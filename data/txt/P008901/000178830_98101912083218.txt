CEYHAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Agriculture, which dominates the Turkish economy, contributes
nearly one-third of the GNP; provides much of the raw material for industry;
and employs 60% of the labor force. Of the total exports in 1971, agriculture
accounted for 73%.  Irrigation is important to Turkey's agriculture because
normal rainfall is insufficient for optimum crop yields. Of the two million
ha, or 12.5% of the planted area currently irrigated, about one-third is
public sector schemes, which are better designed and more efficient than
those in the private sector. In its development plans, Government has been
increasingly emphasizing the improvement and extension of irrigation systems,
in the first plan period (1963-1967) 60% (TL 3.5 billion) of the total public
sector investment in agriculture was for irrigation and in the second plan
(1968-1972) 65% (TL 7.2 billion) was similarly allocated. This policy has
been endorsed by recent Bank economic missions. In furthering this policy,
Government has requested IDA and Bank assistance in financing a multipurpose
irrigation and hydropower project in the Eastern Mediterranean region in the
south of Turkey.
ii.       IDA/Bank lending in the agricultural sector totals US$130.3 million
equivalent (excluding IFC investments) and includes six credits and three
loans. Two loans and two credits, totaling US$66.8 million, were made in
1952 (1 loan), 1963 (1 credit) and 1969 (1 credit and 1 loan) for the Seyhan
Irrigation Project including the multipurpose dam; this project is one of
Turkey's more successful irrigation developments. Progress is satisfactory
on a 1971 credit of US$4.5 million for an Intensive Dairy Production Project
and on a 1971 Credit/Loan totaling US$25 million for a Fruit and Vegetable
Export Project. FY1972 credits of US$18 million for an Irrigation Rehabilita-
tion and Completion Project and US$16 million for the Second Livestock Devel-
opment Project became effective in April, 1972 and January, 1973 respectively.
In the power sector, two credits and four loans have been made totaling
US$93.7 million equivalent. Two power credits (1963 and 1964) and two
loans (1969 and 1971) have been made to Cukurova Elektrik A. S., totaling
US$44.7 million, for power facilities in the .project area. Two other
loans (1968 and 1971) for US$49 million assisted the Turkish Electricity
Authority to finance other power projects. All have been either satisfac-
torily completed or are progressing satisfactorily.
iii.      The proposed Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project would provide
irrigation and drainage systems for 97,000 net ha, flood protection for
about one-third of the irrigated area and generate annually 500 GWh of
electric energy. It would include:
(a)  an earthifill dam with hydroelectric plant;
(b)  flood protection dykes;



- ii -
(c)  irrigation and drainage networks to serve 97,000 ha of which
8,200 ha would be served by pumping;
(d) feeder roads;
(e) on-farm development on 97,000 ha; and
(f) service buildings and houses.
The following would also be financed: land acquisition for the reservoir and
sites for the physical works; hydromechanical and electrical equipment; oper-
ation and maintenance, on-farm development and extension service equipment,
supplies and vehicles; and the purchase of dairy cattle for mixed farming
demonstrations and on-the-job and overseas training of project personnel.
Construction would be phased over eight years. Under the projecL, the State
Hydraulic Works (DSI) would employ a consulting firm to assist in the con-
struction of the dam and power plant and the Soil Conservation Agency (Topraksu)
and the Extension Service would also employ consultants to assist with on-farm
development and extension service to farmers.
iv.       Land within the project area is freehold.  About 16,000 families
are engaged in agriculture of which about 80% are farmers and the remainder
farm laborers and herdsmen. The family averages 7.2 persons and the average
size farm is 10 ha (sizes vary from less than 1 ha to more than 50 ha).  About
17% of the families own about 62% of the land while more than half the fam-
ilies own 12% of the land.  This imbalance in land ownership is likely to be
improved when the proposed Agrarian Reform Law is passed.
V.        Estimated total project cost is US$326.6 million, with an estimated
foreign exchange component of US$104.2 million, or 32% of the total. The
requested IDA credit of US$30 million and Bapi loan of US$44 million would
finance about 23% of the project cost or 71% of the foreign exchange com-
ponent. The remaining foreign exchange of US$30.2 million and local costs
of US$222.4 million would be provided by Government through annual budget
appropriations.
vi.       Civil Works contracts would be tendered totaling about US$143.3
million (excluding contingencies). The full foreign exchange component
(excluding contingencies) of the dam and power plant and on-farm development
would be financed by the Credit/Loan and 80% of the irrigation, flood protec-
tion and drainage works as the funds available are insufficient to finance
the entire foreign exchange requirements of both civil works and all equip-
ment to be procured outside Turkey. Of this total, about US$106.4 million
would be put to international competitive bidding, about US$19 million to
local bidding and about US$17.9 million would be carried out by force account
or by local contractors. Equipment totaling about US$35.4 million would be
purchased of which US$21.8 million, involving equipment to be procured out-
side Turkey, would be financed by the Credit/Loan and the remainder, US$13.6
million, to be purchased within Turkey, would be financed directly by the
Borrower. The purchase of dairy cattle overseas (US$0.3 million) would be
financed by the Credit/Loan.  The remaining costs, excluding contingencies,



- iii -
US$46.2 million would be for consultants, training, engineering and adminis-
tration and land acquisition.  The foreign exchange costs of consultants and
training would be financed by the Credit/Loan and land acquisition costs would
be financed exclusively by Turkey from its own resources.
vii.      Four agenzies of the Turkish Government would be responsible for im-
plementing the project; DSI for construetion of the Aslantas dam and power
plant, irrigation, drainage and flood protection systems; Topraksu for on-farm
development; the Extension Services for assistance to farmers and the Agri-
cultural Bank of Turkey for Credit. On completion of construction, DSI would
be responsible for operation and maintenance of the project, save for the
power plant for which the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) would be respon-
sible. Because of the geological complexity of the dam site, DSI would employ
a consulting firm to assist with construction of the dam and power plant and
Government would also appoint a Group of Specialists to advise as needed on
special problems which might arise during the design and construction of the
dam. Topraksu and the Extension Services-would employ consultants for both
on-farm development and advisory work amongst farmers.
viii.     At full development, the present range of crops, with the addition
of fodder crops, would continue to be grown. Cotton would continue to occupy
the largest area and seed cotton production would be increased by about
141,000 tons (from 53,000 to 194,000 tons). The incremental production of
other crops would be substantial and fodder production with dairy demonstra-.
tions should have a marked beneficial effect in time on livestock production.
With these production increases, coupled with the annual production of 500
GWh of electric energy, the economic return is 13.4%.  The rate of return
for a single-purpose irrigation project would be 13%.  On the other hand, a
single-purpose hydroelectric project would not be justified. A multipurpose
project is preferable because the economic rate of return on the incremental
costs of the power component is at least 15.7% thereby increasing the overall
rate of return to 13.4%. The project is also estimated to increase gross
foreign exchange annual earnings by about TL 291 million (US$20 million). It
would create about 14,000 additional man-years annually of direct employment
and provide annually about 1,000 man-years of employment during 8 years con-
struction. About 1,000 families would be displaced by the Aslantas reservoir,
which is situated outside the project area and they would receive satisfactory
compensation in accordance with existing law which would enable them to pur-
chase land elsewhere and establish themselves thereon. The possibility of a
resettlement scheme for the displaced families was considered. Government
pointed out that the compensation paid was sufficient to enable families to
establish themselves elsewhere, the law did not provide for resettlement and,
in previous acquisitions for a similar purpose elsewhere in Turkey, no re-
settlement schemes were provided and an exception could not therefore be made
in this case.
ix.       As adequate assurances were obtained during negotiations, the proj-
ect would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$30 million and a Bank loan of
US$44 million repayable over 30 years with 9 years grace.  The Borrower would
be the Turkish Government.

CEYHAN ASLANTAS MfULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested an IDA credit of US$30 mil-
lion and a Bank loan of US$44 million to help finance the Ceyhan Aslantas
Multipurpose Project. The project is located in the Ceyhan River basin in
southern Turkey, about 350 km southeast of Ankara near the provincial capital
town of Adana. On completion, the project would irrigate 97,000 ha and
generate annually 500 GWh of electric energy.
1.02      For irrigation, the Bank's 1970 economic mission recommended that
Turkey should give priority to the completion and rehabilitation of existing
irrigation schemes. It also recognized that the country would need to pro-
ceed with new major irrigation wrorks associated with electric power generation.
The 1972 economic mission also considers that additional investment for large-
scale irrigation projects would be required over the long-term in view of
growing domestic demand and foreign markets. Besides raising agricultural
incomes, the expansion of the irrigated area would result in new employment
opportunities in the rural areas. The Third-Five-Year Plan, commencing in
1973, continues to emphasize agricultural development and provides for the
considerable local currency needed to finance this project and on-going ir-
rigation projects.  This project is in accord with Government's announced
strategy for the agricultural sector.
1.03      The Bank and IDA have made the following loans and credits for
agricultural development in Turkey:
(a) The Seyhan Irrigation Project. The first Bank loan, 63-TU
(1952 of US$22.8 million), assisted in financing construction
of the Seyhan Multipurpose Dam. Credit 38-TU (1963 of US$20
million) helped to finance Stage I of the Seyhan Irrigation
Project (57,000 ha) and has been completed. Stage II of
the project (Credit 143-TU for US$12.0 million and Loan 587-TU
for US$12.0 million, 1969) should be completed in 1975.
Although many problems arose during the mid-1960's, they
were resolved and the project is now regarded in Turkey as one
of the country's more successful irrigation developments.
(b)  The Intensive Dairy Production Project.  Credit 236-TU,
(1971 of US$4.5 million) became effective, December 23, 1971.
Progress is satisfactory.
(c) The Fruit and Vegetable Export Project. Credit 257-TU, of
US$15.0 million and Loan 762-TU, of US$10.0 million (1971)
became effective on May 19, 1972. Progress is presently
satisfactory after delays in appointment of consultants and
i                     local staff.



- 2 -
(d)  The Irrigation Rehabilitation and Completion Project.
Credit 281-TU (1972 of US$18.0 million) became effective
in April 1972. Although delays occurred in appointment
of consultants, preparation of work schedules and ordering
of equipment, these should not result in any marked delays
in construction.
(e)  The Second Livestock Development Project.  This credit
for US$16 million became effective in J;rnuarv, 1973
1.04      Credits and loans for power development include Credit 34-TU (1963)
for the third generating unit at the Seyhan dam, Credit 59-TU (1964) and
Loans 623 (1969) and 775-TU (1971). These, totaling US$44.7 million for
power facilities in the Adana Region, were made to Cukurova Elektrik
A. S. In addition, Loans 568-TU (1968) and 763-TU (1971) for US$49 million
helped the Turkish Electricity Authority (formerly the Power Group of Etibank)
finance other power projects in Turkey. All projects have been either satis-
factorily completed or are progressing satisfactorily.
1e05      The Ceyhan project was studied for 10 years by Government agencies
with the assistance of consultants; namely, Italconsult of Italy (Geology),
TECO of U. S. (Financial and Technical Feasibility), Dapta and Gizbili of
Turkey (Irrigation and Drainage Design), and Acres-Syndibel-Su Yapi of
Canada-Belgium-Turkey. The final project feasibility report was prepared
by the State Hydraulic Works (DSI) of the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources, the Soil Conservation Agency (Topraksu) of the Ministry of Village
Affairs and the Extension Services of the Ministry of Agriculture.
1.06      The project was appraised in April/May, 1972 by a Bank mission
consisting of Messrs. M. D. ffrench-Mullen, M. Altaf Hussain, B. Kanchanalak,
S. Okabe, R. A. Stevenin and G. Post (Consultant) for the irrigation component
and Messrs. J. J. Fish and R. W. Bates for the power component. In addition
to the findings of the appraisal mission, this report is based on documents
submitted by Government agencies, the feasibility studies and final design
reports for the dam and power plant, gravity irrigation, drainage and flood
protection works.
II. BACKGROUND
Agriculture
2.01      Turkey has a land area of about 780,000 km2 and a population of
37.2 million (1972) increasing at 2.6% per annum.  There are about 71 million
ha of productive land of which 27 million ha, or two-fifths, is cultivated
and the balance is in pasture or forest. GNP at constant (1965) prices rose
on average by about 7% a year between 1962 and 1971. Agricultural production
has grown at 3.1% per annum during the last decade, significantly less than
the planned 4.2%. The agricultural sector growth has gradually improved
during the last four years when the target rate of 4.2% was attained.  The



low value of output per agricultural worker and sizeable unemployment during
the winter months are key problems in this sector.
2.02      Agriculture contributes 28% of the GDP, provides much of the raw
material for industry and employs 60% of the labor force excluding those
employed in agricultural marketing and processing industries. Of the total
exports of US$677 million in 1971, agriculture accounted for US$491 million
or 73%,, excluding US$50 million for olive oil, sugar, and oil cakes. Agri-
culture's contribution to exports has remained about 75% of total exports
over the past five years. The main agricultural exports are cotton, hazel
nuts, tobacco, animal products, and raisins; fruits, vegetables and fisheries
are also important. Imports in the same year were only US$63 million; 75%
of which were cereals.
2.03      Irrigation is important to Turkey's agriculture because normal
rainfall is insufficient for optimum crop yields. Only about two million ha,
or 12.5% of the planted area, are currently irrigated; about one-third of
which are public sector schemes, which are better designed and more efficient
than those in the private sector. Government investments in irrigation dur-
ing the First Plan period (1963-1967) were TL 3.5 billion or 60% of the
total public sector investment in agriculture. During the Second Plan
(1968-1972), investments in irrigation were increased both in absolute
amount and as a percentage of the total Plan investment, being TL 7.2 bil-
lion and 65% respectively.
0          2.04      Fragmentation of responsibility and loose coordination and even
friction among various agencies dealing with the agricultural sector are
important constraints on agricultural growth. Irrigation projects have also
been constrained by lack of financial resources, both to complete on-farm
development of the irrigated areas and to provide adequate credit together
with lack of a coordinated approach by the three Government agencies involved
in irrigation development. To accelerate growth in Turkish irrigated agri-
culture, the provision of physical facilities needs to be synchronized with
on-farm development, the provision of adequate extension services, credit,
input supplies, market outlets, and applied agricultural research.
Energy and Power
2.05      Turkey has indigenous resources of coal, lignite, oil and hydro-
electricity which supply about 70% of total primary energy requirements.
The balance is met from imported petroleum (mainly crude oil). In 1971, an
estimated 15% of primary energy was consumed in the form of electricity,
supplied from plants having a capacity of 2,260 Mi. One-third of this
capacity was hydro-based and the remainder used lignite, coal and oil.
2.06      Increasing population and economic development (described in
para 2.01) have given rise to a growing need for energy supplies.  Primary
commercial energy consumption grew at an estimated rate of 7% per annum
over the last five years. The consumption of electric power has grown
even faster, showing an annual increase of 12% since 1960. About 75% of
electricity sales are to industry, 18% to domestic and commercial consumers,
4% to Government offices and 3% to street lighting and traction.

III.  THE PROJECT AREA                                      0
Location
3.01      The project area of 97,000 net ha (108,000 gross irrigable ha) is
part of the East Mediterranean region in the south of Turkey.  It is located
in the Ceyhan plain on both banks of the Ceyhan River immediately downstream
of the Cevdetiye diversion weir which is about 25 km downstream of the pro-
posed Aslantas dam site. The main town of the project, Ceyhan (population
51,000) is about 350 km from Ankara and 40 km from the provincial capital of
Adana. To its immediate west is the Seyhan Irrigation Project financed by
the Bank. The two Mediterranean ports of Iskenderun and Mersin are 70 km
and 108 km, respectively from Ceyhan (see Map 10061).
Climate
3.02      The climate is Mediterranean:  hot and dry during the summers and
mild and wet during the brief winters. Based on 1929 through 1964 records,
annual rainfall is about 700 mm, the majority of which falls during the
winter months. Rainfall is scanty during the main plant growth months, June
through September. This rainfall and evaporation pattern is a limiting factor
in the choice of crops and in yields in spite of a climate suited to a wide
range of crops provided irrigation is available. Temperatures are moderate;
ranging between 10°C and 4500 with a yearly average of 18°C. Frost is rare
and snowfall is negligible.
Soils, Topography and Drainage
3.03      An acceptable land classification of the project area on a scale of
1:5,000 was completed in 1970. Over 90% of the area is covered by uniform
deep and permeable brown silty clay and clay loams, Class I, II or III, suit-
able for a wide range of crops under irrigation. About 8,000 ha of heavier
soils, including about 2,000 ha requiring rec'lamation with amendments and
leaching and located mainly on the right bank of the river, would be suitable
for a-restricted range of crops.
3.04      Topographically, the gently undulating plain is suitable for gravity
irrigation; about 20% would require land planing, 60% light leveling and the
remaining 20% medium to heavy leveling. After leveling, about 88,800 ha
would be gravity irrigated and 8,200 ha by pumps feeding gravity systems.
3.05      Surface drainage would be adequate in all areas except 6,000 ha or
6% of net cultivable area, which would require 1.8 m deep subsurface tertiary
tile drains to be connected to surface collector drains. Provision for this
has been made in the project works.
Population
3.06      According to the 1970 census, the population of the project area
is about 172,000 living in 95 villages and two towns, Ceyhan (51,000) and
Osmaniye (46,000) and growing at 2.8% per year.  About 67% of the population,        0



-5-
comprising 16,000 families, averaging 7.2 persons each, is engaged in agricul-
ture; about 80% are farmers and 20% farm laborers and herdsmen. About one-
s            half of each family is of working age.  Except during seasonal peaks, the
family labor is underutilized but, during such peaks, seasonal work is
provided for hired labor which is locally available.
Land Tenure and Farm Size
3.07      Land is free hold and inheritance through subdivision is legal.
Three out of four farm families own land, others are either farm laborers
or, to a lesser extent, tenants. The distribution of farm by size is fairly
representative of land ownership in coastal areas of Turkey with more than
83% of the families owning less than 15 ha each and 4% only more than 50 ha;
the larger holdings however, represent 29% of the land.
3.08      The present pattern of land ownership is likely to be improved
when the proposed Agrarian Reform Law is passed. The Preliminary Measures
Bill on Land and Agrarian Reform became law in July 1972 and requires land
owners to declare their holdings. Ownership details are tabulated below:
Farm Size (ha)           Below 5        5-15        15-50        Above 50
Number of holdings        5,200         3,100       1,300            400
% of total                    52           31          13              4
Area (ha)                13,000        27,500      35,900         31,600
% of total                    12            26         33             29
The smaller units operate their land on a partnership or pooling basis or
rent from or to other farmers.  Differing arrangements are used to create
viable operational holdings by about half the families.  The other half
directly cultivate their own land.
Communications
3.09      The project region has excellent air, sea and ground transport
connections with the rest of the country and the world. Adana, about 40 km
from Ceyhan, has daily air services to Ankara and Istanbul. A railroad
runs through the project. There are two harbors on the Mediterranean,
Iskenderun and Mersin, and both are connected by rail and by paved highways.
Postal and telegraph services are satisfactory, and the telephone network
connects all main centers in the area. However, feeder roads are inadequate.
Power
3.10      The Cukurova Elektrik A. S. (CEAS) is responsible for the bulk
supply of power in the project area. The company sells electricity to muni-
cipalities, villages and industries. Following interconnection with the
TEK system in 1970, CEAS has also sold energy to TEK. In recent years
CEAS has expanded its system and power is available at reasonable prices
throughout the project area.



-6-
Present Land Use and Yields
3.11      About 105,000 ha are currently cultivated of whlich about 30,000,
or less than 30%, are partially irrigated from public or private tubewells,
or by pumping from the river. Cotton is the main crop irrigated. Up to a
third of the project area is liable to occasional floods which damage crops.
A diversion-weir on the Ceyhan River at Cevdetiye, where the river joins
the plain, has been built at a cost of Tl 26.3 million (US$1.87 million).
This sunk cost is negligible in relation to the total cost of the project
even if the cost of the access road (US$0.7 million), presently under con-
struction, to the Aslantas dam site is added and the cost of the existing
inadequate flood protection dykes (US$0.3 million) on either bank of the
Ceyhan River. Its full use, however, depends on construction of the stor-
age dam, flood protection works and distribution systems proposed under the
project. Present land use is extensive, crop choice is limited, inputs are
inadequate, and yields are generally low. The main crops are wheat (61%),
cotton (26%), fruits and vegetables (5%), rice (4%) and oil seeds (4%).
Annex 1 gives details of present cropping pattern, area, yield and production.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The project would provide irrigation and drainage systems for
97,000 ha, flood protection to 35,000 and generate annually 500 GWh of
electric energy. Works to be implemented under the project are summarized
below; details are presented in Annex 2. They would include the construction
of:
(a)  an earthfill dam with hydroelectric plant;
(b) flood protection dykes;
(c) irrigation and drainage networks to serve 97,000 ha of
which 8,200 ha would be pumped;
(d) feeder roads;
(e) on-farm development on 97,000 ha; and
(f) service buildings and houses.
The project would also finance land acquisition for the reservoir area
(3,600 ha) and for the distribution systems and project roads (6,250 ha)
and the purchase of hydromechanical and electrical equipment, operation and
maintenance, on-farm development and extension service equipment, supplies
and vehicles. The project would also purchase dairy cattle for mixed farming
demonstrations and construct the necessary buildings. A consulting firm would
be engaged by DSI, the implementing agency for construction of the dam and



power plant, to carry out additional studies and designs, and supervise
construction. DSI would also employ an independent Group of Specialists for
the dam to review progress of work and advise on specific problems as they
arise. Consultants for on-farm development and extension services would
also be provided. All project works would be completed in eight years with
construction beginning in mid-1973. A detailed construction schedule is
presented in Chart 6946 (3R).
Proposed Works
4.02      Aslantas Dam.  This dam would be an earthfill structure, 75 m high,
with a gated chute type spillway (six gates, 92 m wide) and a conventional
spilling basin, capable of passing 12,000 m3 per sec for the maximum probable
flood (see Table 1, Annex 2). Two tunnels would be constructed for diversion
purposes; the larger tunnel would subsequently serve as a power penstock and
the smaller as a bottom outlet. The storage capacity of the reservoir would
be 1,190 Mm3 plus flood control storage of 650 Mm3.
4.03      Power Plant.  The powerhouse would be a conventional above-ground
structure just downstream of the dam and fitted with three 46-MW turbines
and generators. A switchyard would be located adjacent to the powerhouse
which would be connected to the Osmaniye substation of the main grid which
TEK is to complete in 1976. An assurance was obtained that TEK would cons-
truct and finance the transmission line connecting the switchyard to the
3          main grid.
4.04      Cevdetiye Weir.  DSI completed the weir in 1971.  If the Aslantas
power plant is to generate peak power during the irrigation season, radial
gates would have to be installed - a provision already made in the project.
4.05      Flood Protection Dykes.  Existing dykes on both banks of the Ceyhan
River would be raised and reinforced, and extended downstream for a total
length of about 60 -km to accommodate a discharge of 1,600 m3 per sec during
a 100-year flood.
4.06      Irrigation System.  The left and right bank, concrete lined,
conveyance canals, totaling 160 km, with capacities of 105 m3 and 41 m3
per sec respectively, would receive their supply directly from the existing
Cevdetiye diversion weir. Delivery to 88,800 ha would be by gravity through
148 km of main and 83 km of secondary, concrete lined canals, and 1,845 km
of prefabricated concrete canalettes or pipes and to 8,200 ha outside the
gravity command area by nine pumping stations through 55 km of secondary and
160 km of canalettes or pipes. Field delivery would be by plastic siphons
discharging 10 to 30 1 per sec.
4.07      Drainage Network.  Several main natural drainage channels dis-
charging into the Ceyhan River, totaling about 256 km, exist and are in
generally satisfactory condition. About 1,900 km of drains would be cons-
tructed discharging into the existing drainage channels together with
ancillary structures.



4.08      On-Farm Development.  Land planing or leveling would be carried
out on 97,000 ha, involving about 62 Nm3 of earth movement. About 485 km
of 5 m wide all-weather feeder roads would be constructed.  About 6,000 ha
would require subsurface drainage and 1,455 km of on-farm surface drains
would be constructed. About 2,000 ha would be reclaimed with gypsum,
for further details see Annex 3.
4.09      Service Buildings and Houses.  Three operation and maintenance
centers would be built for DSI at Ceyhan, Kadirli and Kosreli with offices,
stores and 117 staff houses. One supervision center would be built at
Ceyhan for Topraksu and three centers for the Extension Services at Ceyhan,
Kadirli and Osmaniye. They would include offices, stores and staff houses
and Technical Assistance quarters and offices in villages. In addition,
livestock sheds would be constructed for the extension services for
demonstration.
Water Suply Demand, Quality and Rights
4.10      Water Supply.  The reservoir operation studies, based on 14-year
(1955-1968) data, show that the proposed storage in the Aslantas dam, together
with natural flows, would be sufficient to irrigate 97,000 ha at 60% effi-
ciency, to produce 500 GWh of energy annually and, even in dry years, to
meet current and planned downstream commitments. There would be a surplus
of 200 Mm3 during the summer growing season (June to September), but any use
in excess of this amount would endanger project supplies (Annex 4).  An
assurance was obtained that Government would not allow river flows to be
depleted below the minimum required for the project.
4.11      Water Demand.  At full development with the proposed cropping pattern,
the average annual irrigation water requirements for 97,000 net ha would be
about 1,000 Mm3; the average annual diversion demand for all purposes would be
1,100 Mm3 at Cevdetiye weir. The project would also provide sufficient water
for all downstream uses outside the project area, including that for salt water
intrusion control at the mouth of the Ceyhan River, During project construction,
26,500 ha would be irrigated with run-of-the-river flows from the Cevdetiye
weir without detriment to existing downstream uses.
4.12      Water Quality.  The Ceyhan River is suitable for irrigation with
a salt content of about 330 parts per million which would rise with return
flows to about 450.
4.13      Water Rights.  Within Turkey, water rights are governed by the
basic Water Law 6200 of 1953, which prohibits water development schemes
without prior Governmental approval. Since allowance has been made for
existing as well as proposed schemes downstream of the Aslantas dam, no
problem of water rights is foreseen.



-9-
Floods and Flood Control
4.14      The Ceyhan River and its tributaries drain about 15,000 km2 above
the Aslantas damsite and discharge annually about 5,000 MIm3 into the Mediter-
ranean. As a result of winter rains and spring snow-melt, the Ceyhan plain
frequently suffers from flooding. During the last two decades, 14 floods of
varying intensity have occurred in the project area. Five were major floods.
The largest flood, which occurred in 1966, had a peak flow of 2,500 m3 per
sec (a 100-year flood peak flow is estimated at 3,000 m3 per sec), submerged
34,000 ha of the project area, and damaged crops worth US$2.3 million (TL
20.5 million) at 1966 prices. When river flows exceed 900 m3 per sec, flooding
occurs. A 3-year flood would submerge 5,000 ha. Eighteen km of low dykes
have been constructed along the river banks in the project area but they
only protect about 2,000 ha from a 25-year flood. Annual losses from floods
in the project area are estimated at US$0.2 (TL 2.6 million). Further de-
tails are in Annex 5. Flood control would be achieved through the 650 Mm3
flood storage capacity of the Aslantas reservoir. During 100-year floods,
downstream flows in the Ceyhan River would be about 1,600 m3 per sec which
is almost twice the present river channel capacity of about 900 m3 per sec.
The existing dykes, within the project area, would be raised, reinforced and
extended downstream to give a river channel capacity of 1,600 m3 per sec.
An assurance was obtained that the Ceyhan River channel capacity would be
increased to not less than 1,600 m3 per sec capacity.
Status of Engineering
4.15      Aslantas Dam and Power Plant.  Final designs have been prepared by
consultants (see para 1.05) and DSI based on adequate drilling, adits, test
embankments and geological, hydrological and engineering investigations over
10 years. However, some additional work, taking about four months, would be
required before bid specifications could be completed in connection with the
following:
(a) raising of the cofferdam elevation;
(b) the conversion of the smaller diversion tunnel to a
bottom outlet for the dam;
(c) the lengthening of diversion tunnels;
(d) modification of right bank drainage galleries; and
(e) revision of certain technical specifications, particularly
those concerning fill material and grouting (Annex 6).
4.16      The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) did not participate in
preparing designs and specifications for the hydroelectric component of the
project. However, since the power plant will be operated as part of TEK's
interconnected system, it is essential for TEK to review and comment on
5          design features and specifications for the power components affecting



- 10 -
0
operating and maintenance.  Assurances were obtained that DSI would discuss
with TEK the design features and specifications for the hydromechanical and
electrical equipment needed for the power plant.
4.17      Irrigation, Drainage and Flood Control.  Final designs and estimates
have been prepared by two Turkish consultant firms for the irrigation and
drainage systems, except for the 8,200 ha pumped areas, and for the Ceyhan
River dykes for a capacity of 1,200 m3 per sec flood flows. The irrigation
system consists of concrete lined conveyance and main canals and prefabricated
concrete canalettes. Concrete pipes, prefabricated in the factory financed
under Stage II of the Seyhan project may be substituted for canalettes in areas
more suited to a pipe distribution system. The design of the dykes would
need to be modified to cater for 100-year flood flows of 1,600 m3 per sec
(para 4.14).
4.18      The capacity of the left bank main conveyance canal is designed
to provide sufficient flows to irrigate an additional 32,000 ha in the
Dortyol and Yamurtalik plains on the lIediterranean coast. Although the
additional cost is nominal (US$0.4 million), these plains were excluded from
the project because acceptable feasibility studies were not available, the
topography of an appreciable part of the Yamurtalik plain appeared unsuitable
for gravity irrigation and DSI has recently drilled 150 wells to serve a
substantial portion of the Dortyol plain. An assurance was obtained that a
revision of the existing feasibility study would be carried out on these
plains.  No benefits were included in the economic analysis.
4e19      On-Farm Development.  The estimates for land planing and leveling
on 97,000 ha, which are acceptable, are based on sample surveys and on
Topraksu's experience in the Seyhan project. Subsurface drainage is required
on about 6,000 ha but the spacing and depth of the tiles would be finalized
following further field investigations. Further investigations are also
needed to decide on quantities of soil amendments for 2,000 ha. The feeder
road network is so designed that any point in the project area is within one
km of an all-weather road; the road design is similar to that used in the
Seyhan project and is in accordance with Government standards for this class
of road.
Cost Estimates
4.20      Overall project costs, excluding import duties and taxes are es-
timated at US$326.6 million (TL 4,572.4 million) including US$101.4 million
of contingencies. Estimates for civil and on-farm works are based on quan-
tities and unit rates presented in the feasibility reports and final designs
prepared by consultants, DSI, Topraksu and the Extension Service, as modified
at appraisal and adjusted to 1972 prices. Equipment to be imported has been
valued at 1972 CIF prices and equipment reserved for local procurement at
current local prices. Land acquisition costs are in accordance with local
laws and compensation for property in the reservoir area has also been
provided (Annex 7).

4.21      The estimated foreign exchange component of the project, including
contingencies, is US$104.2 million (TL 1,458.8 million) or 32% of total
project costs. The foreign exchange component assumes that the dam and
power plant civil works would be awarded to a consortium of foreign and local
contractors. The irrigation, drainage and flood control works and about
3,000 ha out of an annual target of 15,000 ha to be land leveled would be
constructed by local contractors. The remainder of the land to be leveled,
12,000 ha per annum, would be carried out on force account by Topraksu. The
cost of the transmission lines and distribution circuits has been included
in the economic evaluation but is not financed under the project as they
form part of TEK's development program for the area. Project costs include
a physical contingency averaging 9% of total cost (US$20.7 million) and
price contingencies of 6% per annum (US$80.7 million). Details are given
in Annex 8 and are summarized below:

Financing
4.22      The proposed IDA credit (US$30 million) and Bank loan (US$44 million)
totaling US$74 million would finance about 23% of the project cost or 71% of
the foreign exchange component of US$104.2 million. The balance of the for-
eign exchange of US$30.2 million and local costs of US$222.4 million would
be met by Government through annual budget appropriations as well as interest
during construction and commitment charges amounting to US$10.3 million. The
IDA credit would be repaid over 50 years with 10 years grace and the Bank
loan over 30 years with 9 years grace.
4,23      The Credit/Loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange cost
of all civil works and equipment to be procured outside Turkey including
physical contingencies but excluding price escalation save for the first
three, out of a total of eighteen, irrigation, drainage and flood control
civil works contracts. The three contracts are estimated to cost the equiv-
alent of about US$13 million, and would be entirely financed by the Borrower.
This arrangement would permit land development work to commence in 1973 and
also enables the Credit/Loan (US$74 million) to finance fully the remaining
foreign exchange component of the project including physical contingencies
but excluding price escalation which the Borrower wishes to finance. The
foreign exchange cost of consultants would also be financed and the purchase
of dairy cattle.
Procurement
4.24      The total cost, excluding contingencies, of project civil works
that could be tendered is US$143.3 million. Of this total, one civil works
contract for the construction of the Aslantas dam and power plant (US$52.3
million), and fifteen of the eighteen civil 'works contracts for construction
of irrigation, flood protection dykes, and drainage facilities (US$54.1
million) would be tendered on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the guidelines for procurement under Bank loans and IDA
credits. In order to utilize run-of-river flows as quickly as possible,
three contracts (US$13 million) to be fully financed by the Borrower (para
4.23) would be subject to local bidding procedures which would enable work
to commence in mid-1973. To enable the fifteen contracts for irrigation,
dykes and drainage systems to attract wider competition, it would be neces-
sary to so group contracts that the value of any one group would be not less
than US$7 million, bidders being invited to bid for the group or any part of
the group. An assurance to this effect was obtained. Because of the geo-
logical complexity and magnitude of the dam and power plant civil works,
bidders would be prequalified by a DSI Board whose recommendations, together
with the comments of the consultants, would be sent to the Association and
the Bank for their comments before the applicants are notified and DSI would
make such additions to or deletions from the list of applicants as the Bank
and the Association would reasonably request. An assurance to this effect
was obtained. Buildings and other facilities, totaling about US$2.9 million,
would be constructed over about seven years. The diverse nature of these
works, which are individually small, and the phasing of construction would
not permit packaging of contracts. Therefore, international competitive



-13 -
bidding would be impracticable. Procedures for local bidding are satisfactory
and there is sufficient competition for works of this kind and size. On-farm
development work (US$21 million) would be carried out by Topraksu on force
account or by contract, see para 6.04. Dairy cattle for the Extension
Service (US$0.3 million) would be purchased-overseas by direct negotiations
(Annex 6).
4.25      As Turkey is capable of supplying most of the large fabricated
steel items required for the dam and power plant (cranes, gates, stoplogs,
tunnel liners etc.), low-voltage switchgear and some items of operation and
maintenance and on-farm development equipment and vehicles totaling about
US$13.6 million, Government intends to reserve such items for local procure-
ment. Cost and quality comparisons between current local and foreign
contracts for similar equipment indicate that this arrangement should not
result in increased costs and there should be no problem of availability.
Other equipment (US$21.8 million) which would have to be procured outside
Turkey and which would be financed under the Credit/Loan would be subject
to international competitive bidding in accordance with the guidelines for
procurement under Bank loans and IDA credits. However, any contracts for
civil works not exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000 and any contract for
the procurement of imported equipment, materials and supplies not exceeding
the equivalent of US$25,000 would be exempted from international competitive
bidding provided that the aggregate of all such contracts shall not exceed
US$500,000 equivalent.  As all goods and services not being financed from
the Credit/Loan are an integral part of the project, an assurance was ob-
tained that the Bank and IDA would be sent the draft specifications for all
such goods and services contracts (exceeding US$100,000 for civil works and
US$25,000 for equipment) and the Bank's comments would be taken into con-
sideration before issuance of documents to potential bidders. Two conformed
copies each of the executed contract would be furnished to the Bank and IDA
promptly after its execution.
4.26      DSI, with the assistance of consultants for the Aslantas dam and
power plant, would be responsible for the preparation of all contract
documents, evaluation of bids and award of contracts for civil works and
equipment subject to international competitive bidding, save for on-farm
development contracts for which Topraksu would be responsible and for
Extension Service equipment and livestock which would be the responsibility
of that service.
4.27      Import of types of equipment and vehicles manufactured and/or
assembled in Turkey is strictly controlled by use of an import licensing
system. An assurance was therefore obtained that import licenses would be
issued promptly to all successful bidders for all civil works and equipment
contracts put to international competitive bidding. There are no regional
preferences affecting international contractors or suppliers.
Disbursement
4.28      The proposed IDA credit of US$30 million and Bank loan of US$44
million would be disbursed, net of taxes, over eight years as follows:



- 14 -
(a) at 35% of total expenditures of the Aslantas dam and
power plant civil works contracts;
(b) at 31% of total expenditures of irrigation, drainage,
flood protection dykes civil works contracts;
(c) at 15% of total expenditures of on-farm development and
buildings;
(d) at 100% of foreign expenditures of imported livestock and
equipment for DSI, Topraksu and Extension Service or in
the case of imported equipment procured from local dealers'
stock, 70% of total expenditures; and
(e) at 100% of foreign expenditures of consultants and overseas
training of project staff.
As the Borrower intends to meet all price escalation costs and due to the
impossibility of determining the actual amount attributable to price escala-
tion in each withdrawal application for civil works contracts, the percentage
of total expenditures to be financed by the Bank and IDA was reduced from
the foreign exchange percentage (para 4.21) of 40 to 35% in the case of the
Aslantas dam and power plant and 35 to 31% for irrigation, drainage and flood
control.  These reduced percentages are estimated to disburse the full foreign
exchange cost with physical contingencies of these components of the project
and permit disbursement to be spread over the life of the project. For force
account work on buildings and on-farm development, disbursements would be
made against statements of work performed by the relevant agency, the full
documentation being retained by the executing agency and available for in-
spection by the Bank/IDA. All other disbursci£ents would be made against the
Bank's normal documentation requirements. Any savings after completion of
the project would be cancelled. Commitment charges and interest on the Bank
loan would be met by the Borrower. A schedule of annual expenditures on the
project and an annual and quarterly disbursement schedule for the credit and
loan are presented in Annexes 9 and 10.
Accounts and Audit
4.29      Separate accounts would be kept for the project by DSI, Topraksu
and the Extension Services. Presently, accounts of these agencies are
audited annually by an inspector of the Ministry of Finance, a procedure
accepted in previous projects and found to be satisfactory. Assurances
were obtained that separate accounts would be kept for the project by all
agencies involved and the audited project accounts would be submitted to
IDA and the Bank within four months after the closing date of the Turkish
fiscal year, which ends on the last day of February.
4.30      The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) has received advice and
assistance on establishing a new accounting system through a Bank financed
Technical Assistance Project.  An integral part of the new system is an
assets classification method which is designed to simplify future assets



-15 -
revaluation as necessary to comply with the provisions of previous Bank loans
to TEK.  Since TEK will take over the power assets after completion of the
project, assurances were obtained that the separate accounts being kept by
DSI for the project would be in a form acceptable to the Association, the
Bank and TEK.
Environment and Health
4.31      The project is not expected to adversely affect environmental
conditions. On the contrary, improved drainage coupled with the Government's
mobile health services and an efficient malaria control unit, both already
at work in the area, should further reduce the incidence of malaria, the
only major disease affecting the population. Considerable progress has
been made in the control and eradication of malaria in the Adana Province;
only 540 cases were reported throughout the Province in 1971 of which, within
the project area, there were 118 cases in Ceyhan and its environs, 29 in
Osmaniye and 2 in Kadirli. Whenever a case occurs in a village, all houses
are sprayed at 2 monthly intervals with malathion until no further cases are
recorded. There is no schistosomaisis in the Province. Poliomylitis and
smallpox vaccination campaigns are routinely carried out by the mobile
health units.
4.32      As occured in the Seyhan reservoir, there may be an upsurge in
0          the incidence of malaria in the vicinity of the Aslantas reservoir once the
reservoir becomes operative. However, the health services do not anticipate
any difficulty in controlling such an upsurge as was done in Seyhan. The
Aslantas reservoir would also greatly expand the recreational amenities
available to the public in the area and may also lead to the development of
a fresh water fishery.
4.33      The most important archaeological item in the vicinity of the
Aslantas dam is that of the Hittite stones at Karatepe. There is also a
small Crusaders castle at Kumkale in the reservoir area and thermal springs
at the extreme upper limit of the lake. The maximum operating level of
the reservoir is at elevation 146 m and the maximum flood (100-year) eleva-
tion 154.5 m. At the latter level, the Hittite stones would be unaffected
as would the thermal springs at elevation 156 m. The Crusaders castle
would be submerged. However, the castle is rapidly disintegrating and is
only one of many in the region. Access to the Hittite stones from the
centers of population will be shortened and improved as a result of the
construction of the access road to the Aslantas dam. All interested author-
ities in Turkey are satisfied that the construction of the dam will not
adversely affect archaeological interests.

V. POWER
The Power System
5.01      The total capacity of public power systems in Turkey at the end of
1971 was 2,260 MW. One-third of this is hydro; the remainder uses lignite,
coal and fuel oil.  Of the total, 1,900 MW was operated by the Turkish
Electricity Authority (TEK), a State Economic Enterprise. TEK operates a
large system ("the interconnected system") which supplies all except the
eastern part of the country (See 1ap 3219R).  By 1977, substantially all
electrical energy consumed in Turkey will be supplied from the interconnected
system. The project site is located in the service area of Cukurova Elektrik
A.S. (CEAS), largest of the few private companies remaining in the power
sector (although Government, through TEK, owns about one-third of CEAS' stock).
The CEAS system comprises generating plants with a capacity of 280 MW and
transmission lines of 154-kV and 60-kV serving the Seyhan-Ceyhan region.
CEAS' system is connected with that of TEK through a long 154-kV line via
Avanos, but a stronger tie at 380-kV is planned for completion in 1976, see
para 5, Annex 2,
5.02      Consumption of electric power in Turkey is growing annually at about
12%, a rate which is expected to increase temporarily with the commissioning
of the new Seydesihir aluminum smelter in 1973 and then fall to 11.5% per
annum by 1979, the year before the Aslantas project would come into service,          0
and to 11% by the beginning of the Turkish Fifth Five-Year Plan (1983).
TEK's development program to meet the growth of demand is shown in Annex 11.
Most of the new capacity will be hydro such that by the end of the 1980's,
some 50% of the total will be of this type. In view of the growth rates
mentioned above, the capacity of the Aslantas plant (138 MW, 500 GWh) would
meet only a few months' growth in Turkey's electrical power and energy re-
quirements.  In this context, it is not a large project.
Operation of the Project
5.03      The Aslantas power station would be operated as part of TEK's
interconnected system but most of the power generated would be consumed in
the Seyhan-Ceyhan region, supplementing supply from CEAS' Mersin thermal
plant and Seyhan and Kadincik hydro plants. In an average year, the station
would operate at an annual plant factor of about 40%, but this would drop to
as low as 16% during the late summer months.
Consideration of Alternatives
5.04      The consultants selected the proposed capacity (138 MW) and inves-
tigated the economic justification of the project through an optimising study,
comparing costs at Aslantas with those of an alternative thermal plant. How-
ever, even though most of the power generated by Aslantas will be consumed in
the Seyhan-Ceyhan region, the project will be operated as part of TEK's inter-
connatented system and the mission examined the project accordingly, comparing 0
alternative developments of the interconnected system with and without Aslantas.
These studies are described in Annex 11 and summarized below,



- 17 -
5.05      The demand forecasts underlying the TEK development program were
found to be consistent with two independent econometric forecasts made by
the Bank mission. TEK's development program was amended to take into account
the mission's view that Aslantas power would not be available before late
1980 (rather than 1978 as originally assumed by TEK). With the assistance
of EIE (The Electric Studies Institute) in Turkey, computer simulations were
carried out on an annual basis to estimate total system costs of the inter-
connected system in present value terms. The best alternative development
program, if Aslantas is not included, would involve an appropriate rearrange-
ment in the timing of the thermal units in the development program to maintain
an equivalent level of system security. Total system costs were calculated for
this alternative program, again on an annual basis and in present value terms
and it was found that, for discount rates up to 15.7%, the program including
Aslantas, represented the more economic choice. Further studies showed that
this equalizing discount rate is not very sensitive to changes in the load
forecast, plant mix, or the capital and fuel costs of thermal plant.
5.06      In view of the irregular monthly distribution of Aslantas' output
(para 5.03), it was deemed necessary to supplement the annual simulation
study with a monthly operational study of the TEK system to verify that all
the energy generated by Aslantas could be absorbed without wasting water at
other hydro stations and without replacing relatively low-cost thermal energy.
This study was done in Turkey (again with the assistance of EIE) and showed
that all Aslantas energy could properly be absorbed in the system but the
difference in operating costs between the two alternative development programs
was lower than shown on an annual basis. Even so, the equalizing discount
rate is unlikely to fall below 13% and this reduction is likely to be offset
by factors which could not be allowed for quantitatively in the study (Annex
11).
Organization and Finance
5.07      The Aslantas project would be built by DSI and, on completion, the
Government intends that the power assets would be transferred to TEK for
maintenance and operation. All funds for the project would be provided by
Government and the power assets would be transferred to TEK free of charge
or debt assumption. This procedure is in accordance with the TEK law (Law
1312) and is the pattern being followed for existing hydro plants and those
now under construction.
5.08      Since TEK's tariff is based on a required return on net fixed
assets including the value of hydro plant, under thie present arrangement it
is likely that TEK will accumulate large amounts of cash unless it becomes
responsible for debt service on these projects, or alternatively contributes
to the costs of new hydro projects or pays dividends to Government. This
has been a subject of concern to the Bank since the beginning of involvement
in the Keban project in 1965/66. Despite various agreements aimed at
rationalizing this situation, no effective solution has yet been adopted.
During negotiations, this issue was discussed and Government agreed that by
implementing the procedures provided for under the TEK law (No. 1312) relating
to distribution of surplus that the benefits from TEK's earnings from hydro-
electric projects would accrue to Government.



- 18 - 
Cost Allocation
5.09      Law 1312 (the TEK law) provides that the value of assets to be
transferred to TEK be established in accordance with principles set forth
in a Regulation to be prepared jointly by the ZMinistries of Energy, Finance,
Interior, and Reconstruction. The Regulation has not yet been issued, but
it is believed that a form of the "Separable Costs Remaining Benefits" method
will be used for allocating costs in Multipurpose projects. This method
would in principle be acceptable to the Bank.
5.10      A representative cost allocation, based upon a form of the above
method, suggests a power project cost in the order of TL 553 million, equiv-
alent to US$290 per kW. The resulting average cost for energy would be
about UJS40.9 per kWh. This cost allocation is purely financial and has
no bearing on the economic justification which considers the benefit of the
w.hole project to the economy.
Participation of CEAS in the Project
5.11      Since the Aslantas project lies in the CEAS concession area, CEAS
has objected to Government's plan to have the project operated by TEK,
insisting that it (CEAS) has the legal right to own and operate the plant.
Moreover, CEAS has offered to contribute about TL 450 million to the cost
of the project and, if Government agrees, to undertake the construction of
the power portion of the project. The Bank has taken a neutral position
on this issue since either organization would be acceptable. CEAS, the
recipient of four previous Bank Group loans and credits, has demonstrated
its ability to undertake comparable projects and DSI also has experience in
similar work.
5e12      There is one issue which requires clarification if CEAS is to
undertake the project; CEAS' concession is unclear regarding provisions for
amortization of stockholders' interest. This subject was explored in con-
nection with the last loan to CEAS (Loan 775-TU of June 30, 1971), and if
CEAS is to participate in the project, it would be necessary for Government
to review the concession provisions and agree on modifications which would
clarify the position regarding capital amortization, revaluation of assets,
long-term debt and other provisions, particularly those which would apply
in the event of future nationalization of the company, so that the financial
position of CEAS and its shareholders would not be adversely affected by
CEAS' participation in the project.
5.13      During negotiations, the Government stated that it was its inten-
tion to have DSI undertake the power portion of the project, and after com-
pletion, to transfer the power assets to TEK for operation.  Government has
furnished evidence to the Bank indicating that this action is not contrary
to the provisions of CEAS' concession, and that no revision of the concession
is required.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MiANAGEMENT
Project Coordination
6.01      The project is to be implemented jointly by four Government agencies.
Their activities are to be coordinated by a Project Coordination Committee to
be set up in the Region, comprising the Regional Directors General of DSI,
Topraksu and Extension Services, one representative of ABT and the extension
service project manager (para 6.06). The Chairman of the committee would be
appointed by Government from among its members, see Chart 6925(R). This
pattern is similar to that operating successfully in the Seyhan project.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a Project Coordination
Committee would be established within six months of the date on which the
Credit/Loan Agreements become effective and Government would appoint a chair-
man from among its members. Assurances were also obtained that this commit-
tee would meet at least once every three months to review past accomplish-
ments, to plan future work and to ensure coordination of each agency's
activities.
Implementation of Project Works
6.02      Civil Works:  DSI, a long established agency of the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources, would be responsible for planning, design
construction and supervision of the dam, power plant, dykes, irrigation and
drainage works down to the farm unit. Alterations in design and construction
methods would probably be necessary as work progresses because of complex
dam site geology, earthquakes and flood hazards and poor rock through which
tunnels are to be excavated. Coupled with a tight construction schedule,
these changes would require expert assistance and would therefore require
the employment of an expert consulting firm to assist DSI in the construction
of the dam and power plant. In view of experience in the Seyhan Stage II
Project (Credit/Loan 143/587-TU), which is under construction in the adjacent
river basin, the existing law permitting DSI to offer financial incentives
to recruit additional staff on contract, and the presence of competent staff
in the DSI regional organization, consultants would not be required to
assist DSI in the construction of dykes, irrigation and drainage works.
6.03      On-Farm Development.  Topraksu, the soil conservation agency of
the Ministry of Village Affairs, would be responsible for all on-farm
development works comprising land leveling, surface and tile drainage,
feeder road construction and application of soil amendments at a rate rising
i           to 15,000 ha per annum.  A similar work program of equal magnitude is success-
fully being carried out on the Seyhan project. As the Seyhan project work
will overlap that of the project by about two years, Topraksu would be assisted
during this period by a consultant. Topraksu would set up a project organization,
see Chart 6927, based in Ceyhan town, staffed with qualified engineers respon-
sible to the Regional Director General in Adana, who is also responsible for
all on-farm development on the Seyhan project.



- 20 -
0
6.04      Because of wet weather during the winter, land leveling and tile
drainage can only be carried out during M4ay to November. As a result, land
to be leveled in any one year is normally planted to winter wheat and remains
fallow during the summer cropping season when higher value crops, such as
cotton, are normally cultivated. Consequently, land to be leveled is scat-
tered throughout the project area in parcels of varying size in any one year,
which is not conducive to contract leveling. Moreover, leveling machinery
remains idle for half the year. In consequence, contractors have not been
attracted to this work and previous efforts to contract out land leveling have
failed, Because of these past failures and to avoid delays in on-farm devel-
opment, Topraksu would be equipped to carry out such development on 12,000
ha annually with its own forces. To encourage the development of a contracting
industry for on-farm development, it is proposed to let contracts for a total
of about 20,000 ha, each contract being for a period of up to four years of
about 3,000 ha annually of on-farm development work, including surface drainage
and feeder roads, to enable the contractor to work for about 9-10 months per
year. An assurance to this effect was obtained during negotiations. Should
contractor interest not materialize, the on-farm development of 20,000 ha
would be carried out by force account.
Operation and Maintenance
6.05      DSI would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
dam and irrigation and drainage works and would set up a project organization,
suitably staffed, with headquarters in Ceyhan town and sub-offices at the dam,    0
Kadirli and Kosreli, see Chart 6926. This organization would be responsible
to the Regional Director General in Adana and would also levy and collect
water charges. The operation and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant
would be done by TEK, which would also be responsible for collecting elec-
tricity charges.  The farmers would be responsible for the maintenance of
all on-farm works.
Extension Service
6.06      The existing service in the project area is inadequate in staff
numbers, skills, equipment and facilities and would need to be greatly
expanded and formed into an integrated service, see Chart 6928; each member
would be solely employed on project work. This integrated extension
approach has proved successful in the Seyhan project. The service would
be directed by a project manager assisted by a group of specialists and by
consultants in the early years, resident in Ceyhan town, which would be the
headquarters of the service with sub-offices at Kadirli and Osmaniye. Each
village within the project would have a resident Technical Assistant or
Foreman who would provide the day-to-day contact with the farmer. The serv-
ice would be responsible for advising farmers on cropping patterns, cultiva-
tion methods, irrigation practices, crop protection, the development of mixed
farming and for carrying out demonstrations as well as monitoring agricultural
development in the project area. To enable this work to be done, adequate
equipment, vehicles. and buildings have been provided for as well as purchase
of livestock for demonstration purposes.  Assurances were obtained during             0
negotiations that (a) an integrated Project Extension Service would be set



-21 -
up and a full-time Project tanager appointed within three months of date on
which the Credit/Loan Agreements become effective; (b) full-time, qualified
staff including specilists, in all disciplines required, would be appointed,
as needed, not later than one year prior to the first water delivery to any
area; (c) in-service training of Technical Assistants and Foremen would be
carried out by the staff and specialists; (d) adequate funds would be pro-
vided annually and specifically allocated to operate and maintain this exten-
sion service; and (e) this service would be maintained for at least ten years
following completion of construction.
Training
6.07      In the Seyhan project, funds were provided for both on-the-job and
overseas training of project staff, particularly Topraksu and the Extension
Service staff. The overseas training would take the form of short visits to
enable staff to widen their experience by seeing how others organized and
carried out their work. To date, it has not proved possible to implement
this training because of a Government decision that oversea passages cannot
be met from Credit/Loan funds. A similar training provision had been made
in the Rehabilitation and Completion project and is included again in this
project. Assurances were therefore obtained during negotiations that an
annual training program would be proposed and agreed with the Association
and the Bank within one year of the signing of Credit/Loan Agreements and
that each concerned agency would provide in its annual budget adequate funds
for oversea passages of staff in accordance with the agreed program. The
foreign exchange cost of training overseas would be financed through the
Credit/Loan.
Consultants
6.08      DSI would retain a firm of consultants, acceptable to the Association
and the Bank, throughout the construction of the dam and power plant. The
consultants would assist DSI in the preparation of bid documents, specifications,
revision of final designs and approval of working drawings prepared by con-
tractors during construction, preparation of withdrawal applications, review
of the evaluation of bids, preparation of contract documents, and supervision
of the construction of the dam and power plant. In addition, they would carry
out all investigations required in connection with construction and prepare
rules for reservoir and spillway operation. No consultants would be required
for the irrigation, drainage and flood protection works (para 6.02).
6.09      Topraksu and the Extension Service would retain consultants, ac-
ceptable to the Association and the Bank (paras 6.03 and 6.06), Topraksu
would employ one equipment specialist in 1974 for three years and the
Extension Service two specialists from 1975 for about eleven man-years to
assist both agencies in organizing the one-farm development and extension
programs. Provision has also been made for the Extension Service to employ
short-term specialists for a total of one man-year. An outline of the
consultant's terms of reference for all three agencies and man-power require-
ments are presented in Annex 6.



- 22 -
6.sO      A condition of effectiveness would be the employment of a consulting
f ir  by PS I9 acceptable to the Association and the Bank, for a period of at
leas; sezen years.  Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that
op-eaksu and the Extension Service would employ consultants acceptable to
the Association and the Bank, for a total period of at least six years from
'974~.
Grou  o c Sec iali rts
6>1 < l   For reasons given in para 6.02 and Annex 6, an indenendent group
of four siecialists would be employed to advise as needed or, special problems
.hich night develop during the design and construction of t'le dam.  These
sneczialists -would be one in soil and rock mechanics, one in tunneling, one
in slurry trench, grouting and drainage, and one in engineering geology. An
assurance -was obtained during negotiations that this group would be appointed
in consultation with the Association and the Bank within eighteen months of
the Credet/Lan bei ng signed.
Safet7 of Dam
6.12      As the Aslantas Dam is in an earthquake zone and any dam failure
may result in considerable damage in the Ceyhan plain, assurances were ob-
tained from the Governmernt that DSI would make, at intervaals of not more
than Live years, a formal inspection of the Aslantas Dam and appurtenant
structures as well as the Ceyhan flood protection dykes to determine whether
there are actual or potential deficiencies in the condi.tion of such structures
or in the quality and adequacy of maintenance or methods of operation of such
structures which may endanger their safety and to take any remedial action
necessary and would forward a copy of each irspectior. report to the Associa-
t-on and the Bank,
Research
6M3       Within the Adana region, existing research facilities are adequate.
T7he Tarsus Trrigation Research Institute conducts research on the amounts
and methods of application of water and fertilizer, land reclamation and crop
adaDtabi4i ty. The Regional Cotton Research institute concentrates on increas-
ing the production of principal annual crops grown in the region with particular
attention to cotton and to a lesser degree wheat. The Plant, Protection Institute
conducts research on plant protection and carries out extension work as does
the Animal Husbandry Research Institute on livestock, particularly cattle, the
HHorticultural Experiment Station at Iskenderun and the Citrus Experiment
Station at Dortyol.
Credit
6514      Farm inputs are procured and distributed by public, cooperative,
and private agencies and are generally in good supply. Credit is available
both From private and institutional sources but constitutes a constraint.
Private loans carry high annual rates of interest (exceeding 20%) and, are

by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT) which serves the entire country
through some 750 branches, of which four are in the project area, and through
credit cooperatives acting as agents for ABT. ABT's policy is to give prior-
ity to the needs of small farmers and to ration its limited funds among far-
*          mers throughout the country.  The effective rate of interest to the Bank is
9.5% per annum which is reasonable. About three-fourths of its loan portfolio
is in seasonal credit of which about a third for the country as a whole and
about one half for the project area is in default; this aggravates the problem
of lack of funds. However, in the on-going Seyhan Irrigation Project, a
system has been evolved for production credits given to farmers by ABT whereby
the integrated extension service monitors the use by farmers of these credits,
which are given in installments. The granting of an installment depends on
ABT receiving a certified statement of successful completion of work from the
extension service.  MIoreover, failure to repay a production credit at harvest,
without sufficient reason, automatically debars the farmer from credit for a
subsequent crop until repayment has been effected. This has resulted in a
recovery of over 80% of production credits made to Seyhan Project farmers by
ABT. A similar system will be used in this project.
6.15      Although the amount of short-term loans made by ABT in the project
area increased sharply from approximately TL 35.0 million in 1969 to TL 46.0
million in 1971, it was grossly inadequate in relation to the requirements
estimated at appraisal of TL 171.0 million.  These requirements would in-
crease to TL 299.0 million by 1987 when the project would reach full maturity
(Annex 12). In addition, there will be need for medium and long-term credits.
6.16      Under the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project, Government has agreed
to make a comprehensive study to improve the organization and supply of agri-
cultural credit throughout Turkey. This study is now under way. Meanwhile,
to ensure adequate credit in the project area, an assurance was obtained
from the Government that adequate short and medium-term credit facilities
would be provided to farmers. A similar assurance has proved satisfactory
in the Seyhan project.
Recovery of Cost
6.17      Existing legislation (Law 6200) authorizes DSI to assess and collect
water charges on irrigation projects to meet operation and maintenance costs
and to recover the investment with interest and Topraksu to recover the cost
of on-farm development works with interest (Law 7457) over a period of 15
years with a first payment of 10% of the cost of the work.
6.18      The charges for irrigation water by DSI are annually fixed and
approved by a cabinet committee. All DSI projects are classified into 6
groups for purposes of operation and maintenance charges depending on the
type of service provided and whether pumping is involved.  The rates for
operation and maintenance are set by individual groups of crops for a unit
of area and are related to the water requirements of each crop.  For example,
water charges vary from TL 60 per ha for forage crops under gravity to
TL 1,050 per ha for rice supplied by pumps.  Current water charges do not



- 24 -
meet operation and maintenance costs. However, in the last three years,
Government has raised the water charge each year.  The intention is to
continue raising this charge annually to fully recover operation and
maintenance costs.
6.19      After construction of a project, or an operating unit of a project
is completedD an additional charge is made by DSI for amortization of invest-
ment, except for investments in flood control which is not recoverable by
la,w. This is a flat charge on a per ha basis and varies from TL 30 to TL 170.
6.20      Late payment of water charges to DSI is subject to a penalty of 10%
of the charge regardless of the length of delay.  In the past, there has been
a high. delinquency rate because the penalty for late payment was inadequate
and delinquency constituted a cheap source of credit. However, experience
indicates that full recovery for any one year is obtained in 9 to 10 years
following assessment. Recently, however, DSI has stepped up enforcement and
retains enforcers in each operating organization. After a judgment declaring
delinquency is received from a special court dealing with these matters, the
delinquent's possessions are sold by auction and the arrears are recovered
from the proceedse Although Topraksu is authorized, to date they have not
recovered on-farm development costs from beneficiaries.
6.21      in order to evaluate farmers' capacity to contribute toward the
recovery of investment costs of the project, future farm incomes of represen-
tative farm types have been analyzed (Annex 13). These analyses suggest that
significant revenues could be generated from the project without jeopardizing
farmersb incentives; these analyses are essentially illustrative as they
exclude (a) income earned away from their farm; (b) income from livestock
which is raised on crop residues and grazing areas around the project area;
and (c) management charges, see para 7.12,
6022      The Seyhan Irrigation Project, Stage II, provided for a comprehensive
study by consultants which would relate the water charge recovery rate to
farmers' incentive and capacity to pay; this has been completed and is under
study by Government. It recommends an annual water charge of TL 750 (1970
value) per ha to fully recover operation and maintenance and part of invest-
ment costs in structures, on-farm development and extension,  In terms of
1972 value, this charge rises to TL 1,166 which would be a combined water
and land development charge. An annual combined charge, commencing in the
third year of irrigation, of at least TL 1,250 per ha is proposed. Included
in this charge is provision for full recovery of on-farm development cost
over ffteen years with two years grace.  The charge proposed for the first
two years of irrigation is TL 1,000 and TL 1,100 per ha respectively.
6,23      With the proposed level of recovery (TL 1,250 per ha), the present
value of Government subsidy to farmers (measured by discounting the operation
and maintenance costs; namely, TL 309 per ha or US$22, investments including
physical and price contingencies, but excluding interest during construction
and revenues over 50 years at 10%) amounts to about TL 2.0 billion (US$142
million) and revenues would cover about 25% of costs; namely, TL 0.7 billion
out o£ a discounted total cost of TL 2.7 billion, As the amount of.sunk



- 25 -
0         costs is relatively small (US$2.9 million), their inclusion would make little
difference to the percentage recovery. At this recovery rate, project charges
at full development, on a weighted basis for the range of farm sizes in the
project, would be about one-half of the average incremental net income per
ha and as such, although farmers would be able to pay a higher rate, they
are unlikely to accept this because the suggested level already involves a
*          250% increase within 15 years.  On the proposed basis, the chargeable
project costs for irrigation would practically be recovered in full without
interest.
6.24      As the Water Charges Study is still under discussion with Govern-
ment, assurances were obtained during negotiations that arrangements would
be made for the recovery from farmers of (i) operation and maintenance costs
of the Aslantas Dam (less any amount allocated to TEK) and the irrigation
and drainage systems (excluding flood protection works) based on the actual
annual expenditures incurred in accordance with Law 6200; (ii) on-farm devel-
opment costs for all works carried out by Topraksu in accordance with Law
7457 or any additional legislation which may be introduced, over a maximum
period of 15-20 years; and (iii) investment costs in the construction of the
Aslantas Dam (excluding that portion of the dam costs that may be allocated
to power and transferred to TEK in accordance with regulations established
under Law 1312) and of irrigation and drainage systems (excluding flood
protection works) in accordance with Law 6200 over a maximum period of 50
years. To the extent permitted by the laws of the Borrower, the above water
and land development charges including reasonable interest on the investment
costs and bearing in mind farmers' incentives and capacity to pay would be
introduced immediately after the introduction of irrigation in any portion
of the Project area. An undertaking was also obtained that recovery of
on-farm development and investment costs in the dam and irrigation and
drainage systems would be so phased as to avoid any sharp decline in the
amount recovered annually once recovery of the cost of on-farm development
is completed. Further, the above charges would be subject to periodic
reviews at intervals not exceeding five years at which time the impact of
inflation on the real cost to farmers of such charges would be taken into
consideration. In the event that the Borrower would wish at any time in
the future to initiate legislation altering the present system for the
collection of water and land development charges, assurances were obtained
that provision would be made for the recovery of water and land development
charges at a level not less than the aggregate of the charges described
above, with interest, through equal annual installments and that the Borrower
would also consider levying water charges on an area rather than on a crop
basis.

VIIo PRODUCTION, 'AARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES AND FARMERS' INCOME
Production
7.01      Without the project, the net value of production is estimated to
increase by about 10% without allowing for small flood losses consequent to
the completion of the distribution system for the Cevdetiye weir to utilize
run-of-the-river flows which would irrigate about 26,500 ha and a greater
use of inputs and credits.
7.02      As a result of the project, the gross cropped area would increase
from 110, 200 ha to 117,600 ha because of the cropping intensity rising from
106 to '21%. However, the net cultivated area would decline to 97,000 ha
from I05,000 ha; project structures and roads account for this reduction.
Also, the area under relatively low value w'aeat would decrease in favor of
more remunerative crops, such as, cotton, oil seeds, feedgrains, fodders,
vegetables and fruits. A considerable increase in yields per ha of crops
would be realized with improved irrigation and drainage, expanded extension
services, greater use of inputs combined with adequate credit and marketing
facilities, The feedgrains and fodders would help raise the present low
productivity of the basically good livestock in the project area, comprising
some 30,000 cattle and 50,000 sheep and goats, which currently survive by
grazing fallow land and the surrounding sparsely covered hills.  Details of
future cropping pattern, area and yield are in Annex 1.
7.03      97,000 net ha would be cultivated including 30,000 ha currently
receiving insufficient irrigation. The cropping intensity, which is 114%
at present in the inadequately irrigated areas and about 100% in the non-
irrigated areas, would be increased at full development to 121%. Yields at
full development, in the fifth year after irrigation are projected to be
the same as projected for the adjacent Seyhan project, see Annex 12.
7,04      The present crops, with the adeition of fodder crops (vetch and
alfalfa), would continue to be grown but the area devoted to each would
change. Cotton would occupy the largest area followed by cereals (wheat,
maize and rice), groundnuts, sesame, fodder crops, vegetables and fruits
(citrus and plums) in descending order. On full development in 1985, the
project's cropped area and incremental production would be as follows:
Cropped Area           Production
Present    Future    Present      Future    Increment
---'000 ha -                    000 ton ----     ---

- 27 -
Due to a reduction in area, wheat production would slightly decrease and that
of watermelons and rice would slightly increase, see Annex 1.
Market Prospects
7.05      Marketing arrangements are generally satisfactory.  The Government
also intervenes to support the price and marketing of main agricultural com-
modities, including wheat and cotton, which are the principal products of the
area. The intervention for wheat is accomplished through the official Soil
Products Office (TMO) and for cotton through a semi-official agency of the Union
of Sales Cooperative (CUKOBIRLIK). The operation is financed by ABT and any
losses incurred in the purchase, storage, or sales are underwritten by the
Government. Within the past year, prevailing market prices have been above
the support prices. With the exception of cotton, groundnuts and vegetables,
some of which are exported, all commodites are consumed in Turkey.
7.06      Cotton:  Turkey is a traditional exporter of cotton and has a rapid-
ly expanding textile industry; this is expected to continue since textile
consumption in Turkey is low, incomes are rising and Government supports textile
exports through a favorable exchange rate and tax rebate. Approximately half
of the present 450,000 tons of cotton lint produced is exported and the balance
is used locally. If the current pattern is assumed, for the disposal of the
incremental production of the project (47,000 tons), the annual increase in
exports and local consumption as well as total production between 1972 and
1985 would be less than 1% per annum.  Its disposal should also be helped by:
(a)  the high yields of cotton, which would reduce production
costs and make exports more competitive;
(b)  associate membership in the European Economic Community
(which is pending) would result in increased accessibility
to the Community's market, which is already a major buyer
of lint; and
(c) Turkey has developed additional markets in East Europe,
Lebanon, and Japan which are expected to expand.
Further details are in Annex 14.
7.07      Groundnuts:  Incremental production of groundnuts would be about 0.3%
of current annual world trade estimated at 1.0 million tons oil equivalent.
Europe accounts for 75% of world imports in which Turkey presently has a small
share. Only about two-thirds of the incremental production would be available
for export as there is a strong demand in Turkey.
7.08      Citrus, Tomatoes, Onions, and Other Vegetables:  There is a strong
local demand for these commodities but about one-half of incremental produc-
tion, which would be early maturing, would be for export. Detailed market
projections are given in the report of the Fruit and Vegetable Project
(Credit/Loan 257/762-TU).  At present, about 100,000 tons of fruit and veg-
0         etables are exported to Europe and the Middle East, but studies made by



- 28 -
Turkish and German consultants project exports of upwards to 360,000 tons
by 1975, _   Furthermore, local demand is expected to increase.
7e09      Plums:  All incremental production would be for local consumption
there being a strong unsatisfied local market.
7.10      Maize, Alfalfa and Vetch:  Incremental production of maize as a
feedgrain, alfalfa as hay, and vetch as fodder is essential for upgrading
the existing livestock which is underfed. Provision has been made in the
proj,ecx for demonstrations of improved livestock management using high pro-
ducing imported dairy cattle.  OECD studies indicate that local production
of coarse grains would be insufficient for domestic requirements owing to
a projected rise in livestock production.
Prices
7.1       Two sets of prices have been used; one for financial analysis and
the other for economic analysis. For major crops; namely, cotton, wheat,
groundnuts, rice, feedgrains and citrus, prices have been derived from and
adjusted to those forecasted by the Bank's Economics Department. For other
cropsn prices have been related to the post devaluation domestic prices.
The actual prices used have been given in para 3 (b), Annex 15.
Farmers' Income
7.12      Farmers' income has been calculated at current farm-gate prices.              0
Production costs (Table 5, Annex 13) include all inputs also valued at current
prices and takes into account that all cultivation, other than some weeding
and harvesting, is normally carried ouit by machinery. All hired labor is
costed at going wage rates and interest at 10% per annum is charged on working
capital for a period of six months for each c-.op. Land tax applicable to
different sized farms and a land and water charge of TL 1,250 per ha has been
assumed. Based on these assumptions, the income of farmers of typical sized
farms (Annex 13) would be as under:

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Benefits
8.01      The major benefits of the project would be increased production of
crops, generation of 500 GWh of electric energy and gross foreign exchange
earnings from increased exports estimated at TL 291 million (US$20 million)
per annum at full development. The annual net value of production at full
development would TL 761 million (US$54.4 million) compared to the present
net value of production of TL 247.3 million (US$17.7 million) and a projected
value of TL 263.7 million (US$18.8 million) for future conditions "without
the project" after accounting for flood and area losses (Table 1, Annex 15).
The incremental net value of production due to the project, excluding TL 5.3
million (US$0.4 million) for production foregone in the reservoir, would
be TL 492 million (US$35.1 million). In calculating these values, additional
family labor has been costed at zero, and additional hired labor shadow priced
at TL 6 per day, reflecting the opportunities for employment under with and
without project conditions. The benefits to be derived from the power com-
ponent would be at least TL 85.9 million (US$6.1 million) per annum. With
a project life of 50 years, the economic rate of return is 13.4% (Table 2,
Annex 15), excluding sunk costs (US$2.9 million). The rate of return for an
irrigation only project would be 13% while a single-purpose hydroelectric
project would not be justified when compared with alternative means of pro-
ducing the equivalent energy. The multipurpose project proposed is preferable
because the economic rate of return on the incremental costs of the power
component is at least 15.7% thereby increasing the overall rate of return to
13.4%.
8.02      A sensitivity analysis of the rate of return to variations in
investment costs, prices, value of agricultural production, delay in com-
pletion of the dam, extension of the agricultural development period and
costing hired labor at market prices indicate that even under less favorable
assumptions, the rate of return of the project is unlikely to fall below
10% (Annex 15).
Employment
8.03      The project would increase employment by about 14,000 man-years from
the current 9,000 to about 23,000 man-years, see Annex 16. In addition, the
project would generate employment in the supply of inputs, processing and
marketing and transportation. The increased labor requirements would be met
by doubling family labor employment and a five-fold increase in hired labor.
Hired labor would be obtained from some 4,000 locally resident, non-farming
families and from migrant labor customarily used in the region at harvest.
While the costs of creating the additional employment are relatively high
compared with many other agricultural projects, this results from the heavy
investment in the dam. However, this investment cost would substantially
increase per capita income, see para 8.05.



- 30 -
8.04      About 1,000 families would be displaced by the Aslantas reservoir.
They would receive compensation for their land and immovable property in
accordance with Turkish law which should enable them to purchase land else-
where and establish themselves thereon. The possibility of a resettlement
scheme for the displaced families was considered. Government pointed out
that the compensation paid was sufficient to enable families to establish
themselves elsewhere (land is available), the law did not provide for
resettlement and, in previous acquisitions of land and property to be inun-
dated by the construction of a dam, no resettlement schemes had been provided
and an exception could not therefore be made in this case.
Income Distribution
8.05      Project beneficiaries would be the 12,000 families farming in the
area, Another 4,000 families would benefit through increased employment
opportunities as agricultural labor. Net incomes (after payment of land tax,
and land and water charges) would range from TL 31,480 per farm of 5 ha to
TL 279,870 of 50 ha before income taxes and from TL 30,558 to TL 246,054 after
income taxes. While the progressive nature of income tax effects some dis-
tribution of benefits, the enactment of pending legislation on agrarian
reform would substantially improve income distribution. Differences in farm
income by farm size are presented in the Table in para 7.12
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

ed to the extent permitted by the laws of the Borrower bearing
in mind farmers' incentives and capacity to pay. This level
of water and land development charges would be reviewed at
intervals of not more than five yes,s (para 6.24).
9.02      It was also agreed that a consulting firm would be employed by
DSI, acceptable to the Association and the Bank, for the construction of
the Aslantas dam and power plant for a period of at least seven years

CEYHAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Description of Works
1.        The principal features of the Project are:
(a) the Aslantas Dam, an earthfill structure located on the Ceyhan
River with a storage capacity of 1,190 Mm3, serving irrigation,
flood control and power generation;
(b) the Aslantas power plant of 138 MW installed capacity;
(c) two irrigation conveyance canals on both banks of the Ceyhan
River and distribution systems serving 107,800 gross ha,
98,600 ha by gravity, 9,200 ha by pumping;
(d) a drainage system and improved dykes along the river banks;
0                (e)  on-farm development of the whole irrigated area, including land
leveling, surface and tile drains, soil amendments where necessary
and feeder roads;
(f)  the procurement of on-farm development and operation and main-
tenance equipment; and
(g) the construction of buildings and other facilities.
Aslantas Dam
2.        The Aslantas Dam is located 45 km north of the Mediterranean sea
and 100 km upstream of Ceyhan town. The proposed dam would be an earthfill
structure, 75 m high at crest elevation 160. It would create a reservoir
with a gross storage capacity of 1,190 Mm3 at maximum normal operating level
of 146 m above sea level, plus flood storage capacity of 650 Mm3. Diversion
of the river during construction would require two tunnels in the left abut-
ment: the larger one - 7.80 m diameter - would later be used as a power
penstock; the smaller one - 5.15 m diameter - would ultimately serve as a
bottom outlet. The spillway, gated chute type, with conventional spilling
basin, fitted with six gates - 12 m x 16.5 m - and 92 m wide would pass a
maximum discharge of 12,000 m3 per sec for the maximum probable flood. The
spillway, together with the flood storage space, would be adequate to route
the 100-year flood without allowing more than 1,600 m3 per sec into the
river downstream. Additional statistical data is given in Table 1.



ANNEX 2
Page  2
Power Plant
3.        The powerhouse would be a conventional above ground structure just
downstream of the dam. It would contain three medium-head 46 MW vertical
shaft Francis turbines with generators. One bay of the powerhouse would
be used for an irrigation outlet valve.  There would be no provision for
expansion and none is considered necessary. Characteristics of the power
plant are given in Table 1. A 20 km access road is under construction from
Cevdetlye diversion weir to the dam site.
4.        Water for the turbines - maximum discharge 280 m3 per sec under
59 m rated head - would be drawn through a sloping intake on the dam
face, dropped through a shaft connecting to the larger of the two tunnels
used for diversion, thence about 500 m to a surge tank and dual bifurcation
at the powerhouse.
5.        A switchyard would be located adjacent to the powerhouse.  A 20-km
double circuit 154-kV transmission line would connect the Aslantas plant
with Osmaniye substation which will be the main grid substation in the
Ceyhan region when the Turkish Electricity Authority completes the 380-kV
l"southern loop" in 1976. A 30-kV distribution circuit from Osmaniye to
Aslantas would meet construction needs and provide a standby source for
station service.
Cevdetiye Diversion Weir
6.        The Cevdetiye diversion weir, already constructed 25 km downstream
of the Aslantas dam site, will serve as headworks for the two irrigation
conveyance canals on the right and left banks. Water will be diverted by
gravity at elevation 58.50 m. Radial gates w.ould be installed on the weir if
the Aslantas power plant is to generate peak power during the irrigation
season. At present, they are not necessary.
Flood Protection Dykes
7.        Existing dykes on both banks of the river between Hamidiye and
Hamitbey will be made more continuous, raised and reinforced, in order to
accommodate the discharge released by the dam spillway on the occurrence
of a 100-year flood from the catchment area upstream of the dam. Analysis
of historical floods indicates that they are also caused by the catchment
downstream of Aslantas dam down to Ceyhan bridge, however, the peak runoffs
are so phased in time that the channel capacity of 1,600 m3 per sec will
ensure adequate protection. The total length of the dykes would be about
60 km.
Irrigation Works
8.        The project area is divided as follows:

The major canals are concrete lined, the smaller ones and all distributaries
are prefabricated canalettes or pipes.  The Left Bank conveyance canal, 105
m3 per sec, and the Right Bank conveyance canal, 41 m3 per sec, would branch
off the Cevdetiye weir and serve respectively 57,400 and 31,400 net ha by
gravity. 6,850 net ha of the pumped areas are located on the Left Bank,
only Hedioren of 1,350 net ha would be served by the Right Bank canal. Field
irrigation would be distributed by movable plastic siphons providing unit
discharges of 10 to 30 1 per sec. To improve water use efficiency, DSI
envisages setting up irrigation cooperatives which would be responsible for
water allocation and water charges recovery: smooth operation of such a
cooperative system would require an accurate gauging of the water allocated
to each unit headgate. Irrigation canals to be constructed in each area
would be as follows:

cay, Savrun, Sumbas, Arisu, Kurukulak, have already been constructed from
1959 to 1965, and are generally satisfactory. The secondary and field
drainage canals to be constructed under this project would discharge into
these existing channels. The lengths of drainage channels, existing or to be

Areas to be tile drained or reclaimed are located in the vicinity of Degir-
mendere, on the right bank of Karacay Canal south of Kosreli and in the
Kadirli Plain between Savrun and Endel Canals. A network of feeder roads,
5 m wide, is so designed that any point in the project area is within one
km of an all-weather road.
Equipment
14.       The equipment to be procured under the project would consist of
hydromechanical and electrical equipment for the Aslantas Power Plant,
irrigation gates, pump and motors, vehicles and operation and maintenance
and on-farm development equipment and miscellaneous demonstration equipment
and livestock for the Extension Services, see Annex 8.



ANNEX 2

Buildings and Other Facilities
15.       As listed in Annex 8, buildings to be constructed by the project
consist of three DSI operation and maintenance centers, at Ceyhan, Kadirli,
and Kosreli, with about 117 houses for the staff, offices, stores and
communication systems. TOPRAKSU would build an administration center at
Ceyhan with maintenance workshop, 40 houses and miscellaneous facilities.
The Extension Services would build three offices at Ceyhan, Osmaniye and
Kadirli, 20 substations for Technical Assistants throughout the project
area, 13 staff houses, livestock demonstration sheds, stores, garages and
also purchase 300 head of dairy cattle from overseas. In the long-term it
is expected that mixed farming will develop in the project area. Consequently,
mixed farming demonstrations are necessary during the development phase of
the project using guaranteed high producing Friesian cows which have to be
imported.

CEYHAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Water Supply, Demanid, Quality and Rights
Inadequacy of Rainfall
1.        Rainfall in the project area is about 70() mm per annum, falling
mainly in the winter.  The summers are dry and rainfall is insufficient for
crop growth.  Water requirements of annual spring and summer crops (cereals,
cotton, oilseeds and vegetables) are 400 to 700 mm while 1,000 mm or more is
required for perennial crops such as citrus, plums, and alfalfa. The useful
rainfall in the project area, which is available mostly in spring, is far
less than crop requirements, consequently, irrigation is required if the
project area agriculture is to be developed to its full potential. Table I
illustrates the proposed land use under gravity and pumped irrigation systems.
Water Supply
2.        The project would derive its water supply entirely from the Ceyhan
river on which the Aslantas storage dam would be constructed. Upstream of
the damsite, the river drains approximately 15,000 km2. About 25 km down-
stream of the dam, the Cevdetiye diversion weir, completed in 1971 by DSI,
would feed the left and right bank conveyance canals to irrigate 97,000 net
ha. Prior to the completion of the Aslantas dam and reservoir, this weir
would be able to irrigate about 26,500 ha by diverting the run of the river
flow of the Ceyhan river when the distribution system is constructed.
3.        Four years (1965-1968) of flow records are available at the dam
site. It was, therefore, necessary to reconstitute the historical flow.
This was done by direct flow correlation with upstream flows gauged at
Cercioglu from 1957 to 1964 and at Kilavuzlu from 1941 to 1956 with catch-
ment areas of 14,000 km2 and 8,000 km2 respectively. The above data was
reviewed and revealed an over-estimation of flow of 20%. Consequently, for
appraisal purposes, 80% of the flow was used and the reservoir operation
calculated over a 14 year period (1955-1968). This period covered the
extremes of climate normally experienced and expected in the project area
and resulted in corrected flows averaging about 4,000 Mm3 per annum, see
Table 2.
Future Use of Water in Upstream Areas
4.        The present Ceyhan flow can irrigate about 26,500 ha.  On completion
of the dam in 1979, it would not only be possible to irrigate the 97,000 ha
net in the project area and the Dortyol and Yumartalik Plains of 32,000 ha
plus a part of the 200,000 irrigable ha, which are located upstream of the

dam, without jeopardizing the project, provided such abstraction does not,
on average, exceed 200 Mm3 per annum.
Water Requirements and Consumptive Uses of Crops
5.        The crop consumptive uses were estimated according to the climatic
and rainfall conditions experienced during the period 1955-1968, using the
modified Blaney-Criddle method. The crop coefficients used were based on
the crop growth stage coefficient curves adjusted to the conditions prevail-
ing in the project area.  The water requirement for tomato nurseries (1/15
of planted area) was taken as 50 mm during March. 200 mm was assumed to be
the water requirement for flooding rice land during preparation and broad-
casting in June.
6.        The total average water requirement for each crop was as follows:
Mar  Apr   1       Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Total
- --------------------- mm--- ------------------------------

Effective Rainfall
7.        This component of rainfall was determined for each crop by assuming
a 150 mm irrigation per application, which revealed that, on average, the
total useable rain would be about 100 nma for cotton, 200 mm for wheat, 150
mm for vegetables and 300 mm for perennial crops such as citrus and alfalfa,
out of an average annual rainfall of 700 mm.
Losses, Irrigation Efficiency
8.        Since all canals, including secondary and tertiary would either be
lined or canalettes, the conveyance efficiency in the canal system was assumed
to be 90%, field efficiency 65% and overall efficiency rounded to 60%.
Total Irrigation Demand and Irrigation Duty
9.        On these assumptions, the total irrigation demand would average
about 1,000 Mm3 per annum, equivalent to about 10,000 m3 per ha per year.
The breakdown, on a monthly basis is in Table 3, indicating the peak demand
(irrigation Duty) of about 100 m3 per sec in July, equivalent to 1.00 1 per
sac per ha. The design canal capacity adopted of 1.14 1 per sec per ha would
be adequate.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Downstream Requirements and Salt Intrusion
10.       A review of the demands for municipal and industrial uses in the
area - Osmaniye, Ceyhan, and Misis - indicated that these demands, inclusive
of the future expansion in 30 years are too small to be taken into account,
the total of which is less than 1 m3 per sec. However, other downstream
requirements would be:
(i) the existing 4,000 ha and future 8,000 ha in the Misis Plain, and
(ii) maintenance of the salt water boundary at the estuary.
The Ceyhan river maintains an average low flow of about 50-60 m3 per sec in
late summer. It decreases to about 20 m3 per sec in a critical year. A
careful review indicated that the Misis Plain would require about 10 m3 per
sec to meet the peak demand in July.  Another 10 m3 per sec would be needed
to keep the salt water boundary far enough from the pumping station at
Kirmizidam, about 33 km upstream of the river mouth, and to maintain an
adequate depth in the river channel for the pumping intake. These require-
ments were allowed for. Consequently, salt water intrusion would not be a
problem under project conditions.
Total Water Requirements from Reservoir
0=         11.       Table 3 summarizes the irrigation water requirements and require-
ments downstream of the project as well as the return flow resulting from
drainage and deep percolation from the irrigated areas, such flow being about
15% of the irrigation water admitted into the project area.  The net diversion
requirements were derived from 1955-1968 data and were used to determine the
stored water required for irrigation as shown below:

Irrigation Water During Construction Period
12.       The existing Cevdetiye weir would divert the unregulated flow of the
Ceyhan river into part of the project. The effective flow available during
the growing season would serve about 26,500 ha.
Water Quality
13.       Water quality is suitable for irrigation.  Samples taken from the
Ceyhan river at Ceyhan bridge and Misis in the project area show that the
quality falls into Class C2S1.  Return flows would not materially change
0          this water quality.  The estimated total salt content of the river water



ANNEX 4
Page 4

when mixed with the return flow would be about 450 ppm compared to 330 ppm
of the normal river water. This is within acceptable limits for irrigation
water,
Power Release and Summary of Reservoir Operation Studies
14.       Even in a dry year, the net annual runoff into the reservoir is
nearly three times the irrigation demand. The surplus runoff, mostly in
winter, and the irrigation water, in spring and summer, while being released
from the dam would also generate power.  The dam would provide regulating
storage mainly for irrigation. A higher dam, to permit larger storage for
more power would submerge major historical and archeological sites. In
order to assess the adequacy of supply on a seasonal basis and during periods
of low-flow, reservoir operation studies were performed on a basis of the
corrected runoff, taken as 80% of the original estimates. These studies
also took into account the reduced capacity of the reservoir due to future
sedimentation (see para 16), and are summarized in Table 4. They indicate
that the reservoir storage would be sufficient to meet the irrigation require-
ments every year, except once in 14 years in September. As September is the
harvesting season for most crops, this shortage would not cause much damage.

j.   Maximum probable flood space                                 650
Sediment Loads
16.       Sediment loads transported by the river into the reservoir were
originally assessed by consultants on the basis of a yield of 250 m3 per
km2 per annum, which is lower than might be expected with the storm inten-
sity and physical conditions prevailing in the headwater area. When this
sediment yield estimate was doubled, there is still no problem of sedimenta-
tion in the reservoir for the 50 years of project life. However, the useful
life of the reservoir would be prolonged if any upstream reservoirs were
built, as is projected in the long-term development program of the Ceyhan
basin.

Water Right
17.       Law 6200 of 1953, administered by DSI, controls the use of water
from rivers and streams in Turkey. Under this law, all water development
schemes in the State require the approval of DSI, which assures that all
existing development would be served, and new schemes would have to acquire
the necessary rights.which would be granted only if water is available.
Consequently, there would be no water rights problem.

CEYHAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Flood and Flood Control
Flood
1.        During the last two decades, five major floods occurred in the
lower Ceyhan area; among which, the maximum observed peak was 2,500 m3 per
sec at Ceyhan Bridge in the lower portion of the project area. This would
compare with the 100-year flood, which was computed to be about 3,000 m3
per sec. Historical flood-flow data is given below:
Year                  Approximate Flow   Approximate Return Period
m3 per sec                 Years

Computed                    2,850                     100
Floods inundate low lands in the project area when flows are greater than
900 m3 per sec in one section and 1,200 m3 per sec in another. In 1966,
the area flooded in the project area was 34,000 ha and, in 1971, 5,000 ha.
Agricultural damage was about US$2.3 million (TL 20.5 nillion) in 1966 and
US$0.3 million (TL 3.5 million) in 1971. Under existing conditions, average
annual flood damage was estimated to be about US$0.2 million (TL 2.6 million)
at 1972 prices, in spite of 18 km of dykes on the Ceyhan river banks, which
protect about 2,000 ha from a 25-year flood.
Flood Control
2.        Project Area - The proposed Aslantas dam and reservoir would mainly
serve irrigation. Hlowever, it would provide 460 IMm3 for flood storage which
would cater for a 100-year flood. The proposed flood protection works for
the project (channel improvement and flood protection dykes) were based on



ANNEX 5
Page  2
a 35-year flood which requires a river channel capacity of 1,200 m3 per
sec.  As the flood storage capacity of the reservoir caters for the 100-year
flood, and the magnitude of the 1966 flood closely approached that of a
100-year flood, the channel capacity would be increased, to cater for a
100-year flood, to 1,600 m3 per sec.
3.        Diversion During Construction - The design adopted was based on a
25-year flood. The review of the proposed diversion operation indicated
that if the cofferdam were raised by 5 m, protection corresponding to a
100-year flood would be achieved. The additional cost involved would be
relatively small (US$0.2 million) and would be justified by the higher degree
of safety. The proposal would be studied by the project consultants before
the final design of the cofferdam is prepared.
4.        Aslantas Dam - The inflow design flood provided for the spillway
at the proposed dam was derived from 48 hour rainfall and snowmelt and on
the basis of the maximum probable conditions. A review of the flood indicat-
ed that the original estimate was probably overstated. This resulted in a
relatively excessive amount of flood runoff, as the assumption used reflected
a runoff coefficient of 90% compared with the expected 65 - 70% from the
catchment area. The estimate was, therefore, adjusted downwards to 70%
coefficient. Consequently, the spillway capacity would provide for even
greater safety than was originally estimated.  The magnitudes of the inflow
maximum probable floods and their flood factors are given below:
Drainage    Rainfall       Runoff
Area    and Snowmelt  Coefficient    Peak    Volume
kumz         mm            %        ms per sec   Mm3
Original estimated flood  14,700         320            90         15,300    4,200

TURKEY
CEYHIAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Organization - Contractors - Consultants
Organization
1.        The Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project would be implemented
jointly by several Government agencies, DSI being responsible for the con-
struction of the dam and power plant, construction and operation and main-
tenance of irrigation, drainage and flood protection works, Topraksu for on-
farm development, the Extension Services for assistance to farmers, the
Agricultural Bank for credit and TEK for operation and maintenance of the
power plant. The proposed Ceyhan Aslantas project organization will be
similar in nature and size to that adopted for, and proven in the Seyhan
project, located in the same Adana Region. Organization of each agency is
shown in Charts 6925(R), 6927, 6926 and 6928 and coordination of project work
by these Agencies would be provided by a Coordinating Committee, see Chart 6925(R).
2.        DSI:  Construction of Aslantas dam and irrigation, drainage and
flood protection works would be the responsibility of DSI's Regional
Office in Adana. Power plant construction, also under DSI, would require
prior consultation with TEK. The Adana Regional Office of DSI, now in charge
of the Seyhan Project and several other schemes has considerable experience
in constructing, operating and maintaining irrigation and drainage projects.
However, since the construction of the dam involves particular difficulties
and major risks DSI would retain a firm of consultants, see para 8. DSI
staffing for the project is adequate. Its engineering and administration
cost would be TL 272 million, about 13% of construction costs. At full deve-
lopment, annual operation and maintenance costs would be about TL 30 million,
including materials, spare parts and replacements.
3.        Topraksu:  All on-farm development works, including land leveling,
tile and surface drainage, feeder roads, and soil amendments are to be
carried out by Topraksu, as in the Seyhan Project. The annual cost of
Topraksu's engineering and administration is estimated at TL 43 million,
about 15% of the cost of works. An equipment specialist (consultant) would
be retained initially to improve utilization of heavy equipment, see para 13.
4.        Extension Services:  Assistance to the farmers would be provided
by the Extension Service of the Ministry of Agriculture, assisted by Topraksu,
as it is for the Seyhan Project. The staff would consist of about 10
specialists, 15 graduate field staff and about 96 Technical Assistants and
Village Foremen, at a total annual cost of about TL 20 million. Consultants
would be retained to provide special expertise and help coordinate the
extension services in the field, see para 14.



ANNEX 6

Construction Contracts
5.        Dam and Power Plant:  A single civil works contract should be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding among prequalified
contracting firms. The difficulty and size of this particular dam and the
very tight construction schedule require that prequalification, which is
usual DSI practice, should be based on contractors' capability with reference
to:
(a) construction of large diameter tunnels in similar rock formation;
(b) large and deep excavation;
(c) slurry trench or cast in situ plastic concrete diaphragm;
(d) grout curtain;
(e)  earthfill dam (several million m3 fill);
(f) hydropower plant or similar work;
(g) experienced personnel available with detailed curricula
vitae;
(h)  equipment on hand and to be procured to undertake the                       X
Project;
(i) financial support; and
(j) if a joint venture, names and references of associates and
specialized firms for some particular works (slurry trench,
grouting, etc.).
6.        Irrigation and Drainage;  DSI proposes to divide these works into
18 contracts, including Ceyhan River dyke construction, of which fifteen would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The remaining
three contracts would be subject to local bidding procedures thereby permitting
work to commence in mid-1973 to utilize run-of-river flows as quickly as pos-
sible. Each contract would be about US$3.7 million. To enable the fifteen
contracts to attract wider competition, two or three contracts would be so
grouped that the value of any one group would be not less than US$7 million,
bidders being invited to bid for the group or any part of the group.
7.        On-farm Development:  Topraksu intends to carry out most of the
on-farm development by force-account, as in the Seyhan project. The con-
struction equipment would be supplied under the project.  However, about
3,000 ha annually would be done by contract, in order to develop a local
contracting industry in Turkey.

Consultants
8.        Aslantas Dam and Power Plant:  The Aslantas dam site, located in
an earthquake area, offers several special difficulties which call for the
utmost care during construction. Due to geological-conditions and the use
of unusual construction materials, many amendments are likely to become
necessary as the works progress. Therefore, an experienced consulting firm,
well acquainted with similar conditions (weak rock, large tunnel excavation,
deep open cut excavation and large earthfill dam, slurry trenches, grouting)
would be retained to assist DSI and would be fully responsible to DSI for the
supervision of these works. Because of the complexity of the work an inde-
pendent Group of Specialists would be required to review progress on the most
critical works. Proposed terms of reference for the consulting firm are
summarized hereunder:
(a) contractor prequalification evaluation;
(b) preparation of additional or modified designs such as
raised cofferdam to elevation 129, bottom outlet in
the auxiliary diversion tunnel, modification of surge
tank and drainage galleries on both banks, lengthening
the diversion tunnels, etc;
(c)  study of potential slides upstream of the dam;
(d) revision of some parts of the technical specifications,
chiefly concerning the fill materials and grouting
specifications;
(e) comparison of alternative use of borrow areas for the
dam core and shell materials;
(f) assist in preparation and review of tender documents;
(g) evaluation of bids and preparation of contract documents;
(h) supervision of additional test embankments (for core
material) to be done before the river closure;
(i) review of general working drawings, design loads
anti criteria, taking into consideration the actual
conditions met during construction, assuming the detailed
working drawings will be prepared by the contractor and
supervised by the consulting engineer;
(i) supervision of ali works and laboratories, slurry trenches,
excavation, tunnels, earthfill and concrete, grouting
and drainage;
(k)  supervising and approving contractor's schedules;



ANNEX 6
Page 4
(1) assistance in preparation of withdrawal applications;
(m)  studying and recommending the reservoir and spillway
operating rules for flood control, irrigation and power
generation;
(n) studying and interpreting all instrumentation data during
the first filling and drawdown and issuing instrumentation
observation rules; and
(o) preparation of draft quarterly and annual progress reports.
9.        Group of Specialists:  The membership of the independent Group of
Specialists should be: one engineering geologist, one tunnel and rock
mechanics consultant (weak rock), one soil mechanics, earthfill consultant
(foundation of the dam, core material of weathered flysch, earthquake
resistant design of earthfill dams, deep cut slope stability, rebound of
ground cut after excavation), and one slurry trench, grouting and drainage
expert. The Group of Specialists would be employed to advise as needed on
special problems which might develop during the design and construction
of the dam.
10.       Staff:  The staff on site would consist of at least 834 man-months
of DSI personnel assisted by about 310 man-months of consulting staff. The
DSI Regional Director would be responsible for construction assisted by a
Deputy working equally on the dam and irrigation and drainage systems. A
Chief Engineer, with Assistant, would be resident on site throughout con-
struction assisted as required by at least two design, three field construc-
tion and one each mechanical, electrical, mapring and laboratory engineers
as well as a geologist. Technicians, sub-professional and non-professional
DSI staff would be supplied as required.
11.       The consulting staff would comprise of an experienced senior proj-
ect engineer, who would be employed full time once construction commenced
and 3-4 senior engineers as required (see para 15).
12.       The consulting firm's cost, including the Group of Specialists,
is estimated at US$2.0 million, of which US$1.4 million would be foreign
exchange. The consulting firm should be appointed at least four months
before bids are issued for the Aslantas dam construction and employed
for the whole construction period.
13.       On-farm Development:  One experienced senior specialist would be
necessary on equipment operation, for a three year period from early 1974
on the assumption that equipment will be received in time to commence work
in the 1974 season. The estimated cost would be US$0.3 million,- of which
US$0.1 million would be foreign exchange.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
14.       Extension Services:  Two experienced senior specialists would be
necessary for a total of 11 man-years commencing in 1975. The estimated
cost would be US$0.8 million of which US$0.5 million would be foreign
exchange.

TURKEY
CEYHAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Land and Property Acquisition
1.        The lands to be flooded by the Aslantas reservoir and those to
be occupied by other project works would be requisitioned by Government and
adequate comDensation would be paid for the land and immovable assets such
as houses and plantations that would be submerged. However, in accordance
with the relevant law, no resettlement costs can be paid to the some 1,000
displaced families who would be able to purchase land elsewhere with the
compensation received.
2.        The possibility of a resettlement scheme for these families was
discussed with the Government. It pointed out that the compensation paid
to displaced families was sufficient to establish themselves elsewhere and
in previous acquisitions for a similar purpose, no resettlement scheme was
provided. An exception in this case was, therefore, not possible.
3.        The land liable to maximum probable flooding is estimated at
4,077 ha. Between 1975 and 1979, only 2,000 ha would be flooded. In a
hundred-year frequency flood, inundated areas would be 3,600 ha and for
normal lake use about 3,000 ha. Consequently, in 99 out of 100 years,
about 600 ha would be available for cultivation, besides some additional
areas between June and November when the dam level would be low.
Reservoir
4.        It is assumed that 3,600 ha, which are liable to flooding (100-
year frequency) would be acquired at TL 24,900 per ha. This price has
been derived from the customary legal formula used in Turkey, which is
14 times the net production (with family labor costed at prevailing wages)
of the area. It takes into account different soil classes. The compensa-
tion paid would total TL 90.0 million.
5.        The value of houses, plantations, and property liable to inunda-
tion with maximum probable flood is estimated at TL 7.0 million. Only 10%
of it has been assumed to be salvageable. The amount to be paid will thus
be TL 6.3 million.

CEYHAN ASLANTAS MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Aslantas Power and the TEK Development Program
The TEK Development Program
1.        TEK's forecasts of generation requirements for Turkey (expressed
in GWh) are based upon past trends and an econometric model of electricity
consumption. The current forecasts (Table 1) project an average rate of
growth of about 12.5% per annum over the period 1972-1987 compared with a
historical trend growth rate of 12% per annum. From 1980 (the year in
which the Aslantas project would be commissioned) to 1982, the projected
growth rate is 11.5% per annum falling to 11% per annum in the last five
years. The forecast of peak demand shown in the same table assumes a
long-term load factor of about 63.4%, which is reasonable in the light of
past trends, the beneficial effects of increased interconnection and the
anticipated effect of the proposed aluminum smelter at Seydesihir.
2.        The TEK development program (Table 2) includes Aslantas with its
original commissioning date of 1978. The program was chosen on the basis of
least-cost studies and is designed to meet TEK's estimates of peak and
energy demand, subject to certain reserve criteria. The criteria state
that the reserve of installed power must be at least equal to the sum of the
capacities of the two biggest units while the planned annual firm energy I/
must be at least equal to 98% of the expected demand for energy. System
capability (calculated from the selected development program in Table 2)
appears in Table 1. The high proportion of hydropower in Turkey makes the
requirement for firm energy more important as a constraint than the
requirement for power capacity.
3.        The Bank mission has examined the economics of the Aslantas power
project in the light of the latest project cost estimates and the mission's
estimate that Aslantas power would not be available before late 1980. Two
independent forecasts of demand have also been made by the mission, using
econometric methods.
Load Forecasts
4.        The first Bank load forecast estimated total electricity demand
directly via a relation with aggregate Gross Domestic Product. In the
second method, the main components of electricity demand were analyzed
1/   Defined as the minimuri energy availacble  iith an 8 in 9 probability.



ANNEX 11

separately, and the estimate of total demand was built up from these
individual components. The following equations were found to be most
likely to give reasonable predictions:
(a)  Log (Total Electricity Consumption in GWh) = 1.679 Log
(GDP at constant 1965 prices and in TL millions) - 4.5629.
Correlation coefficient 0.997.
(b)  Log (Industrial Electricity Consumption in GWh) = 1.082 Log
(Industrial output at constant 1965 prices and in TL
millions) - 1.0325. Correlation coefficient 0.995.
(c) Log (Domestic and Commercial Electricity Consumption
in GWh) = 3.986 Log (Total population in thousands)   1.5037.
Correlation coefficient 0.988.
While per capita national income may be expected on theoretical grounds to
affect Domestic and Commercial Electricity consumption, it was found that
its inclusion in equation (c) had little effect on the results.
5.        Projected annual growth rates of the independent variables were
based upon the Third Plan (1973-77) and the findings of a recent Bank
Economic mission.  Consumption by Government offices, street lightning
and traction is only a small percentage of total consumption (see para 2.06)
so these classes were aggregated and it was assumed that the group would
maintain the average growth rate which it recorded over the period 1962-71.
Forecasts of generation requirements for Turkey as a whole corresponding to
the two independent consumption forecasts were found by allowing 20% for
all network losses, and station and auxiliary use, and making separate
provision for the requirements of the Seydesihir aluminum smelter. The TEK
forecast of generation requirements falls roughly halfway between the two
Bank forecasts with a band of about 5% on either side and appears reasonable
given present knowledge.
Comparison of Aslantas with an Alternative Thermal Development
6.        It is clear from Table 1 that the Aslantas project is small
relative to Turkey's power and energy requirements, contributing less
than 2% to the latter in its first full year and less than 1% by 1987.
Nevertheless, it would operate as part of the interconnected system and the
mission examined it accordingly. TEK's development program was amended to
take into account the mission's view that Aslantas power would not be
available before late 1980 and computer simulation studies were carried out
on the interconnected system to estimate total system costs year by year.
The capital and operating costs of Aslantas power, installed as part of
a multipurpose scheme, were derived on an incremental basis as the dif-
ference in the cost of the proposed multipurpose scheme and the cost of
an alternative irrigation-only project (see para 5, Annex 15).  It was
concluded that if the Aslantas project excluded the power component, the
best way of providing equivalent energy would be to advance the timing of



ANNEX 11
Page 3
the planned thermal units in TEK's development program, keeping the same
standard of system reserves. System costs for this alternative program
were computed, again on an annual basis.  Present values of the capital and
operating costs for both programs were found for a range of discount rates
and the program including Aslantas was more economic for discount rates
up to 16% (the equalizing discount rate).
7.        The preceding approach has the difficulty that the cost
advantage of Aslantas power is a relatively small difference between two
large numbers. Another approach, used by the Consultants, assumes that the
alternative to Aslantas would be a specific thermal plant. The approach
is computationally easier but less satisfactory in principle because it
ignores the operation of Aslantas within the interconnected system and
tends to overestimate the operating cost savings attributable to the project.
Sensitivity Tests
8.        The results of the computer simulation studies were subjected to
a variety of sensitivity tests. The mission found evidence that the lignite
fuel costs per kWh assumed in the study may be on the conservative side and
may underestimate the true marginal cost of lignite production.  Capital
costs for lignite plant are also, if anything, on the low side.  Nuclear
capital and fuel costs quoted in the recent International Conference for
the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy (September 1971) are higher than
those assumed in the study. If allowed for, these factors would improve the
economic case for the Aslantas power project. In the sensitivity tests,
lignite fuel and capital costs were raised by 50% and 20% respectively.
Nuclear fuel and capital costs were raised by the same percentages. The
maximum effect (attributable to the 20% increase in lignite capital costs)
was to increase the equalizing discount rate by 6 percentage points, although
in all other cases the rate rose by less than 3 points. Capital and fuel
costs for oil-fired plant assumed in the study were varied by + 10%, and
the equalizing discount rate altered by less than 2 points in all cases. The
economic justification of the Aslantas power project is more sensitive to
changes in the capital cost of the project itself. The effects of possible
inaccuracies in the project cost estimates were tested by considering
variations of + 10%. A 10% increase in Aslantas capital costs reduces
the equalizing discount rate to 12%. In the other direction, reducing the
capital cost estimate by 10% increases the equalizing discount rate to 25%.
9.        The small size of the Aslantas power project and its likely
position in the merit order combine to make the equalizing discount rate
insensitive to changes in demand and plant mix.  A 10% increase or reduction
in demand would raise or lower the equalizing discount rate by about one
percentage point. The most likely changes in TEK's plant mix which can be
foreseen at the present time would leave the economic case for Aslantas
unaltered or even improve it slightly.

Monthly Studies
10.       In view of the uneven distribution of monthly output from the
Aslantas power project (para 5.03), the mission considered it necessary to
develop a monthly operational study of the TEK system. As in the case of
the annual studies, this was done in Turkey with the assistance of EIE
(The Electric Studies Institute). The results indicated that the annual
studies overestimated the operating cost savings of Aslantas due to the
fact that Aslantas output is relatively high when the system is using at
the margin relatively low-cost thermal energy, and relatively low when
the output of other hydro plants is low. Nevertheless, the equalizing
discount rate is unlikely to fall below 13%. Also, several unquantifiable
factors will tend to increase the available output of Aslantas. These
factors include possible future upstream developments (Kiziltas, Berke)
which would regulate the inflow and increase the firm energy, the likelihood
of being able to utilize a portion of the flood storage by retaining part
of the last seasonal flood thus increasing the water available for summer
release, and some overall increase in flow which would result from mine
pumping in connection with the proposed Elbistan lignite project.

E   At 10/ per year for 6 months.
Water charge without project varies for crops and area locations.  We have assumed that one-fourth of each farm is
currently irrigated and the level of' vater charge is TL 500 per irrigated hectare irrespective of crops. The combined
land and water charge under with project situation is taken as TL 1,250 per hectare. This level of land and water
charge is derived from a Consultant study made for Turkey which recommended TL 750 per hectare in 1970 value of dollar.
L Land tax at Dresent is 0.3' of the value of land.  We have asnumed TL 24,000 per hectare as the value of land which
price has also been used for payment of compensation for land to be acquired for project use.
/7  Income tax calculated on the basis of sliding scale according to law.
Family size being 7.2 persons.

Outlook for Cotton Export -
1.        World cotton prices are expected to decline from recent high
levels by the mid-seventies and perhaps by another 5% by the late seventies.
In terms of Mexican SM 1-1/16", a representative grade of medium-long
cotton which normally accounts for more than 60% of total world cotton
output, this means a price of around 26 cents per pound, c.i.f. Liverpool,
in 1970 U.S. dollars, by about 1975 and a price in the neighborhood of 25
cents per pound by 1980. Actual prices for cotton in 1975 and 1980 are
expected to differ only slightly from forecast cotton prices expressed
in 1970 U.S. dollars. Inflation in developed countries in recent years
seems to have had little effect on unit costs of cotton production in
developing producing countries. Analysis of costs of production developments
in key developing cotton producing countries indicates that these costs
(and the supply price) should increase over the next ten years at a much
slower rate than the price level in developed countries.  On this basis the
actual price of Mexican 1-1/16" is forecast to be around 28 U.S. cents
per pound by 1975 and around 29 U.S. cents per pound by 1980.
2.        The expected downward trend in price over the medium-term
reflects a number of assumptions: (a) that the current high prices are
temporary and reflect a demand-supply imbalance caused largely by a
temporary supply shortage; (b) that in the absence of a decline in prices
production will tend again to outpace consumption in the mid-seventies 2/;
(c) that inter-fiber competition will continue to limit the growth of
cotton consumption but that no major breakthrough in man-made fiber
technology will greatly accelerate recent substitution trends; and (d) that
price adjustments will take place within the framework of a relatively
freer, more competitive market. This in turn implies continued competition
among some sixty exporting countries (many of them heavily dependent on
cotton exports); absence, in future U.S. price support and cotton export
policies, of the elements which made that country a residual supplier in
the world market and led to recurring stock accumulation in the United
States; and, finally, no international cotton agreement.
I/   Prepared by Economics Department.
2/   Avtailable information on government plans or intentions (as supplied to
the International Cotton Advisory Comm.ittee in June 1971) indicate
that worl1 cotton production could execed demand in the mid-seventies
by some 5 to 7%.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
3.        The future growth of cotton production depends not only on the
natural supply response to change in price but also - and quite crucially -
on the cotton policies of the major producers. The United States and the
USSR account together for almost 39% of world cotton production. Their _
production policies necessarily influence the growth path of world cotton
supply.  In our supply projections, we have assumed a "normalization" of
U.S. cotton output by 1975, to about 13 million bales (in line with U.S.
stated intentions and current policies) and total output of about 11 million
bales in the Soviet Union (again in line with its expansion plans). The
combined output share of the two countries would therefore remain the same
as during the past five seasons. Should the U.S. cotton output remain
around the 10-11 million bales of the past three seasons and the USSR
output stabilize at 10 million bales, the 1975 projected surplus situation
would turn, other things being equal, into one of rough demand-supply
equilibrium and lead to actual prices 5% higher than those forecast in
paragraph 1.
4.        Demand uncertainties, however, call for a certain degree of prudence
in forecasting cotton prices. World cotton consumption is projected to
grow at an average annual rate of 1.6% during the next ten years. Even
this modest growth rate of cotton consumption presupposes some further
improvement in the quality composition of cotton and progress in promotional
activity and, furthermore, that no new breakthrough in the production of
man-made fibers would occur and lead to a faster substitution of cotton
with man-made (especially synthetic) fibers.  Cotton consumption did in
fact slow down considerably in the late sixties and grew at a very modest
average annual rate of 0.8% between 1966/67 and 1970/71, see Table 1. This
compares with the average annual growth of 2.2% of the preceding 11 years.
The declining trend in cotton utilization in developed countries since the
mid-sixties largely due to greater competition from man-made (especially
noncellulosic) fibers, was less than fully compensated for by increased
consumption in developing and centrally planned countries. Competition
from synthetic substitutes, although particularly strong in industrialized
countries, is by no means restricted to these markets. In Central
America, South America and South Asia synthetic fibers have already penetrated
the market and further inroads are expected during the next decade. During
the past ten years, while cotton's share of world total fiber market fell
from nearly 66 to 44%, the market share of man-made fibers increased
from 29 to 50%.
5.        Inter-fiber competition hinges upon two main factors:  relative
prices and quality performance.  Prices of man-made fibers (especially
polyester fibers) declined considerably in the past five years thereby
moving price parities in favor of man-made fibers. Recent high cotton
prices, moreover, are likely to accelerate the trend in substitution of
cotton with polyester fibers, particularly in developed countries. The
quality or product performance of man-made fibers is superior to cotton in
some crucial end-uses (e.g. apparel) where cotton lacks the "easy-care"
properties characteristic of synthetic fibers (alone or blended with cotton).
Although further sharp declines in the prices of the most important non-
cellulosi°c fibers do not appear very likely in the short run, the possibility W

of increased competition from these fibers still remains quite strong,
given the technical advantages that man-made fibers have in new high-speed
knitting machines. This could seriously affect cotton demand and slow down
its annual growth to a very modest 1% over the next ten years.
6.        At projected equilibrium levels of demand, supply and price for
the mid-seventies, world raw cotton exports would experience a growth rate
of around 1.2% per annum between 1967-1969 and 1975, although developing
countries' exports may grow at a higher rate (between 1.5 and 2.0% per
annum). Assuming that world cotton prices move in the late seventies toward
long-term equilibrium levels, world raw cotton exports may continue to grow
throughout the late seventies at approximately the same rate envisaged for
the earlier period. Export shares, however, become more difficult to
predict, given their dependence on possible future policy actions by major
producing and exporting countries such as the United States and the USSR.
7.        The export performance and prospects of individual developing
countries will continue to vary depending, inter alia, on availability of
land, trends in yields, quality and marketability of cotton grown, domestic
consumption trends and cotton textiles trade balances. Competition among
producing countries is expected to continue and small producing countries
with limited production alternatives are likely to push output and succeed
in expanding their small shares.  The world market growth, however, is
expected to be a slow one throughout the seventies.  Competing man-made
fibers will continue to exert pressure on cotton and to limit its growth.
The balance between advancements in cotton agronomy and man-made fiber
technology, although difficult to predict, is likely to remain tilted in
favor of competing man-made fibers.

CEYHIAIi ASLANTAS HULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Rate of Return Calculations and Sensitivity Analysis
Justification of the IWhole Project
1.        The method used to evaluate the Ceyhan Aslantas Project was to
estimate its annual costs and benefits over a 50-year period. Wlen
discounting project costs and benefits over this period, the economic
return of the wlhole project is estimated at 13.4%. The benefits of each
component were evaluated as under.
Power Benefits
2.        Besides contributing towards meeting an increase in system
requirements for electricity, the Aslantas power plant would make a saving
in the total system fuel costs in that it would enable existing thermal
plants to operate fewer hours in the year.  The calculation of the power
benefits was carried out on a "with and without" (as distinct from a
'before and after") basis.  lit the case of Aslantas, the "with and without"
approach is estimated to give savings in system fuel costs of TL 8.1 million
in 1980, TL 32.3 million in 1981 (the first full year of operation) and
TL 19.4 million in 1982. Aslantas would also meet increases in system
requirements for electrical energy worth (at the present average price
per kWh sold) TL 66.5 million in 1982 and each subsequent year 1/.
Agricultural Benefits
3.        The data and assumptions used in computing benefits were as
follows:
(a) Irrigation Development - Some parts of the project area
would be irrigated by diverting run of the river flow
from the Ceyhan river through the existing Cevdetiye weir
prior to completion of the Aslantas dam; the entire area
would be irrigated in 1981. The annual rate of irrigation
and cropping development would be as follows:
1/   Aslantas' contribution to the system in 1981 is entirely savings in
system fuel costs due to the temporary effect of large tihermal plants
installed in that year.

(b)  Prices  -  Prices used for calculating economic benefits
for the seven main crops, namely: cotton, wheat, ground-
nuts, rice, feedgrains, citrus and tomatoes were related
to international prices as forecast by the Economics
Department and adjusted to farngate prices by taking into
account the handling and transport costs. Prices for
other crops are the average of those wihich have been
prevailing in the domestic market during the post-devalua-
tion period. The prices used were as under:
Domestic Prices       Economic Prices
1971-72       1975-79      1980-2022

Domestic prices were used for financial analysis.
(c)  Production Costs  -  Farm production costs are based on
1972 price levels and are unchanged for thLe project life.
For economic analysis, as far as practical, taxes and
subsidies were excluded.  Family labor was costed at zero
and unskilled labor was shadow-priced at TL 6 per day
notionally of eight hours.  i4achiuie operators and other
skilled labor during cornstruction and after was costed at
full wage. For financial analysis, however, taxes an("
subsidies were included and both family and hired labor
was costed at the going wage of TL 20 per day.

(d)  Net Value of Production  -  Net value of production under
without the project conditions was projected to increase
by 10% at 1%,' per year from 1973 to 1982 when all the project
lands would be irrigated. This rate of growth without the
project is regarded as liberal for the following reasons:
(i)  all lands are cultivated and, therefore, increase in
area is not possiole;
(ii) irrigation is insufficient for the present areas
and there is limited possibility of tapping
additional groundwater; and
(iii)  current base is high for cropping intensity and yields.
Witin the project, the incremental benefits would start
accruing in 1974 and full development reached by 1985.
Following the introduction of irrigation, benefits were
assumed to increase in a five-year period at the rate of
about 25% per year for the,first two years followed by 20%
per year during the next two years and 10% in the final year.
(e)  Other Adjustments:
(i)  land acquisition cost totaling TL 246.3 million were
excluded from the cost stream because the value of
production foregone was taken into account;
(ii) the net value of production under the without project
condition was adjusted as under:
-    TL 2.6 million was deducted from 1973 to 2022
per year to account for flood losses;
-    TL 5.0 million was deducted from 1980 to 2022
per year to account for the production of areas
to be lost due to irrigation extension under
without project situation; and
T'L 5.3 million was added also from 1980 to 2022
per year to account for the production foregone
in the reservoir.
(f) Net Benefits - The incremental net value of production on
the above listed assumptions on full development in 1985
would be as follows:

Ratw of Return of Ceyhan Aslantas Project - Sensitivity Analysis
4.        The costs and benefits of the Ceyhan Aslantas Project are shown
in Table 2 which yield the economic return of 13.4%. The sensitivity of the
rate of return to various alternative assumptions are estimated with the
following results:
Assumptions                           Rate of Return
(a)  Project construction costs decreased
by 10%                                            13.89
(b)  Project construction costs increased
by 10%                                            11.75
(c)  Value of agricultural products increased
by 10%                                            13.68
(d)  Value of agricultural products decreased
by 10%                                            11.75
(e)  Farmgate price of cotton (key crop)
decreased by 20%                                  11.07
(f)  Dam completion delayed by 2 years                   12.00
(g)  Development period extended from 5 to 7 years    11.71
(h)  Hired labor costed at market price                  11.74
(i)  (e) and (g) combined together                       10.49

Incremental Rates of Return for Individual Components
5.        A multipurpose project may show an acceptable overall internal
economic rate of return even though it may contain one or more components
that would not be justified if their benefits were to be compared with their
incremental costs to the project. In the present instance, it is necessary
to determine whether, from an economic point of view, it would be preferable
to build a project for power only or for irrigation only rather than for
power plus irrigation as in the proposed project 1/. A single purpose
hydroelectric scheme at Aslantas would not be justified compared with
alternative means of producing equivalent energy. An alternative single-
purpose irrigation scheme (i.e. producing equivalent irrigation benefits)
would consist of a 154-m dam as opposed to a 160--m dam. There would be
irrigation and drainage networks, spillway and dykes, extenision service
and other services. The economic return on such a project is estimated at
13%. The combination of power plus irrigation with a rate of return of 13.4%,
however  is preferable to a project involving irrigation only because the
economic rate of return on the incremental costs of the power component is
15.7% 2/ and Aslantas is also the least-cost way of providing this power
(see Annex 11).
1/   Irrigation includes flood control.  By distilnguishing flood control as
an independent purpose, it would in theory be possible to introduce
otiher alternatives. In practice, the irrigation benefits are not
obtainable without flood control (see Annex 5). Similarly, the
benefits of a project based solely on flood control would not justify
the necessary expenditures on associated structures.
2/   This is the discount rate which equates the present value of the power
benefits and fuel cost savings shown in column 9 of Table 2 with the
present value of the difference in costs between the multipurpose
scheme and the single-purpose irrigation scheme, shown in column 2.
The costs are attributable to the extra dam height required to generate
power (160 m as against 154 m), the civil works serving exclusively
power, hydroelectric plants, power intake, steel liners, surge tank,
branch tunnel, transmission line and associated expenses.
