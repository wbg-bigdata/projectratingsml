REPORT AND RECOMMIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO
TURKEY FOR A MULTIPURPOSE IRRIGATION AND POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for the equivalent of US$30 million and on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$44 million to Turkey to help finance a multi-
purpose irrigation and power project. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms, and the loan would have a term of 30 years including 9 years of grace
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Developments and Prospects of
Turkey" dated September 18, 1972 was distributed to the Executive Directors
on October 25, 1972 (R72-236). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a long period of stability, internal political tensions
have appeared in the last two years. Student disturbances and unrest among
workers occurred in 1970 and early 1971, and the armed forces called in March
1971 for the resignation of the Demirel cabinet and for the implementation
of the land, tax, educational, administrative and other reforms prescribed by
the 1961 Constitution. An "above-party and reformist" government was formed
under Prime Minister Erim, and martial law was introduced. In its eight
months in office, the Government largely re-established law and order, and
introduced some administrative changes. It also raised prices charged by
several State Economic Enterprises and presented several reform bills to
Parliament. However, it was not able to translate its long-range economic
policies into detailed measures and decrees. Growing opposition from
Parliament to some of the administrative changes and reform proposals brought
about the resignation of a large group of ministers in December 1971, and a
new coalition government, headed again by Prime Minister Erim, was then formed.
The second Erim government had greater political party representation, but
its attempt to push through modified reform measures again met with opposition
in Parliament. A mining reform bill and a moderate land reform bill were
introduced in Parliament, but little was done to further educational reform
or to reorganize the State Economic Enterprises. Prime Minister Erim resigned
in mid-April after his request for "government by decree", intended to speed
up the process of reforms, was turned down by the political parties. A new
government drawn from three parties and non-parliamentarians and headed by
Prime Minister Melen was formed in May 1972. It declared its aim to pursue
the reform measures and prepare for national elections in the fall of 1973.



4.         While long-term economic policy issues lkave recently become a
cause of political tensions, growth in Gross N\ational Product in the last
decade has been high and continuous, averaging about 6.8 percent per year
in the period 1962-1971. In the same period, gross investment increased
substantially, with its share in GNP rising from 15 to 21 percent. Although
total consumption increased considerably, gross niational savings increased
at a mucli faster rate, their share in GNT rising from 11 to 20 percent.
Hlowever, in the last two years (1970 and 1971), in spite of a big jump in
workers' remittances, the share of gross national savings has not risen
substantailly due to relatively poor public savings, and the share of invest-
ment also increased more slowly.
5.        The main growth sectors in the last decade have been industry, power
and construction. This reflected the development strategy during the first
and second five-year plans (1962-67, 1968-72), which gave highest priority
to industrialization. Industrial output grew by about 10 percent per annum
with textiles, machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals providing the main
impetus.   But this rapid growth, mainly to meet domestic demand and replace
imports, was insulated from foreign competition. Other rapidly growing sectors
were transport, trade and financial services. The impact of large investments
in agriculture was slow, however, and agricultural production had a trend
growth rate of about 3 percent per annum, with large fluctuations from year to
year depending on weather conditions.    As a result of the relative growth rates,
the shares of industry and trade in GDP rose to 23 and 10 percent respectively,
and that of agriculture dropped to 27 percent. In 1971 CNP increased by 9 per-
cent in real terms, thanks largely to an excellent harvest, a continued indus-
trial growth and a sharp rise in em4grant worker remittances, and output in
1972 may also have been above average.
6.        The balance of payments situation was c:haracterized in 1967-70 by
increasing trade deficits, ancl a strict system of import controls leading to
delays and shortages of essential imports and, zonsequently, to underutiliza-
tion of production capacity.    hle overvalued official exchange rate was changed
in August 1970 (from TL 9 to TL 15 per US$) and revised to TL 14 in December
1971. This, together with associated stabilization measures and a rapid rise
in workers' remittances helped to improve the situation dramatically. Workers'
remittances increased sharply, from about $140 million in 1969 to $470 million
in 1971. Commodity exports and tourism receipts also increased markedly.
These improvements have led to better availability of essential imports
of investment goods, raw materials and parts, and to rebuilding of stocks.
Thie improvement in the balance of payments has continued in 1972; in the first
eleven montlhs, exports were 39 percent higher than in the corresponding period
in 1971 due primarily to increased exports of tobacco, cotton, fruits and
vegetables, textiles, food and beverages, hides and leather produlcts and
petroleum products; imports were about 28 percent higher; and workers' remit-
tances had already reached $610 million by the end of October, compared with
$470 million during the whole of 1971.    The overall result has been a sub-
stantial rise in gross foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $1,341 million
at the end of November 1972. Net foreign assets, which were negative in 1966-
68, rose to over $500 million, the equivalent of about five months' imports.
The growth of foreign exchange reserves is unlikely to continue at the same
rate however particularly as short term debts are repaid and if intport liberali-
zation proceeds further.

7.        The budgetary situation has been dominated in the last decade by the
need to control the rapid growth of public expenditures. Tax revenues have
grown faster than GNP, their share rising from 12.9 percent in 1962 to 17.6
percent of GNP in 1971, but the increases in tax revenues have been more than
offset by the rise in current expenditures and transfers. The overall budget
deficit has grown since 1968 and was particularly large in 1971 when the full
impact on current expenditures of public salary increases under the 1970
Personnel Reform Law was felt. The Treasury had to have growing recourse to
the Central Bank for short-term advances and to other short-term borrowingX
The difficulties facing public mobilization of resources led to public invest-
ment expenditures falling short of targets, and to an actual decline in putlic
fixed investment in real terms in 1971.   The pressure on public resources tas
continued in 1972, and the growth of public development expenditure has
probably suffered as a result.
8.        The financial results of the State Economic Enterprises (SEE's)
have been consistently poor. Although the SEE's now account for over 10
percent of the value added and about 20 percent of the fixed investment in
the economy, the rate of return on investment in the 28 major producing SEE's
as a whole has been less than 3 percent in the last few years. The low
profits of the SEE's have necessitated increasing budgetary transfers, which
amounted to TL 3.5 billion in 1971. The profitability varies among different
SEE's, with railways and the Coal Corporation incurring heavy losses.
9.        In the period 1967-70, while available resources increased, a more
rapid growth of expenditures led to inflationary pressures in the economy,
resulting in an average increase in wholesale prices of about 6 percent per
annum. Inflationary pressure became particularly strong in 1971 when whole-
sale prices rose 16 percent and cost of living by 20 percent. The pressures
came mainly from the demand side due to substantial increases in public
salaries and industrial wages, higher remittances from abroad and larger
agricultural incomes in a year of record output.    At the same time controlled
prices of public industrial enterprises and support prices of major agricul-
tural products were also raised, and prices of imported goods increased sharp-
ly as a result of both devaluation and the rise in world export prices. The
pressure on prices has continued in 1972, fueled by a continiued rise in
receipts from remittances and exports, as well as by the resumed growth of
investment, both private and public. Wholasale prices rose by 13 percent
in the first eleven months of 1972. In these circumstances, better mobiliza-
tion of resources by the public sector, a balance between the claims of the
public and private sectors on investment funds, further liberalization of
imports and avoidance of short term borrowing by the Treasury from the Central
Bank are needed, among other measures, to contain the inflationary pressure.
10.       For the longer term, the continued political uncertainties have
meant that the planned reforms, e.g. administrative, tax, educational and
land reforms, and reorganization of SEE's have on the whole not progressed
very far. In July 1972, a "preliminary measures law" for land reform was
passed which provided for preparatory measures, but the land reform bill has



- 4 -
yet to be passed by Parliament.   Administrative reform of the SEE's and
upgrading their executive and labor skills have still to be achieved. This
is particularly important to prepare Turkish industry for competition that
will arise from association with the EEC.    In agriculture, although sub-
stantial irrigation investments have been made in the past and the government
rightly gives high priority to completing on-going projects, several long-term
problems remain. The Anatolian plateau and the eastern part of Turkey are
considerably less developed than the coastal regions and land tenure problems
are serious in some regions. Surplus stocks of tobacco, tea and hazelnuts
have accumulated and there is need to modify price support and other policies
to divert resources from those surplus crops for which Turkey has no comparative
advantage and is facing difficulties in expanding it's traditional exports.
Some progress has already been iade in shifting land from sugarbeet to sun-
flower, feedgrains and other crops.
11.       The employment situation is also a matter of growing concern.
Despite rapid industrialization and with the leveling off in agricultural
employment, Turkey has not been able to absorb the increasing labor supply in
the last decade. The labor force grew by about 420,000 a year between 1965
and 1970, of whom about 57,000 emigrated and 240,000 found employment on the
domestic market, mostly in services and industry, leaving about 124,000 more
unemployed each year. In the medium term, labor supply is expected to con-
tinue growing by about 2.8 percent per year while demand outside agriculture
is projected to about half the increase oGny. Speedy implementation of land
reform would help to reduce the migration from rural to urban areas. In
addition, labor-intensive projects need special emphasis in the choice of
industrial projects. However, even with continued emigration, urban unemploy-
ment is likely to grow.
12.       The problem of domestic resource mobilization by the public sector
will remain a major constraint and will restrain the real growth of public
investment in the Third Plan period (1973-77), especially if the savings
strategy continues to be heavily dependent on public savings. The draft
Third Plan targets imply excessively high marginal savings rates. If sub-
stantial increases in public savings are to be realized, then planned changes
in the tax structure should be implemented at an early stage and the failure
of State Economic Enterprises to generate sufficient surpluses should be a
major concern of economic policy. In addition, it is essential to develop
a capital market in Turkey to supplement the existing sources of long-term
domestic borrowing. Proposals for a capital market bill are now being
considered.
13.       If the country remains politically stable and if the government
effectively carries out structural reforms in the areas mentioned above and
promotes exports, Turkey may be able to maintain or even exceed a growth
rate of 7 percent per annum. Turkey will continue to need substantial amounts
of external assistance to be able to maintain the high level of investment
which is needed to achieve this rate of growth, as well as meet its financial
obligations.



5-
14.       Total debt outstanding and disbuirsed was $2.2 billion at the end
of 1971, of which all but 2 percent is public or publicly guaranteed. The
average terms have been hardening in recent years and this trend is expected
to continue. Of the total gross official external assistance of about $400
million in 1971, the Consortium members provided about $300 million. Of this,
about $90 million came from the United States, $52 million from the European
Fund, $26 million from the European Investment Bank and $37 million from the
World Bank Group. The USSR disbursed $40 million. As a result of successive
debt reschedulings and arrangements for debt relief together with substantially
increased workers' remittances, the debt service ratio fell considerably after
1965, reaching 19.4 percent of exports of goods and non factor services and
12.9 percent of total foreign exchange earnings (including workers' remittances)
in 1971. However, since the improvements in the balance of payments have oc-
curred relatively recently and are based to a considerable extent on external
factors, Turkey should continue to seek a part of its external aid on conces-
sionary terms and continue for the time being its restraint in using suppliers'
credits.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
15.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficulties
before the 1970 stabilization program, and devaluation of the Turkish lira,
Bank lending was only intermittent.   Since then, the rapid improvement in the
balance of payments and in creditworthiness stimulated by these actions has
made possible a large increase and a new continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which
in FY 1971 and FY 1972 amounted to $114 million and $173.3 million respectively.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
16.       Bank Group lending since 1970 has generally been aimed at assisting
Turkey in the following broad development tasks: (a) the continued build-up
of creditworthiness; (b) the external orientation and liberalization of the
economy to improve external and domestic competitiveness; (c) improved orien-
tation of public investments with a view to ensuring the efficiency of invest-
ments and bringing about a better balance between growth and employment and
between the sectors and regions where development has reached a momentum of
its own and those where it is lagging and (d) institution-building in the
public sector and especially among SEE's, where resource mobilization should
and can be greatly improved.



- 6 -
17.       In the pursuit of these aims, a pattern of concentration in lending
is evolving along sector and to some extent along geographic lines. In two
sectors, agriculture and industry (including mining and development finance
companies), past and planned lending is on a large scale and fairly broad
in coverage of subsectors. In transportation, power and urban development,
substantial lending focused on a few projects, particularly SEE's, will be
continued or started. Geographical concentration has been designed to obtain
mutually reinforcing benefits in related sectors and institutions and to
support the objective of better rural-urban balance. Thus far, concentration
has occurred mainly in the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urbarn develop-
ment and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova region around Adana on the
southern coast, where the proposed multipurpose project would be located, with
emphasis on power, irrigation and fruit and vegetables. A start has recently
also been made on a complementary effort to provide rural inhabitants with an
alternative to urban migration by lending for labor intensive projects such
as the Second Livestock Credit which focuses on breeding, raising and fatten-
ing in Eastern and Central Turkey and by preparing, with the assistance of
the IBRD/FAO cooperative program, an integrated rural development project in
rainfed areas of Central Turkey.
18.       Several specific projects financed by the Bank Group in recent years
or presently under discussion may be mentioned to illustrate the effort to
support the objectives discussed above. For instance, emphasis was placed
on export-oriented sub-projects in the last two loans (713 and 873-TU) made
to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) which has made a start in
this direction, and in the loan and credit (762/257-TU) for the Fruit and
Vegetable Export Project. Other projects for which lending is contemplated
in coming years, especially for livestock, forestrv and irrigation, are expected
to enhance Turkey's ability to earn foreign exchange as well as spread develop-
ment in rural areas. On the other hand, attempts to assist the expansion of
tourism have not borne fruit, indicating some Government hesitation as to the
importance to be given to tourism in Turkey's development strategy; as a re-
sult tourism projects suitable for Bank consideration have not yet been put in
shape, although an IPC investment in the sector is likely to be presented soon
to the Executive Directors. The objective of institution building has been
pursued chiefly in agriculture (including agricultural credit), power and in
transportation where a loan for railways, currently under negotiation, is
expected to pave the way for substantial organizational and financial improve-
ments. In preparation of this, the Bank has already acted as executing agency
for UNDP technical assistance studies on transport coordination and on a rail-
way investment program. The Bank has furthermore been instrumental in bringing
about a comprehensive reorganization of the power sector culminating in the
establishment of the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) to which a loan
(763-TU) was made in 1971.
19.       Previous Bank/IDA lending in the agricultural sector totals $130.3
million equivalent and includes six credits and three loans. Repeater
operations at two or three year intervals in five sub-sectors form the heart
of the future lending program: in fruit and vegetables, aimed at exports; in
irrigation rehabilitation; in livestock and dairy, which support developmenlt



- 7 -
in Eastern Turkey; in agricultural credit; and in integrated rural develop-
ment which focuses on the problem of increasing output in the purely rainfed
areas of the country. Finally, it is expected that the Bank Group will con-
tinue to finance selectively large-scale irrigation projects in Turkey.
20.       Past credits and loans for power development amounts to $93.7 million
of which $44.7 million is for power facilities in the Adana Region where the
proposed project is located, and $49 million to assist the Turkish Electricity
Authority (T.E.K.) in financing other power projects in Turkey. Several new
projects are under active consideration by the Bank Group to continue providing
TEK with adequate power facilities in future years.
21.       A $40 million ninth loan (there has also been one IDA credit) to TSKB
for lending to private industry was approved by the Board on December 21, 1972.
In addition to the proposed Credit and Loan, two other Bank/IDA operations are
planned for FY 1973; a $47 million loan to help finance a project for the
financial rehabilitation and the technical and administrative modernisation
of the railways, and a loan of about $12 million for power development in
support of Istanbul urban development.
22.       IFC has been active in Turkey, -having participated in industrial
investments in nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum. Total commit-
ments so far amount to about $30 million. IFC is currently investigating new
investment opportunities in various sectors including special steel and
tourism.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN TLRKEY
23.       A detailed description of Turkey's agriculture sector is contained
in the report entitled "Current Economic Developments and Prospects of Turkey"
(EMA 53a) dated September 18, 1972.
24.       Agriculture is the dominant sector in the Turkish economy, provid-
ing some 60 percent of total employment and the bulk of foreign exchange
earnings. The growth trend in agricultural production (excluding forestry
and fisheries) averaged 3.1 percent during the last decade (1962-71). Favor-
able weather conditions, combined with the cumulative expansion of the area
under irrigation in recent years raised the average growth rate during the
first four years of the Second Development Plan (1968-72) to the target rate
of 4.2 percent, despite the fact that investment in agriculture actually
declined by 2.7 percent annually in these years. The Third Five-Year Plan
(1973-77), like the second, assigns lower pricrity to investment in agri-
culture relative to industry and transport. It is clear that in order to
absorb rising population in the rural areas and, more importantly, to check
the present drift of the rural underemployed to urban centers, which is
creating problems of its own, a concentrated effort is required not only
to increase the volume of investment in agriculture but also to bring about
necessary institutional and other reforms and a reallocation of resources
within the sector.



-8-
25.       Within the agriculture sector, resources are unevenly distributed
both from the geographical point of view and in social terms. The most rapid
development in agriculture to date may be seen in the climatically better
favoured coastal regions of southern and western Turkey which have responded
more readily to the introduction of a new technology, including new seed
varieties, credit and increased use of irrigation. Opportunities undoubtedly
exist in the less favoured areas, particularly in Eastern Turkey and parts of
the Anatolian plateau, for increasing wheat yields and livestock production,
for which there is an unsatisfied demand in Turkey.    Greater emphasis is
now being given to public investment and supporting services for dry-land
agriculture in the interior of the country, but the greatest potential for
increased production hinges on1 the expansion of irrigation in view of the
limitations imposed by uncertain rainfall and the lack of new cultivable
areas on which to expand.
26.       Present land ownership and tenure arrangements are one of the
barriers to innovation and to raising agricultural productivity. Although
there is wide discrepancy between different parts of the country and much
of the land is still unregistered, available statistics indicate that a
significant proportion of cultivable land is in large ownership units, es-
pecially in parts of Eastern Turkey where absentee ownership and sharecropping
are common and where land reform would thus be beneficial.    In contrast,
however, the larger units that exist in the Cukurova Region (see para 49) are
often operated on modern lines by innovative landlords where the division of
ownership may depress output in the short run although much would depend on
the smoothness of the transfer, the size of the new units and the availability
of credit, marketing and other supporting services. The Government has been
aware for many years of the unsatisfactory land tenure situation. Land
reform has been adopted as one of the main objectives of the present Gov-
ernment ancd is the subject of a Land Reform Bill submitted to Parliament
in April 1972.   In July 1972 a "Preliminary 'leasures Law" was passed pro-
viding for the creation of a secretariat of land reform, declaration by
land owners in provinces to be designated by the Council of Ministers of
their land holdings, and other preparatory measures. The Land Reform Bill
is still under discussion in Parliament and has been the subject of numerous
proposals for amendment; its speedy passage, leading to a imore equitable
distribution of wealth and incomes in rural areas, would stimulate private
investment on the part of farmers, who cannot at present afford land improve-
ments on more productive livestock and equipment, and thus accelerate growth
of output. Efforts at consolidation of fragmented land holdings, which is
also a problem in many areas, has been offset in the past by the inheritance
system. The Land Reform Bill is expected to remedy this situation and, when
passed, would enable land consolidation to proceed more rapidly in the future
in those areas where cadastral surveys have been completed.
27.       Other constraints on agricultural production in Turkey are largely
institutional. Turkey has comprehensive price support and control programs
that influence prices for most farm products including major agricultural
exports. Some of these are socially oriented and have led to the accumulation
of excessive stocks of certain products such as tobacco and tea. Such
controls should be readjusted wherever possible in order to stimulate the



- 9 -
production of alternative crops.   Exploitation of forests should be increas-
ed and made more effective through improved policies and management. Finally,
in view of insufficient supply of inputs in recent years, vigorous efforts
should be made to ensure adequate marketing and distribution facilities and
supplies of credit, seeds and fertilizer on time and where needed.
28.       Turkey has paid close attention in recent years to increasing the
volume of agricultural exports, a policy which has been supported by the
Bank Group through such projects as the Seyhan Irrigation Project and the
Fruit and Vegetable Export Project and to which the project under considera--
tion would make a substantial contribution.    The total volume of agricultuzal
exports reached $491 million in 1971, compared with $443 million in 1970
and $406 million in 1969 and 1968, representing about 15 percent of total
agricultural production, and zontinued to rise rapidly in 1972. Most of the
increase in 1971 was accounted for by higher prices for cotton but exports
of citrus and livestock also show marked increases. Measures to reduce
tariffs and quotas on Turkish exports to the EEC and the recent expansion
of ECC membership would further help to increase exports.
29.       Land use in Turkey (excluding forest areas, amounting to some 18.0
million ha, and waste land) is almost evenly divided between agricultural
land (27.0 million ha) and pasture land (26.0 million ha). About 13.5 mil-
lion ha of agricultural land is suitable for irrigation, of which it is
estimated that 8.1 million ha may be irrigated without using advanced levels
of technology, yet only 2.0 million ha are actually irrigated. The remaining
13.5 million ha of agricultural land is under dry land farming. Growth
trends in output during the past decade are highest for those crops that
have been brought under irrigation, where there has been an increase in
fertilizer use or a shift to higher value crops such as cotton, citrus and
vegetables. Yields per ha have not changed significantly in the last decade
for cereals and pulses (which cover 80 percent of the planted area) and seem
to have dropped in recent years for tobacco.    Yields bave increased over 50
percent for cotton and sugar beet however.
30.       Expansion of irrigation offers a major means of increasing agricultural
employment and production in Turkey.   An anbitious prograr of construction of
major dams and irrigation schemes has been carried out for many years.     This
has been undertaken efficiently but realization of the full benefits from
these schemes has-been prevented in the past by the relatively slow pace of
on-farm development and insufficient supporting services such as road construc-
tion and extension work. Coordination of these activities is a recurrent
problem in Turkey where a number of Ministries and Government Agencies are
involved in implementation. Bank Group investments in the irrigation sub-sector
have attempted to correct these shortcomings by bringing an integrated effort to
bear on the part of all Agencies concerned with development, and by providing
funds for rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes as well as for imple-
mentation of new schemes.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A dezailed description of the proposed project is given in the report
entitled "Ceyhan Aslantas 'Multipurpose Project" (No. 16a-TU) dated January 31, 1973
1973 which is being distributed separately. A Loan, Development Credit and
Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
32.       Project preparation was carried out by the Government with the
assistance of consultants and has been closely followed by the Bank Group
since its inception some ten years ago. The project was appraised in April/
May 1972. Negotiations were held in 1Washington in November and December 1972.
The Turkish delegation was headed by Mr. Akinci, Chief Financial and Economic
Counsellor, Turkish Embassy, Washington, D.C. and included representatives of
the Government Agencies which would be responsible for project implementa-
tion.
33.       The project is located on the Ceyhan Plain in the Cukurova Region
of Southern Turkey immediately east of the Seylian Irrigation Project financed
by the Bank Group under loans and credits miade available in 1952 (Ln.63),
1963 (Cr.38) and 1969 (Ln. and Cr.537/143) (see map).    Details on recent
experience on this project is given in Annex II. The main town in the project
area, Ceyhan,. is about 350 km. south-east of Ankara and 40 km east of the
provincial capital of Adana. The main features of the project consist of the
construction of the Aslantas dam and power plant (capable of generating
annually 500 GWh of electric energy), irrigation and drainage works for
97,000 ha, and flood protection for 35,000 ha of irrigable land. The project
has been designed so tllat irrigation can be expanded by a further 32,000
ha, subject to the completion of satisfactory feasibility studies in the
proposed extension areas.
34.       Additional features of the project include road improvements, pro-
vision of farmers credits, dairy cattle for farm demonstrations, buildings,
consultant services and training needs of the project. The project also
provides for the purchase of hydromechanical and electrical equipment for
the power plant and operation and maintenance equipment for irrigation,
drainage, and extension service.
35.       Project Administration.   The coordinated action of four Government
Agencies is required to construct the project:
(a)  DSI - State Hydraulic Works (an agency of the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources) would be responsible for con-
struction of the dam and power plant, flood protection works
and all irrigation and drainage works down to the farm unit.



- 11 -
(b) Topraksu - Soil Conservation Agency (an agency of the Ministry
of Village Affairs) would be responsible for carrying out all
on farm development works chiefly on the farm unit including
land levelling, installation of tile and surface drainage,
improvement of soil structure and construction of feeder roads
in the project area.
(c) Extension Service (under the Ministry of Agriculture) would be
responsible for advisory work among farmers. A separate ex-
tension service unit would be established whose staff would be
employed solely on project work, on the pattern of the Seyhan
Irrigation Project extension service which is working success-
fully. (See Annex II).
(d) ABT - Agricultural Bank of Turkey (an autonomous agency under
the Ministry of Commerce) would be responsible for providing
agricultural credit.
36.       In order to achieve coordination of these various activities during
project construction, the Turkish Government will be required to establish,
within six months of effectiveness of the Credit and Loan Agreements, a project
coordinating committee, on which the relevant Agencies would be represented,
and will appoint a chairman from among the members of the Committee. Coordina-
tion will also be facilitated during the critical period of project implemen-
tation by the work of the consultants to be appointed under the project (see
para 37). DSI would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of all
project works with the exception of the pewer plant. The Turkish Electricity
Authority would be responsible for the construction of power transmission
lines (not included in the project) and operation of the power plant. The
Aslantas dam would be operated as part of T.E..L's inter-connected system.
37.       Consultants.  Both Topraksu and the Extension Service will require
outside assistance in organizing their work on the project. The Government
has therefore agreed to the appointment of a consultant for a period of three
years to assist Topraksu in construction and improvement of heavy equipment
utilization, and of two consultants for the Extension Service for a total of
eleven man years to help consolidate extension services in the field.
38.       DSI has had considerable experience in contracting, operating and
maintaining irrigation and drainage projects and is considered capable of
processing the respective works on the project without outside assistance.
The construction of the dam and power plant, on the other hand, presents
several unique problems arising from the complex dam site geology with
attendant seismic and flood hazards which, coupled with the tight construction
schedule, make it necessary to engage consultant services. The Government
will engage an independent group of four specialists, acceptable to the Bank
and the Association, to advise as needed on special problems which might
develop during the design and construction period and will also appoint a
consulting firm, acceptable to the Bank and the Association, to assist DSI
with the supervision of construction for the dam and power plant. This
appointment would be a condition of effectiveness of the Credit and Loan
Agreements.

39.       Procurement.   Equipment, materials and vehicles for the project and
to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit and Loan would be procured
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Local manufacturers would
be allowed a preference of 15 percent in bid comparison or the import duties,
whichever is the lower. Certain items of equipment, materials and vehicles
($14 million), which can be manufactured locally, have been reserved for
local procurement under normal government bidding procedures and will be
financed entirely by the Government. Cost and quality comparison between
current local and foreign contracts for similar equipment indicate that this
arrangement should not involve any cost or other penalty for the project.
40.       Civil works, which total about $143 million equivalent excluding
contingencies, would be tendered on the basis of international competition with
the following exceptions: (i) Tne seasonal nature of land levelling rules out
the possibility of attracting international bidding. It is therefore pro-
posed that part ($15 million) of on-farm development would be carried out by
Topraksu using force account and the remainder ($6 million) by local contractors
assuming, in the latter case, that sufficient interest is generated. Should
contractor interest not materialise, then this work would be carried out on
force account; (ii) The first three contracts for irrigation and drainage
works ($13 million) would be carried out by local contractors and would be
financed entirely by the Government. This would permit irrigation of land
from run of the river flows as quickly as possible, thereby realising early
benefits from the project which would not otherwise be possible if inter-
national bidding procedures were observed and (iii) The diverse nature of
buildings, workshops and communication facilities ($3 million), which are in-
dividually small, and the phasing of their construction does not permit group-
ing of contracts; international bidding would thus be impractical.
41.       Because of the complexity and magnitude of the dam and power plant
civil works, bidders would be prequalified by DSI whose recommendations,
together with the comments of the consultants, would be sent to the Bank for
approval. Irrigation, flood protection and drainage works contracts would
be so grouped that the value of any one group would be not less that $7
million to attract wider competition; bidders would be invited to bid for the
group or any part of the group.
42.       Project Costs and Disbursements.    The total cost of the project
(including physical and price contingencies)is estimated at $326.6 million
net of duties and taxes, of which $104.2 million would be in foreign exchange.
A detailed breakdown of costs is given in Annex III. The proposed Credit and
Loan amount of $74 million is to cover the estimated foreign exchange compon-
ent including physical contingencies of all civil works, save for the three
contracts noted in paragraph 40 (ii) above. It would also cover the foreign
exchange cost of consultants, training, purchase of dairy cattle for farm
demonstrations and of all equipment subject to international competitive
bidding. The Government will be responsible for covering the balance of the
estimated foreign exchange cost ($30.2 million) which corresponds mainly to
the contingency provision for price escalation, and the whole of the local
costs ($222.4 million). In addition, the Government will finance interest



- 13 -
and other charges on the Bank loan during construction (estimated at $10.3
million on the $44 million loan), annual recurrent costs (estimated at about
$2.5 million), and make available adequate credit to farmers in the project
area, where credit demand is expected to reach some $20 million per year at
full development.
43.       The Credit and Loan would be disbursed against the full foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment, livestock, consultant services and over-
seas training of project staff. Expenditure on civil works would be reimbursed
at the rate of 35% of the cost of the Aslantas dam and power plant, 31% of the
cost of irrigation, drainage and flood protection works and 15% of on farm de-
velopment and building construction costs.
44.       T4ater Charges.  The Turkish authorities have agreed on a formula for
the recovery over the life of the project of full operation, maintenance and
investment costs together with reasonable interest thereon, as provided under
existing legislation, by means of levying annual water and land development
charges on farmers in the project area. Such charges would be brought into
effect immediately following the introduction of irrigation into any portion
of the project area. The level of water and land development charges would
be reviewed at least every five years and would be increased if necessary
in order to reflect price changes due to inflation.
45.       The recommendations of a lWater Charges Study carried out in 1972
by the Seyhan Project consultants are at present under review by the Gov-
ernment. Some of these recommendations, if put into effect, would change the
basis for calculating existing water and land development cnarges (e.g. by
charging farmers on an area rather than a crop basis, a change advocated by
the Bank). The Government has agreed to continue discussion on the implemen-
tation of the Study and an assurance was received during negotations that,
should the Government wish to introduce legislation altering the present
system for the collection of water and land development charges, it would
ensure that provision is made for the recovery of the full costs of the project.
46.       Environment and Health.   The health of the population would not be
adversely affected as a result of the project. There is no Schistosomiasis
in the Province of Adana and any initial increase in the incidence of malaria
can be brought under control by the existing health services. The Bank is
satisfied that archeological sites of major interest in the project area will
not be flooded.
47.       Economic Benefits.   At full production, about 5 years after comple-
tion of the project, the annual net value of production, valued at interna-
tional prices, is estimated at TL 761 million (US$54.4 million) compared to
TL 247.3 million (US$17.7 million) at present and a projected value without
the project of TL 269.0 million (US$19.2 million) not accounting for flood
and area losses. In addition, power benefits would amount to some TL 85.9
million (US$6.0 million). The incremental net value of production due to



- 14 -
the project would thus be TL 577.8 million (US$41.1 million).    Mlost of the
incremental cotton and part of the fruit and vegetable production from the
project is expected to be exported bringing an annual increase of $20 million
in foreign exchange earnings at full production.
48.       The average life of the project facilities has been assessed at
50 years. Over this period the economic rate of return is estimated at
13 Y%.
49.       Some 16,000 farm families would benefit directly from the project.
Increased labor requirements would be met by doubling family labor employment
and a five-fold increase in hired labor. In addition, the project would generate
employment in the supply of inputs, processing and marketing and in transpor-
tation.
50.       There are about 10,000 farm units in the project area, of which 8,300
are below 15 ha. and 400 only exceed 50 ha. in size. Taking a typical small
farm of 5 ha, the incremental income per annum as a result of the project,
net of taxes, would amount to T, 17,800 or TL 3,560 per ha compared with
TL 60,400 or TL 2,020 per ha for a 20 ha farm. The incremental income on
larger farms is estimated to be less than that for smaller farms due to the
progressive nature of income taxes in Turkey. Income distribution is uneven
in the project area due to the variation in the size of land holdings. How-
ever, if pending legislation (see para. 26) on agrarian reform is eventually
introduced, an improvement in income distribution can be expected.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRU.MENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association and
the Republic of Turkey, the draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the
Republic of Turkey, the Reports of the Committees provided for in Article V,
Section 1(d) and Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit and loan are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
52.       The Executive Directors? attention is drawn to the covenants in the
draft Development Credit Agreement relating to the employment of consultants
(Sections 3.02, 3,03 and 8.01(b)), project coordination (Section 3.07) and
water charges (Section 4.08).
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit and loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the Bank.

.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION lJ
lzi. No. 568 Keban rransmission Lines Project: US$ 25 million loan of October
31, 1967.  Closing Date:  March 31, 1973.   Progress on this project was interrupted
for about a year in 1970/71 by a dispute between the Turkish Eiectricity Authority
(TEK) and the principal contractor concerning payment of the increased cost of the
project, following the devaluation of the Turkish lira.   This matter has been put
to arbitration and TEK is now carrying out construction using its o-wr staff.
Subsequently, delays on delivery dates for project equipment led to the extension
of the original closing date for the lDan to March 31, 1973. Since the earliest
date for power operation (two units) of the Keban dam has also been postponed,
to October 1974, the timinig for the completion of the project is acceptable.
Ln,O and Cr. Nos. 5871h43 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project:  US$ 12 million loan
and US$ 12 million credit of Feb      2   1LosingDate: _June 30, 1975.
Tne project is making satisfactory progress and should be completed on time.   Yields
of wheat and seed cotton, the principal crops, reached record levels in 1971/72.
A large part of this success can be attributed to the efficient working of the
project extension service which was set up for the first time in Turkey to inte-
grate the various extension service activities in the project area under a full time
extension service manager with sole responsibility for the project. Coordination of
irigation and drainage works, on-farm development and the extension service has been
achieved by a project coordinating committee representing the concerned Governmnent
Agencies.
1' These notes are designed to iTform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems which are being
encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this
sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
Ln. Nos. 589 and 713 TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$ 25
million loan of March 12, 1969 and US$ 40 million loan of November 27, 1970.
Closing Dates: March 31, 1973 and December 31, 1974 respectively. Since
the first Bank loan was made in 1950, a very satisfactory relationship has been
developed with TSKB. These loans when fully disbursed would bring total Bank
Group lending to TSKB to $128 million. The standard of TSKB appraisal work
is consistently high and sub-projects submitted for Bank approval are well
prepared.
Ln. No. 623 Third Cukurova Power Project: US$ 11.5 million loan of June 27,
1969.  Closing Date: September 15, 1973. Work on this project is progres-
sing well. Initial operation is scheduled for July 1973, three months ahead
of contract date for completion.
Cr. No. 236 First Livestock Project: US$ 4.5 million credit of February 22, 197
Closing Date: June 30, 1975   Implementation of this project was delayed
initially by difficulties encountered by the Turkish authorities in fulfilling
some of the effectiveness conditions under the Credit Agreement and by admin-
istrative problems in hiring the necessary staff for the project unit. These
delays were largely due to the absence, following a reorganization of the
Turkish Government administration in March 1971, of an effective coordinating
link between the various ministries concerned with the project and between
the Government and the Bank Group. Steps have been taken recently to correct
this deficiency and progress on the project is now satisfactory.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$ 13.5 million loan of June 9, 1971, Closing
Date: September 30, 1976. Following a slow start caused mainly by the transfer
of responsibility for this project within the Turkish Government and indecision
on the selection of building sites, progress of civil works is about 8 months
behind schedule. Civil works are limited to a Management Institute and six
adult centers. The cost of civil works is expected to be about the same as
that of the appraisal mission estimate except possibly for the management
institute, whose size and standards of equipment may be changed. An estimate
of the costs involved awaits review by the Bank.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Excport Project: US$ 10 million
loan and US$ 15 million credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976e
This project was also delayed by difficulties in meeting some of the effective-
ness conditions by the due date for the reasons noted under Cr. 236 above.
Although it is expected that the project should catch up on the time lost,
the Agricultural Credit Survey, which is included for financing under the
project, will be delayed beyond the forecast date. The Survey team has now
been assembled, however, and is expected to produce a preliminary report in
March 1973 and a full report in September 1973, which could pennit Bank
consideration of a first Credit project for FY 1975.
Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project: US$ 24 million loan of June 22,
1971. Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Implementation of this project was
delayed by three months by failure to meet effectiveness conditions when
due. First contracts were awarded early in 1972 and work is now progressing
according to the revised schedule.



ANNEX II
Page h of 4
Ln. No, 775 Fourth Cukurova Power Pro-ect. US$ 7 million loan of June 30
1971, Closing Date: March 31, 1975,    In part an extension of in. 623, this
project is still in the initial stage0  Major contracts have been awarded and
work is proceeding on schedule. Estimated combined foreign exchange cost
of the Third and Fourth Cukurova projects has increased by about 81 million
principally due to currency exchange variations. uCukurova is producing new
cost estimates for Bank review.
Cr. lNo, 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project:  US$ 18 million credit of
Janluary 2, 19720  Closing Date: June 30, 1977. Preparation of specification
and bidding documents and the respective work programs of the Government
agencies responsible for project imprementation are in hand to enable work
to conmence on schedule in 1973. Appointment of consultants for on-farm
development is taking longer than anticipated but should not hinder progress.
Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project:  US$ 76 million loan of April 28,
1972,  Closing Date:  December 31, 1976,  D=fficulties in coordinating the
implementation steps for the project between the Company, the lenders
(IBRD, USAID and U.S. Ex-Im Bank) and the project engineers (Koppers Asso-
ciates Inc.) have caused delay in the prequalification of contractors and
preparation of specification and bidding documents.
Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project:  US$ 37 million loan of June 30,
1972, Closing Date:   June 30, 1977,  The terminal date for effectiveness for
this loan was extended until January 5, 1973 to permit completion of the
required steps. Considerable progress has been made in the selection of the
consultants and some of the works are in progress.  The new effectiveness da-.e
was met on time.
Cr, No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development ProJect:  US$ 2.3 million credit of
Juine 30, 1972, Closing Date: June 30, 1977. The terminal date for effecti-
veness for this credit was extended until January >, 1973 to meet completion
of the required actions for effectiveness tunder Ln. 84, Istanbul Water Supply,
to which effectiveness of this project is linked. There has been considerable
progress towards the selection of consultants alt'Xough imDlementation will be
delayed slightly due to the complexity of the arrangements necessary.
Ln. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul. Fertilizer Company) Project: US$ 24 million loan
of June 30, 19720 Closing Date: June 30, 1976. This project was declared
effective on October 6, 1972. Progress is on schedule.
Cr. No, 330 Second Livestock Project: US$ 16 million credit of September 28,
1972,  Closing Date:  December 31, 1976.  The signing of the Credit Agreement
was delayed until September 1972 pending the Third IDA replenishment.
Conditions of effectiveness were met by the due date of Januarzj 5, 1973,
Ln. No. 873 TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey) US$ 40 million loan
of December 21, 1972-. Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Terminal date for
effectiveness scheduled on March 11, 1973,
Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK): US$ 1.}
million grant of August 20! 1967. Technical Assistance contracts were termi-
nated in November-December, 1972, Achievement, though short of target in some
respects, is generally satisfactory and TEK new has a much improved accounting,
budgeting and financial reporting system.  The consultants' report concerning
organization structure is under examTuination by the Bank.
