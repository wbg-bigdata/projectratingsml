I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Urbanization and Urban Poverty
1.01      Urbanization Trends.  Brazil's urbanization over the last 30 years
has been characterized by rapid growth, large abtsolute size of urban popula-
tion, and geographical imbalance. Between 1950 and 1970, the urban popula-
tion grew at an annual rate of 5.5% compared to a 2.9% rate of growth of total
population. The urban population (as measured by the standard international
definition of 20,000 or more inhabitants) almost tripled during this period,
rising from 13 million (25% of the total) to 37.8 million (40% of the total).
The current rate of growth is estimated at 4.4% per annum and is expected to
further slow down to 4% during the 1980-1990 period. Nevertheless, the urban
population is likely to reach 85 million (54% of the projected total) by
1990.
1.02      Urban population has traditionally been concentrated along the
coastal areas particularly in the southeast (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo
metropolitan areas). 1/ During the 1950-1970 period, the rates of urban
growth have been highest in the center west--due primarily to the expansion
of Belo Horizonte and the creation of Brasilia--and in the south. This,
however, was not enough to overcome the large imbalance between the southeast
and other regions. In 1970, 39% of the urban population lived in the Sao
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro metropolitan areas (vs. 41% in 1950).
1.03      Employment.  Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo also dominate industrial
employment. In 1970 about 53% of Brazil's urban industrial jobs were located
in the Rio/Sao Paulo axis, compared to 14% in the other metropolitan areas, 5%
in the other large cities of between 250,000 and 1,000,000 inhabitants, and
28% in the remaining urban areas. The 1970 Rio/Sao Paulo percentage shares of
the national wage bill and value added were 62% and 63%, respectively.
1.04      An alarming feature of recent urban growth is that employment in
nonagricultural activities in the formal sector has failed to keep pace with
the rapid growth of the urban labor force. Data from employment studies in
selected cities show that, although open unemployment is low (3%-4%), between
25% and 50% of the urban labor force is employed in low paying, high turnover,
informal sector jobs.
1.05      Urban Poverty.  For a middle-income country like Brazil, the Bank
uses the concept of relative poverty, calculated as one-third of national per
capita income (adjusted for urban-rural price differences), to establish a
poverty income level to be used as a guideline in project preparation and
evaluation.  The 1977 poverty level was calculated at US$465.   Brazilian
agencies operating in the urban sector define poverty in terms of family
income and multiples of regional minimum wage. Using these variables, the
poverty group correspond to the families with monthly incomes up to three
1/   There are nine officially designated metropolitan areas in Brazil:  Porto
Alegre and Curitiba in the south; Belo Horizonte in the center; Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo in the southeast; Salvador, Recife, and Fortaleza
in the northeast; and Belem in the north.



times the regional minimum wage (the 1977 minimum wage equalled approximately
US$55 in the north, northeast, center and center-west, and US$70 in the south
and southeast in 1977 1/). The average urban family size is 4.9.
1.06      According to the 1970 census, 2/ close to 1.6 million families or
8.1 million persons living in the metropolitan areas were in the poverty group
this year. The percentage of families living in poverty ranged from 41% in
Sao Paulo to 76% in Fortaleza.
B. Housing and Urban Services
1.07      Housing Deficit.  The rapid growth of urban population has created
a huge demand for housing and urban services. Between 1964 and 1977, the
number of urban households increased by 6,740,000 or about 480,000 annually.
During the same period, the number of housing units financed through the
Housing Finance System (Sistema Financeiro de Habitacao--SFH) (see para.
1.19)--which provides nearly all of formal housing financing in Brazil--was
1,740,000 or about 125,000 units per annum. Thus, over 75% of housing needs
had to be accommodated outside the SFH system. This led to proliferation of
squatter settlements and illegal subdivisions, widespread use of substandard
structures and overcrowding. On a basis of the 1970 Building Census, it was
estimated that in 1970, 20% of urban housing structures in Brazil, or some
2,000,000 units, were substandard, i.e., overcrowded, built from non-durable
materials or lacking elementary services, such as water, sanitation or elec-
tricity. Since this date, the continuing urban population growth contributed
to the further aggravation of the housing deficit.
1.08      Access to Urban Services.  A large proportion of the urban population
have little or no access to safe water supplies, sewerage systems, and public
transport. The situation is most serious in northeast urban areas where less
than 40% of the population has a safe water supply and only 24% has sewer
connections. Some cities are much worse off: for example, in Fortaleza, 95%
of the metropolitan population has no sewerage connection. In the absence
of paved roads, public transport services are deficient, especially in the
peripheral areas of large cities, and work journey times often average one
hour and can rise much higher.
1.09       Impact on the Urban Poor.  The urban poor is the group most severely
affected by the lack of adequate shelter and urban services. Many of the
urban poor are recent migrants who squat on the periphery of metropolitan
areas, where the land is still to be serviced, or in more centrally located,
but often illegal and precarious, old squatter settlements. The demand-supply
1/   The minimum wage in Brazil is regionally differentiated to compensate
for cost-of-living differences. It is almost 30% higher in the south-
east than in the northeast.

gap is driving up the prices of land, infrastructure provision, and construc-
tion materials at a higher rate than wages. Furthermore the scarcity of
available shelter pushes rents considerably above construction costs. Thus,
low-income families find it increasingly difficult to participate in the
formal housing market. For-example, the market rent for a standard one-bed-
room apartment is not affordable to 75% of the urban households in Recife
and Sao Paulo. 1/
Housing Conditions in Three Metropolitan Areas
1.10      A rapid overview of housing conditions in the metropolitan areas
of Recife, Salvador, and Sao Paulo provides a more detailed picture of urban
housing conditions. These three areas, containing close to 30% of the Brazil
urban population, or over 11 million persons in 1970, of which an estimated
4.7 million (43%) were in the poverty group, demonstrate the variety and scale
of Brazil's housing problems.
1.11      Recife.  The metropolitan planning agency, FIDEM, has made an esti-
mate of the housing deficit by adding the 1970 census enumeration of nondur-
able dwellings to the number of single-family dwellings with multi-family
occupancy. The resulting housing deficit is estimated to be 122,000 units,
equal to about 37% of the 1970 housing stock. Approximately 57% of the
deficit, or 67,000 units, is in the city of Recife, with the rest distributed
over the surrounding municipalities.
1.12      Most of the population with deficient housing, estimated at 63% of
the total metropolitan population, lives in illegal settlements on steep
hillsides or swampy land; sites that were previously abandoned as unbuildable
or impossible to provide with infrastructure, but are frequently close to
jobs, especially in the informal sector. Given Recife's torrential rains,
these sites are subject to floods and landslides and create conditions con-
ducive to rapid transmission of contagious diseases.
1.13      Salvador.  Based ont a 1975 survey by CONDER, the metropolitan
planning agency, some 137,000 units, 52% of the total housing stock, could be
classified as deficient dwellings, with no or unsatisfactory services. In the
city of Salvador, 27% of the city's population lacks access to piped water and
90% lacks access to sewerage connections. About 20,000 families live under
most precarious conditions in the low-lying, constantly flooded and unsanitary
area of Alagados.
1.14      The situation is likely to get worse in the coming years, as the
urban population is expected to continue to grow at an average annual rate of
4.7%. Assuming that the housing deficit as a proportion of the number of
households remains constant, a conservative assumption, the deficit will reach
250,000 units by 1985.
1.15      Sao Paulo.  According to research carried out by COHAB-SP in 1976,
the housing problem in Sao Paulo may be classified in three categories:
shanty-towns, slum tenements, and unserviced settlements. Twenty-six percent
of the total housing stock of 1,900,000 units--close to 500,000 units--were
classified as substandard; sheltering 2.9 million people or close to 30% of
the 1976 metropolitan population.
1/   Assuming that 25% of the family income is spent on housing.



-4-
1.16      Regarding services, only 35% of the population has access to sewer-
age facilities, and 65% has access to piped water. The major housing problem
of Sao Paulo is the sprawl of unserviced, often illegal, settlements that have
sprung up around the city to accommodate the 5.6% annual population growth
experienced over the last 15 years. Although no forecasts have been made of
future demand, the combination of a base-line deficit of 500,000 housing units
and a population growth rate approaching 5%, thus requiring between 80,000 and
100,000 additional housing unit a year, indicates the magnitude of the problem.
C. Housing Policy, Institutions, and Financing
Housing Policy
1.17      In Brazil, public sector involvement in the provision of housing
predates by many years the urban development policies enunciated in the
Second National Development Plan (1975-1979). Official housing policy had
been initiated in 1964 with the creation of the Housing Finance System
(Sistema Financeiro da Habitacao-SFH) and the National Housing Bank (Banco
Nacional da Habitacao-BNH) (see chart 19158). By the time the National Com-
mission on Urban Policy and the National Fund for Urban Development were
created in 1975, the BNH and related agencies had already established strong
policy guidelines and working procedures, and controlled about 70% of public
investment resources in the urban sector.
1.18      The basic principle of official housing policy has been to ensure
the financial viability of the housing sector while promoting home ownership,
especially among the low-income population. The government has also promoted
the creation of local entities with the capacity to plan, design and execute
large-scale housing operations. Furthermore, in order to ensure the flow of
funds to the low-income end of the sector, it created a system of cross-
subsidies and incentives. Finally, an effort was made to devise low-cost
shelter solutions which would expand the number of low-income families who
have access to the housing market.
Housing Institutions
1.19      BNH.  The key institution in the sector is BNH, the largest govern-
ment banking institution in Brazil dedicated to social development. The main
task of BNH is to guide, regulate, and control the SFH, which in addition to
BNH comprises the local executing agencies and the Brazilian savings and loan
system (SBPE) established in 1966. 1/ BNH is also financing urban infrastruc-
ture, in particular--through the Sanitation Finance System--water and sewerage.
1/   Comprising Federal and State Savings Banks, Real Estate Credit Companies
and Savings and Loan Associations.  Created in 1966, the Brazilian
Savings and Loan system grew to become the fourth largest savings and
loans system in the world, and by far the largest in Latin America, with
total assets at the end of 1977 of US$14.5 billion equivalent, of which
US$11.3 billion in 17.5 million individual savings accounts.



- 5 -
1.20      Local Intermediaries.  By its statutes, BNH is prevented from execu-
ting and managing operations it finances. It acts as a second-line agency.
For its programs to succeed, BNH took steps to encourage the creation of viable
intermediaries at the local level, which would execute and manage housing and
urban development operations. In the area of low-income housing, these inter-
mediaries are low-income housing companies (Companhias de Habitacao Popular--
COHABs), mixed-economy societies owned by the states and municipalities. There
are now 34 COHABS (22 owned by the state and 12 owned by the municipalities)
(see paras 3.09-3.11).
Financing
1.21      Monetary Correction.  Since July 1964 major banking liabilities and
assets are subject to monetary correction, using a Ministry of Finance index
(ORTN), which is related to the wholesale price index. Within the BNH-SFH
system, the indexation led to the adoption of a new accounting unit, the
standard capital unit (UPC), which is revalued every quarter using the ORTN
index. Major BNH liabilities and assets (including the loan portfolio) are
denominated in UPC. 1/ The ORTN index was revalued 24% in 1975, 34% in 1976,
35% in 1977 and is expected to average 32% p.a. during the 1978-1980 period. 2/
1.22      FGTS_   To ensure a steady source of funds for the sector the Govern-
ment decided in 1967 that BNH would manage the Employment Guarantee Fund
(Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Servico--FGTS). The FGTS is fueled by an 8%
tax on all wages covered by the labor legislation and is designed to enable
workers to build up a savings reserve that would retain its real value and be
available in case of unemployment, retirement or emergency. The fund is
maintained in indexed individual accounts earning 3% annual interest. These
accounts can be used as downpayment for BNH-financed housing.
1.23      Size of the System.  At the end of 1977 BNH total assets equalled
US$11.6 billion equivalent. Including US$14.5 billion channelled through
SBPE, BNH directs the use of over US$26 billion. 3/ BEH-financed invest-
ments in 1977 totalled US$2.4 billion, representing 1.4% of the GDP and 6.5%
of the Gross Capital Formation of Brazil. About 70% of BNH investments is
in the housing sector, with the balance in sanitation and urban development.
Low-income housing averaged under 20% of BNH commitments in prior years
(1964-1976); it is now the largest single budgetary unit with 26% of pro-
grammed investments for the 1978-80 period vs. 19% and 14%, respectively,
for middle- and upper-income housing (see para 4.06). Since 1964 over
1,000,000 families (five million people) have bought SFH-financed housing
units.
1/   Thus, all interest rates throughout this report are expressed on an
indexed principal denominated in UPC. As of June 1978, 1 UPC = US$14.75.
2/   Inflation in Brazil, as measured by the general price index, was 28% in
1975, 41% in 1976, 43% in 1977 and is expected to average 40% during the
1978-1980 period.

1.24      QrOss Subsidization.  BNH also promotes the social objectives of the
SFH through a complex series of cross-subsidization schemes: BNH's social
programs are subsidized by its higher-income housing programs (0% to 3% inter-
es  orn thc   `eed principal for the former; 3% to 10% for the latter);
prosperous southern states pay higher interest rates (8%) than poor north-
eastern states (3%); even within the social program, COHABs pay lower interest
rates for urbanized lots than for finished houses (see para 1.32).
1.25      Fiscal Benefit.  In order to encourage house acquisition, the Govern-
ment authorized, starting in 1971, a deduction of interest payments from the
taxable income of SFH beneficiaries. However, this system did not reach
families, who did not pay income taxes but contributed to FGTS--a majority
of potential beneficiaries of BNH low-income programs. In order to correct
this distortion, the government introduced in 1974 a fiscal incentive to all
beneficiaries of SFH--the "fiscal benefit." This is a rebate equal on the
average to 12% of the beneficiary's actual loan repayments in the previous
fiscal year subject to a minimum of Cr$900 and a maximum of Cr$6,000 (US$50
and US$333, respectively, at July 1978 exchange rate) and credited against
the current year payments. 1/ BNH and COHAB officials believe that the
fiscal benefit has had very positive impact on payments by beneficiaries
and improved the cash position of COHABs.
D. Low-Income Housing Program (PLANHAP)
PLANHAP I
1.26      In 1973, BNH provided for the first time a comprehensive planning
framework to its low-income housing operations through the establishment of
the National Low-Income Housing Program (Plano Nacional de Habitacao Popular -
PLANHAP). The goal of PLANHAP was to eliminate within ten years the housing
deficit for the population with incomes up to three minimum salaries, estimated
at two million housing units. To achieve this goal, BNH set up special lines of
credit and co-financing and coordination agreements with the states. PLANHAP's
implementation however was disappointing: lacking independent resources,
COHABs and states encountered difficulties to fulfill their financial obliga-
tions. Furthermore, with land and construction costs rising more rapidly than
the minimum wage, there was an increasing affordability gap for the target
popiezlation. Drawing lessons from this experience, BNH introduced in 1975 a
series of modifications in PLANHAP I and established a new planning framework
for its low-income housing activities--PLANHAP II.

1.27      Goals.   The goal of PLANHAP II is no longer the complete
elimination of the housing deficit--clearly an unattainable goal given the

magnitude of the demand--but rather to (a) expand housing production as fast
as supply capacity permits; and (b) develop a wider range of shelter alter-
natives affordable to the entire range of the target population. The ten-year
planning framework was abandoned as unrealistic and currently a three year
rolling investment plan is used (see para 4.06).
1.28      The PLANHAP target population are families with monthly incomes
between one and five minimum salaries. To this population, BNH offers a range
of shelter solutions ranging from apartments through finished and embryo
houses, sites and services to material loans for house improvement, enlarge-
ment and completion. Only shelter units costing up to 500 UPC (US$7,375) are
eligible for BNH financing under PLANHAP.
1.29      Participants.  PLANHAP operations involve three categories of parti-
cipants: BNH's Directorate of Social Operations (COS), responsible for low-
income housing operations of BNH, and its regional counterparts; COHABs; and
state and municipal governments. COS defines the rules and regulations of
PLANHAP, approves COHABs' subprojects and provides financing. COHABs, which
function as BNH financing and executing agents, prepare and execute subprojects,
select final beneficiaries, and sell houses and lots to them. Support from the
local governments, COHABs' owners, is the key element of the success of the pro-
gram.  In each state, an agency is designated as PLA.-NIAP coordinator.  States
and municipalities, or companies controlled by them, are responsible for
financing and execution of infrastructure and community facilities. Often,
they facilitate land acquisition for low-income housing or even transfer the
land they own to COHAB at nominal cost or as a capital grant. More importantly,
the states are required by BNH to guarantee CORABs repayments (see para 3.09).
1.30      Lines of Credit.  PLANHAP II operates through a series of sub-
programs and lines of credit. 1/ The principal subprograms are:
(a)  land acquisition;
(b)  construction and acquisition of finished housing
(PLANHAP) including embryo houses, detached houses,
apartments or a combination of these;
(c)  production and acquisition of sites and services
(PROFILURB); and
(d)  construction, completion, enlargement, or improvement
of individual houses (FICAM).
The loans under these programs are made initially to COHABs for constructi-on
and refinanced by BNH when COHABs sell the shelter units to the final benef-
iciaries.
1.31      In addition, BNH finances the provision of infrastructure and
community facilities through three main lines of credit: (a) FIEGE-for road
1/   Their terms and conditions are detailed in Anne- 4.



- 8 -
and drainage; (b) FISIP--for power, gas, water and telephones; (c) FIEP--for
health care, education, manpower training, and similar public services. Loans
under these lines of credit are made directly to the state and municipal
governments. These programs are intended to complement the main sources of
infrastructure financing: budgetary resources of the state and municipal
government, grants from the Federal Government, loans from the Federal Savings
Bank or State Development Banks, or from BNH lines of credits such as PLANASA,
and CURA; in case these resources are not readily available for low-income
housing operations.
1.32      Interest Rates.  The interest rate charged by COHABs to final
beneficiaries vary with the value of the unit from 1% on the indexed principal
for units up to 200 UPC to 6% to 500 UPC units. BNH charges COHABs between
0% (on the indexed principal) for units up to 200 UPC and 3% for 500 UPC
units; COHAB spreads then vary from 1% to 3%. The interest rates charged by
BNH to the states and municipalities vary in function of fiscal revenues and
population of the borrowing entities, ranging from 3% in Amazonas to 8% in Sao
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
Performance under PLANHAP
1.33      PLANHAP I and II.  Under PLANHAP I BNH approved COHAB loans for only
15,000 and 16,000 units in 1973 and 1974 respectively. Since PLANHAP II was
initiated in 1975, the number of units approved for BNH financing has expanded
dramatically as shown in Table 1.1.

1977       106,042             10,269                   5,022          121,333
Total    258,427             16,650                   8,105          283,182
As of December 31, 1977, COHABs had completed 265,300 units; had 131,000 units
under construction and 102,400 units were in the final design/procurement
stage.
1.34      It should be noted that with construction plus sale periods ranging
from 18 months to three years this expansion in approvals by BNH has not yet
fully materialized in the statistics of units sold. In 1977 the number of
units produced and sold reached 47,200 units, a 26% increase over the 1976
period. As the production capacity is increasing it is expected that the next
few years will show a rapid increase in the number of units completed and sold.
1.35      One feature of PLANHAP II performance gives cause for concern:
a large proportion of approved housing projects are affordable only to the



- 9 -
families in the three to five minimum wage range--the upper range of the
PLANHAP target population. Nationwide, approximately 40% of all units approved
in 1977 fell into this category. This reflects high costs of land and con-
struction, but also the preference of COHABs and local government for finished
housing (see para 3.11).
1.36      PROFILURB. The PROFILURB program established in 1975 was designed
to counter this tendency for costs to price housing out of the reach of the
low-income population. The program has been rather slow to expand due to
the initial reluctance of local governments and COHABs. Until the end of 1977
only 16,000 units were approved for BNH financing.  The first project (in Vila
Velha, Espirito Santo) for 393 units was initiated in 1976, and successfully
completed in mid-1977. Another interesting project has been successfully
implemented by COHAB-Rio Grande do Norte in Natal. It combines provision of
650 sites and services with a materials loan operation and extensive community
development assistance. There are other hopeful signs that the initial
reluctance of COHABs and local governments is being overcome. The number of
approvals in 1977 was twice as high as in 1976. Large sites and services
programs are now being planned and executed in Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Sao
Paulo and Pernambuco.
1.37      FICAMY,  Lack of BNH financing for partial house improvement and
building materials was one of the factors adversely affecting PROFILURB's
performance and excluding many low-income dwellers from the SFH. To remedy
this situation BNH created in September 1977 a new program for individual
house improvement and construction loans (FICAM). FICAM loans can also be
used for land acquisition and tenure regularization purposes. Since its
inception, BNH has approved financing for 5,022 loans under FICAM. It is
expected that the program will become of major importance as a key complement
of sites and services and on-site upgrading operations.
1.38      Future Efforts.  Since 1973 BNH has made an impressive attempt to
overcome the severe problems that affect low-income housing programs in
Brazil. Faced with (a) rising land and construction prices, (b) an income
distribution that excludes a significant part of the population from tradi-
tional housing solutions, and (c) limited implementation capacity at the local
level; BNH has taken steps to devise appropriate programs, make financing
available on attractive terms, and provide technical assistance to improve
local production capacity. The first fruits of BNH's efforts are now being
seen in the expansion of units being approved.
1.39      While PLANHAP performance compares favorably with that of other
countries at similar levels of development, it still falls short of need and
effective demand for shelter. The major shortcoming of PLANHAP has been its
inability to reach on a significant scale the lower strata of its target
population--families with monthly incomes between one and three minimum
wages--many of whom are regular contributors to FGTS. Improving housing
conditions of the urban poor will require BNH to continue and expand its
financing and technical assistance efforts to promote PROFILURB and FICAM
programs, which offer the only affordable shelter options to the majority of
the urban poor. Steps will also have to be taken to develop squatter upgrad-
ing operations, using these and other BNH programs. Furthermore, reduction
of infrastructure design standards and of housing construction costs needs



- 10 -
to be acti- el<y pursued. While COHABs' delivery capacity has begun to improve,
it still reimains uneven and its further strengthening, in particular improve-
ment of their financial and physical planning procedures, is necessary.
Finally, t-r<  is a need for continuing monitoring by BNH of terms and con-
ditions of PLANHAP lines of credit to ensure that they encourage low-cost
solutions while providing adequate remuneration to COHABs. The proposed
project aims at assisting BNH to overcome these deficiencies and shortcomings
of PLANHAP.
E. Project Rationale
1.40      Bank's Urban Sector Involvement.  The Bank involvement in the sector
focuses on two key aspects of the urban sector: (a) provision of badly needed
services and employment opportunities to the urban poor and (b) strengthening
of the institutions at the federal and local level. The Bank has participated,
beginning in 1970, in the financing of a series of water supply and sewerage
projects in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo (through BNH) and ir. an
Urban Transport Project in five metropolitan areas (in 1977). In addition,
two education projects are currently being executed and a vocational training
project was recently approved by the Executive Directors. Projects are also
under preparation for water supply and sewerage; urban infrastructure; educa-
tion and assistance to small scale industry. Complementing these projects, a
number of urban sector studies have been carried out since 1976. 1/
1.41      Project Background.  The Bank has been discussing the possibility of
supporting the PLANHAP programs since mid-1974. Following the establishment
of PROFILURB in 1975, it indicated its interest in this program. At that time
BNH felt that PROFILURB was relatively new and its scale limited, thus offer-
ing little scope for a Bank loan. Subsequently, BNH requested the Bank to
consider a project including some finished and semi-finished housing--which
represents the bulk of PLANHAP production--and focusing on strengthening the
implementation capacity of COHABs.
1.42      In June 1977 the Bank agreed to consider a project on this basis,
provided that the subprojects including finished units have average cost
affordable to poor urban families with monthly income not exceeding three
minimum salaries. Following the Bank preparation mission in August 1977,
the BN11 prepared a detailed report reviewing the PLANHAP program, its past
performance and future prospects, and proposing a three-year PLANHAP program
in three states (Sao Paulo, Bahia, and Pernambuco) as a project for Bank
financing. This report, submitted to the Bank in December 1977, formed the
basis for the preappraisal mission in February/March 1978 and the appraisal
mission in May/June 1978.
1/   A study of urbanization trends, problems and policies has been included
in the 1977 Economic Memorandum (Report No. 1267-a BR, January 1977).
An urban sector mission visited Brazil in January 1977 and the Human
Resources mission which took place in October 1977, analyzed, among other
sectors, housing, water and sewerage programs of BNH. This chapter of
the report draws heavily on this work.



- ]1 -
1.43      Project Objectives.  The main difficulty encountered by BNH in
developing its low-income programs has been the implementation capacity
bottlenecks at the local level:  managerial weaknesses of COHABs and reluc-
tance of local governments to experiment with lowest cost shelter solutions,
when housing scarcity exists at all income levels. Accordingly, the major
contribution of the project will be the comparative experlence and expertise
of the Bank in development of low-income housing programs, specifically sites
and services and squatter upgrading operations, and in the institution-building
of local executing agencies.
1.44      The principal objectives of the proposed project are two-fold:
x(a)  to promote the lowest cost elements of PLAiNHAP--PROFILURB
and FICAM programs, support squatter upgrading, and encourage
lower housing and infrastructure design standards; and
(b)  to contribute to the institutional development of the COHABs
and strengthening of their overall delivery capacity, in
particular development of on-site assistance to PROFILURB
and FICAM beneficiaries, better financial and physical
planning and closer coordination with agencies in charge of
provision of infrastructure and community fadil±tiest
1.45      Within PLANHAP programs, the proposed project would focus on
PROFILURB and FICAM subprojects which account for about 65% of shelter units
finarnced under the project. Inclusion of higher standard units, ranging
from embryo houses to three-bedroom houses will facilitate the development of
mixed subprojects offering a wider choice of shelter. Such subprojects would
offer a more balanced social mix of beneficiaries and create opportunities for
cross-subsidization in favor of the lower-income inhabitants--an important
policy objective of BNH.
1.46      To facilitate the achievement of institation-building objectives
of the project, the bulk of the project will be concentrated on PLANHAP
programs in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo in the south and the States of
Pernambuco and Bahia in the northeast.  The three project areas provide a good
cross section of urban shelter problems in Brazil and the three COHABs have
reasonable records of success in building traditional low-cost housing and
are willing to try new approaches in the development of FICAM and PROFILURB
programs.  Together, they accounted for 33% of PLANHAP housing units approved
by BNH in 1977 and 32% of estimated PLANHAP disbursementsZ The project will
seek to demonstrate--using the three COHABs--the feasibility, replicability
and public acceptance of large-scale sites and services and squatter upgrading
operations. The experience derived from it could then be applied to BNH's
low-income programs throughout Brazil.
1.47      To ensure the replicability of the project, its implementation
arrangements will be those of PLANHAP with only minor modificatiors, BNH
will play a pivotal role in the project implementation as 'LI.-e financial
intermediary with respcnsibility for subproject appraisal, the PLANWtLE
regulatory body, and the source of technical assistance to COF-ABs. During



- 12 -
the project preparation, Bank staff worked closely with BNH to develop a pro-
ject mix better reflecting the profile of the target population and devise
measures and incentives which would increase the acceptance of PROFILURB
and FICAM programs. The project will strengthen the BNH commitment to these
kinds of shelter programs, which today are still in formative stages. During
project implementation, the Bank will continue the policy dialogue and
exchange of experience regarding, in particular, technical assistance to the
COHABs, terms and conditions of financing for low-income shelter and other
incentives to encourage low-cost programs.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Components
Project Concept
2.01      The project will consist of a slice of the 1979-1981 PLANHAP program
for the three COHABs, complemented by funds for community facilities and
infrastructure and for an experimental squatter upgrading operation in Recife
(Part A). In addition, a small proportion of project funds will be earmarked
for PROFILURB projects of other COHABs (Part B). The project will be comple-
mented by a technical assistance program.
2.02      Bank participation in the entire investment programs of the three
COHABs is not desirable due to their combined magnitude of approximately
US$800 million and the fact that these programs contain a large proportion
of medium-cost housing affordable only to families earning between four and
five minimum salaries. In order to encourage lowering of building costs and
to reach the target population, Bank disbursements would be limited to the
subprojects with average unit costs affordable to families with monthly
incomes not exceeding three minimum salaries. At January 1979 prices, this
implies a maximum average unit cost of US$5,162 (350 UPC) in Sao Paulo and
US$4,425 (300 UPC) in Bahia and Pernambuco. 1/ Criteria for subproject
approval are discussed in more detail in paras. 2.36-2.37.
Project Components
2.03      Part A.  This part of the project, drawn from the investment programs
of the three COHABs, would comprise:
(a)  about 31,800 urbanized lots under the PROFILURB program
(see paras 2.07-2.09).
(b) about 23,800 home improvement and construction materials
loans under the FICAM program, which would be provided
in connection with, but not restricted to, the PROFILURB
subprojects (see paras 2.10-2.12);
1/   Differences in unit costs reflect regional minimum salary differentials.



- 13 -
(c)  about 19,500 em-bryc units, low-cost finished and semi-
finished dwellings (see paras 2.13-2.17);
(d)  complementary infrastructure and community facilities
provided in connection with eligible urbanized lots and
housing subprojects under (a) and (c). Given the fact that
these investments are normally funded from other sources,
(see para 1.31) the infrastructure financing under the project,
through PLANHAP lines of credit, would be limited to specific
cases in which difficulties in obtaining financing from other
sources might lead to delays in the execution and sales of
COHAB subprojects or when the financing of infrastructure
through PLANHAP is a standard operating procedure (e.g. for
power in Pernambuco and water supply in Bahia). It is esti-
mated that financing for these cases would represent 10% of
the funds invested in shelter operations; and
(e) experimental squatter upgrading in Recife (Pernambuco)
for about 7,200 families (see paras 2.18-2.20)
2.04      Part A of the project is based on the review of potential sub-
projects, taking into considerat.ion availability of land and its location,
possible unit mix, status of Cesign and engineering an  proposed eligibility
criteria under the project. Most subprojects expected to be approved during
the first year have identified sites and preliminary or detailed engineering
has been initiated. The remaining subprojects are at the stage of identifi-
cation. During the subproject review process Bank staff worked closely with
COHAB staff to promote the provision of low-cost solutions, specifically of
urbanized lots. In Recife and Sao Paulo, this resulted in a twofold increase
in the number of urbanized lots compared to the original program.  In Bahia,
the increase was more modest (about 20%). The investment programs and the
project slices for the three CG0EABs are shown in Annex 1.
2.05      Part B,  Thils  art of cthe project would provide funds to support
selected PROFILURB subprojects (up to a total of 10,000 units, estimated
20% of the 1979-1981 PROFILURB programs outside the three COHABS) in other
states.  These subprojects will be selected by BNH for inclusion in the
project using the agreed subproject approval criteria (oara 2.36).
2.06      The project will also include a technical assistance program, which
will be financed out of BNHi own resources, and will focus on the areas con-
sidered essential both for s-c-essful project executic. and for developing
COHABs capacity to carry out large low-income shelter programs: COHABs manage-
ment; COHABs financial management, reporting and incentives; design efficiency
and lowering of infrastructure standards and construction costs; implementa-
tion of PROFITURB and FICAM rrograms; squatter upgrading; and monitoring and
evaluation (see paras 2.28-230')a
B,  Design Standards and Unit f,-;s
Sites and Services (PROFILURB)
2.07      Three basic types of sites and services -^-_uld be financed under
th.e project-



- 14 -
(a) basic urbanized lots which will have individual water, sewerage
(waterborne or septic tanks), and power connection but no structure
on the plot;
(b) hydraulic wall plots, which in addition to the above will offer a
wall containing hook-ups for bathroom and kitchen facilities around
which the house will eventually be built;
(c)  sanitary unit lots which will include a 3 m  sanitary unit, with a
bathroom, outside laundry and a water tank.
2.08      In Sao Paulo, sites and services subprojects will consist largely of
basic urbanized lots. In Pernambuco, 90% of lots will be sanitary units with
the balance being basic urbanized lots. Bahia will offer the most balanced
program with an estimated 40% of the URBIS program going to basic urbanized
lots, 30% to hydraulic walls and 30% t   sanitary unit plots. The standard plot
size for Pernambuco and Bahia is 200 mi2.  The denser Sao Paulo metropolitan
area would have smaller plots of 130 m .
2.09      The unit mix, design standards and plot sizes reflect the early stage
of PROFILURB development. Further lowering of standards and smaller plot sizes
will be sought during the project implementation as COHABs acquire more expe-
rience in this kind of projects.
Home Improvement and Construction Loans (FICAM)
2.10      All three COHABs offer at least two types of FICAM loans which
permit upgrading of a sites and services lot to either an embryo or one-
bedroom house.
2.11      In Sao Paulo and Pernambuco, the provision of FICAM loans will be
closely linked with the PROFILURB program. It is expected however that some
PROFILURB beneficiaries will have acquired materials on their own and there-
fore the number of FICAM loans was restricted to 70% of PROFILURB loans.
2.12      In Bahia, the FICAM program will be broken into two parts.  The
first part, as in the case of Pernambuco and Sao Paulo, would cater to
PROFILURB participants. The other part will be aimed more generally at
the low-income population living in existing precarious dwellings. In par-
ticular, the program will complement a 5,000 unit upgrading project being
managed by the State's Secretariat of Social Welfare (FUNDESCO). This proj-
ect is located in Narandiba, a large urban development site in metropolitan
Salvador that includes areas URBIS will be using for PLANHAP housing and
sites and services. Thus, coordination of the URBIS-administered FICAM
loans with the FUNDESCO programs of community development should pose no
difficulties. Furthermore URBIS has the largest on-going FICAM program in
the country (2,123 units) (see para 3.40).
Housing
2.13      This category includes units ranging from one-room embryo houses
to three-bedroom finished houses and apartments.



- 15 -
2.14      In Sao Pau;o, an estimated 80% of housing funded under the project
will consist of 20 m  embryo houses including a bathroom, kitchen and living
room. The balance will be divided between one-, two-, and three-bedroom
apartmaents.
2.15      In Pernambuco, a housing mix, whose average cost i's affordable
to the targey population, would include units ranging from 27 m  embryos,
5                   ~~~~~~~~~~2
through 35 m  one-bedroom house to 52 m  three-bedroon aparLmenLs.
2.16      In Bahia the current state policy of cross-subsidizing the cost of
land for low-income housing (para 3.41(a)), allows URBIS to offer houses at
prices similar to those in Pernambuco, in spite of notably high2r construc-
tion costs. 2An eligible housing mix here could range fr2m 23 m embryos,
through 33 m  one-bedroom and 39 m  two--bedroom, to 52 m  three-bedroom
houses.
2.17      Efforts have been made in all three COHABs to achieve the lowest
costs for housing units, both through minimum built-up areas and reducing
construction costs per square meter. This has led to innovative and in some
cases very good designs. The units are usually provided with only polished
cement floors and rough or no finishing on walls, permitting the residents to
eventually upgrade their dwellings. Further cost-reducing effort is needed
however in the design of site layouts and infrastructure and community facil-
ities..
Squatter Upgrading
2.18      The project area for this component, Jiquia-Remedios, is located
about 5 km from downtown Recife and is subject to periodical flooding. Only
10% of the approximately 7,200 families living in the area have water connec-
tions and fewer still have legal tenure. This component would include the
legalization of tenure (through FICAM loans), the provision of basic infra-
structure (drainage, water, sanitation, roads and electricity), as well as
communaity facilities and the upgrading of housing conditions through partial
house improvements, construction of low-cost dwellings and provision of about
1,200 sites and services of which 300 would be used to relocate families
affec-ed by on-site upgrading works. The project would be complemented by a
series of community development programs, and technical assistance for the
development of productive activities and small-scale enterprises funded and
implenented by the State government and its agencies. However, only those
aspects which could be channelled through the BNH-PLANHAP lines of credit
(estimated at about 80% of this component cost) will be eligible for Bank
disbursement. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that the State of
Pernambuco would fund and implement the complementary programs and technical
assistance for this component.
2D19      Planning for this component has been completed by the Recife metro-
politan planning agency (FIDEM) and the preliminary design was carried out
iointly by FIDEM and COHAB-PE.  Following the completion of preliminary
designs in October 1978 the project was submitted by COHAB-PE and the State
of Pernambuco for BNH analysis and approval.  The key issues identified so
far Eare land tenure and design standards.



- 16 -
2.20      During appraisal, FIDEM, COHAB-PE, and COS agreed to work jointly
on finding satisfactory solutions to both issues: i.e., to (a) devise a scheme
and procedures of tenure regularization, which would offer security to benefi-
ciaries while minimizing the risk of speculative turnover, protracted litiga-
tion and excessive administrative costs, and (b) develop design standards that
are affordable to the target population and acceptable to BNH and the Bank.
This agreement was confirmed at negotiations.
Unit Costs
2.21      Unit costs for different types of shelter categories to be financed
under the project are shown in Table 2.1. They are based on the construction
costs for similar units recently designed or sold by the COHABs. Differences
in unit costs reflect differences in construction costs between three COHABs.
Construction costs are the highest in Bahia, reflecting material supply bottle-
necks and lack of skilled manpower both in trades and in on-site management,
and lowest in Pernambuco.
2.22      Unit costs include land acquisition (except in Bahia), site prepara-
tion, on-lot infrastructure connections, on-lot construction, design and super-
vision fees, 10% physical contingencies 1/ and interest during construction.
The proportion of land costs varies from 12% for completed houses in Recife to
60% for urbanized lots in Sao Paulo.
C. Project Costs and Financing Plan
Project Costs
2.23      Total project costs including price contingencies have been estimated
at US$265.7 million at January 1979 prices. Land acquisition costs are esti-
mated at about US$37 million or 14% of the total. The foreign exchange compo-
nent amounts to US$61.5 million (23%) practically all of which is indirect.
The technical assistance program expenditures include on-going research pro-
grams and BNH staff time and its costs are not included (see para 2.30).
Project costs estimates are summarized in Table 2.2.
2.24      Project costs were determined on the basis of average unit costs
of sub-projects that will satisfy the Bank's criteria of affordability (see
Table 2.1). Thus, any increase in construction costs in excess of the rise
of the minimum wage cannot be passed on to beneficiaries by raising prices
of all units in a given subproject, but rather must be reflected by COHABs'
restructuring the project mix toward lower-cost options, i.e., a decrease in
the total number of higher cost units and an increase in the number of lower
cost units. Following BNH standard procedure, design and supervision of work
are estimated at 6% of the value of works and are included in the unit costs.
1/   Except for the squatter upgrading subproject where physical contingencies
amount to 20%.

- 19 -
2.25      BNH's accounting unit, UPC, was used in calculating the base project
cost. Over the years, the relative value of the UPC with respect to the US
dollar has remained approximately constant. Thus, the price contingencies in
US dollar equivalent are based on worldwide inflation trends and amount to
7.5% in 1979 and 7% per annum in 1980 and 1981. They represent 18.5% of the
base costs.
Financing Plan
2.26      A Bank contribution of 35% or US$93 million of the total project
cost is proposed for the project, reflecting its emphasis on the provision
of shelter and complementary services to the urban poor. The State Govern-
ment of Pernambuco would finance complementary infrastructure and community
facilities for the squatter upgrading component in Recife estimated at US$4.6
million. The balance of project funds would be supplied by BNH. The pro-
posed financing plan is shown in Table 2.3.

Channelling of Funds and On-Lending Terms
2,27'     The proposed Bank loan would be made to the National Housing Bank
(BNHJ) and guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Brazil, The loan would have
a fixed amortization period of 15 years including three years oF grace. BNH
would assume the foreign exchange risk but would have the right to request
Government assistance should the cost of the Bank funds exceed its average
cost of funds. Proceeds of the Bank loan would be channelled to COHABs in
cruzeiros on standard BNH-PLANHAP terms (para 1.32):  0%' to 3% interest per
annum on the indexed principal, the i-nterest rate for subprojects varying
according to the cost of shelter units included. The proceeds of Bank loan
for community facilities and infrastructure would be channelled in cruzeiros
to the states and municipalities on standard BNH terms: 3%"0 on indexed princi-
pal in Bahia, 5% in Pernambuco, and 8% in Sao Paulo. The amortization period
would be 25 years for shelter units and 18 years for infrastruct-ure and
community facilities following the construction and sales period of up to
three years. The maximum grace period would be 36 months. The on-lending
terms to the final beneficiaries (for shelter units only) would likewise vary
with the unit cost from 1% to 6% on the indexed principal. The amortization
period will be 25 years. The repayments due to the Bank and not yet repaid by
COHABs, because of the longer amortization periods, will be met by BNH out of
its funds flow.

D. Technical Assistance
2.28      The technical assistance program under the project will continue,
expand and complement the on-going BNH programs carried out by the Research
Department (APQ) in the Planning and Technical Assistance Directorate and
the Technical Assistance Division of COS. The BNH ongoing programs of in-
terest for the project include (a) diagnoses of the housing deficits in
Sao Paulo, Salvador and Recife; (b) experiments in the use of soil cement
bricks and blocks for low-income housing; (c) review of the adequacy of
the municipal building code in Sao Paulo for low-income housing; (d) community
development assistance to COHABs in Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia and Santos; (e)
evaluation of beneficiaries' response to low-income housing programs in Recife
and Sao Paulo; (f) development of improved methodology and training techniques
for design of low-income housing carried out by a group of specialists from
six universities; (g) management diagnoses of COHAB-SP and URBIS carried
out by Brazilian Center for the support of small- and medium-scale industry
(CEBRAE). The Bank supervision missions would periodically review the progress
on these programs.
2.29      In addition, BNH will develop technical assistance studies and
programs in the following priority areas.
(a)  COHAB Management - development of measures to improve COHABS
overall management through streamlining of their internal
procedures, raising the qualification of the staff and
strengthening the management continuity. These measures will
be developed on the basis of CEBRAE diagnoses mentioned above
(para 2.28(g)).
(b)  COHAB Financial Management.  Following a recommendation of the
appraisal mission, BNH has formed a Working Group to revise the
COHAB Accounting Manual to reflect new reporting requirements
and with a view to make the Manual a more useful tool for
management control. This group, comprising the representatives
of appropriate COHAB representatives and outside experts as
required, would also review the key areas of financial manage-
ment and policy (see para 4.16-4.18).
(c) Financial and other incentives to PLANHAP agents to encourage
and reward development and promotion of lower cost solutions
(see para 4.14).
(d) Lowering the design standards and costs of infrastructure and
community facilities provided in connection with COHAB projects
through analysis of existing standards and design practices
and development of more cost-effective alternatives.
(e) Implementation of PROFILURB and FICAM programs through design of
operating manuals to assist the COHABs and final beneficiaries.



- 21 -
(f) Squatter upgrading - development and testing of replicable
schemes of tenure regularization for squatter areas. The
experimental squatter upgrading operation in Recife will
provide the initial case material for this study (para 2.20).
(g) Monitoring and Evaluation - to assess the impact of selected
subprojects in one or more project areas with emphasis on
project location, progress of self-help house construction and
consolidation; socio-economic characteristics of beneficiaries
in particular; their repayment record and turnover.
(h) Training of CORABs personnel - short-term courses on national
or regional basis to improve the design efficiency of COHAB
projects; communIity development programs; and on-site assistance
to PROLIFURB and FICAM beneficiaries.
2.30      The manpower required to carry out the above program is estimated
at about 180 manmonths of which BNH staff contribution would be about 60 man-
monlths, with the balance provided by firms, universities and individual ex-
perts. The necessary expertise is available in Brazil. During negotiations,
it was confirmed that the technical assistance program -will be carried out by
BNH using its own resources.
E. Implementation Arrangements
2.31      Implementation arrangements would follow current PLANHAP procedures,
amended as necessary. Previous Bank experience with BNH in the water supply
sector was also taken into account,  Overall project coordination will be
ensured by a special workiAn  group within BNH, comprising the representatives
of the Social Operations Directorate (COS), of the Planning and Technical
Assistance Directorate which is responsible for foreign loans, of regional BNH
offices in the project areas; and a lawyer. BNH will be responsible for sub-
project appraisal and approval, technical assistance, channeling of funds to
COHABs, and for filing disbursement applications to IBRD.
2.,32     Subproject preparation up to detailed engineering would be the re-
sponsibility of the COHABsa In the case of the squatter upgrading component
in Recife, the project would be prepared jointly by the COHAB-PE and FIDEM.
The COHABs would be responsible for tendering and direct supervision of
shelter construction. They would also carry out all complementary activities
such as selection, orientation, and community development assistance, as well
ais administration of loans to beneficiaries.
2.33      The construction of infrastructure and community facilities and
financing would be the responsibility of the states and municipalities.
Interagency coordination to ensure the timely provision of community facil-
ities and infrastructure would be the responsibility of the COHABs except in



- 22 -
the case of the squatter upgrading project for Recife where it would be shared
with FIDEM. The coordination arrangements between these agencies and the
COHABs were reviewed during appraisal and should be adequate. These arrange-
ments were confirmed at negotiations.
2.34      In order to facilitate the implementation of PROFILURB and FICAM
programs, special units dealing exclusively with these programs should be set
up or expanded. During the appraisal specific arrangements for each COHAB
were reviewed (see paras 3.27; 3.35-3.36; and 3.43). During negotiations, it
was confirmed that the COHABs would implement these arrangements in accordance
with the planned expansion of the PROFILURB and FICAM programs.
2.35      The slice of the investment program for each COHAB which will be
financed under the project was discussed during appraisal (see Annex 1). Over
the life of this project, changes in the implementation capacity of COHABs can
be expected which would affect the speed of project execution and disbursement
of funds. In addition, shifts in the demand of the target population and
other factors such as availability of land and changes in PLANHAP regulations
may also affect the size and composition of the investment program. This
indicates a need for a periodical review and updating of the COHABs' invest-
ment program and of the project's slice. It was confirmed at negotiations
that the COHAB investment programs would be reviewed annually by BNH, COHABs
and the Bank.
F. Subproject Approval Procedure
2.36      Shelter subprojects eligible for Bank financing would be selected on
the basis of the following criteria:
(a)  they should form part of the agreed 1979-1981 COHAB investment
program 1/;
(b)  the subprojects should be affordable to the target population,
i.e., their average unit cost should be affordable to the
families with monthly incomes not exceeding three regional
minimum salaries;
(c)  projects should have efficient design, i.e., project location
should take into account access to work and the breakdown of land
use and the length of infrastructure networks should fall within
specified parameters;
(d)  the subprojects should be economically viable.
2.37      Community facilities and infrastructure subprojects will be eligible
for Bank financing only if they benefit shelter subprojects eligible under
criteria described above.
1/   Except for subprojects under part B of the project.



- 23 -
2.38      The eligibility criteria and the methodology of their application 1/
were discussed with BNH and COHABs during appraisal and were agreed at
negotiations.
2.39      Approval procedures would be as follows.  For the first site and
services, the first housing subprojects from each of the COHABs and the first
two subprojects under part B of the project, BNH would forward, after its own
approval, the project documentation to the Bank for review and approval. The
project documentation would include the project summary submitted by the COHAB
to BNH, BNH's own evaluation report including economic analysis, and an
additional fact sheet detailing land use percentages, infrastructure network
lengths and site location information. For subsequent subprojects BNH would
notify the Bank of its approval and keep the documentation for Bank review.
Should the Bank determine that a subproject had been erroneously approved, it
would have the option to cancel a part of the loan equivalent to the value of
the subproject. It is estimated that the risk of this happening is small
since Bank supervision missions would have had the opportunity to follow
virtually all subprojects during their preparation.
G. Procurement
2.40      Procurement contracts would be divided into two categories.  The
first is procurement of civil works for housing and sites and services in
excess of US$2.4 million and US$1.5 million respectively 2/ that are under the
direct responsibility of the three COHABs. Contracts for these works would
represent about 60% of the value of procurement under the project and would be
subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. The second category is procurement of civil works for smaller
housing and sites and services contracts under the responsiblity of the three
COMABs; infrastructure networks and community facilities that are under the
responsibility of states, municipalities and state-controlled agencies; as
well as of civil works for subprojects under Part B of the project. Contracts
for these works would be procured according to local competitive procedures
acceptable to the Bank. These procedures, based on federal legislation,
insure adequate competition and are consistent with Bank guidelines. They are
similar to those used in the Secondary and Feeder Roads project (Loan No.
1207-BR). Foreign contractors are allowed to participate in these biddings.
2.41      Brazil has a well-developed civil works and housing construction
industry and it is expected that most, if not all, civil works contract would
be won by local contractors.
1/   Separate notes on the methodology of project design efficiency and of
economic analysis of subprojects are available from the project file.
2/   This corresponds to an average contract size of 600 units for housing
and 1,500 units for sites and services respectively.



- 24 -
2.42      The project is expected to generate more than 120 contracts over
the next three years. In 1977, contracts awarded by the three COHABs ranged
from Cr$2-3 million (US$150,000 to US$250,000) to about Cr$130 million (US$11
million) depending on type of works (earthworks or civil works) and on the
size of the projects. The main responsibility for reviewing and approving
bidding documents and contracts would lie with BNH. In order to facilitate
the Bank's ex-post review, BNH prepared standard bidding documents to be used
in local and international bidding. During negotiations, these documents were
reviewed and found acceptable to the Bank.
H. Disbursements
2.43      The investment program for the project is based on expected BNH
subproject approvals and funds commitment between January 1, 1979, and
December 31, 1981. However, with the execution period extending from 18 to
24 months, the last disbursement is expected in the fourth quarter of 1983.
The estimated disbursement schedule is shown at Annex 2.
2.44      The Bank loan would be disbursed against civil works, as well as
against materials and equipment, if any, under FICAM program. The Bank would
disburse 35% of expenditures for eligible sub-projects.
2.45      Proceeds of the loans have been allocated on the basis of the
agreed investment program of the COHABs. This allocation will be reviewed as
needed following the annual review of COHABs investment program (para 2.35)
and according to the demonstrated execution capacity of each COHAB.
2.46      Disbursements for subprojects will be made on the basis of the
following documentation:
(a)  the loan contract between BNH and the COHAB (or other financial
agent);
(b) a BNH document certifying that BNH has disbursed to the COHAB
(or other financial agent) for the expenditures incurred for
the given subprojects.
All contract documents, bid evaluations, and proofs of payment, will be
retained by COHABs or BNH as the case may be and will be available for Bank
examination. This procedure has been used in the two Minas Gerais Water
Supply Projects (Loans Nos. 1009 and 1309-BR) and has worked satisfactorily.

III. THE BORROWER AND THE INTERMEDIARIES - BNH AND COHABs
A. BNH
BNH Structure
3.01      BNH is a government-owned financial institution under the respon-
sibility of the Ministry of Interior, but with financial and administrative
autonomy and independent legal personality. BNH's policy is set by a Board
of Directors, comprising the President, nine counselors and six directors
appointed by the President of the country with the approval of the Federal
Senate. BNH's operations are managed by the Executive Committee made up of
the President and the directors, and are carried out by six directorates:
Social Operations, responsible for low-income housing; Housing Programs,
responsible for middle-income housing; Financial Agents, responsible for
housing units financed through SBPE; Special Operations, including support of
housing construction industry, Urban Development; and the Sanitation Finance
System.
3.02      BNH activities at the local level are supervised by eleven regional
offices. It has been BNH policy since 1973 to decentralize its activities
and currently the bulk of technical loan appraisal and approvals as well as
all supervision of works are carried out by the regional offices.
CoS
3.03      The responsibility for BNH's low-income housing operations is
with the Social Operations Directorate (Carteira de Operacoes de Natureza
Social--COS) and its counterpart units in the regional offices. COS head-
quarters staff is small, 40 professionals, but competent and dedicated. Many
of the staff have worked for COHABs and are therefore sensitive to their
needs. BNH pays competitive salaries and has no difficulties to attract and
retain good staff.
3e04      COS is organized into five divisions:  studies and planning, project
analysis, credit administration, technical assistance, and community develop-
ment (see the chart 19156). Three of these are of specific interest.
3.05      The Division of Project Analysis has functional responsibility for
evaluation of projects prepared by COHABs. The division reviews directly
about 40% of the projects (108 out of 273 projects in 1977) and overviews the
project evaluation carried out by the regional offices. In order to facili-
tate the project preparation, the Division developed a set of guidelines
that set out in detail the socio-economic, planning and design information
required to support a project. The objective of the guidelines is to provide
a consistent set of background information as a basis for BNH analysis and
evaluation. They represent a welcome move away from rigid layout and
design standards COHABs were required to follow earlier. However, while
they insure adequate technical standards of design and engineering, they do



- 26 -
not provide normative criteria against which achievement of PLANHAP objectives
can be assessed. Furthermore, pressure to process a large number of projects
quickly limits the time available for thorough review. Thus, the projects are
usually approved if they follow norms developed in previous projects; there is
little systematic effort to improve project design.
3.06      The Division of Technical Assistance provides technical assistance
to the COHABs designed to: strengthen COHAB management, promote technological
experiments to lower construction costs (i.e. soil-cement bricks), and train
COHAB personnel. On a routine basis the division arranges exchanges, seminars
and meetings between COHABs so that their staff can be exposed to innovative
ideas and techniques.
3.07      The Division of Community Development provides assistance to COHABs
to develop programs stressing the development of community leadership and
education of residents as to their rights and obligations, especially vis-a-
vis government agencies. In 1977, COS contributed US$700,000 in grants to
such programs which benefitted some 27,000 families. The division has also
developed a set of guidelines for preparation and evaluation of community
development programs. In the future, these programs will become even more
important as they expand to encompass the community participation required
for successful implementation of urbanized lot programs.
3.08      Regional Offices.  Each of BNH's eleven regional offices has a
COS unit. In the larger regional offices, i.e., Sao Paulo, the COS unit is
structured like the main directorate. In smaller regional offices, the COS
unit is organized on a more ad hoc basis. In all cases, the regional COS
units are responsible for the day-to-day operation of PLANHAP. They assist
COHABs in project preparation, appraise the majority of projects, and super-
vise their execution. While BNH policy is to operate as a second-line finan-
cial agent, the regional offices, through their everyday action, do influence
the operations, targets, and production of the COHABs.
B. Role and Function of COHABs
3.09      The COHABs are a direct result of BNH's posture as a second-line
financial agent. BNH promoted'the establishment of COHABs to prepare, ex-
ecute, and manage low-income housing programs. Although the majority share-
holders of the COHABs are the states or municipalities, the primary, and most
frequently, the sole function of the COHABs is to act as the financial and
promoting agent for BNH programs. BNH provides practically all of COHAB's
financing and the COHABs financial viability is dependent on BNH rules govern-
ing the fees that may be charged by the COHABs, their interest rates and
amortization periods. On the other hand, the COHABs depend on political sup-
port from their shareholders for low-income housing programs, as the local
governments appoint COHABs' top management, help the COHABs to acquire land,
and provide the necessary complementary infrastructure and community facilities.



- 27 -
3;10      Prior to 1973, the COHABs developed rather slowly, largely due
to the absence of national low-income housing programs and their precarious
finanlcial situation.  The changes introduced under PLANHAP I and  TI put the
CCHA3s on a sounder financial footing and progress in mos: COliAlfis dZtes from
that time.  In many COHABs, progress has been impressive, w- th a -rapid expan-
sion of productive capacity.
3.11X .   Within the constraints imposed by their institutiorF  n-SVironment
the COHABs tend to respond to the incentives embedded in BNH re- -iations
(see paras 4.11-4.15). They prefer to produce houses under programs that give
a greater financial return, that have beneficiaries who are less risky, and
that have the lowest overhead. Thus, at present, COHAB programs include much
more finished housing and apartments for families earning four-five minimum
wages than urbanized lots for families earning two or less minimum salaries.
This tendency is reinforced by pressures from the states and municipalities.
Governors and mayors often prefer to count among their achievements finished
apartment and housing complexes rather than acres of urbanized lots at various
stages of consolidation--a fact that often limits the capacity of COHAB man-
agement to embrace innovative programs which would better serve the intended
target population.
PLANHAP Project Cycle
3.12      Programming.  Each year BNH prepares a three-year investment pro-
gram in cooperation with PLANHAP state coordinators and the COHABs.  However,
this program is only indicative and its execution depends on many factors.
One major factor is land availability, especially in the metropolitan areas.
The size of the land area, its location and level of available urban services
(or cost of their provision) determine to a large extent the housing mix
between apartments, detached houses and sites and services.  Another factor
determining the housing mix is the structure of financial incentives embedded
in terms and conditions of BNH loans to the COHABs (see paras 4.11-4.15).
3.e13     Design.  The COHABs are responsible for project design and engineer-
ing for site layouts and housing units, and usually have a qualified staff
to carry out this task. Complementary infrastructure - roads, water supply,
sewerage, electricity - can be designed by the appropriate executing agency
(i.e. state water company or state electrical company) or by the COHABs, which
often subcontract these tasks. In any case the executing agency has to approve
inf rastructure design.
3.14      Loan Approval and Project Execution.  The appraisal of subprojects
and loan approval takes normally between one and two months. Preparation
of contract documents (centralized at BNH headquarters) and loan signing takes
anoi:her month. After the loan has been approved and signed, BN}1 advances
COMlABs 2% of the estimated value of the project as a planning and design fee.
BNH encourages the COHABs to submit final designs and tender docluments for
project approval and to invite bids between project approval and signing of
the contract in order to minimize delays and protect COHABs against cost
ove-rruns.  Most COHABs use competitive bidding procedures in accordance wit1
the Federal Decree Law No. 200, which requires prequalification of interested



- 28 -
contractors. For this purpose, BNH maintains a registry of contractors. BNH
disbursements to the COHABs are made in accordance with an approved disburse-
ment schedule and with progress of works as monitored by the BNH regional
office. 4% of the estimated cost of the project is disbursed to the COHABs as
a supervision and administration fee during construction.
3.15      In the past, a lack of coordination between housing operations
and provision of infrastructure and community facilities adversely affected
the progress of PLANHAP. In order to improve the situation PLANHAP now offers
special lines of credit for infrastructure and community facilities to comple-
ment other sources of finance. In addition the COHABs must obtain undertakings
from the relevant agencies that the infrastructure and facilities will be
provided as a condition of BNH loan approval.
3.16      Selection of Beneficiaries and Marketing.  After completion of
construction (between 12 and 24 months), the COHAB is given a grace period of
up to eight months to market the housing units. The COHAB selects the bene-
ficiaries from its inscription list. Eligibility criteria for inscription
include: family income up to five minimum salaries; residence in the area of
the COHAB's activities for a specified period of time, usually two years; and
the household head's age between 18 and 55. Earnings and source of employ-
ment have to be formally documented, which excludes many applicants from the
informal sector. 1/ Given the scarcity of affordable housing, there is a
considerable demand for COHAB housing.  Despite minimum or no advertising by
COHABs, waiting lists of 50,000 to 60,000 families in large metropolitan
areas are not uncommon. Selection procedures are determined by each COHAB
and vary considerably from a simple "first come, first served" system to a
complex computerized multi-criteria ranking.
3.17      After the selection has been completed, all the loans previously
made by BNH for a given project are consolidated and refinanced as a market-
ing loan to be amortized over a period varying from 15 to 25 years. This
loan, allocated between different housing units on a basis of their relative
cost, determines the liabilities of final beneficiaries to the COHAB.
3.18      COHABs units are sold at cost--often 35% to 50% below their market
price. To prevent the possibility of speculation, the COHABs use a hire-
purchase system, under which the title is transferred only after the final
payment is made. Beneficiaries are allowed to sell their homes during the
repayment period but only with the consent of the COHAB, which often has
the right of first refusal and in all cases requires the new owners to be
within the PLANHAP target population. Overall, house ownership in COHAB
complexes appears stable: in a 1977 census conducted of all its projects,
some up to 10 years old, COHAB-PE found between 70% and 80% of the original
families still on site.
1/   For the self-employed, a card stating the applicant's contribution to
the national health insurance (INPS) is required.

C. COHAB-SP,? COHAB-PE, URBIS
3.19      The three COHABs examined differ in operating style, pc=.+ormance,
and efficiency. COHAB-PE is well organized and managed, with well-developed
and operational systems and consistently good production over the past three
years.  COHAB-SP has been gohlg through changes and has not yet evolved a
smoothly functioning structu-re and systems, yet its performance has improved
impressively over the past twio vears. URBIS faces serious organizational
problems. Despite this, URBIS has performed quite well over the past two
years and should be able to improve this level of performance in the future.
Both COHAB-SP and URBIS are subject to CEBRAE management diagnoses studies
(see para 2.29(g)).
COARB-SP (Companhia Metropolitana de Habitacao de Sao Paulo)
3. 20      Structure.  CGuI'B-3P cerates in the metroa-litan area of Sao Paulo,
which encompasses 37 municipalities with a 1977 total population of over 11
million inhabitants. Its dominant shareholder and controlling authority is
the municipality of Sao Paulo.  The COH)AB is governed by a Board of Directors
consisting of a President and two Councilors elected by t.he General Assembly,
and managed by an Executive Committee, consisting of the President and five
directors. Directors are elected for two-year renewable terms.
3.21      The present interna'l structure consists of the President's office,
which includes the Legal Advisor, and four Directorates ksee Chart 19159).
The Directorate of Real Estate is responsible for land search, security of
unoccupied land owned by the COHAR, and maintenance of unoccupied COHAB
buildings. The Administration Directorate is responsible for maintaining
office buildings, personnel and general services. The Planning and Works
Directorate is responsible for all design, detailed engineering, preparation
of documents to be submitted to KNH for construction loan approval, procure-
ment, and supervision of  orks.  The Urban Recuperation Directorate is
resoonsible for research, market analysis, the PROFILURB and FICAM programs
(except for detailed design and supervision of work), provision of community
facilities, sales, collections, and community development. The Finance
Department is also a part of this directorate.  In July 1978 the staff of
COHAB-SP was 358 persons, many of whom had been hired during the past three
years.  Turnover at the professional and middle levels is low.
3.22      In general, the COHABs' directorates furnction reasonably well.  In
particular, the Planning and Works Directorate has shown a strong capacity
to design and execute housing projects. The major internal problem in
C()HAB-SP has been that the market analysis function in the Directorate of
Urban Recuperation and the design fun-ction in Planning and Works were essen-
tially independent, with the result that the projects designed and executed
were mostly aimed toward the upper end of the PLANEIAP target population.
The high cost of buildable land in Sao Paulo reinforces this tendency. Tn
the context of on-going reorganization of COlHAB-SP (para 3,26), steps wuld
be taken to improve interdepartmental coordination so that project planning
and design better reflects the demand profile of the COHABs' target population.



- 30 -
3.23      Selection of Beneficiaries.  Although steps are being taken to de-
velop a pipeline of projects that will significantly expand both the number
and the proportion of units that will be affordable to the very low-income
population.  ?OHAB-SP beneficiary selection procedures for recent projects
allocated units on a "first come, first served" basis, subject to the appli-
cants ability to afford the unit and residence near the project. This meant
that an embryo house (affordable to a family earning three minimum salaries)
could be sold to a family earning five. To correct this situation, COHAB-SP
is now establishing a computerized points system of inscription and selection
of beneficiaries, which matches more closely units' costs and beneficiaries'
income.
3.24      Performance.  COHAB-SP's performance has undergone a dramatic
improvement in the last two years, benefitting from both the new PLANHAP
rules and the appointment of a dynamic new president. Up to 1975, COHAB-SP
had completed only 3,597 units. By the end of 1977, 9,374 additional units
were completed, 30,423 were under construction or put out to tender (in-
cluding 2,833 sites and services) and 8,973 were awaiting bids. In 1977
alone, BNH approved loans for 21,777 new units to be built by COHAB-SP.
Over 13,000 units were sold between 1973 and 1977.
3.25      Complementing its construction and marketing activities COHAB-SP
has developed a community development program for the residents of its
housing complexes. Teams of social workers provide orientation for the
new residents, establish residents associations, and help the community
organize their own vocational courses. A pilot self-help program has
recently been started, providing materials loans for low-income families
who already own a lot they wish to develop. Finally, in an effort to
reduce housing costs, COHAB-SP is conducting research to test the use of
soil cement in house construction.
3.26      Recognizing the need to strengthen the organization and expand
COHAB activities benefitting the lower-end of its target population, COHAB-
SP's president has initiated in 1976 a reorganization of COHAB's structure,
which resulted, among other changes, in the creation of the Urban Recupera-
tion Directorate to deal in a comprehensive way with the lowest-cost pro-
grams of PROFILURB-FICAM type. However, given the magnitude of the task
and incoming change of the state and municipal administration which imposed
a temporary hiring freeze, the reorganization (in particular approval of
new internal regulations) is not likely to be completed before the end of
1979.
3.27      IBRD Project Implementation.  The appraisal mission examined the
institutional structure and staffing of COHAB-SP and determined that no major
reorganization would be required and that the project could be implemented
within the existing structure. The overall responsibility for the IBRD
project (defining program mix, producing basic layouts, and ensuring that
final beneficiaries are from the target population) will rest with the
Directorate of Urban Recuperation, whose staff will be expanded pari passu
with program expansion. This arrangement was confirmed at negotiations.



- 31 -
COHAB-PE (Companhia de Habitacao Popular do Estado de Pernambuco)
3.28      Structure.  COHAB-PE is the result of a 1975 merger between two
COHABs, one state and one municipality (Recife), with 90% of shares being
owned by the state. The COHAB-PE operates throughout the state of Pernambuco
and is under the responsibility of the State Secretary of Sanitation, Housing
and Works, although it maintains a separate legal personality.
3.29      COHAB-PE operates through three directorates (see Chart 19158): the
Technical Directorate, responsible for project design and execution; the Real
Estate Directorate, responsible for marketing, collections, and management of
completed units; and the Financial Directorate, responsible for loan financing,
insurance, liquidation, cash management, disbursements, accounting and cost
control.
3.30      A notable feature of the COHAB-PE is a strong presidency supported
by a Legal Advisor, a Planning Advisory Unit, and a Social Research and Pro-
motion Advisory Unit. In addition, the Data Processing Center, the Procure-
ment Council and the Internal Auditor report directly to him.
3.31      The present operational structure of COHAB-PE was designed after
a six-month study by a state consulting group (CETEP) in 1976 and implemented
with CETEP assistance in 1977. The major purpose of the study was to insure
a continuity of policy and operations in face of changes in politically
appointed top management. Thus in each Directorate a post of manager, a
permanent staff member, was created under the politically appointed director.
As in the case of COHAB-SP, the majority of the staff of 373 were recruited
over the previous three years, and there is little turnover at the middle and
professional levels.
3.32      Overall, COHAB-PE is an efficient company--well organized, well
managed, and with a competent staff. Both management and staff appear
genuinely dedicated to meeting COHAB-PE's objectives and take a real pride
in their work. In general, the problems that pervade other COHABs have been
avoided or resolved in COHAB-PE.  The organization of the Directorates avoids
overlapping jurisdictions and promotes vertical integration of the decision
and design processes. The fact that COHAB-PE is a state company under the
responsibility of the State Secretary of Sanitation, Housing and Urban De-
velopment also overseeing the State Water Company eliminates most of the
problems of coordination with infrastructure agencies.
3.33      Performance.  Much of the improvement in COHAB-PE's performance
has come about in the last two to three years, coinciding with the changes
in the PLANHAP rules, but also reflecting the arrival and management style of
the current president. In the period 1975-77, COHAB-PE obtained approval from
BNH for projects totalling 28,000 housing units (compared with 1,200 in the
previous two years). At the end of 1977, 17,600 units were under construction
and projects for 13,000 additional units were being prepared for BNH approval.
Since 1965, COHAB-PE has completed and sold about 25,000 housing units distri-
buted among 60 projects.



- 32 -
3.34      An extensive community development program supports COHAB-PE's
primary function of supplying housing. Residents are provided with initial
orientation and assisted in forming residents associations. Organized this
way, the communities are able to solve many problems on their own and to deal
directly with the appropriate municipal agency without having to rely on
COHAB-PE staff. COHAB-PE has worked closely with the state vocational train-
ing agency, SENAC, to establish a variety of training programs with close to
9,000 students. Most of these programs are oriented to women working in their
homes; only few offer trade skills for men.
3.35      IBRD Project Implementation.  The project will be implemented within
the existing structure, with minor adjustments described below.
3.36      COHAB-PE's PROFILURB program is currently operating on an experi-
mental basis (200 units are under construction). To accommodate the proposed
expansion of the program, COHAB-PE's management designated an Urbanized Lot
Program Coordinator, reporting directly to the President, with the responsi-
bility of ensuring the smooth and efficient execution of PROFILURB and FICAM
programs. In addition, a new unit will be created within the Technical
Directorate (a) to provide technical assistance to project beneficiaries on
house building and improvement; and (b) to certify the works and the use of
materials. This unit will also establish a system of supply of building
materials to the beneficiaries of FICAM loans, using local suppliers. These
measures were confirmed at negotiations.
3.37      Economic Analysis.  Following the agreed selection criteria, all
subprojects to be submitted to the Bank must include a post-design economic
analysis to be carried out by BNH (paras 2.36-2.37). In Pernambuco, due to
the high quality of the staff, the possibility exists of carrying out an eco-
nomic analysis during, not only after, the design phase. This analysis would
contribute to the decision on the mix of units for a given site and help to
determine the impacts of different mixes on COHAB-PE's ability to reach its
target population. Such a system would be implemented on an experimental basis
for selected sub-projects to be financed by IBRD. 1/ COHAB-PE's willingness to
undertake this experiment was confirmed at negotiations.
URBIS (Habitacao e Urbanizacao da Bahia, S.A.)
3.38      Structure.  Established in 1965, URBIS is a state-wide mixed-economy
company under the State Secretary of Housing, Sanitation and Urban Development.
Its institutional structure does not materially differ from that of the other
COHABs comprising a Board of Directors of five members and an Executive Com-
mittee, consisting of three Directors--the Director-President, Administrative
Director, and Technical Director--serving renewable two-year terms (see Chart
19157).
I/   Methodology for this procedure is presented in the note on economic
analysis (available from the project file).



- 33 -
3.39      The Office of the President includes the Legal Advisor's office, a
Planning and Coordination Advisory Unit, and an Assistant to the President.
The Technical Directorate includes the Project Planning and Design Department
and the Department of Works. The Administrative Directorate includes the
Administrative, the Finance, and the Sales Departments.  URBIS also includes a
Social Department, whose head reports directly to the President. At present,
the total staff of 278 experiences little turnover at the professional and
middle management level.
3.40      Performance.  Between 1965 and 1974, URBIS built and sold 10,566
housing units. After a good performance between 1967 and 1970 (7,200 units
built), its production declined between 1971 and 1974 to 2,139 units. Intro-
duction of PLANHAP II and greater support for the low-income housing by the
new state administration (which took office in 1975) stimulated URBIS' pro-
duction. The number of housing units approved passed from 52 in 1975, to
2,523 in 1976 and 11,981 in 1977. As of December 31, 1977, URBIS had 7,400
units under construction (including 400 PROFILURB units), 3,600 units were in
tendering stage and projects for an additional 1,453 have been submitted for
BNH approval. Furthermore, URBIS is developing FICAM operations. BNH already
approved financing for 2,122 FICAM units and URBIS signed a convenio with the
State Secretariat of Social Welfare, to develop projects that would provide
some 5,000 FICAM loans to inhabitants of a low-income area of Salvador
(Narandiba) (see para 2.12).
3.41      Problems of URBIS.  URBIS faces a number of institutional problems
threatening its operational efficiency and further development of its programs.
The two most important are the lack of coordination with other agencies acting
in the field of urban development and top-heavy internal management structure.
(a) Coordination. Although coordination arrangements between
URBIS and the state and municipal agencies responsible
for provision of infrastructure and community facilities
are adequate and function reasonably well, there are
however a number of problems arising from the prolifera-
tion of agencies involved in housing and urban development:
the municipal planning agency (OCEPLAN), the metropolitan
region planning agency (CONDER), the State Urban Develop-
ment Company (CEDURB), the State Secretariat of Social
Welfare, the Company for Improvement of Alagados (AMASA),
a large low-income settlement on stilts (see para 1.13).
Their areas of action and their mandates often overlap. In
principle, URBIS is the sole financial and promoting agent
of BNH for PLANHAP and should coordinate all these efforts.
In practice, there was little cooperation. This has been
particularly disturbing in the case of CEDURB. CEDURB,
established in 1975, is responsible for urban development
operations throughout the state. To fulfill its mandate,
CEDURB was given the custody of large quantities of land
acquired by the state. In fact, CEDURB now controls the bulk
of the available land in the Salvador metropolitan area and



- 34 -
is developing three major projects (Narandiba, Cajazeira and
Caji). In theory, the low-income housing units within the
projects were to be designed by URBIS, which would also
execute and market them. In practice, CEDURB appeared anxious
to retain total planning control. Thus, for the first phase
of the Cajazeira project, URBIS was not involved in either
planning or design and was handed over final designs for units
it was to execute and market. Furthermore, in the long run,
restrictions of URBIS responsibilities regarding land acquisi-
tion would act as a continuing constraint on URBIS action.
(b) Internal Management. More than other COHABs, operating decisions
are centralized in the President's office. This is due in part
to the fact that the upper- and middle-level management is often
young and inexperienced. Another problem is inadequate physical
accommodations. The staff are scattered in six buildings that
are not even near to each other and which have totally inadequate
telephone communications. Conditions are so cramped that in some
divisions needed staff cannot be hired due to the lack of space.
3.42      IBRD Project Implementation.  Problems described above would have
to be corrected if URBIS is to successfully implement the proposed project
and to become a strong intermediary for the PLANHAP program. During appraisal,
they were discussed with the State Secretary of Housing, Urban Develop-
ment and Sanitation, URBIS' (and CEDURB's) overseer. During negotiations, it
was confirmed that:
(a) URBIS would be responsible for design of low-cost housing and
sites and services in the area of Narandiba, Caji, and Cajazeira,
which are part of larger CEDURB operations.
(b) The state would provide necessary financial resources and
legal instruments to allow URBIS to develop its own land
acquisition program.
(c) Steps would be taken to improve the physical facilities of URBIS.
3.43      At present, URBIS uses two staff members of the Technical Direc-
torate to supervise full-time the PROFILURB and FICAM programs. During
negotiations, it was agreed that this staff will expanded as required by the
development of these programs.
3.44      CEBRAE has initiated in July 1978 a full-scale management study of
URBIS. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Bank would be given an
opportunity to comment on the study and discuss its results and implementation
procedures with URBIS, BNH and the Secretary of Sanitation and Urban Develop-
ment (see para 2.28(g)).

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. The Borrower
Financial Position
4.01      The summary financial statements at Annex 3 show BNH's evolution
since 1971. The picture is one of growth, strength and liquidity. Total
assets were US$11.6 billion at the end of 1977, up 552% from US$2.1 billion
in 1971. The loan portfolio has grown even faster (620%) from US$1.5 bil-
lion to US$9.3 billion at an annual rate of 35%. The debt/equity ratio, 6:1
at the end of 1977, is conservative and has shown little variance over the
years; thus, growth has been balanced. Liquidity is good, evidenced by about
US$1.0 billion (9% of assets) in cash and marketable securities.
4.02      The FGTS, BNH's main source of funds, has been generating over
US$1.0 billion, net of withdrawals, in each of the last three years (US$1.5
billion in 1977). Although the rate of growth of the FGTS has declined in
recent years, other sources of funds have allowed BNH to continue its expan-
sion. Internally generated funds, including repayments from the outstanding
loan portfolio (US$1,187 million in 1977) now account for about 50% of all
sources. And BNH, in its role as Central Bank to the National Housing System,
is able to tap the voluntary savings of the SBPE to provide additional funds.
Thus, FGTS share declined from 82% of total BNH liabilities in 1971 to 69% in
1977; whereas deposits from SBPE and other liabilities grew from 5% to 16% of
the total in the same period. Foreign loans (IDB, AID, and IBRD) of US$120.4
million were about 1% of total liabilities at the end of 1977.
4.03      In 1974 the construction industries faced a liquidity crunch
affecting many of BNH's institutional borrowers. BNH established a liquidity
fund (Fundo de Assistencia de Liquidez-FAL), financed by contributions from
SBPE members, to help financial institutions in difficulty. Despite these
measures BNH was obliged to force the liquidation of six institutions. Debts
of these borrowers amounted to US$636 million, or 5.5% of BNH assets, at the
end of 1977. The loss reserve to cover possible losses from these liquida-
tions stood at US$233.6 million at the end of 1977.
4.04      BNH is able to draw substantial savings from the SBPE via the FAL,
which is obligatory, and other voluntary deposit arrangements. In 1977, for
example, SBPE deposits with BNH grew by US$198.1 million, contributing 5.5% to
total BNH sources of funds for the year. Given the rapid growth of voluntary
savings in Brazil, the potential for future transfers to other BNH programs
via these deposit mechanisms is significant.
4.05      During the 1971-1976 period, administrative expenses have remained
static at about 40% of service income, showing no economy of scale. Financial
expenses increased with respect to related revenues (loan income) from 69% in
1971 to 77% in 1976. BNH attributes increased costs to the decentralization
of headquarters operations to regional offices (see para 3.02).

Future Finances
4.06      Each year BNH is required to prepare a three-year investment pro-
gram (in UPCs) for the approval of the Minister of Interior. The 1978-1980
program, I/ totals US$12.3 billion equivalent, of which housing will receive
74%, sanitation 14% and urban development 12%. The 1978 budget of US$3.3
billion is 37% above the 1977 figure of US$2.4 billion, which, however, was
8% below 1976 reflecting anti-inflationary budget cuts imposed by the Federal
Government. In 1979 and 1980 the investment program is projected to grow by
35% and 3%, respectively, bringing average growth to 25% for the three-year
period. Low-income housing is expected to receive about 26% (US$3.23 billion)
of total investment funds.
Lending Policies and Cross-Subsidization
4.07      BNH is a government banking organization with social goals to pro-
mote low-cost housing, urban and regional development. To fulfill its mission
while ensuring its financial viability as a banking organization BNH has
developed lending policies which involve both sectoral and regional cross-
subsidization using variable interest rates (see para 1.24). In this way BNH
straddles its average cost of money (estimated at about 5%), yet still shows a
reasonable profit. Net income after tax in 1976 was US$100.5 million, about
7.5% of capital and reserves, and US$42.7 million, 3% of capital and reserves
in 1977, a year of reduced activity because of budget cuts referred to in para
4.06 above. Profit in the context of BNH is an indicator both of financial
viability and the limits of cross-subsidization lending policies. Inasmuch as
BNH lending programs are mainly financed from sources other than profit (FGTS,
SBPE deposits, etc.), which continue to grow satisfactorily, it would appear
that BNH operations are well-balanced.
PLANHAP Flow of Funds
4.08      Following the 1975 reform (see para 1.26), PLANHAP programs became
more widely accepted by the COHABs.  In 1977 PLANHAP estimates were actually
exceeded, 1% in number of approvals, and 26% in value. COS attributed the
large budgetary variance to the continued preference for higher cost finished
housing among the COHABs. Commitments to PROFILURB and FICAM, although
increasing, still lagged behind BNH targets.

PLANHAP programs from 1973-1977:

% Repayments/Disbursements    17.0          10.6       10.0        13.8
These figures show that PLANHAP is in a heavily net investment position.
Total disbursements to date are US$911.7 million vs. total repayments of
US$125.6 million. 1977 investments of US$386.5 million were matched by
only US$38.7 million in repayments. The disbursement budgets for 1978-1980,
calling for new investments of US$898.2, US$1,062.9, and US$1,270.0 million
would represent a significant net outflow of funds for BNH. Given BNH's
strength and access to new funds, however, PLANHAP investment requirements
should be readily met.
COHAB Repayments
4.10      COHAB payments to BNH have been punctual.  In 14 years of operations
BNH reports that agent's payments in default have only rarely exceeded 1% of
loans outstanding.  In part the good payment record is attributed to the state
and municipal guarantees required on BNH loans to COHABs.  Borrower payments
to the COHAB, on the other hand, are less satisfactory.  Although the situa-
tion has improved over the last five years, collections are an area of con-
tinuing concern (see para 4.27-4.30).
PLANHAP Incentives and COHAB Remuneration
4.11      The principal PLANHAP programs and their terms and conditions are
summarized at Annex 4. PLANHAP incentives to the COHABs fall into three
categories: the interest rate differential or spread, fees for planning and



- 38 -
supervision of project development, and other fees (for collections, sales
administration and community support). The COHABs may not resell improved
land or houses at a markup or profit. 1/ Hence, their main sources of income
are derived from the interest spread and fees.
4.12      The current interest formula rewards the COHABs building the highest
priced units. Thus, Sao Paulo is building apartments at an average cost of
485 UPC (US$7,150) and earns nearly 3% in interest spread; whereas Pernambuco
is building houses at about 350 UPCs (US$5,160) and earns a spread of only
about 2%. This effect runs counter to other regional development policies
favoring the Northeast; it acts as a disincentive to cost efficient opera-
tions; and it tends to detract from development of the lowest cost program,
PROFILURB, where the spread to the COHAB is lowest (1%).
4.13      The design and supervision fees, paid to COHABs during the design
and construction phases (see para 3.14), are capitalized in the sale price.
This mechanism adopted in 1973 has proved an adequate incentive for on-going
production of finished housing projects. However, COHABs officials consider
the fees inadequate for the PROFILURB and FICAM programs, where costs of
supervision and assistance to beneficiaries are estimated between 8% and 10%
of total project cost.
4.14      COS is aware of the distortions in the existing system of remunera-
tion to the COHABs. However, changes in the interest rate and fees can only
be made following a BNH-wide review. To prepare and accelerate this review,
BNH would undertake a study of incentives as part of the technical assistance
program (see para 2.29(d)).
4.15      In November 1978, BNH extended the term of PROFILURB from 15 to 25
years, raised the financing limit from 120 to 200 UPCs, and introduced a flat
minimum supervision fee and an extended grace period to beneficiaries. These
measures should make PROFILURB more easily affordable to the lowest strata of
the target population and more financially attractive to the COHABs.
Financial Management and Reporting
4.16      In principle BNH offers assistance to the COHABs in key areas of
financial management, such as capital budgeting and financial planning. In
fact, however, BNH has done little by way of technical assistance in this
area. The technical support unit of COS dealing with this matter is under-
staffed with only one trained accountant and one financial analyst respon-
sible for financial assistance and monitoring and evaluation of the COHABs.
As part of the technical assistance package, BNH would strengthen its finan-
cial management assistance to the COHABs, and form a Work Group to review
financial management and policy of the COHABs. The specific areas to be
included in the review are: the organization of financial functions, levels
of minimum capitalization, working capital and liquidity; the role and
responsibilities of State and Municipal Governments; asset management;
collections; cost control and cost accounting; long range financial planning;
and financial reporting (see para 2.29(b)).
1/   The sole exception is the commercial facilities program (FIEPAR) (see
Annex 4) relatively small in overall COHABs operations.



- 39 -
4.17      In 1975 the BNH Internal Audit Unit prepared an Accounting Manual
for use by the COHABs. This was an important step in the development of
common reporting standards. The usefulness of the Accounting Manual as
a tool for management control, however, is limited by a number of deficien-
cies: e.g., in the classification of assets and liabilities, the definition
of working capital, mixing of cash and accrual bases in tbe income statement
and the definition of depreciation. Improvement is also needed in the guide-
lines for comparative reporting, capital budgeting, and long range financial
planning. Some of the deficiencies in the Accounting Manual relate to efforts
to reduce income tax liability; most are the result of inadequate or outdated
practices.
4.18      The new Corporate Law 1/ and the new Tax Law, 2/ both effective in
Fiscal Year 1978 and applicable to all companies unless exempted by specific
legislation, embody sweeping changes. Among other merits, the new Corporate
Law sets forth systematized accounting requirements based on presently accepted
accounting norms. The Tax Law relies on the accounting norms contained in the
Corporate Law, in effect requiring all business entities to employ the new
accounting procedures. As part of technical assistance program, the Financial
Management Work Group (para. 4.16) would review and update the Accounting
Manual in conformity with the new legislation (see para. 2.29(b)). The first
revision should be completed by December 1978 to be reviewed by COHABs and the
Bank.
B. The Intermediaries
Financial Position of COHAB-SP, COHAB-PE and URBIS 3/
4.19      COHAB-SP.  Year end 1977 showed COHAB-SP with high liquidity (US$10.0
million in cash equivalents), a relatively small loan portfolio (US$14.3 mil-
lion equivalent), and an inventory of works in progress of US$60.5 million
(including US$16.4 million of land acquired for project development). Total
assets of US$86.8 million were balanced by US$$9.0 million of paid in capital
and reserves and US$77.8 million in debt, all but US$0.4 million from BNH.
The debt/equity Ratio of 9:1 at year end 1977 is conservative for the COHABs.
Although only marginally profitable in 1976 (US$0.2 million), COHAB-SP earned
US$2.1 million in 1977.
4.20      Future  Finances.  The heavy investment program is projected to
raise COHAB-SP's assets to US$193.8 million at year-end 1978, to US$527.6 mil-
lion by 1980 and to US$977.3 million in 1983, with return on equity averaging
above 30% per annum. These figures assume uninterrupted high volumes of pro-
duction. Costs have been fully allowed for, thus, the projections tend to

21   Decree Law 1598 of December 26, 1977.
3/   At Annex 5 are summary balance sheets and income statements for the three
COHABs for the years 1975-1977. Projections of financial statements and
sources and uses of funds for the 1978-1983 period are available on the
project file.



- 40 -
confirm the adequacy of the present incentive structure of PLANHAP to insure
the financial viability of the COHABs. Sao Paulo's projected profitability
is particularly high because of the progressive interest rate differential
and Sao Paulo's higher unit costs. Thus, from 1978-1983 interest income is
projected to grow from US$5.5 million to US$45.8 million vs. interest expense
(to BNH) of US$1.7 million and US$21.6 million. Among projected sources of
funds, repayments from beneficiaries (only 8.6% in 1978) become increasingly
important, growing to US$85.3 million in 1983 or 34.1% of total funds flow.
As a consequence reliance on BNH financing would be reduced from 84% in 1978
to 58.6% in 1983.
4.21       COHAB-PE.  At year end 1977 COHAB-PE showed total assets of US$90.3
million, of which US$30.9 million in loan portfolio and US$46.2 million in work
in progress. COHAB-PE showed a small profit in 1977, US$452,000. Although
liquidity was reasonably good (US$3.9 million in cash equivalents), periodic
cash shortages have been observed, a function primarily of COHAB-PE's aggres-
sive policy of financing contractors' purchases of materials (COHAB-PE advances
up to 20% of contract value for wholesale purchase of non-perishable materials
as a way of lowering building costs). Thus, advances to contractors totalled
US$5.5 million at 1977 year end. Of total liabilities US$84.5 million was
in long-term debt to BNH, US$2.9 million in equity and the remainder in short-
term liabilities. The debt/equity ratio of 30:1 was abnormally high, reflect-
ing COHAB-PE's basic under-capitalization.  COHAB-PE has further weakened its
capital base by investing its limited resources in community facilities (US$1.3
million in 1977), which are normally paid for by the State.
4.22      The State of Pernambuco is aware of the need to strengthen COHAB-
PE's capital. A subscription of CR$7 million (US$388,000) was paid in July
1978, and the State plans to pay in an additional Cr$33 million (US$1.8
million) by February 1979. The added capital will enable COHAB-PE to com-
plete a badly needed new headquarters building on land already owned for
this purpose and to increase working capital. A further capital increase
is expected from a revaluation of fixed assets required by the new law.
4.23      Future Finrances.  Rather more typical of most COHAB's in Brazil
COHAB-PE's projected statement of sources and uses of funds shows a
high dependence on BNH (93.4% of all sources in 1978 and 79.1% in 1983).
Repayments from beneficiaries rise from 4% of sources (US$2 million) in 1978
to 19% (US$44.5 million) in 1983. COHAB-PE's dependence on BNH is a function
both of its low capital base and aggresive growth projections. Total invest-
ment in housing programs of US$38.7 million in 1978 is projected to grow to
US$82.2 million in 1980 and US$162.9 million in 1983.
4.24      URBIS.  URBIS at year end 1977 showed US$40.5 million in total
assets, including US$24.6 million in loan portfolio, US$9.7 million in work
in progress and US$3.9 million in short-term assets.  The volume of housing
units sold has been practically static over the past three years, reflecting
URBIS relative inactivity in the 1975-1977 period. Liquidity, about 10% of
assets, is adequate for URBIS present level of activity. Capital and reserves
were US$2.5 million vs. debt obligations of US$38.0 million (of which US$35.9
million in long-term debt to BNH); thus debt/equity ratio is 15:1, likewise
satisfactory for URBIS' low volume of business in 1977. The income statements
show that URBIS has received donations from the State of US$1.2 million in



- 41 -
1976 and US$0.5 million in 1977 in order to operate at or near zero profit-
ability. Considering projected increases in activity in 1978-1983, and
URBIS critical need for efficient office space, it is likely thnat URBIS
capital will have to be increased during 1979-1980 period. During negotia-
tions assurances were obtained from the state on this matter.
Financial Management of COHABs
4.25      Responsibility for Financial Functions.  In COHAB-SP and URBIS
there is no financial director, and the financial manager does not report
directly to the President. COHAB-PE has a fully vested financial directorate
which may be more appropriate. In addition, each COHAB is somewhat under-
staffed in financial areas, especially considering the rapid expansion of
construction and sales programmed in the near future. It was confirmed at
negotiations that the staff will be increased as required to manage the
planned expansion.
4.26      Cost Control.  In the context of the COHABs cost-control has two
aspects: internally, it is necessary to allocate incomes, expenses and over-
head by department or functions; and externally, in the area of contractor
relations, significant cost reductions may be realized by better control of
cost estimating, of bidding procedures and by monitoring of contractor ex-
penditures. Although COHAB-SP and COHAB-PE appear to be running cost-con-
scious and efficient operations, none of the COHABs has a comprehensive cost
accounting system. COHAB-PE is implementing a cost control unit in conjunc-
tion with the CETEP management study; and the development of cost-control
systems for the other two COHABs, will be studied by the Financial Management
Work Group (see para 4.16).
4.27      Collections have been an area of continuing concern.  In the early
1970s as many as 30% of COHAB beneficiaries were in default (defined as more
than 90 days in arrears). Factors affecting punctuality, besides family
income, are the availability of infrastructure and community services; and
the efficiency of the COHABs' initial selection process and of its collection
system. In concerted effort BNH and the COHABs have made improvements in each
of these areas. These efforts, together with the fiscal benefit (para 1.25),
which is applied directly to beneficiaries' monthly payments, have signifi-
cantly improved the payment record of COHAB beneficiaries. In 1977, 83% of
COHAB borrowers were able to qualify for the fiscal benefit, having paid up
all installments of the previous year. This is only slightly below the index
of all SFH borowers, 85%.
4.28      COHAB-PE has a well organized collection system, with computerized
control of its 25,000 accounts receivable and an escalating collection policy.
Beneficiaries 30 days in arrears are notified at the local credit bureau;
those 90 days in arrears are declared in default and are automatically re-
ferred to the Legal Advisor, wnich initiate.s a judicial process, a four to six
month procedure. Evictions total only three to five per month but are chosen
selectively for their demonstration effect. These policies have resulted in
sharply improved payments. Actual collections (from all classes of borrowers)
are running at 98% of monthly billings. Thus, payments are essentially in
equilibrium.



- 42 -
4.29      COHAB-SP has improved its arrearages from 17.4% in 1976 to 12.8%
in 1977. Actual collections in Sao Paulo are running in excess of monthly
billings (112% in December 1977), showing the efficacy of its collection
policies which are similar to those in Pernambuco.
4.30      URBIS collections gave cause for concern:  during appraisal the
amount of arrears was unknown, payments were not analyzed properly between
amortization and interest, and collection policies were weak and confused.
URBIS is aware of the need to improve collections and is in the process of
computerizing accounts receivable. By October 1978 two-thirds of benefi-
ciaries' accounts were computerized with marked improvement in control and
accuracy. URBIS expects to complete the computer transfer and to bring
collections under effective control by December 1978.
4.31      Financial Planning and Budgeting.  All of the COHABs are relatively
weak in these areas which are in an early stage of development and implemen-
tation. Therefore, guidelines are lacking as to methodology and formats for
presentation; coordination between physical and financial planning is poor;
and responsibility for this function is not clearly defined. Improvement of
financial planning and budgeting would be a priority item for the Financial
Management Work Group, to be established by BNH (see para 4.16). In addi-
tion, it was confirmed at negotiations that the three COHABs would prepare
each year financial statements for the coming three-year period, which is
consistent with BNH's own budgeting cycle.
4.32      Auditing.  All of the COHABs are subject to external audit from
the State and Municipal Governments and from BNH's Audit Unit. In addition,
COHAB-SP and COHAB-PE have external audits performed by independent commercial
firms. It was confirmed at negotiations that URBIS will engage independent
auditors, beginning with the financial statement of the fiscal year 1978.
Subject to this agreement, auditing arrangements are satisfactory. Although
internal audit functions are not well developed, COHAB-PE is implementing an
internal audit unit as part of the CETEP reorganization scheme. The CEBRAE
diagnoses are expected to include recommendations to introduce internal
audit in the other COHABs (see para 2.28(g)).
C. Cost Recovery and Project Affordability
Cost Recovery
4.33      In accordance with standard BNH and COHAB practice, the following
procedures will be used to recover project costs:
(a) all costs incurred by COHAB and financed by BNH (90% of the
project costs) are included in the final sale price of the unit
(see para 2.23) and are thus recovered directly and completely
from the beneficiaries;
(b)  water, sewerage, and electricity services (approximately 5% of
the project costs) are provided by the state utility companies,
for which the project beneficiaries pay the city-wide standard
monthly charges for these services; and



- 43 -
(c) other infrastructure--roads, drainage--and community
facilities are provided by the municipality or the
appropriate state agency and are recovered through
property taxes or general taxation.
4.34      PLANHAP beneficiaries' monthly payments include:  amortization of
principal, interest, insurance, and fees for collection and administration and
for community development. Principal is amortized according to the BNH system
of constant amortizations (SAC) in equal monthly installments. Since interest
is paid on the declining balance of outstanding principal, the monthly payment
decreases in real terms over time.
4.35      COHABs are protected against inflationary loss by the present
indexation system. Beneficiaries' payments are revalued once a year for
the following twelve months by the amount of the previous year's ORTN index,
(30.5% in 1978), but COHAB payments to BNH are adjusted quarterly based on the
current ORTN index; thus, under conditions of stable or declining inflation
rates, the COHABs receive from beneficiaries somewhat more than they owe BNH.
Furthermore, new beneficiaries pay a Salary Equivalency Coefficient (CES--
currently 15%), on first year payments until the following revaluation.
Finally, BNH guarantees the COHABs against possible loss due to inflation.
Affordability
4.36      The initial monthly payment is used by BNH to determine whether
a family can afford a given shelter unit. The maximum percentage of income
that a family can spend on housing is a function of income and family size.
BNH norms recognize that the monthly payment represents only a portion of
housing expenditures. The maximum percentage vary from the low of 5% for a
family of 10 or more members with a monthly income of 8 UPC (US$118) to the
high of 25% for a family of five members or less with a monthly income between
20 and 22 UPC (US$295 to US$325).
4.37      Listed in Table 4.4 are housing options for each of the three COHABs
along with sale prices, monthly payments, required minimum income levels, and
the percentiles reached of the inscription lists and urban households. The
lowest-cost urbanized lots reach the 5th percentile of urban households in Sao
Paulo, the 12th percentile in Pernambuco, and the 10th percentile in Bahia.
The squatter upgrading project in Recife will reach down to the 10th percentile.
When only the households on the COHABs inscription list are considered, urban-
ized lots are affordable to virtually all families in the Sao Paulo list and
reach to the 4th percentile of families on the Pernambuco and Bahia lists.

/1 The sale price are in January 1979 prices and include  the following for all three cities:  terracing, on-lot construction, on-lot
infrastructure connections. fees for planning and construction supervision (6% of construction costs), BNH administration fee (1%),
interest during construction.   In Sao Paulo and Pernambuco, the price of land is also inpluded.  The sale price exclude  on-site
but off-lot infrastructure (roads; water, sewerage, and drainage mains), comfunitY facilities and, in Bahia, land. (Note: l UPC=USt14.75
/2  The monthly payment is the sum of the following:          sale price
a)  Amortization (at a constant rate for 25 years) =         300
b)  Interest on the principal outstanding: 1% per year for units up to 200, then increasing   ^aduallv so 6% Per YeF for 500 UPCO nits.

/3 BNE has set standards for the maximum percentage of income families of different sizes and income levels ,are alloved to spend on
BNH-financed housing. For families with five or fewer members, the level are as follows: monthly income of 8 UPC (US$118) or less,
13%; monthly income of 9-12 UPC (US$133-177), 18%; monthly income of 13-16 UPC (US$192-236), 20%; monthly income of 17-20 UPC (US$251295),
22%; and monthly income from 21-22 UPC (US$310-325), 25%.  Since this family size category includes most families inscribed in
the three COEABs, (78% in Sao Paulo, 72% in Recife, and 82% in Salvador), all affordability calculations are based on this group.
/4  The minimum salary in 1978 averaged US$77 (5.2 UPC) in Sao Paulo and US$61 (4.1 UPC) in  Recife and Salvador.
/5  For each of the three cities, calculations were made for two sizes of FICAM loans:  the smaller one is sufficient to purchase
materials for an embryo house; the larger one, for a one bedroom house.
/6  Despite the fact that the embryo is more expensive than the sanitary core plus FICAM, they both have the same monthly
payments.  The sanitary core option, which comes under PROFILURB, has higher TAC and TCA charges.

4.38      PLANHAP beneficiaries are eligible to receive FICAM loans of up to
300 UPC's for house completion or improvement, with repayment terms the same
as for purchase of a PLANHAP unit. However, the total monthly payment for
both PROFILURB or house purchase plus FICAM loans cannot exceed BNH standards
for percentage of family income to be spent on housing, and the total value of
both cannot exceed 500 UPCs.
4.39      A complete view of housing expenditures should also take into
account minimum utility payments for water, sewerage, gas, and electricity,
ranging between 0.81 UPC (US$11.95) and 0.87 UPC (US$12.83) per month; and
the fiscal benefit rebate (see para. 1.25). The minimum rebate, Cr$900
(US$50), represents on the average 25% of the annual payments for urbanized
lot and embryo house options, and thus reduces the payment burden. Total
housing costs (monthly payment plus utilities minus the fiscal benefit) for
lower-cost shelter options represent 20% to 25% of the required minimum
income of families eligible for these units. 1/ According to the 1974-1975
family expenditure survey by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statis-
tics, this figure is about the norm for housing expenditures of low-income
households.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
5.01      This loan, the first to the Brazilian housing sector, will support
a program providing about 41,800 sites and services units, 19,500 units of
embryo, semi-finished and finished housing, about 23,800 materials loans,
and funds to upgrade 7,200 squatter housing units. Over 80,000 families, 2/
400,000 individuals, should receive a range of benefits including improved
infrastructure, housing, and community facilities, with concomitant improve-
ments in levels of health and education. An estimated 70,000 man-years of
employment in construction activities will be generated directly by the project.
5.02      While the direct impact of this project will be significant, the
project will also seek to demonstrate the viability and replicability of these
lower-cost housing options on a larger scale. To this end, project implemen-
tation, to be handled by BNH and the COHABs, will follow standard procedures
already proven effective in managing construction and sale of the units and re-
covering costs. Further, the funds in Part B of the loan will support 10,000
PROFILURB units outside the three main project areas. Technical assistance, an
integral part of the program, is to be channelled through BNH, and thus made
available to COHABs throughout the country.
1/   Tabulation available from the project file.
2/   Assuming that 50% of the FICAM loans beneficiaries will also benefit from
the PROFILURB loans under the project.



- 46 -
B. Urban Poverty Impact
5.03      The urban poverty impact was calculated using the Brazilian defi-
nition for the urban poverty group, families earning less than three mini-
mum salaries. It is estimated that 91% of the families benefitting from this
project would be in this group. Assuming that all sites and services units,
FICAM loans, the squatter upgrading component, the embryo houses in Sao Paulo,
about one-half of the completed housing in Recife and Salvador, and a propor-
tional share of the infrastructure costs will benefit families in the poverty
group, 82% of project costs will generate direct benefits for the urban poor.
C. Economic Analysis
5.04      Given the sectoral nature of the project, it was difficult to carry
out an economic evaluation for the project as a whole: several subprojects to
be submitted for Bank approval are still in the preliminary stages of prepara-
tion. However, analysis has been done for sample subprojects--one from each
of three COHABs in Sao Paulo, Pernambuco, and Bahia--which were recently sub-
mitted to BNH for approval, or which will be submitted this year. No specific
analysis has been conducted for the FICAM loans, but costs and benefits of
urbanized lot and embryo house consolidation have been included in the analy-
sis for these three sample subprojects.
5.05      The subprojects chosen from Recife and from Salvador contain a
series of options, including urbanized lots, embryo houses, finished housing,
and apartments. The Sao Paulo subproject contains only urbanized lots and
embryo houses. The average unit cost in all three sites can be afforded by
families earning below or about three regional minimum salaries. Details
of the subprojects are shown in Annex 6.
Costs
5.06      Included in project costs are the following:
(a) market value of land;
(b) construction and earthworks;
(c) planning and supervision, expenses of the COHABs,
and administrative expenses of BNH;
(d) all on-site infrastructure;
(e) all community facilities;
(f) additional construction costs incurred by the beneficiary
in developing the urbanized lots and embryo houses into
one-bedroom dwellings. It was assumed this consolidation
takes place within two years from the time a beneficiary
receives his unit;



-47 -
(g) yearly maintenance costs (estimated at 3% of construction
costs) and yearly COHAB operating costs (estimated at 7.2
UPC per unit or about 2% of construction costs); and
(h) the foreign exchange component estimated at 26% for Sao
Paulo and 25% for Recife and Salvador was shadow priced
at 1.3, the shadow exchange rate used for Brazil by Bank
economists.
Benefits
5.07      Included in project benefits are the following:
(a) imputed market rent levels for each city, differentiated
by zones of housing quality and housing unit size. The
data were drawn from an ongoing BNH study which is
updated quarterly. For sites and services, it was assumed
that imputed rents equaled 50% of the rent of a one-bedroom
house during the two years needed for consolidation, and
then 100% of the rent for a one-bedroom house in the years
following; and
(b) minimum charges for water, sewerage, and electricity. In the
case of water and sewerage, use of these is a conservative esti-
mate of the economic value of utilities, since the charges are
generally cross-subsidized.
Results
5.08      Internal rates of return (IRR) were computed for each project and
the following sensitivity tests were conducted: (a) construction costs
increased by 10%; (b) setting imputed rents for developed urbanized lots at
85% of the value of a one-bedroom house; and (c) a general 20% reduction in
benefits. As can be seen in the table 5.1 below, all projects in all cases
have rates of return above 12%. For the basic case, the IRRs are 17% for Sao
Paulo, 22% for Recife, and 23% for Salvador, thus demonstrating the projects
are economically justified.

D. Risks
5.09      Project risks appear in four areas:  PROFILURB implementation,
interagency coordination, squatter upgrading, and the subprojects' location.
PROFILURB Implementation
5.10      The three COHABs have had limited experience with the PROFILURB
program and their implementation capacity varies. However, the resulting
risk of inadequate executing capacity is considered manageable for the fol-
lowing reasons: (a) many components required for a sites and services pro-
gram--such as selection, commercialization, and cost recovery mechanisms--
have already been established for the COHABs' traditional housing projects;
(b) specific steps are being taken by each COHAB to ensure adequate funding
and staffing for functions, such as on-site technical assistance, that are
new to the COHABs and specific to PROFILURB projects. These steps were
confirmed at negotiations; (c) the availability of land for project sites
has been reviewed, and appears adequate for the next 18 months, as far ahead
as the COHABs are able to consider land purchases; (d) the Bank-financed pro-
gram represents only a portion (70%) of the total number of PROFILURB sites
to be developed by the three COHABs, thus ensuring that even if there is some
delay in overall program development, the Bank-financed program would not be
adversely affected; and (e) disbursement procedures for the project were
designed to permit a degree of flexibility in allocating funds between COHABs
in function of their performance (para. 2.45).
Inter-Agency Coordination
5.11      Timely provision of infrastructure during project construction is
dependent on the state utility companies, state government and the municipali-
ties.  To minimize the risk of delays, BNH requires each COHAB, when submitting
a project for its approval, to present undertakings from the relevant agencies
assuring their commitment to provide the infrastructure on time. This require-
ment will also apply to the subprojects financed under the Bank loan. In addi-
tion, the states of Pernambuco and Bahia and the municipality of Sao Paulo
will be parties to the loan agreement between the Bank and BNH.  In the two
states, the PLANHAP coordinator--the Secretariat of Housing, Urban Development,
and Sanitation--oversees both the COHABs and the state water companies, which
should facilitate coordination.
Squatter Upgrading
5.12      The squatter upgrading component in Recife will represent a new
undertaking for COHAB-PE and the metropolitan planning agency, FIDEM, and one
of the first operations of this kind for BNH. Its success will require close
cooperation between the two agencies and BNH, and the support of the state
government in order to complement the infrastructure provision with social
and economic programs, which would seek to raise the income of project benefi-
ciaries. In addition, the complex and delicate question of tenure regulariza-
tion will require close attention of all parties involved. During appraisal,



- 49 -
appraisal, working arrangements for the cooperation and resolution of tenure
issue were discussed (see para 2.20). At negotiations, assurances were
obtained from COHAB-PE, BNH and the State Government of Pernambuco that they
will continue to collaborate in project design, financing and execution.
5.13      It is clear that this component of the project presents greater
risks than the others. Nevertheless, it is believed that in view of the
potential pay-off these risks should be accepted.
Project Location
5.14      With high land prices in the three metropolitan areas, frequently
only sites on the city outskirts can be procured for COHAB projects. Many
families to be selected for PROFILURB sites are likely to be involved in
services and informal sector employment in the city center, and the time
and cost of commuting could be a serious problem. To minimize this risk,
several measures are proposed. First, the site location will be a parameter
of design efficiency to be used as one of the project selection criteria
(see para 2.36(c)). To the extent that the market rent reflects access, the
location of the subproject will also affect the economic analysis. Second,
mixed developments--including apartments, embryo houses, as well as sites
and services, thus allowing cross-subsidization--will be encouraged. Third,
during appraisal, a sample of sites for the first twelve months was reviewed,
and it was ascertained that these have adequate access to centers of employ-
ment. Fourth, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from the states
of Bahia and Pernambuco and the municipality of Sao Paulo that (a) they will
use their legal power to facilitate land acquisition by COHABs; and (b) their
policy of employment location and public transport will take into account
location of COHAB operations.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED

Selected COHABs Subprojects
1.        To ensure that the Bank-established criteria for subproject
approval could be met, the appraisal mission reviewed in detail one typical,
recently-prepared subproject from each of the three COHABs. Issues of lo-
cation, design efficiency, average unit price and affordability, and eco-
nomic viability were all considered. On most points, the projects are
adequate to meet the criteria, and the modifications required are few
and minor.
2.        It should be noted that these particular subprojects will not
necessarily be financed by the Bank. However, they indicate that the COHABs
should have no major difficulty in presenting acceptable subprojects. Fol-
lowing are brief descriptions of the three subprojects reviewed by the
mission:
Recife - COHAB-PE: Maranguape I
3.   (a)  Size:  188 hectares
(b)  Location:  Ten kilometers northwest of the city center, near an
industrial park and directly between two other COHAB-PE projects.
Very good location.
Sale Price/Unit
(c)  Unit types                            No.of Units       (UPCs)
Urbanized Lots with Sanitary Core          910           112
Embryo Houses (27 m2)   2                  632           212
One-Bedroom Houses (35 m )               1,187           276
Two-Bedroom Houses (41 m2)               2,688           296
Three-Bedroom Houses (52 m2D             2,688        - 375
Duplex Houses (70 m2)                      304           410
Total Units                              8,409
Average Unit Price:   ?96 uPc
Monthly Payment:      2.16 UPC
Required Income:    12.00 UPC or 2.97 Regional Minimum Salaries 1/
(d)  Design:  The Maranguape project has a very efficient layout design
both in terms of land use and circulation/infrastructure network.
(e)  Economic Analysis
Net Present Value (11% discount rate): 2/       3,170,129 UPC
Internal Rate of Return (IRR)                   22%
Benefit Cost Ratio                              1.70
1/ With 300 additional urbanized lots replacing the duplex units, this project
would meet the criterion of being affordable to families earning three mini-
mum salaries or less. Such a minor change is being considered by the COHABs.
2/ Estimated opportunity cost of capital in Brazil.
