THIRD PORTS PROJECT
Loan and Project Sunmazy
Borrower:         Republic of Turkey
Beneficiaries:    1.  Turkish State Railways (TCDD)
2. Turkish Maritime Organization (TDI)
Amout:            US$134.5 million equivalent
Terms:      .     Seventeen years including four years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate
Relending Terms:  Part of the loan would be onlent to the beneficiaries on the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan. The
beneficiaries would bear the full foreign exchange risk.
Proiect           The proposed project is designed to assist the
Description:      Government in introducing modern container handling
technology to the ports system. The project would cover a
first phase of container port development designed to meet
traffic growth up to 1992. The loan would provide financing
for: (i) specialized equipment for handling containers at
four selected ports (Izmir, Baydarpasa, Mersin and Trabzon);
Cii) renewal of high priority items of floating equipment
required for the maintenance and construction of port
facilities; (iii) civil works for container berth
facilities; and (iv) technical assistance-for introducing
container handling technology including documentation,
operating procedures, maintenance and training.
Benefits and      The project would lead to direct savings in ship
Risks:            service time and reductions in cargo handling costs which
would be felt in lower increases in sea freight rates and
port tariffs. Benefits would also include savings from
avoided damage to goods, reduction in potential congestion
and reduced need for general cargo facilities. The project
would generate foreign exchange earnings by providing
support to Turkey's foreign trade and by facilitating
international transit traffic. Adverse developments in
transit traffic represent the major risk for the project.
Should conditions in the Gulf area return to normal in the
next 2-3 years, Gulf ports could again handle the major
traffic to Iran and Iraq by early 1990. In the event that
transit traffic to Iraq should decline, container capacity
at the Mersin port would be taken up chrough growth in
exports from Southeastern Turkey. As the transit trade to
Iran provides the only container traffic in the Black Sea, a
minimm development has been proposed for the port of
Trabzon. Should transit traffic in the Black Sea fall
substantially, the equipment at Trabzon could be relocated
at other ports. Risk analysis suggests that the project
would remain economic even if major reductions in transit
traffic should occur.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A THIRD PORTS PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$134.5 million to help finance
the foreign exchange cost of a Third Ports Project. The loan would have a
term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard
variable rate.
PART I - TME ECONOMY i/
2.      An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89) in
August/September 1984 and its findings are reflected in this section.
3.      Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 48 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1230 in
1983. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 47 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 19 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.
Background
4.      During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Industrial Schools Project (P-3956-TU), dated
April 18, 1985.



-2-
Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of public investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowings.  The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 1970s was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces. Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances which, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages. On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
system, the export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program. Implementation
of the adjustment program was carried out under a military regime during
September 1980 - November 1983 and since then by an elected government.
The Structural Adjustment Program -- 1980-84
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 and 1984
proved to be mixed, due in part to adverse economic developments on the
external front, slippages in the monetary program, a persistent shortfall in
Government revenues and the renewal of inflationary pressures.
8.       Real GNP expanded by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982.  In
1983, GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent, due in large part to the effects
of a bad harvest and a decline in the contribution of the foreign balance.
The growth rate rebounded in 1984 to an estimated 5.7 percent, supported by
favorable performance in the productive sectors with agricultural value added
growing at 3.6 percern and industrial value added at 9.6 percent. Capacity
utilization rates in private industry in 1984 are estimated to have risen by
about 5 percent to an average rate of 72 percent. On the expenditure side,
the average annual real rate of growth of public fixed investment has been
contained to 3.1 percent over the 1980-84 period while the growth rate of
private investment has improved systematically from -L7.3 percent in 1980 to
4.8 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.4 percent in 1984. Private
consumption, which had actually fallen by 5 percent in 1980, grew at
4.9 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.0 percent in 1984. On the other hand,
helped by strict budgetary discipline, the rate of growth of public
consumption declined from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1983.
Estimates for 1984 suggest a modest growth of 2.4 percent.



-3-
9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average
rate of increase in the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981
and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. This rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and commercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983 as well as an unexpected increase in the budget deficit.
The resulting liquidity expansion, in conjunction with a lowering of nominal
deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the expense of savings.
10.      Inflation accelerated further in the first half of 1984, although it
moderated in the second half. The average inflation for 1984 is estimated at
a little over 50 percent. The major factors that contributed to the worsening
of the inflationary situation were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agriculture product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other important inflationary factors included substantial "catch up"
increases of SEE prices and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira- In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues. Given the tight monetary and fiscal
programs likely to be agreed upon with the IMF as part of a new standby
agreement (para. 25), the expectations are that inflation will decline this
year.
11.      Commercial bank interest rates, which were deregulated in July 1980,
have increased substantially and are now positive in real terms. As a result,
total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981
this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 103 percent and time
deposits by 274 percent. Growth in total deposits slowed after 1982, and in
1983 and 1984 they grew at 53 percent and 42 percent respectively. The
bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook
depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds into the larger
banks. The Goverrunent averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector and
undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole. A
new banking law was enacted in June 1983 which covered many of the
recommendations made in the Bank's report on the Financial Sector
(No. 4459-TU). These included measures to reduce the undercapitalization of
banks, place limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the
establishment of branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the
interlocking between banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance
scheme, and increase the role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the
banking sector. A new law is currently before Parliament which will further
the banking reform process by introducing standardized accounting for banks
and improved procedures for handling non-performing loans. The Government
also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation by reducing
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Separately, the
Government has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge).



-4-
12.      The Government is committed to maintaining an interest rate structure
for deposits which is positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding more or less positive real returns since end-1983, with interest
rates ranging from 45 to 53 percent depending upon the term of the deposit.
While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to save, they
have also meant high borrowing costs. Nominal interest rates range from 60 to
80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because of the high
intermediation costs of the commercial banks and their widely prevalent
practice of requiring compensating balances. The interest rate differentials
between preferential and non-preferential credits and among preferential
credits are large and need to be reduced. The Government has reaffirmed its
determination to achieve positive real rates on all lending by a combination
of bringing down inflation and phasing out interest rate subsidies on
preferential credits. In January 1985, it eliminated preferential interest
rates on short-term export credits. High market interest rates, together with
the limited availability of credit, have led to considerable liquidity
problems for the private business sector, particularly for businesses
supplying the domestic market. Measures are also needed to lower the
operating costs of banks, which are well above prevailing levels in comparable
countries.
13.      In the fiscal area, progress was evident from 1980 to 1982 but there
have been slippages in 1983 and 1984. The budget deficit to GNP ratio was
reduced from 5.3 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent in 1982, and the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) dropped sharply from 12.6 percent of GNP to
6.9 percent over the same period. However, the revenue to GNP ratio has been
declining over the past three years. From a high of 20.3 percent in 1981, it
has fallen sharply to an estimated 15.6 percent in 1984. Largely because of
this significant short-all in revenues, overall fiscal performance has
worsened since 1983 even though government expenditures have been considerably
curtailed (from 24.2 percent of GNP in 1980 to an estimated 20.8 percent in
1984) and budgetary transfers to SEEs as a percentage of GNP have fallen
steadily (from 4.8 percent in 1980 to an estimated 1.6 percent in 1984). The
budget deficit is estimated at 5.2 percent of GNP in 1984 and the PSBR at
8.8 percent. The downward trend in the Government revenue to GNP ratio
highlights the urgency of mobilizing additional public resources. As a step
in this direction, the Government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) in
January 1985.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were systematic through 1982
with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion (5.7 percent of
GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (2.2 percent of GNP) in 1982. However, in 1983
the current account deficit widened to about $2.1 billion (4.2 percent of GNP)
as merchandise exports and workers' remittances fell short of targets.
Exports rebounded strongly in 1984, gr^wing by 25 percent in dollar terms to
$7.1 billion.  Remittances, too, registered a higher than expected increase,
reaching $1.9 billion (up by 24 percent).  Concurrently, there was a continued
large inflow of deposits through the Dresdner scheme ($550 million in 1984).
Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish workers
Germany and automatically places these funds at the disposition of the Central
Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an interest rate
commensurate with the Euro-market rate. However, these increases were offset
by a sharp rise in merchandise imports to $10.8 billion (up by 16 percent in
dollar terms). As a result, the current account deficit in 1984 was
considerably higher than projected, reaching $2.1 billion (4.3 percent of
GNP), or about the same level as in 1983.



15.      On balance, merchandise export performance has been impressive over
the 1980-84 period, growing at an average annual rate of about 26 percent in
dollar terms. This growth has been led by the manufacturing sector and has
involved a rise in the share of exports to the Middle Eastern countries.
Industrial exports, comprised primarily of processed foods and textiles, have
risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to 72 percent -3- 1984. These
results were achieved by a combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate
policy and import liberalization) and direct (tax rebates, preferential
credits) measures to enhance the relative profitability of exports and offset
the traditional bias towards producing for the domestic market. The flexible
exchange rate policy was one of the most important factors contributing to the
growth of exports, together with the penetration of Turkish products in Middle
East markets.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, mostly due to exogenous
factors. Imports fell by 1.0 percent in dollar terms in 1982 and rose by only
4.4 percent in 1983. This reflected price decreases in both oil and non-oil
imports. Merchandise imports, however, increased substantially in value in
1984. The increase has been most significant in some of the groups (e.g. raw
materials and consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization
in terms of both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of
quantitative restrictions.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Government's Fifth Five Year Plan (1985-89) was approved by the
Grand National Assembly in July 1984. The Plan reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i)   an average arnual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise imports of
8.2 percent;
(iv)   an average-annual real rate of growthL of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment; and
(v)   a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989.

18.           While the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with the goals of
the structural adjustment program, certain targets seem optimistic in view of
both past performance and the immediate prospects for the economy. The Bank's
projections indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
well into 1987, implying a lower growth rate in GDP for the early years of the
Plan and a return to a higher growth path only in 1988. Key economic
variables in the Bank's latest projections for the period 1985-89 are
presented in Table 1:

19.      Bank projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.6 percent per annum on
average for the Plan period, with a low of 4.9 percent in the initial year of
the Plan (stabilization period) and a high of 6.3 percent for the final year
(growth period). Achievement of these growth rates will depend on the
performance of the productive sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.
This in turn will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination
to constrain the growth of the public sector in line with public resources and
to create a more favorable investment climate for the private sector. This
translates itself into a projected real growth per annum in public fixed
investment of about 5.0 percent on average for the Plan period, starting with
a modest increase in the early years. The comparable figure for private fixed
investment is 10.6 percent or a little more than twice the growth rate for
public fixed investment. These figures are consistent with the need to meet
the infrastructure requirements of the economy through the public investment
program, while providing for the capacity expansion of the private sector
necessary to meet the export and growth targets.
20.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average 9.4 percent
per annum in real terms. Merchandise imports, on the other hand, are
projected to grow more slowly in real terms through 1986 and then pick up to
an average 7.5 percent per annum in the terminal years of the Plan. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1986
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the Plan period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through the end of the Plan. The terminal year 1989 would show a.deficit of
approximately $2.0 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of $1.7 billion. -The
projected capital account is seen to remain manageable throughout the period
even in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization payments in
1985-87 arising from the debts rescheduled during the 1978-80 period and an
imposed constraint on foreign exchange reserves equivalent to at least two
months' imports. Consistent with the above is an average debt service ratio
for medium and long-term credits for the Plan period of 21.7 percent.
Including short-term debt the average debt service ratio for the Plan period
is 23.7 percent. Gross capital inflows required in 1989, on these
assumptions, would be about $5.9 billion, or about 38 percent higher than the
amount in 1984. Such an inflow is consistent with a decreasing debt service
ratio from 1986 onwards.
21.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community and the present
view nf future resources and export market possibilities, the Government's
somewhat more ambitious Plan targets would be feasible provided they are
supported by slightly higher export growth rates and greater success in the
mobilization of public resources. This may be more difficult to achieve in
the early (stabilization) phase of the Plan.
22.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions of
export and import growth rates, a downside risk case has also been developed.
With Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such



as the world economic outlook and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of 6.9 percent over the Plan period)
would lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments
situation, more external borrowing, a lower GDP growth (averaging about
4.8 percent per annum) and a higher debt service ratio (22-24 percent per
annum). In such a situation the Government would have little chance of
absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. However, given the Government's emphasis on export promotion aL.d the
determined efforts to counter the bias towards producing for the domestic
market, there is good reason to support the perspective set out in the
medium-term scenario presented in paragraphs 18 to 21.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
23.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in
convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers' credits and $1.2 billion of
non-guaranteed suppliers' credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or
partially converted into Turkish lira obligations. Following the resolution
of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official sources -- major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the
estimated total debt outstanding of $22.7 billion at end-1984, 81 percent
constituted medium and long-term debt (including IMF). Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
18 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme (para. 14). At
end-1984 the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme are
estimated to amount to $1.8 billion, which would represent about 45 percent of
Turkey's short-term external obligations and 8 percent of its total
outstanding debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 41 percent in 1984 to 32 percent in 1989. This translates into a
total debt outstanding forecast for 1989 of $30.6 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 23 percent of that total. Dresdner scheme inflows are
projected to be around $60C million per annum throughout this period and to
account for a large part of the rise in the ratio of short-term debt to total
debt outstanding.
24.      The debt service ratio fcr medium and long-term credits (in relation
to exports of goods and-non-factor services and workers' remittances)
increased from about 14.6 percent in 1981 to a peak of 28 percent in 1983 as a
result of a large repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier
OECD agreements. Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the
coming years and would average about $3.8 billion per year in 1985-89.
However, the debt service ratio is seen to decrease from an estimated
25 percent in 1984 to 19.8 percent in 1989. The debt burden should rerain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive further support from
international commercial and official sources. There have been encouraging



-9-
signs of Turkey's ability to enter the market for commercial borrowings. From
December 1983 to November 1984, Turkey had secured a little over $500 million
from commercial credits, constituting about 23 percent of the total external
credits received during this period. The Central Bank of Turkey recently
completed the syndication of a $500 million multi-component medium-term (seven
years) facility involving a large number of U.S., European, Jaranese and
Middle Eastern commercial banks as lead managers.
25.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. The Government purchased the full amount
authorized under the arrangement. The Government also purchased
three-quarters of a SDR 225 million one-year standby arrangement which was
approved by the IMF in April 1984 and replaced an earlier one-year arrangement
terminated at the request of the Government. Discussions are presently under
way on a further one-year standby arrangement.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
26.      Through March 31, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent $5383.5 million 1/
to Turkey, through 81 projects. Agriculture accounts for 19 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 24 percent, power for 13 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 32 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined (excluding structural
adjustment loans) average 49 percent of appraisal estimates, as compared to
50 percent for Tunisia and 49 percent for Morocco. As of March 31, 1985, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $239 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a suimnary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1985.
27.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structutal
adjustment lending (SAL) program. SAL V, which was approved in June 1984,
completed the series of five loans which the Bank had indicated would be the
maximum to a country. Significant progress has been achieved in the past five
years, but the task of restructuring is by no means over. The next phase will
involve the broadening and deepening of the adjustment process at the sectoral
level. Recent economic-developments have underlined the need for a
continuation of the stabilization program without giving up the goals of
1I/ Net of cancellations.



-10-
sectoral adjustment. Hence-the emphasis of Bank lending in the post-SAL
period would be on striking an appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment
lending designed to be quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in
the major sectors, and carefully formulated project lending focussing on high
priority projects principally in the agriculture, energy and transport sectors.
28.      Efforts have already been initiated to develop a series of sectoral
adjustment loans for the major sectors over the next few years, starting with
agriculture. The loans for the agriculture sector would help to support a
medium-term action program aimed at increasing the growth of primary
production and exports, rationalizing public investment and strengthening
sectoral institutions. Sectoral adjustment lending would also support
measures to address the structural problems of the financial sector and
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans could be developed include energy and transport.
29.      Project lending, which will continue to make up the major.ty of the
lending operations, will be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. A portion of project lending would be earmarked for the construction
or rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would
be guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
30.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic aJ. sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the five-year development
plan and studies of housing finance, telecommunications and electronics.
Topics to be covered in the future include a review of the public investment
program, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review of
transport investments and studies of engineering and agro-industries.
31.      This is the fourth loan to Turkey to be presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year.  Other loans being processed include an
agricultural sector adjustment loan, and loans for a fourth power transmission
project and power systems operations assistance.
32.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1985-89 (paras. 23 and 24). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 12.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 13 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.4 billion in 1984 to $14.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.7 billion in 1984 to $8.8 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 17 percent in 1989.



-11-
33.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND PORTS SUBSECTOR
34.      The Transport System.  The transport sector is vital to the
political, economic and administrative development of Turkey. The main
centers of population are widely spread throughout the country and long
distances have to be covered, frequently over difficult mountainous terrain
and under severe climatic conditions. Turkey is a vital transport bridge
between Europe and the Middle East. With its long sea coast, extending from
the Mediterranean into the Black Sea, it offers many ports for domestic and
international trade. The sector contributes about 10 percent of GDP, close to
$1.0 billion in foreign exchange earnings (1983184) and about 12 percent of
direct employment of the non-agricultural labor force. The backbone of
Turkey's transport system is the 8,200 km railway network and the 60,000 km
state and provincial road network. The road system also includes a vast
network of rural and forestry roads totalling around 490,000 km. This is
supplemented by private and state-owned international and coastal shipping
serving approximately 12 major ports as-well as many smaller facilities,
ranging from open roadsteads to small jetties. Turkish Airlines (THY), which
is government-owned, provides domestic and international flights and there is
also a small private charter airline. A system of civil and military oil
product pipelines links refineries and ports with consumers.
35.      The core of the transport system was largely completed in the early
sixties. Road transport has expanded at an average annual rate of about
8 percent during the 1970's and, despite an increase in fuel costs and a
period of slower economic growth, carries over 75 percent of freight traffic
and 95 percent of domestic passenger traffic. Railway freight traffic has
shown an absolute decline since the peak year of 1976, when it carried
20 percent of total freight traffic compared with 10 percent today. This
decline has not been the result of price competition from other modes, since
railway tariffs are low, but rather of the decline in railway freight
carrying capacity, due to out-dated traffic management and a shortage of
motive power. Coastal shipping has not grown significantly in recent years.
36.      Investment in the transport sector during the 1970's did not keep
pace with the development of the economy. Inadequate attention to
rehabilitation and modernization of transport facilities and equipment now
constitutes a bottleneck to economic growth. Roads are below standard for
present traffic levels, railway track is worn-out and the railways lack
adequate motive power and supporting facilities. Moreover, the imbalance
between overall economic needs and the scope and direction of transport
investment implies that a shift in the modal pattern of future investments is
needed in order to accommodate changes in demand and technology. For
instance, the current emphasis on the development of mining as well as the



-12-
development of the agricultural sector, particularly in production of cereals,
will lead to new bulk transport requirements, primarily on the railways. At
the same time, the continued growth of Turkey's foreign trade as well as
transit traffic to the Middle East requires the introduction of modern port
handling equipment to accommodate the growing volumes of container traffic,
expected to increase at up to 20 percent per year through 1990.
37.      Transport Policy, Planning, and Coordination.  Responsibility for
transport sector planning, policy development and investment is divided among
a large number of entities. The main agencies involved are: (a) the Ministry
of Transport, which significantly contributes to transport pclicy and also
oversees the main agencies in the transport sector - the Turkish Maritime
Organization (TDI), Turkish Cargo Lines (TCL), Turkish State Railways (TCDD)
and Turkish Airlines (THY); (b) the Ministry of Public Works, which is
primarily responsible for planning and execution of all transport
infrastructure projects including highways; (c) the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Rural Affairs which is responsible for planning, building and
maintaining the large network of rural and forestry roads; and (d) the State
Planning Organization (SPO) which coordinates and helps determine project
priorities.
38.      The need for improved coordination in the transport sector and for
ensuring an appropriate determination of modal, sector, and national
priorities has been recognized by the Government and was incorporated as a
major goal in its development plans. The Government's goals are embodied in
the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) prepared for the period 1983-1993.
Although there have been changes in the economy which affect the conclusions
of the NTMP, the basic targets remain valid and the plan provides a valuable
framework for the development of the sector. To take changing conditions into
account, the Government intends to update the NTMP every three years. The
first revision is scheduled for 1985. The NTMP is supported by five-year
programs for each transport agency. These programs are being established for
the period 1985-89 and will be updated annually under the proposed rolling
plan system. Specific guidelines for the development of the ports subsector
are provided by a National Ports Master Plan (NPMP) prepared by consultants in
1983.
39.      Bank Role in the Sector.  The Bank has been involved in detailed
discussions on policy and institutional issues in the transport sector and on
modal investment plans through preparation and implementation of Bank-financed
projects as well as through preparation of a Transport Sector Memorandum (TSM)
in 1983 and Transport Investment Plan Reviews in 1981 and 1984. Through its
involvement in the sector, the Bank has reached a broad agreement with the
Turkish authorities on the main issues and goals of the transport sector. The
Bank supports the Government plans to strengthen the planrn"g and
implementation capacity of transport agencies and the policy of establishing
cost based transport tariffs. The Bank has assisted the authorities with the
rationalization of investment programs through project preparation and
implementation in highways, railways and ports. Under the proposed project,
assistance would be provided to the Government for the introduction of a
modern system for handling containers, related improved documentation and
customs procedures, greater autonomy for ports, strengthening of planning and
accounting functions and comprehensive training programs. Similarly, improved
planning and better selection of highway projects as well as a shift from
force account work to construction by private contractors are being achieved



-13-
under two existing highway projects. Under a proposed Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan, one of the objectives is to achieve improved planning and
subproject selection for rural roads. A railway project under preparation
would attempt to remedy major deficiencies in railway operations and include
arrangements to reduce railway deficits.
40.      The Bank has participated in five projects in the transport sector
totalling $395.8 million equivalent (net of cancellations). These include two
loans to the port subsector (Loans 28-TU and 1741-TU) totalling
$91.3 million. A loan of $47 million was made in 1972 for a railway project
(Loan 893-TU) which is now completed, as well as two loans for highway
projects (Loans 2137-TU and 2439-TU), totalling $257.5 million, both of which
are ongoing and scheduled for completion in 1987 and 1990, respectively.
Project implementation has generally been satisfactory in achieving physical
targets although there have been some delays. Most problems have occurred in
implementing policy decisions. However, recently the Government has been
successful in developing a more coordinated and realistic approach towards
implementing transport sector policy.
41.      Only the Railway Project, which covered the first three-year tranche
of the Railways 1972-1977 Investment Plan and closed on June 30, 1981, has
been the subject of a Project Completion Report (PCR). This PCR is currently
under review by the Operations Evaluation Department. The main conclusions of
the PCR were that the project was largely successful in meeting its physical
objectives, especially track renewal. However, it failed to achieve
significant institutional and policy objectives, relating to improved
productivity and financial viability. These issues are being addressed anew
in the context of the proposed second railway project. Bank assistance in the
ports subsector has helped Turkish ports to handle increasing traffic in
recent years, in particular the rapid expansion of export and transit traffic,
at reasonable cost and greater efficiency. However, with the development of
containerized traffic in recent years, it has now become vital to introduce
modern equipment and handling techniques and up-to-date procedures to support
exports and reduce costs on imports and the transit trade.
42.      The Ports Subsector.  Turkey's long coastline of 7,300 km is served
by 12 major public ports, about 30 small municipal and other public ports, and
about 35 specialized ports owned by industrial complexes. Altogether, the
ports handled about 22 million tons of cargo in 1983, including 5 million tons
of coastal traffic and about 10 million tons of general cargo and transit
traffic. The major public ports serve the bulk of the country's foreign trade
handled by ship. Since 1979, foreign cargo has been growing at a rate of
almost 11 percent per year, while coastal traffic has increased at only
2 percent per year. In-addition, transit traffic to Iraq and Iran has grown
rapidly over the past five years, increasing from about 600,000 tons in 1979
to over 4 million tons in 1983. Despite the lack of appropriate handling
facilities, container traffic has also increased sharply, from 77,000 TEU in
1979 to about 200,000 TEU at present.
43.      Turkish ports generally have adequate capacity and ship waiting time
is tolerable. Although conditions vary from port to port, cargo handling
performance is reasonably satisfactory with general cargo throughputs



-14-
averaging about 450 to 500 tons per day. Productivity is expected to improve
further upon completion in 1985 of a program of rehabilitation and equipment
renewal, financed in part by the Bank. Maintenance practices are generally
satisfactory. Ongoing training programs started under the previous ports
project have assisted in improving port maintenance. However, container
operations, throughput and traffic control need to be improved. The growth of
foreign trade and the country's emphasis on exports, combined with major
increases in international containerized transit traffic, require the
introduction of modern container handling systems. In view of the specialized
nature of container operations, this traffic is likely to be concentrated in a
limited number of ports and will lead to considerable savings in ship service
time, ship waiting time, reduced handling costs and reduced cargo losses.
44.      Administration and Organization.  Port operations are under the
control of two separate institutions, namely the ports department of Turkish
Railways (TCDD) and the ports department of the Turkish Maritime
Organization (TDI), previously known as the Maritime Bank. Construction and
maintenance of port infrastructure are the responsiblity of the Directorate of
Railways, Ports and Airports Construction (DLH) in the Ministry of Public
Works.  Although TCDD and TDI provide satisfactory day-to-day port operations,
port development has suffered somewhat from a shortage of qualified and
experienced staff. Also, ports profits have been diverted to finance other
activities of TDI and TCDD. Although the Bank-supported Port Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1741-TU) provided for the creation of a single ports
institution, the Government has decided, and the Bank has agreed subsequently,
that the establishment of one institution woul not be appropriate. The
experience with similar central organizations in other sectors has been less
than encouraging. Although still under the general overview of the TCDD and
TDI Boards, the ports organizations have recently been made more autonomous.
They keep separate accounts and their planning, project preparation and
implementation departments as well as marketing and accounting departments are
being strengthened. Funds adequate to cover maintenance, debt service and an
adequate contribution to investment are being set aside before ports surpluses
are distributed. Measures taken or about to be taken represent a major step
towards making the ports depa-tments more responsive to the needs of the
economy. Relevant details are included in an Action Plan for the proposed
project (para. 63).
45.      Investments in Ports.  Investments in ports during the Fourth
Development Plan 1980-84 averaged about TL 18.8 billion ($54 million) annually
in 1984 prices. Although the main emphasis during this period was on the
rehabilitation of ports, particularly of conventional cargo handling equipmert
and storage facilities, during the latter part of the plan construction of new
berth facilities began in several ports in order to cater for expected
increases in general cargo and container traffic. Investments in these
facilities as well as the balance of the equipment renewal program represent
the bulk of the current spillover of ongoing investments into the Fifth
Five-Year Development Plan 1985-89, equivalent to about TL 25 billion
($70 million) in 1984 prices.
46.      It is expected that investment levels in ports during 1985-89 will
average about TL 24 billion ($69 million) annually in 1984 prices, a slight
increase in real terms over levels achieved during 1980-84. However, this is



-15-
well below the initial proposals of the port agencies. Detailed discussions
on the port investment program were held with the Bank during preparation of
the propoeed project as well as during a transport investment review mission
in October 1984. The current Plan for 1985-89 will be limited to the proposed
container port development program and to the essential renewal of
conventional cargo handling equipment and high priority floating equipment for
DLH.  In view of the uncertainties over container traffic flows, especially
for international transit trafEic, a phased approach has now been adopted for
the development of container port facilities in order to reduce the risks
related to transit traffic (para. 49). This program, which covers the period
1986-88, is expected to account for about 60 percent of the 1985-89 port
investment plan. In general, all items in the plan appear justified except
that the proposed development of bulk mineral facilities at Izmir should
possibly be deferred or reconsidered pending the probable expansion of
container operations. The Government has agreed to provide the Bank with
draft annual investment programs and budgets for the ports subsector during
the period of project implementation; it has also agreed that large
investments would be based on appropriate feasibility studies (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.05).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
47.      Project History.  The project was identified in June 1983 and
prepared by the port agencies with the assistance of Bank preparation
missions. The project was appraised in November/December 1984. Negotiations
were held in Washington from April 1-5, 1985 with a Turkish delegation led by
Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Counselor for Financial and Economic Affairs, Embassy
of the Republic of Turkey, and including representatives of the Treasury, SPO,
the Ministry of Finance and Customs, DLH of the Ministry of Public Works, TCDD
and TDI. A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report of a Third Ports Project"
(No. 5467-TU), dated April 18, 1985 is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and project are given in
the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. Maps showing the Turkish
transport network (IBRD Map No. 18675) and the main transit routes in the
Middle East (IBRD Map No. 18778) are also attached.
48.      Project Obiectives.  The proposed project would provide assistance to
Turkey in the acquisition and use of modern container facilities and
procedures. These would facilitate increased exports of industrial and
agricultural products and would generate foreign exchange savings on sea
freight rates for both exports and imports. Moreover, the development of
these modern facilities would provide Turkey with additional foreign exchange
earnir"s accruing to Turkish shippers, road transport companies and port
agencies by serving a growing demand for international transit traffic. The
specific objectives of the project include the provision of specialized
container handling facilities in selected ports as well as implementation of a
comprehensive action plan for the introduction of modern container handling
technology, including operational procedures, equipment maintenance and
modified customs procedures. The project would assist in strengthening
planning activities in the ports subsector through agreement with the



*  -16-
Government and the port agencies on realistic investment levels during the
period of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan, 1985-89 (pars. 39) and through
appropriate technical assistance and staff training. The project would also
assist in improving accounting procedures and in the introduction of
commercially viable tariffs for container handling.
49.      Project Description.  The separate plans of TCDD and TDI originally
proposed development of nine container ports as compared with a National
Master Plan proposal to develop seven through 1990. Given the uncertainties
of transit traffic and the specialized nature of container facilities, the
Government finally decided to develop only four ports in a first phase (one
port for each major hinterland area), which would be the main beneficiaries
under the proposed loan. The Government also decided to monitor traffic
patterns to determine which ports should be included in a second phase
development, the preparation of which would be included under the proposed
project. The proposed developments for each of the four ports are discussed
below.
50.     At Izmir, where construction of new quays is well advanced, the
project would finance two standard container cranes which will work on the
main 450m long berth by mid-1987. Dredging of the quays and deepening of the
inner harbor and the approach channel to the port from the Aegean Sea would
be carried out to permit larger container ships and bulk carriers to enter the
port. TDI is providing two lightweight cranes from its own resources in
advance of the project to operate a multi-purpose berth by mid-1986.
Associated support equipment would also be financed under the project.
51.     At Haydarpasa, the project would finance two standard container
cranes for use on the recently completed 300 m berth and one lightweight
container crane for an adjacent multi-purpose roll-on or roll-off berth,
together with associated support equipment.
52.     As Mersin is the main transit port for Iraq as well as serving a
major export demand from south-eastern Turkey, five standard container cranes
and associated support equipment would be financed. The extension of one
berth to handle container shipa and bulk carriers would be undertaken and
financed by TCDD; a 400 m container quay has already been completed.
53.     At Trabzon, a new container quay financed from TDI's own resources is
presently under construction. Traffic through the port is mainly transit
traffic to Iran. A minimum development based on two lightweight container
cranes and associated support equipment would be financed under the project.
54.     To raise the operational efficiency of these four ports and to
introduce the use of new cargo handling technology, the project would include
the fiuancing of technical assistance to: (i) improve modern documentation
and control systems for cpntainer handling and storage; (ii) establish new
operational systems and practices in line with the new technology and
equipment; (iii) improve engineering maintenance procedures and spare parts
inventory; (iv) provide on-the-job and overseas training of port staff; and
(v) undertake studies leading to improved accounting procedures and cost
related container tariffs, the establishment of inland container depots and
preparation of a second phase container port development. An Action Plan,
covering the preparation of the project as well as the terms of reference for
the technical assistance component, has been prepared and agreed with the
authorities (para. 63).1



-17-
55.      Maintenance of ports infrastructure is carried out by DLH.  More than
half of the equipment owned by DLH is over 20 years old and is mostly beyond
its useful economic life. A priority list of equipment for port maintenance
operations proposed by DLH has been reviewed by the Bank and is considered
appropriate for Bank financing under the project. It includes two floating
cranes, three bucket dredgers, back-hoe dredgers and new enginen for tugboats
and hopper barges.
56.      To accelerate the clearance of conta ners, the customs authorities
are reviewing specialized surveillance equipment which would be procured under
the project. It would be located at the four ports and at the border stations
through which the transit traffic passes. A list of equipment to be procured
has been agreed.
57.      Cost Estimates and Financing Plan.  Total project cost is estimated
at $182 million (including physical and price contingencies) with a foreign
exchange cost of $150.7 million, the balance comprising local costs and taxes
on civil works. The proposed Bank loan of $134.5 million would cover
96 percent of the foreign exchange cost of equipment, the foreign cost of the
Izmir dredging contract as well as the total cost of technical assistance and
training. Respective amounts of the loan would be sublent to TCDD and TDI in
line with the financing plan on the same terms as the proposed loan. The
foreign exchange risk for these subloans would be borne by TCDD and TDI. The
local currency costs including taxes and duties and the balance of the foreign
exchange cost would be financed from the agencies' own budgets (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.01(c) and Project Agreement, Section 2.01(a)). The
financing plan is shown in the Loan and Project Summary.  Provision of
10-15 percent of the cost of equipment has been included for spare parts. For
costs expressed in Turkish lira, price contingencies have been based on
estimated annual price increases of 30 percent in 1985, 25 percent in 1986,
20 percent in 1987, 15 percent in 1988 and 10 percent in 1989 and 1990. For
costs expressed in US dollar terms, price contingencies have been based on
estimated annual price increases of 5 percent in 1985, 7.5 percent in 1986 and
8 percent in 1987 through 1990.
58.      Manpower requirements for technical assistance would include local
and expatriate assistance. It is estimated that 72 man-months would be
required for documentation and operations specialists, 55 man-months for
equipment maintenance specialists, 10 man-months for organizing on-the-job
training and overseas technical visits, and 20 man-months for an inland
container depots study. A further 15 man-months of assistance would be
required for improving accounting procedures. About 80 man months of overseas
technical visits are envisaged for ports staff, DLH personnel and Customs
officials.
59.      Cost estimates have been basea upon recent equipment prices for
similar types of equipment supplied by foreign manufacturers. Dredging costs
are derived from prices for similar works undertaken in the region in recent
years, but actuil costs will be subject to the availability of suitable
dredging contractors at the time of international competitive bidding, and an
additional 15 percent contingency has accordingly been allowed.
60.      Accounting and Audit.  Under their respective charters, both TCDD and
TDI ports organizations follow the accounting procedures laid down for
state-owned establishments and enterprises. These include budgetary control



-1B-
and the use of a uniform system of accounts. The latter, while suitable for
basic Einancial accounting, does not adequately cover the requirements for
cost accounting or analysis. The proposed priject would include technical
assistance for rationalization of the cost accounting system and generation of
management information. DLH in the Public Works Ministry, the Customs
Department, TCDD and TDI have agreed to keep separate project accounts in
accordance with Government budgetary and accounting procedures.
61.      Audits are carried out by the financ-il inspectors of the Ministry of
Finance.  Agreemen; has been reached on the fc smat of the reports and their
timing (Loan Agreement, Section 4.01 and Proje:t Agreement, Section 4.01).
62.      Proiect Coordination.  With the involvement of four different
agencies in the project, close coordination is essential and the Government
has agreed to set up a Project Coordination Committee (PCC) for this purpose,
chaired by a Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport (MOT).
Specific terms of reference and a staffing plan for the PCC have been agreed.
The PCC would have a major role in implementing the Action Plan and would
submit quarterly progress reports on overall project implementation, as well
as maintain records of relevant data for the preparation of a Project
Completion Report (PCR). The PCC would submit draft annual investment
programs and budgets to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section 3.05(a)(ii)).
63.      Action Plan.  A comprehensive action plan has been developed for the
project. It integrates all the key elements required for successful
implementation of the project and includes a procurement schedule for
equipment items, an implementation program for the completion of
infrastructure works, details and timing of technical assistance inputs,
introduction of revised customs procedures, monitoring of traffic
developments, and actions required for financial accounting and establishing
container tariffs.
64.      Procurement.  Procurement of ports container handling equipment,
replacement maintenance equipment for DLH, specialized equipment for Customs
and dredging by contract at Izmir, would be by international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Some smaller items of specialized
equipment, up to a total of about $100,000, would be procured under limited
international bidding (LIB). Consultants would be recruited in accordance
with Bank guidelines (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 and Project Agreement,
Section 2.02). Local manufacturers would be expected to bid for a small
portion of the equipment to be procured under the loan.
65.      Disbursements under the Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange
costs of equipment procurement, and the foreign exchange costs of the Izmir
dredging estimated at 88 percent of its e-timated total costs; disbursement
for technical assistance would cover toLal expenditures excluding taxes and
duties. A Special Account would be set up for this project with an initial
deposit of $8.0 million. Disbursements are closely tied to delivery of
equipment, and are expected to take place from FY86 through mid-FY9l. The
Closing Date of the loan would be December 31, 1990. A timetable for project
implementation has been agreed with the Goverrment and project agencies.



-19-
66.      Environmental and Employment Impact.  The greatly increased cargo
throughputs achieved with modern container handling systems would reduce the
need for major expansion of port facilities which would normally be necessary
for general cargo operations. In addition, berth occupancy for container
ships generally does not exceed 30 percent, thereby reducing the risks of
pollution and oil spills in port. Although the project would reduce the need
for port labor employed on general cargo operations, it is anticipated that
these reductions would be achieved partly through attrition and partly through
redeployment in other port activities. Also the development of container
traffic is likely to create additional employment in such activities as
trucking, storage and freight forwarding.
67.      Traffic Forecasts.  The main focus of the traffic analysis has  been
to obtain forecasts of cargo suitable for containers, for both Turkish foreign
trade and transit traffic, and to estimate the penetration of this traffic by
containers following the introduction of modern container handling systems.
Forecasts of national general cargo traffic are based on a continuation of the
macroeconomic stabilization program through 1985, followed by a strategy aimed
at a 5 to 6 percent per year growth in GDP through the end of the decade.
Exports are forecast to increase at 8-10 percent per year with the main
increases coming from exports of industrial goods. Import growth is expected
to increase at about 7-8 percent per year during the period 1985-90. For
transit traffic to Iran and Iraq, it is difficult to make any accurate
forecasts in view of the changes which could occur in the Gulf area. In view
of the fluctuations in this traffic in recent years, average transit volumes
for the 1981-83 pe*riod of 2.4 million tons for the Mediterranean route and
800,000 tons for the Black-Sea route are assumed to remain unchanged. On this
basis, total container cargo through Turkish ports is forecast to increase
from a current level of 4.9 million tons to at least 5.7 million tons in 1990,
of which just over 30 percent would be transit traffic.
68.      Forecasts of container movements were established for each port for
national and transit traffic, based on the dominant flow patterns. With the
development of modern container handling systems, penetration of potential
container cargo as a whole is forecast to increase from a current level of
20 percent to about 60 percent in 1990; the share of total general cargo
handled in containers would increase from 8 percent to 25 percent over the
same period. Total container movements are estimated to increase from the
present level of about 200,000 TEU to about 420,000 TEU in 1989 and
740,000 TEU in 1992, an average increase of about 18 percent per year.
Forecast traffic levels for 1989 were used to establish equipment requirements
at each of the project ports; container movements in 1989 are estimated to
reach 200,000 TEU at Mersin, 40,000 TEU at Trabzon, 88,000 TEU at Haydarpasa,
and 88,000 TEU at Izmir.
69.      Benefits.  One of the main benefits of the project would be savings
in ship service time and port handling costs which will ultimately be passed
on to producers and consumers through slower increases in sea freight rates
and port tariffs. Other benefits would include reductions in potential
congestion in the ports, net reductions in cargo losses, and the value placed
on reduced transit times and the increased security of shipments. It is
expected that about half the savings in ship service time would accrue
directly to Turkish shipping lines, while a large share of the savings



-20-
accruing to foreign shipping would ultimately be felt in lower sea freight
rates to the general benefit of Turkey. In termJ of indirect effects, the
project would also have a major impact on foreign exchange earnings on exports
which might have been forgone in the absence of containerization. Similarly,
in facilitating transit traffic, Turkey receives important foreign exchange
earnings.
70.      Economic Rate of Return.  The quantification of benefits has been
limited to savings in ship service time and reductions in cargo handling
costs. However, savings in ship service time have been included in full, even
though part of these benefits would remain with foreign shipping lines. These
benefits are included as surrogates for benefits accruing to Turkey in other
indirect forms, such as the impact of modern container systems on export
earnings and on foreign exchange revenue accruing to Turkish shippers, road
transport operators and port agencies engaged in transit traffic. For labor
cost savings, only half of these benefits are included because of
uncertainties as to whether labor savings would be achieved in full through
redeployment to other activities. Individual ERRs for the four ports range
from 12 percent to 21 percent with an overall average for the container port
program of about 18 percent. The procurement of equipment for DLE to replace
old worn-out equipment, required for essential maintenance of existing and
proposed port facilities, is expected to provide an ERR of at least 20 percent.
71.      Risks.  Uncertainties over the development of transit traffic to Iran
and Iraq represent the main risks for the economic viability of the project
and specifically for the proposed programs at Mersin and Trabzon. Should
there be a return to normal conditions in the Gulf area, the Gulf ports would
be rehabilitated and would again handle a major share of current transit
traffic through Turkey. However, the rehabilitation of Gulf port facilities
will take a number of years and both Iran and Iraq are likely to continue to
use the Turkish transit routes in the longer run to a certain extent for
strategic reasons. As transit traffic at Mersin represents less than half of
the total container traffic, the economic viability of the proposed
development there would not be significantly affected by any reductions in the
transit trade because any reductions would be offset by steadily rising
Turkish exports. On the other hand, the port of Trabzon has no local traffic
potential and any fall in the transit trade to Iran would require the
relocation of equipment to meet traffic demand at other ports. Because of
this uncertainty-, the proposed facility at Trabzon, based on two lightweight
cranes, represents a minimum level of development to provide satisfactory
container handling operations.
72.      Another risk relates to the rate of penetration of container cargo.
The assumptions used in the traffic analysis imply that all incremental
general cargo from about 1988 onwards would be handled by containers, the
overall growth in container traffic being about 18 percent per year. As this



-21-
rate is about twice the forecast growth rate for general cargo traffic, it
appears to represent a reasonable pattern of development. Even if this growth
rate were reduced to 14 percent per year, all project ports would still remain
economically viable.
73.      Financial Analysis.  The major ports have been profiltble since the
introduction of realistic tariffs in i981. The tariff structure is generally
adequate. Tariffs which are expressed in US dollars are at a level which
ensures the continued profitability of the ports. It is estimated that
operating ratios would not rise above 65 and that the return on net fixed
assets would not fall below 25 percent.
74.      While there have been some improvements (supported by the Ports
Rehabilitation Loan 1741-TU) in establishing a cost-accounting system for TCDD
and TDI port organizations, the present systems are not yet adequate for
management decision making.  The accounting systems are being modified to
bring them in line with current legislation which requires transfer of
surpluses to the Treasury (para 75). Beyond this, further improvements are
planned under the project, with assistance provided by local consultants, in
order to rationalize the accounting systems and to establish them as
management tools. These improvements would be implemented by January 1, 1988
(Loan Agreement, Section 4.02 and Project Agreement, Section 4.04). In view
of the introduction of equipment to facilitate container traffic, TCDD and TDI
would review the adequacy of tariffs related to container operations and as
necessary implement revised tariffs in accordance with a schedule incorporated
in the Action Plan.
75.      In the past, the profits of the ports were used by the parent
organizations for funding their own activities. Following the establishment
of semi-autonomous port organizations with a requirement for separate
accounts, it is now possible to identify surpluses as well as any
appropriation by parent organizations. It is now the responsibility of the
Treasury to decide on the disposition of the surpluses. It has been agreed
that the port organizations would manage their financial affairs so that
revenues from tbeir respective operations would be sufficient and be retained
to cover operating, maintenance and overhead costs, debt servicing and working
capital as well as at least 15 percent of the annual capital requirements on
average (Project Agreement, Section 4.02).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
76.      The Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the
Project Agreement between the Bank and TCDD and TDI and the report of the
committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Features of special interest are listed in Annex III of this report. The
execution of loan agreements passing on a portion of loan funds for TCDD and
TDI would be a special condition of effectiveness (para. 57).



-22-
77.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
78.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
