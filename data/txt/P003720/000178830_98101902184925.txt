INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
CCMPANY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US $10.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance
a development bank (BAPINDO) project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Indonesia has received twenty IDA credits amounting to
US $263.4 million.   The composition of this lending reflects the
priorities for rehabilitation and development established by the
Government.   Indonesia's First Five Year Plan (1969-1974) gives
highest priority to agriculture. The Association has already extended
three credits to help develop plantation crops in the Government estates
sector. Other credits for agriculture include four to assist rehabili-
tation of irrigation systems, one for fisheries and one to help increase
rice yields throughout Indonesia by establishing a seed multiplication
program for high-yielding rice varieties. The Association also organized
a consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the PUSAI
fertilizer plant.   These ten credits account for well over half of the
Association's lending to Indonesia.
3.        In order to accelerate rehabilitation in other sectors, credits
for highways, power, telecommunications, education and population have
also been made.   In addition, three technical assistance credits have
been made to help finance pre-investment studies undertaken by the Govern-
ment, which have helped to establish investment priorities over a wide
range of activities.   A summary statement of IDA credits and IFC
investments is at Annex I.
4.        Three other credits are expected to be ready for negotiation
shortly: a second power distribution project, a fourth agricultural
estates project, and a project in a priority field not hitherto assisted:
marine transport.
5.        The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 196d.
Twelve of the twenty credits have been made since July 1, 1970.   The
program is thus relatively new, and largely for this reason the undis-
bursed portion of the credits is large.   Another contributing factor
is that virtually every credit has introduced extensive institutional
reform, involving creating of new project authorities, drafting of new
charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of which have taken much
time.   However, several credits have experienced pronounced delays in
disbursement because of management problems.   Comments on individual
credits are in Annex I.



PART II - THE ECONChY
6.,       The latest Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a),
dated November 30, 1971, concluded that Indonesia's economic
progress continues to be satisfactory. The economy appears to be
growing at around 6-? percent in terms of GDP, while price stabi-
lity is being maintained and exports are increasing. Production
of rice, the basic comoodity, has increased substantially for the
fourth successive year. In the industrial settor, especially in
textiles, there is further substantial growth. With private
foreign investment accelerating and the rehabilitation and expan-
sion of domestic enterprises being fostered under official programs,
the prospects of industrial growth from the present small base are
good. (Country Data are presented in Amex II,)
7.        Economic progress is at an early stage, however, and the
problems which remain to be tackled are large. The population
project referred to in paragraph 3 represents a first step in deal-
ing with high birth rates in densely populated areas and marks an
inportant reversal of earlier attitudes. Advances have been made
in foriulating plans, programs and projects and in starting to
implement them, but the limited managerial and financial resources
available still preaent a serious obstacle. The pressure on finan-
cial resources is evifdnced by the continuing high rates of interest
which prevail in the econovy and by the necessity for a devaluation
in August 1971, designed in part as a precaution in the race of
international uncertainties and in part to restrain import demand
foliowing a loss of foreign exchange reserves. In 1972 there are
prospects of a significant increment in both foreign exchange earn-
ings and  overnment revenues, as a result principally of shaxp
increases in oil production and in the volume and value of oil
exports. The demand for resources is so great, howeer, that the
need for aid will continue at a high level as a supplement to
domestic resources available for public and private investment and
imnprovement of essential services even after allowance for increased
earxings from oil.
8.        Government revenues in 1971/72 (April-March) are now
estimated to have been 20 percent higher than in the previous year,
A mtuch larger increase, 36 percent, is forecast for 1972/73. The
largest item in this increase would be taxes on expected higher
earnings of foreign oil comnpanies, but other revenues would increase
by l8 percent. The expected increase in revenues of about Rp. 150
billion ($36o million) would finance increases in salaries and
material eqenditures in the ordinary budget, while still allowing
for a doubling (to Rp. 136 billion or $328 million) of the surplus



-3-
available for the development budget, Together with counterpart
funds generated by program aid (estimated at Rp. 95 billion or
$229 million), this would provide for a development budget in
1972/73 of Rp. 231 billion ($557 million), which is 40 percent
larger than that for 1971/72. Further increases in oil export
prices effective on April 1 could add an extra Rp. 20 billion
($48.2 million) to revenues.
9.        Exports were expected to rise by 10 percent in 1971/72
with the prospect of a 29 percent increase to $1,270 million
(Rp. 527 billion) in 1972/73. Most of this is accounted for by
rising oil export earnings which will expand by a further $50$60
million because of the April price increases. Timber exports, up
44 percent in 1971/72, are projected to increase by 27 percenit to
$220 million in 1972/73. For all other exports, aggregate value
may have been down somewhat in 1971/72, due primarily to lower
prices for rubber, but a moderate price recovery is expected this
year.
10.       Imports of goods and services of $1,778 million are
projected for 1972/73, which would mean a current account deficit
of just over $500 million (Pp. 207.5 billion), slightly larger than
that experienced last year. Debt payments will be slightly lower;
the increase in private capital inflows is expected to be somewhat
higher; and public capital inflow, at $520 million, is expected to
be higher by $75 million than that estimated for 1971/72 because of
increased project aid utilization.
11.       Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the
international support being given in increasing amounts through
the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia (IGGI). A summary of
aid commitments is included in Annex II. These commitments have
risen from $200 million in 1967 to well over $600 million for
1971/72. The proportion of project aid has steadily increased
over this period, but substantial program aid remains essential as
support for the balance of payments and - in spite of strong
domestic revenue efforts - as a source of additional rupiah funds
for the development budget, For 1972/73 the Government requested
IGGI aid commitments of $670 million, of which $350 million for
project aid and $320 million for program aid, including $110 million
in food supplies. At its meeting at Amsterdam in December 1971, the
IGGI accepted this request, endorsed by the Bank and Fund, as approp-
riate in relation to Indonesia's requirements; at the subsequent
pledging session on April 25-26, express or implied commitments by
IGGI members in fact amounted to some $724 million, approximately
meeting the request for food and non-food program aid and exceeding
by a substantial margin the amount sought in project aid,



12.       Following the rescheduling arrangements for pre-1966
external debt which culminated in April 1970 in agreement on a
long-term settlement of the debts held by Western creditors and
Japan, and subsequent agreement on similar lines with several
Eastern European countries, the ratio of external debt service to
exports is currently low, about 11 percent of exports. It will
rise appreciably throughout the 1970's as grace periods expire on
aid received after 1966, but should remain manageable during the
decade if good export performance continues, if restraints on
medium-term borrowing are maintained and if new aid remains avail-
able on concessional terms similar to those at present obtained
from the IGGI. All aid from the IGGI members has been given on
concessional terms approximating the standards set by the DAC. 1/
The Bank Group Strgy
13,       Indonesia's continuing economic development will require,
in addition to substantial external support, some change in emphasis
from rehabilitation and improvement in infrastructure to the expan-
sion of capabilities for sustained additional production in agricul-
ture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing.  It will also require
continued strengthening of the institutions for the planning of
development and management of the economy. And key problems of
welfare and distribution, including family planning as well as
regional'development and related patterns of employment and popula-
tion movement, will be important in Indonesia's development strategy.
14.       The economic work and the lending activities of the Bank
Group, at both the Resident Mission in Indonesia and at Headquarters,
have been oriented toward these development objectives.    The focus
of the Bank's economic work in providing assistance to the Government
in the current preparation of Indonesia's next five-year plan scheduled
for 1973 is now along these lines.
15.       In operational activities, Bank Group financing is
shifting from   the  past    emphasis on infrastructure to increasing
emphasis on projects more closely related to direct production in
agriculture and industry. The latter would include industrial estates
and industrial credits. Transport and other infrastructure will, of
course, continue to be part of the financing program as will opera-
tions in education and family planning. Project possibilities are
also likely in water supply, urban development and tourism.

Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.



-5-
16.       Consistent with Indonesia's large external resource re-
quirements, and difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank
Group's assistance to Indonesia (aside from I7 investments) has
been and will continue to be in the form of IDA credits.    In
recognition of the urgent need for institutional reforms, most
IDA projects have included major steps to reorganize existing
institutions or to establish new ones, involving the creation of
new project authorities, the drafting of charters and the enactment
of legislation.   At the same time, to supplement the Government's
efforts in improving administration and management, credits have
included provision for consultants services and other technical
assistance.
17.       Priority projects commonly involve a high proportion
of local expenditure, and it is not practicable to meet Indonesia's
need for external capital if external lenders lend only for tte
import component of projects.   The Bank Group has therefore
covered some local expenditure in its financing and will have to
continue to do so in the future.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT
Industrial Environment
18.       As a result of the political upheaval of the mid-sixties, the
industrial output of 1963 was not equaled until 1969.    But substantial
increases in output were recorded by most industries in 1970 and 1971,
although even now the share of manufacturing in GDP is estimated to be
only 7%-8% compared with 10%-12% in other developing countries of
comparable size and per capita income.    Private industry is dominated
by small- and medium-sized establishments; large establishrents are
mainly state or foreign-controlled enterprises.    The geographic
distribution of manufacturing is roughly the same as that of the
population, heavily concentrated in Java.    Significant under-
utilization of capacity and obsolescent equipment are common.
19.       Since 1967, the Government has been replacing the highly
protectionist and heavily state-controlled system by a more liberal
system of industrial incentives based on tax and tariff relief, which
is stimulating industrial investment and growth.    The investment climate
has also been greatly improved by the success of the financial stabili-
zation program in 1966-69, the removal of import, exchange and other
controls and the evidence of strong support for the new economic poli-
cies in the form of project and program aid by member governments and
institutions of the Inter-Governmental Group for Indonesia.. The result
has been a surge in industrial investment.    It is estimated that private
manufacturing investment in 1971 may have reached about $130 million,
with domestic enterprise accounting for up to one-half of that total.
Tentative estimates by a Bank economic mission suggest that total



- 6 -
private investment in manufacturing might grow by up to 25% annually
over the period 1971 to 1975 and that the domestic component might
expand even more rapidly if the necessary funds were available.
Financial Eavironment
20.       Present financial network. The existing banking network con-
sists of Bank Indonesia (the central bank), the State commercial banks,
the State development bank (BAPINDJ), a group of national private banks
and branches of eleven foreign banks. There are five State commercial
banks which to some extent specialize in various sectors of the economy.
These five banks currently dominate the market for commercial finance.
Total bank credit has been increasing rapidly in the past few years.
The proportion going to the private sector has also increased. All
banks in Indonesia make both short-term working capital loans and
medium-term investment loans. At the end of 1971, Bank Indonesia
supplied about h8 percent of the outstanding credit, but in
recent years its share has been declining. The State commercial banks
now account for about 43% of the total. There has also been a dramatic
increase in bank deposits during the past few years, stimulated by
ret,jrning monetary stability and by high interest rates on deposits, which
were introduced towards the end of 1968. For all practical purposes
there is no capital market in Indonesia at the present time. However,
studies are continuing, under the auspices of Bank Indonesia, to deve-
lop both money and capital markets. IFC is considering what technical
assistance it can give the Government in fostering the development of
money and capital markets in Indonesia.
21.       Facilities for term-financing.  The bulk of long-term finance
to the manufacturing sector is provided (mainly by Bank Indonesia) under
the Joint Financing Scheme (JFS) through the five State commercial. banks
and BAPINDO. Under this scheme, which was started early in 1969,
borrowers are required to contribute 25% of project costs. The remaining
75% is provided by Budget funds, at no cost to the participating banks;
by Bank Indonesia, which charges the participating banks 4% per annum;
and by the participating banks themselves from their own resources.
Priority for financing is given to projects for rehabilitation, modern-
ization and expansion, and the use of funds is restricted to financing
fixed assets. Maximum period allowed for subloans is five years. JFS
disbursements in 1970 to the manufacturing sector are estimated to have
accounted for half of all manufacturing investment for the year. The
cost of funds to the borrowers is 12%. Individual loans above Rp. 100
million require approval by Bank Indonesia.
22.       To utilize capital aid given on a government-to-government
basis by foreign countries for the manufacturing sector, a new arrange-
ment called Development Loans Through the Banking System (DLBS) has
been proposed. Under this arrangement, foreign exchange loans would
be made available to banks to relend to the industrial sector for



-7 -
periods of up to 12 years. An interest rate of 9% per annum will
be charged to the sub-borrower, who would bear the exchange risk.
Other terms would be similar to those under the JFS. An initial
loan of 13.6 billion (about $10 million equivalent) by Japanese
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund has been agreed but had not been
made effective as of April 30, 1972.
23.       The only institution other than BAPINDO specializing in
providing long-term finance is the Indonesian Development Finance
Company (IDFC), a sucoessor to the earlier Development Bank for
Indonesia, The initial paid-in share capital of IDFC is Rp. 560
million, jointly subscribed by Bank Indonesia tnd the Netherlands
Overseas Finance Corporation.
24.       Preliminary discussions are also under way concerning the
establishment of a new, broadly-based private development bank, in
which private entrepreneurs in Indonesia and private foreign investors
would participate. The Government strongly supports the idea and is
receiving Bank Group assistance in developing the project.
25.       BAPINDO, IDFC and the proposed private development bank will
thus constitute the specialized institutional sources of term finance
for the industrial sector. The investment outlook appears to offer
good scope for business for all three institutions.
26.       Interest rates. The interest rate structure applied by
State commercial banks as well as BAPINDO is determined by Bank Indo-
nesia, while private commercial banks are free to set their own inte-
rest rates. There is a wide range of interest rates. The State banks
charge from 12% p.a. for medium-term investment loans under the JFS
to 30% for short-term working capital loans. Interest rates charged
by private banks range from 3% to 6% per month.   Interest is paid by
State banks on demand deposits at rates ranging from 6% to 12% depending
on amount and on time deposits from 12% on deposits of less than three
months to 24% on 12 months deposits.
27.       The interest rate structure has contributed to a remark-
able increase in total deposits, but it has obvious defects. Rates on
short-term funds for working capital are high (30% per annum and up-
wards) while the cost of funds for medium-term loans to purchase capital
equipment is only 12% per annum. Moreover, the medium-term rate of
12% is only one-half of the interest rate on 12-month deposits. Nbdi-
fications of the current interest rate structure are presently under
discussion by a Select Committee appointed by the Government.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       Since late 1968, the Association has been working with the
Government of Indonesia to improve the conditions for the provision of
resources for medium- and long-term investment in industry. A key ele-
ment in this process has been the reorganization and strengthening of
the State-owned Development Bank of Indonesia (BAPINDO) to enable it to
become an effective institution for providing term finance for medium-
and small-scale productive enterprises.
Background
29.       Established in 1960, BAPINDO was used in its first five years
as a conduit for Government funds for purposes specified by the Govern-
ment; these were not necessarily developmental. Its resources were
exhausted by 1965, and its operations virtually stopped. In 1966,
BAPINDO's functions were enlarged to include commercial banking and it
began to accept deposits from the public. In 1966 and 1967 it operated
mainly as a commercial bank. In 1968 and 1969 the Government allocated
Budgetary funds to BAPINDO for lending to selected State enterprises,
and in April 1969 it became also a participant (together with the five
State commercial banks) in the JFS. In October 1970, Bank Indonesia
stopped BAPINDO from term-lending to new clients because of its critical
financial position and organizational problems, a ban not lifted until
December 10, 1971.
30.       The Association's first detailed examination of BAPINDO in
December 1969 revealed that BAPINDO, which was engaged in both develop-
ment and commercial banking activities, was an inefficient institution,
poorly managed, ill-organized and over-staffed. Its capital structure
was unbalanced and it was illiquid. A substantial part of the debts due
to it were bad or doubtful, but its accounts had never been audited
by independent qualified accountants and BAPINDO's financial position
as at the end of 1969 could not be exactly determined. In short,
BAPINDO was not then creditworthy.
31.       In June 1970 the Government and the Association agreed on a
plan for strengthening and reorganizing BAPINDO. Since then, sub-
stantial progress, described in the following paragraphs, has been made
along the agreed lines. BAPINDO has now achieved a degree of credit-
worthiness sufficient to justify consideration of the proposed credit,
which would enable BAPINDO to consolidate its position, and provide it
with a part of the resources it needs to meet its current and projected
conmitments. BAPINDO's management has been greatly strengthened. With
the continued support of the Government and with the Association's tech-
nical assistance, BAPINDO has a good chance of becoming within a reason-
able time an effective financial institution.



-9-
The Reorganization of BAPINDO
32,       BAPINDO's charter and operating policies. In May 1970, the
Government agreed with the Association that term lending to medium- and
small-scale enterprises should become BAPINDO's main activity, that
BAPINDO's authorized capital should be increased from Rp. 60 million to
Rp. 20 billion and that the Supervisory Board, which then consisted only
of the Minister of Finance and the Governor of Bank Indonesia, should be
enlarged. In order to give effect to the agreed measures, and also to
make other desirable changes in BAPINDO's charter, the Government intends
shortly to introduce in the Indonesian Legislature a new Act. The draft
Act is satisfactory to the Association; it is not controversial, and the
Government expects passage to- be completed in the next few months.
Enactment of the new Act is not a condition of effectiveness because the
Government has already increased BAPINDO 's capital as agreed with the
Association; the reorientation of BAPINDO's functions has been ensured
through the adoption of a comprehensive Policy Statement (see the follow-
ing paragraph); and the expansion of the Supervisory Board, although
desirable, is not urgent.
33*       BAPINDO's Policy Statement lays down sound guidelines to be
observed by BAPINDO with regard to the scope of its activities, invest-
ment and financial criteria, relationships with enterprises financed,
financial and portfolio management, and the building of an effective
organization and staff. Amendments to the Policy Statement will be
subject to prior approval by the Association.
34.       Management1 organization and procedures.  The Government agreed
with the Association that an essential element in strengthening BAPINDO's
management would be the appointment as President of a man of strong will
and integrity. To this end, Mr. Kuntoadji was appointed President in
January 1971. Two additional managing directors have also been appointed,
and the Board of Managing Directors now consists of four members including
the President. BAPINDO's management has been further strengthened by the
appointment of four Advisors, advising on overall policy formulation and
management, finance and accounts, term-lending and engineering.. All four
Advisors were recommended and seconded by the Association. BAPINDO's
managenent has been greatly strengthened in the past 12 months and it is
now capable of raising BAPINDO's effectiveness to a satisfactory level
within a reasonable period.
35.       BAPINDO's management, in consultation with the Advisors, has
recently regrouped BAPINDO's activities among its departments, with
sharper definition of responsibilities than applied heretofore, and in
the process has created a number of new departments. Internally,
BAPINDO's procedures and controls have been ilmproved substantially,
although they still need further upgrading. BAPINDO's new management
has made a start on training staff for better appraisal and follow-up
work. Procurement and disbursement procedures still need to be tightened



- 10 -
up.   BAPINDO's appraisal, follow-up, procurement and disbursement
procedures were discussed during negotiation of the proposed credit
and satisfactory understandings were reached on the steps BAPINDO
would take to bring about further improvements.
36.       In reorganizingsBAPINDO'. management faced and continues to
face serious problems.   The change from commercial banking to long-
term financing will not be achieved quickly or easily.   The
retrenchment of surplus staff is likely in Indonesian conditions to
be slow and difficult.   Of BAPINDO's 18 existing branches (down 2
since 1969) about one-half are uneconomic; and BAPINDOt, in
consultation with Bank Indonesia, intends to find ways of'shedding
them.   Some may be closed;  some may be transferred, by negotiations,
to other State-owned banks.
Capital Structure and Financial Position'
37.       The Association's examination of BAPINDO at the end of
1969 revealed that BAPINDO had an unsound financial stAdictu&e and a
weak financial position.   For example, its long-termb'orrowings
amounted to Rp. 9.2 billion and its equity to only Rp. 48,7 million.
BAPINDO was seriously illiquid. Hi.ch of- its portfolio appeared to be
of doubtful quality and reserves were inadequate.   The Government, on
the Association's recommendation, appointed qualified indeendent
accountants to audit BAPINDO's accounts for 1969 and subsequent years.
38.       Following the audit of BAPINDO's accounts for the years 1969
and 1970, and a detailed review: of BAPINDO's portfolio by an Association
mission in November and December 1970, the Government reorganized
BAPINDO's financial structure, effective April 1, 1971.   The re-
organization involved:  (a) transfer from BAPINDO's portfolio of all
its loans to State enterprises, amounting to Rp. 5.6 billion;. (b)
conversion into equity of Government loans to BAPINDO amounting to
about Rp. 2.6 billion; (c) conversion into equity of Rp. 4 billion
of the loans from Bank Indonesia to BAPINDO; and (d) writing off
about Rp. 2.5 billion as bad debts.   On December 31, 1971, this
write-off was reversed and substituted by a provision for bad debts
amounting to Rp. 3 billion.   In addition the Government agreed to
increase BAPINDO's equity by Rp. 2 billion in each of 1972 and 1973.
The Government made the first payment of Rp. 2 billion to BAPINDO on
may 6, 1972..
39.       As a result of those measures, BAPINDO's financial position
and capital structure-are now- satisfactory..  After the Rp. 2 billion
increase in paid-in-capital noted above, BAPINDO's total debt/equity
ratio was about 3 to 1 and its long-term debt/equity ratio had improved
to about 1 to 1.   At least as important as the improvements in
BAPINDO's financial position have been the improvements in its internal
accounting system and control procedures brought about since December
1970.   BAPINDO's accounts for the year ended December 31,' 1971,
are its first ever to be certified by independent qualified
professional accountants.



40.       BAPINDO's present portfolio consists of (a) medium-term
loans, (b) short-term working capital loans and (c) short-term loans
for raw cotton. Total medium-term loans outstanding as at December 31,
1971 amounted to Rp. 21.2 billion; those for working capital loans
amounted to Rp. 4.1 billion; and the raw cotton loans, to Rp. 13.3
billion. The raw cotton loans are made to selected spinning mills
for financing the raw cotton imported under PL 480 agreements with
the U.S.A.
41.       As at December 31, 1971, BAPINDO's total arrears amounted
to Rp. 6.8 billion(Rp. 4.8 billion for principal and Rp. 2.0 billion
for interest) of which Rp. 4.5 billion related to working capital loans.
Provisions for possible losses on account of bad debts, on a cumulative
basis, amounted to Rp. 3.0 billion as at December 31, 1971. BAPINDO's
management, on the basis of a detailed review of individual loans,
believes that the provision is adequate. The auditors in their report
have not expressed an opinion on the adequacy of the provision; how-
ever, given the careful review undertaken by BAPINDO's management,
the now strong equity base of the company and prospective increases
in that base, the company is creditworthy for moderate amounts of
additional debt. The large amounts of write-offs and arrears reflect
both the poor quality of BAPINDO's past appraisals and some important
factors outside BAPINDO's control.  Such factors include the political
pressures that in the past, put a number of bad loans on BAPINDO's
books. They also reflect some restrictions imposed by the terms of
the JFS. The arrears situation is expected to improve appreciably
over the next few years and will be kept under close review by BAPDNDO,
its auditors and the Association.
Prospects
42.       Business forecasts.  The prospects for further industrial
development in Indonesia are good. Although private domestic invest-
ment in manufacturing has expanded rapidly, it is still a small part
of the total investment in the economy. There is evidence that the
principal constraint on the growth of private domestic investment is
the limited amount of resources available. If BAPINDO is endowed with
adequate resources, it should not lack investment opportunities. On
the basis of past experience with the JFS and using the tentative esti-
mates of private investment in manufacturing prepared by a Bank economic
mission, BAPINDO forecasts commitments of about Rp. 40 billion during
1972-75. This would be about 13% of gross private manufacturing
investment during the same period. This is ambitious, but given BAPINDO's
strong management and the absence of other active specialized long-term
lending institutions, it may not prove unrealistic.
43.       For the next two years, commitments of medium- and long-term
loans are estimated at Rp. 15.5 billion ($37.4 million equivalent).
While it is difficult to forecast at what pace business will grow, the



- 12 -
prospects appear good since BAPINDO can offer longer and.more approp-
riate terms than are available under JFS, and can provide term loans
for permanent working capital at the same rate as for loans for fixed
assets.
44.       The business forecasts mentioned above do not take.1into account
BAPINDO's operations in the maritime sector (inter-island fleet:rehabili-
tation).   The Government selected BAPINDO in 1971 to be the financial'
intermediary for loans made for the rehabilitation of Indonesia's inter-
island regular liner service.   The Association is considering-a proposed
credit of US$8.5 million equivalent to be used by BAPINDO for this
purpose.   BAPINDO is setting up a new department to deal with its maritime
financing operations, and an additional managing director for.'shipping is:.
expected to be appointed shortly.   Estimates made for the'maritime project
indicate that its calls on BAPINDO's Rupiahzresources during.,1972 and 1973
are not likely to exceed Rp. 2 billion.
45.       Resource requirements .  BAPINDO had about Rp.. Lbillion. in
uncommitted resources at the beginning of 1972.   During-1972 and 1973,
it expects to-receive an additional Rp. 4.0Q -  billion inutheoform of
Government's contributions to its equity, about Rp. 3.0 £billion from-
liquidation of its present short-term portfolio (taking,into account the
expected reduction in deposits as it winds down its -commercial banking
operations) and about Rp. 3.0 billion in internal cash generation.
PAPINDOIs forecasts reflect its plans to draw from Bank Indonesia under
the JFS about Rp. 5 billion in the two years 1972 and 1973.'  However,
credit creation is necessarily restricted, and the amount Bank Indonesia
is able to make available through the JFS during that period may not'
permit BAPINDO to draw as much as Rp0 5 billion.   BAPINDO will also
need Rupiah resources to meet its requirements for maritime operations.
Some of the available resources are restricted.in use: country-tied in
the case of DLES; 5-year maximum in'the. case of JFS; for fixed assets
only in the case of JFS.   In summary, however, BAPINDO s.local currency
resource base should be adequate to cover its commitments over the next
two years and also to provide a good liquidity base for operations in
subsequent years.
46.       Statistics prepared by BAPINDO and reviewed by the Association
indicate that in BAPINDO's.past lending operations the foreign exchange-
component, direct as well as indirect, of plant and equipment was slightly
over 60 percent, and that of construction contracts slightly over 40 per-
cent.   If an overall foreign exchange component of around 50 percent is
assumed, BAPINDO's lending over the next two years would generate claims
on foreign exchange resources of the order of $22 million.   The proposed
IDA credit covers about 50 percent of this amount.   The credit proceeds
would be used exclusively to finance foreign.exchange expenditures.
1/ As already noted, BAPINDO received the first installment, Rp.2 billion,
in May 1972.

47.       Projected financial position.  The projected Balance Seets
as at December 31, 1972 through 1I75 show that BAPINDO's financial posi-
tion will remain sound throughout the period of the forecast. Total
assets are expected to grow at an average annual rate of about 15%.
The long-term debt to equity ratio will remain low, being 0.9sl as at
December 31, 1972 and 1973, increasing to 1.2;1 and 1.5:1 at the end
of 1974 and 1975 respectively. The total debt/equity ratio is also
forecast to remain below 3:1 during the four-year period. Credit
covenants would provide for a maximum total debt/equity ratio of 3s1.
Provisions for doubtful debts would amount to about 11.7% of the
portfolio as at the end of 1972, declining to about 6.8% by the end of
1975 with the rapid growth of the portfolio. Retained earnings amount-
ing to about 8.8% and 11% of net portfolio as at the end of 197a and
1975 respectively, would provide additional reserves.
48.       BAPINDO wiU be only moderately profitable mainly because of
high operating expenses and low leverage. Earnings before interest
and tax would be about 6%-7% on average total assets during 1972-75.
The return on average equity would be about 13% for 1972 (when tax is
expected to be very low because of past losses charged in that year's
accounts) but would then decline to about 5%-8% during the remaining
years of the forecast. Debt servioe cover is estimated to be satis-
factory throughout the life of the loan to BAPINDO.
Terms and Conditions
49.       The terms and conditions of the loan to BAPINDO made from the
proceeds of the proposed credit would be governed by a Sabsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and BAPINDO and by a Project Agreement
between the Association and BAPINDO. BAPINDO would pay the Government
interest at a rate not less than 7V per annum, the Bank's current
lending rate, and would relend at not less than 9¼%. If the rates paid
to BAPINDO by its borrowers were higher than 11¼, BAPINDO would pay
the Government the rate of interest that would allow it a spread of 4%.
BAPINDO's repayments to the Government would conform to its own collec-
tions.. The free limit for individual projects would be $100,000 with
an aggregate limit of $2.5 million. Other terms and conditions,
including the standard commitment charge, would be similar to those in
recent Bank loan agreements with development finance companies. Signing
of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit.
50.       On sub-loans made from the proceeds of the proposed credit,
BAPINDO would charge its own borrowers whatever rate or rates were
prescribed by Bank Indonesia for the banking system in generaL,subject
to a minimum rate of 9¼. BAPINDO would set repayment periods for
its sub-borrowers in accordance with project needs, subject to a
maxinum term of 15 years.

BAPINDO's Prospects
51.       The demand for investment credit in Indonesia is large and
growing. The shortage of loanable funds on reasonable terms appears-
to be the main impediment to more rapid growth of private domestic
investment.   Transfers made to'the banking system from Government
savings, and credit creation by Bank Indonesia, are necessarily
restricted; they need to be augmented by foreign public and private
inflows if domestic enterprise is to grow at a satisfactory rate.
BAPINDO is the largest financial institution specializing in term-
lending, and the groundwork has been done to enable'it to become, in
time, an efficient, effective institution..
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHOIUTY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Indonesia.and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
Bank Pembangunan Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and the text'of a resolution approving
the proposed credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RBCCOMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve.the proposed

III. Credits Experiencing Delays in Disbursement
The first and second agricultural estates projects (Crs. 155
and 194-IND), have had problems in appointing boards, executive manage-
ments, and consultants for various services.   The Government has been
informed of the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation,
and has undertaken to do so.   Similarly, initial delays have been
encountered on the telecommunications project (Cr. 210-IND), but all
major contracts have now been awarded except for the tropospheric scatter
system for which the consultants have Just completed the survey and
prepared specifications.   Disbursements ontwo projects  electricity
distribution (Cr. 165-IND) and education I (Cr. 219-IND), have been
delayed because of problems in the selection and appointment of
consultants by the Government;  for the electricity prd'ject, however,
orders are now being placed for equipment and disbursements are expected
to rise satisfactorily.   As to the education project, negotiations
with consultants were protracted partly because of uncertainties regarding
the liability of foreign consultants and contractors to Indonesian income
tax, but the contract is now signed.
Work on the first irrigation rehabilitation project is proceeding
well, and disbursements are on schedule.   The second such project was
delayed by three months due to difficulties in establishing the new
project authority, and further delays occurred because of procurement
difficulties, but construction contracts are now being awarded and dis-
bursements are expected soon to rise sharply.   On the third project,
planning and design are progressing, but there are possibilities of cost
overruns and delays, which are currently under review; meanwhile,
construction is under way.   Design and construction of the fisheries
project (Cr. 211-IND) have been delayed by about one year, pending
completion of a master plan to develop the project site, and disbursements
have been accordingly set back; the master plan is now ready and prospects
for successful project implementation now look good.   In the case of the
PUSRI fertilizer expansion project (Cr. 193-INn), though disbursements
will not rise appreciably until the second half of 1972 when financing
of equipment contracts will commence, the project is proceeding well and
the borrower's performance on this complex project can be considered
satisfactory.
