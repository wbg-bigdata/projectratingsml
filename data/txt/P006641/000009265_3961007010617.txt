SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Chile
Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project (Loan 2652-CH)
Attached is the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Chile - Valparaiso Water
Supply Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2652-CH)" prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean
Regional Office with Part II contributed by the borrower.
Following the March 1985 earthquake, a water supply project in Valparaiso, tentatively
identified earlier, was appraised and processed as an emergency project with reconstruction
components added. The objectives were to: a) reconstruct the water supply system of Greater
Valparaiso: b) prepare studies for future water and sewerage extension; and c) improve
ESVAL's operational efficiency.
In the event, no reconstruction was carried out under the project, i.e., all loan funds
were used for new facilities. Preparation of a follow up project was completed. The agency's
financial position was improved significantly. However, its operational efficiency was not.
Unaccounted for water has remained high (44%).
On balance, the outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as likely
and institutional development impact as substantial.
The PCR falls short of normal quality standards. An audit is planned upon completion
of the follow up project.

VALPARAISO WATER SUPPLY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Loan 2652-CH)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Valparaiso Water
Supply Reconstruction Project, for which Loan 2652-CH was approved on
February 11, 1986 in the amount of US$6.0 million. The loan closed as
scheduled on December 31, 1990. The last disbursement was on February 7,
1991, making the loan fully disbursed.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy
Operations Division, Country Department IV of the Latin America &
Caribbean Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and
the Borrower, Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de Valparaiso S.A. (Part II).
This PCR is based, inter alia, on: (a) the Staff Appraisal Report; (b)
Loan and Guarantee Agreements; (c) supervision reports; (d) correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; (e) interviews with Bank staff; and (fl
internal Bank memoranda.

VALPARAiSO WATER SUPPLY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Loan 2652-CH)
Evaluation Summary
Project Objectives
1.    The objectives of the Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project
(the Project) were: (a) to help reconstruct the water supply system of Greater
Valparaiso after a devastating earthquake; (b) to improve the operational
capacity of the executing agency, Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de Valparaiso,
(ESVAL); and (c) to prepare the studies and designs required for a second
loan aimed at implementing major extensions and improvements in the water
and sewerage systems of Greater Valparaiso (para. 3. 1). Specifically, the
Project was to finance: (a) the construction of a 500 liters per second (1/sec.)
surface-water treatment plant, a 5,000 m3 storage reservoir, and some 1,500
house connections; (b) the rehabilitation of an existing 750 1/sec. water
treatment plant damaged by the earthquake; (c) the acquisition of operations
equipment and general technical assistance; and (d) the preparation of the
feasibility studies and engineering designs needed for the improvement and
expansion of the Greater Valparaiso water supply and sewage disposal systems
(para. 3.2).
Project Implementation and Results
2.    Project implementation and results were satisfactory. The 500 1/sec.
water treatment plant and 5,000 m3 reservoir are in operation. All the studies
and designs for the improvement and expansion of the Greater Valparaiso
water supply and sewage disposal systems were completed, and the operations
equipment envisaged was purchased (para. 6.1). The initial Project laid the
foundation for the larger, follow-on project (the Second Valparaiso Water
Supply Project).
3.    However, there were changes in the Project's scope; the rehabilitation
of the existing 750 1/sec. water treatment plant at Conc6n was postponed due
to lack of funds as well as technical considerations (para. 5.3), and only 515
of the estimated 1,500 house connections were completed under the loan (the
other 1,000 were completed prior to loan signing) (para. 6.1). Furthermore,
ESVAL was unable to meet the Loan Agreement covenant (Sec. 5.02a) which
required the financing of 45 % of the annual expenditures from internal sources
in 1988, and was lax in securing adequate insurance as stipulated in the Loan
Agreement (Sec. 4.03) (paras. 5.2 & 9.1).



iii
4.    The Project's economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated neither in
the SAR, due to the emergency nature of the loan (SAR, para. 2.35), nor at
the closing of Loan 2652-CH, due to the Project's continuation under the
Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project (Loan 3331-CH) (para. 6.3).
Sustainability
5.    The Project directly and indirectly improved ESVAL's sustainability.
Directly, the Project created a basic institutional infrastructure and a long-term
plan for the firm. Indirectly, the Project provided the impetus for the granting
of tariff increases by the GoCh and for the implementation of the new tariff
system in the water sector based on full cost recovery. The tariff increases
subsequently adopted markedly improved ESVAL's financial sustainability
(para. 7.1).
Lessons Learned
6.    The Project's intent was to put a basic structure in place to allow for a
larger, follow-on project. Thus, the success of the initial Project has to be
measured by the success of the follow-on project. The follow-on project (the
Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project) has consistently been found to have
few or no problems since its inception in 1991. The principal lesson learned
was that small, initial projects which focus on getting basic institutional
infrastructure and long-term plans in place can better support larger, follow-on
projects (para. 8.2).
7.     A secondary lesson, learned concerns the estimation of the damage
caused by the earthquake and the amount of physical contingency funds. A
more realistic and comprehensive estimate of earthquake damages should have
been done by an expert with more expertise and experience. The estimate
provided by the consulting engineer significantly underestimated the amount of
earthquake damage. The lesson learned is that emergency projects should
have physical contingency amounts that reflect the risks of a lack of detailed
analyses, poor information, and/or project complexity. This Project did not.
The amount of physical contingency funds was only 10% of the total costs.
The Argentine Flood Rehabilitation Project, for example, had 35% of the total
costs earmarked for physical contingency costs (para. 8.3).

VALPARAISO WATER SUPPLY RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(Loan 2652-CH)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name       Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project
Loan Number        2652-CH
RVP Unit           Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
Country            Chile
Sector             Water Supply and Sewerage
2.    Background
2.1   The Valparaiso area is the third largest urban area in the country (after
Santiago and Concepci6n), with a 1991 population of approximately 770,000.
The borrower, Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de Valparaiso (ESVAL), provides
services to Chile's Fifth Region comprising eight provinces with a total
population in 1988 of 1.4 million, of which 91 % was urban.
2.2   The Water Sector. In the last two decades Chile has made significant
progress in the provision of water and sewerage services to its population.
Chile's water and sewerage coverage is among the highest in Latin America.
In 1988, approximately 98% of the urban and 75 % of the rural population had
access to water through house connections, and approximately 81 % of the
urban population was connected to a central sewerage system. The Chilean
water sector also has one of the lowest ratios in Latin America of employees
per 1,000 water connections-4.5, while ESVAL has a ratio of just 3.2. For
comparison, the Latin American average in 1985 was 9.0.
2.3   Sector Objectives. The Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction
Project was in-line with the GoCh's objectives of: (a) providing water and
sanitation to all its citizens; and (b) making major improvements in
environmental health. The Project also fits well with the Bank's sector
objectives of: (a) alleviating major water pollution problems by providing
adequate sewage treatment and disposal facilities; (b) improving the
performance of the urban water supply systems by optimizing the distribution
networks and storage facilities and reducing unaccounted-for water; and (c)
improving the institutional performance of the water companies, so that they
can meet the major challenges they will face in the next decade.



2
2.3   Origins of the Project. The Project was identified by ESVAL in May
1984. A Spanish consulting firm was hired to do the pre-appraisal field-work,
completing it in February 1985. On Sunday, March 3, 1985, the Valparaiso
region was hit by an earthquake measuring 7-8 on the Mervcalli/Richter scale.
The Greater Valparaiso water supply and sewerage facilities were heavily
damaged. After the earthquake, the consulting firm sent an engineer to assess
the damage and provide rehabilitation estimates. As a result, an earthquake
rehabilitation component was added to the Project, and the Bank was asked to
provide assistance. The Bank sent two consultants in April 1985 to appraise
the Project as an emergency loan. In a move to expedite loan approval, the
Project (by then formally named the Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction
Project) was appended to the Santiago Water Supply and Sewerage II Project.
To some extent, the move did expedite the Valparaiso Water Supply
Reconstruction Project's approval; it was approximately 11 months from the
date of the earthquake (March 3, 1985) to approval by the Board (February
11, 1986). Other emergency projects, however, have been appraised and
approved in less than six months (the Argentine Flood Emergency
Rehabilitation Project, for example).
2.4   Institutional Profile of ESVAL. ESVAL was established in 1977 as a
public agency under the Ministry of Public Works. In 1989 ESVAL was
transformed into a stock corporation with all shares held by the GoCh either
directly (35%) or indirectly (65%). When the Project began, ESVAL's
organization had remained unchanged for years. The corporation had
approximately 900 employees, but staff composition was unbalanced; there
were insufficient middle-level managers and technical staff. This problem was
not addressed in this Project but in the follow-on project, the Second
Valparaiso Water Supply Project (Loan 3331-CH).
2.5   When Project implementation began, ESVAL's installations were
rundown because of inadequate maintenance. The cause was GoCh policy.
From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, ESVAL's tariffs were kept at a level
just sufficient to cover operating costs. Thus, ESVAL deferred needed
maintenance and investments and was perennially short of working capital.
The Project markedly improved ESVAL's financial situation and basic
operations. However, the bulk of improvements (e.g., added capacity,
training, staff composition, decentralization) were part of the Second
Valparaiso Water Supply Project.
2.6   Bank Sector Lending Experience. The Bank has been involved in
Chile's water and sewerage sector since 1977 when it carried out a Sector
Study. In 1980 a first loan of US$32 million (Loan 1832-CH) was granted for
the Water Supply Project of Santiago. In 1986, the Bank approved the
Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project (Loan 2652-CH) along with a
second loan of US$60 million for the Second Santiago Water Supply and
Sewerage Project (Loan 2651-CH). Overall, the Bank's experience in the
sector has been satisfactory.

3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1    Project Objectives. The objectives of the Project were: (a) to help
reconstruct' the water supply system of Greater Valparaiso; (b) to prepare the
studies needed to support improvement and extension of ESVAL's water
supply and sewage disposal systems; and (c) to improve ESVAL's operational
efficiency.
3.2    Project Description. The Project had three components:
(a)    civil works composed of: (i) construction of the 500 I/sec. Las
Vegas water treatment plant; (ii) rehabilitation of the existing
750 I/sec. Conc6n water treatment plant; (iii) construction of the
Santa Ines 5,000 m3 reservoir and (iv) the installation of 1,500
house connections.
(b)    operational equipment consisting of: (i) the procurement of
vehicles, earth-moving equipment, sewer cleaning equipment,
generators, mobile pumps, and leak detection and repair
equipment; and (ii) the purchase and installation of water
meters; and
(c)    consultant services for: (i) the final design and construction
supervision of the Las Vegas water treatment plant; (ii) technical
assistance for inproving operational efficiency; and (iii) studies
and designs for preparation of the next envisioned project (the
Second Valparaiso Water Supply and Sewerage Project).
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1   As mentioned in the Background section, the Project began as an
emergency loan to "reconstruct" damaged facilities. Although the actual
design contained little reconstruction work (only the Conc6n water treatment
plant), the design did benefit from flexibility, and to a lesser degree,
expediency. There were, however, no detailed descriptions or costs
breakdowns for the Project sub-components. The lack of analysis and detail
resulted in logistical problems during implementation.
4.2    The Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project and the Santiago
Water Supply and Sewerage II Project were originally envisioned as a single
loan granted to the GoCh, covering the areas of Santiago and Greater
Valparaiso. During negotiations in October 1985, the loan was split in two
(2652-CH and 2651-CH). The split was requested by the GoCh because
constitutionally, it is prohibited from on-lending to majority-owned government
subsidiaries.
1.    'Reconstruct' is a misnomer. All of the Project's civil works save one (and it was
later cancelled) were new facilities.



4
4.3   When Loan 2652-CH was approved by the Board on February 11,
1986, it included an unspecified amount of money for reconstructing facilities
damaged by the March 3, 1985 earthquake. However, it later appeared that
the magnitude of the damage was more than originally estimated. Therefore,
the Bank, the Borrower, and the IDB agreed that US$12.4 million would be
reallocated from an existing Ministry of Public Works IDB loan (1 13-CH) to
cover the earthquake damage. The earthquake reconstruction component
(Conc6n water treatment plant) of Loan 2652-CH was dropped and the funds
used for other Project components.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1   Implementation of the Project began slowly. Loan 2652-CH became
effective on July 3, 1986, five months after Board approval. Four months
later, due chiefly to insufficient organization and administration, ESVAL had
still not completed the Terms of Reference for consultant assignments or the
bidding documents for equipment (a 22% delay from the Project schedule).
The initial delays, however, were eventually made up, and the Project was
completed as scheduled on December 31, 1990.
5.2   The Project's most significant problem was ESVAL's financial
performance. As noted in the SAR, the Project's main risk was that the
GoCh's tariff action would be delayed. The Loan Agreement stipulated that
ESVAL would finance 45% of the Project costs from internal sources (Sec.
5.02a). Late in 1987, ESVAL's much-needed tariff increase, requested in
mid-1986, was still pending with the GoCh. To cover the gap, ESVAL used
the cash originally set-aside for the larger Project components to finance its
portion of the short-term Project costs. This was possible due to the slow pace
of initial Project implementation. The tariff increase granted in December
1987 was insufficient, and ESVAL's financial situation deteriorated further.
In 1988 there was a projected financing gap of US$1.3 million for the coming
year (1989). ESVAL asked the GoCh for an additional tariff increase in mid-
1988. The tariff increase, however, was not approved until March 1989.
Thus, a financial short-fall developed in 1989. To cover the short-fall,
ESVAL asked for and received an amendment to the Loan Agreement
increasing Bank-financed expenditures in June and July 1989 from 50% to
100% of Project costs.2 After mid-1989, there were no more financial
problems. ESVAL's subsequent financial health was due mainly to the
implementation of a new tariff law by the GoCh in March 1990. The new law
established a tariff which provided full cost recovery in the sector by 1994 (as
recommended by Bank Sector Report No. 6614-CH). It is remarkable that the
Bank took no formal action during the year and a half in which the Borrower
was not in compliance with Borrower financing requirements.
5.3   Regardless of the financial problems and the initial delays, the Project
progressed well. All the major components of the Project were completed on
schedule with the exception of the rehabilitation of the existing Conc6n water

treatment plant, which was moved from the initial Valparaiso Water Supply
Project (Loan 2652-CH) to the follow-on Second Valparaiso Water Supply
Project (Loan 3331-CH, approved on April 28, 1991). This was done (a)
because of a lack of funds due to higher than estimated costs for the Las Vegas
water treatment plant, and (b) because the capacity of the water production and
treatment system did not allow the existing Conc6n plant to be taken off-line
during the long period of time required for the rehabilitation. This could be
done only after the new treatment plant at Conc6n, funded under the Second
Valparaiso Water Supply Project, was completed. This logistical problem was
not considered during appraisal. The funds originally slated for the Conc6n
water treatment plant were used to fund the cost increases in the Las Vegas
treatment plant caused by increases in the scope of the work.
5.4   Costs and Financing. The Project was appraised at US$10.8 million
of which US$6.0 million were foreign costs and US$4.8 million local costs
(Table 4). The Bank was to provide US$6.0 million (56%) and ESVAL was
to provide US$4.8 million (44%) (Table 5). US$3.9 million (36%) of the
total funds were set aside for contingencies. Total project costs increased from
US$10.8 million to US$11.3 million (an increase of 4.7%) in 1989 and to
US$12.2 million (an increase of 12.4%) by the closing date of December 31,
1990. Local costs increased from US$4.8 million to US$10.0 million (108%).
While foreign costs decreased from US$6.0 million to US$2.2 million (173%)
(Table 4). Yet the increases in total costs do not tell the whole story. The
actual increases were higher given the fact that the Conc6n water treatment
plant was dropped from the Project and its funds allocated to the other sub-
components. There were no specific costs given in the SAR for the Conc6n
Plant; thus, it was not possible to calculate the actual cost increases.
Ultimately, the Bank provided US$6.0 million (49%) and ESVAL provided
US$6.2 million (51%) of the total costs. Cost increases were funded from
ESVAL's internal sources and by using funds originally slated for the Conc6n
water treatment plant rehabilitation (para. 5.3). The cost increases were
primarily the result of higher than estimated costs for the construction of the
Las Vegas plant. All procurement was in accordance with Bank guidelines.
6.    Project Results
6.1   Overview. The Project was a qualified success. The Las Vegas water
treatment plant is operational, providing 500 1/sec. of water with excellent
operating results. The design of the Las Vegas plant was superb and was used
as a model for the new water treatment plant funded under the Second
Valparaiso Water Supply Project. Most of the other components of the Project
are also in place; (a) the 5,000 m3 reservoir has been constructed; (b) the
operational equipment funded by the loan has been purchased; (c) the studies
needed to support the Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project were
successfully completed; and (d) 515 out of the estimated 1,500 house
connections were completed under the loan. Only 1/3 of the 1,500 house
connections were completed because prior to the loan signing (April 1986),
ESVAL installed about 1,000 connections using its own funds.



6
6.2   ESVAL's Financial Performance. As mentioned above (para. 5.2),
delays in the GoCh's tariff actions resulted in significant income short-falls in
1988 and the inability of ESVAL to meet the financial stipulations of the Loan
Agreement (e.g., 45% of Project costs financed from internal sources). It was
only after mid-1989 that the financial situation began to improve. The
improvement was a direct result of a new tariff structure based on full cost
recovery in the water sector. The impact of the new tariff structure was that
actual, net income went from 277% below the SAR target in 1988 (US$-
0.9:US$-3.4 million) to 55% above the SAR target in 1989 (US$-0.9:US$-0.5
million) (Table 14). ESVAL's financial performance has increased every year
since, with 1992 showing a net income (in 1984 US$) of US$3.9 million.
Overall, ESVAL's financial performance improved during implementation and
was better than projected in the SAR. The financial audit reports prepared by
independent auditors were satisfactory but often delivered with delays and
minor qualifications.
6.3   Economic Rate of Return. The Project's economic rate of return
(ERR) was calculated neither in the SAR, due to the emergency nature of the
loan (SAR, para. 2.35), nor at the closing of Loan 2652-CH, due to the
Project's continuation under the Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project
(Loan 333 1-CH). Therefore, no ERR comparison can be made.
6.4   Impact. The Project had a significant long-term economic impact: (a)
it helped provide the funds and expertise to design a long-term water sector
plan for the Greater Valparaiso area; and (b) it helped to transform ESVAL
from a deteriorating and neglected water services provider, to an institution
with a nascent capacity for sustaining future growth.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.1   The Valparaiso Water Supply Reconstruction Project strengthened
ESVAL's sustainability indirectly and directly. Indirectly, the tariff increases
granted by the GoCh to help finance the Project, and the GoCh's new tariff
structure implemented in March 1990, assured income levels sufficient for
future growth. Directly, the Project's funding of additional facilities and
equipment, along with the creation of a long-term master plan for growth,
paved the way for long-term sustainability. Moreover, because of the Project,
ESVAL now has much of the necessary institutional infrastructure (e.g.,
equipment and management information systems) to sustain itself in the near-
term. Long-term institutional sustainability is being consolidated as part of the
Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project.
8.    Bank's Performance
8.1   Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory. The Bank's appraisal
was, perhaps, too flexible and general; the lack of details and analyses in the
SAR made it difficult to evaluate Project implementation. Bank supervision
was sufficient with six missions and 59 staff-days spent in the field. All



7
Project problems were resolved before they caused significant delays in
implementation.
8.2   Lessons Learned. The Bank's involvement with the Borrower started
on a small scale; the Project created basic improvements in institutional
infrastructure and operations as well as supported the studies needed for the
next phase of ESVAL's development. In other words, the Project helped
establish a stable foundation on which the larger, follow-on project (the US$50
million, Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project) was built. The success of
the initial Project is evident in the success of the follow-on project. The
Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project has been consistently rated as having
few or no problems. If it is possible to generalize from the experience of this
Project, it would be that small-scale projects which create basic institutional
infrastructure and long-term plans can lead to successful, large-scale, follow-
on projects. Another lesson learned concerns the preparation of
comprehensive studies prior to the design of the follow-on project; the studies
completed under the initial Project provided in-depth data and alternatives for
the preparation of the larger, follow-on project, thereby increasing that
project's chance of success.
8.3   A secondary lesson learned concerns the estimation of the damage
caused by the earthquake and the amount of physical contingency funds. A
more realistic and comprehensive estimate of earthquake damages should have
been done by an expert with more expertise and experience. The estimate
provided by the consulting engineer significantly underestimated the amount of
earthquake damages. The lesson learned is that emergency projects should
have physical contingency amounts that reflect the risks of a lack of detailed
analyses, poor information, and/or project complexity. This Project did not.
The amount of physical contingency funds was only 10% of the total costs.
The Argentine Flood Rehabilitation Project, for example, had 35% of the total
costs earmarked for physical contingency costs.
9.    Borrower's Performance
9.1   The performance of ESVAL was satisfactory. However, ESVAL did
not get adequate insurance coverage as stipulated in the Loan Agreement (Sec.
4.03) until three years after the Project began, even though the Bank
repeatedly noted the discrepancy, and the Borrower repeatedly promised
action. Further, there were initial delays in the Project caused by insufficient
organization and administration on the part of ESVAL (para. 5.1).
10.   Borrower-Bank Relationship
10.1  The Project has built an excellent working relationship between the
Bank and the Borrower with lines of communications well established. Loan
2652-CH created a strong, professional association that led directly to the
US$50 million loan for the Second Valparaiso Water Supply Project
(Loan 3331-CH).

11.   Consulting Services
11.1  Consultant services financed under the Project constituted a sizable
portion of the Project. Bank-approved procedures were used in hiring all
consultants. Both the Bank and the Borrower were generally satisfied with the
quality and execution of the consulting firms, many of which provided
exemplary services and have continued to work for ESVAL.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The quality of the documentation was fair. It should be noted that the
Project went from preparation to approval in less than a year; thus some of the
standard indicators were left out or aggregated in the interest of expediency.
The SAR could have been improved by including such indicators as the
Project's ERR and by disaggregating the costs of the Project's sub-
components. During implementation, quarterly financial reports by ESVAL
provided basic financial information on the progress of the Project. ESVAL's
Progress Report dated March 1991 (after the Project's completion) was
particularly useful in that it was the most up-to-date and comprehensive of all
ESVAL financial reports.
12.2 It would have been helpful for the PCR's preparation to have had more
details about Project implementation in the supervision reports. This lack of
details is, however, understandable given that the Project was consistently
rated a 1 or 2, and thus there were few problems to be highlighted in the
supervision reports.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S
PERSPECTIVE
1.    Compliance
1.1   The Borrower complied with the Project Completion Guidelines by
preparing a Completion Report sent under Note No. 0517 dated April 30,
1993. The Borrower sent a revised report in August 1993 and a review of
Parts I, II and III of the PCR in February 1994. The Completion Reports
(original and revised) and the comments on the PCR are on file in the LAC
Information Center.
2.    Synopsis of Borrower's Comments
2.1   Borrower's Approval of Synopsis. The Completion Report sent by
the Borrower was 52 pages long, in Spanish, and contained considerably more
than the requested information. The Borrower agreed to and approved the
following synopsis.
2.2   Bank's Performance. Overall, the Borrower was very satisfied with
the Bank's performance, noting that the technical and financial collaboration
and assistance of the World Bank was vital to bringing the Project to fruition.
There were, however, some minor points raised by the Borrower regarding
Bank performance: (a) the methodology of the Bank's competitive bidding
system should be adjusted to give technical quality a greater weight vis-a-vis
the price of the bid (no details were provided as to how); and (b) the Borrower
recommends that the Bank adopt more flexible criteria for consultant bid
evaluations, e.g., the Chilean tax of 20% to 40% on the contracts of foreign
consulting firms should be included in the cost of the proposals for evaluation
purposes.
2.3   Consultants' Performance. Since the majority of the Project was
implemented by consultants, the Borrower devoted significant space to
reviewing consultant contracts and performance. Comments on all consultants
were favorable, with the firm of GKW singled out for its excellence. GKW
carried out the study of the sewerage alternatives in the Greater Valparaiso
Area.
2.4   Borrower's Performance. The Borrower did not directly address its
own performance. It did, however, note that ESVAL now has a basic
organizational structure in place, permitting further development, alluding to
the insufficient organization and administration that initially caused project
delays (para. 5.1).
2.5   Relationship between the Bank and the Borrower. The Borrower
did not assess its relationship with the Bank.
