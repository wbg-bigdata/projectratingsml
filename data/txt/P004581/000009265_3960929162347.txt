MEMORANDUM AND RECOM.MENDAfION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES,
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES,
FOR A COTTAGE ENTERPRISE FINANCE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Development Bank of the Philippines, with the guarantee of the Republic
of the Philippines,  for US$15.0 million is submitted for approval.   The
proposed loan would be for 20 years including five years grace at the
standard variable interest rate and would help finance the development of
cottage  enterprises.    The  proposed  Project  would  be  cofinanced  by
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).
2.       Background.    Cottage enterprises  in the  Philippines  are very
important in terms of their employment impact (they account for 40X of (ormal
non-agricultural employment); their regional impact (two-thirds of their
production takes place outside the national capital area); and as the
principal source for the emergence of dynamic small and medium sized firms
that will play an increasingly important role in the Philippines' industrial
strategy. The firms are particularly well represented in the manufacturing
sector; cottage firms are concentrated in food preparation, apparel,
furniture and fabricated metals subsectors. Since about two-thirds of the
labor force in manufacturing in rural areas, where cottage firms predominate,
is female, there is a strong likelihood that the sector has a high female
participation rate.
3.       Despite  their  social and economic  importance  these  firms  are
routinely shut out of formal channels of credit due to their small size and
lack of acceptable collateral.   Interviews with cottage firms, industry
associations and banks indicate that cottage firms have almost no access to
credit through banking channels. The main issue is that most cottage firms
have only chattel mortgages to offer banks, which banks consider greatly
inferior to real estate mortgages because the chattel is usually small
machines which can easily be moved and/or substituted, and are difficult to
value and to repossess.   Further,  such firms usually lack established
premises, reputations and banking track records. Hence the smallness of the
firms is an important reason deterring banks from accepting their assets as
collateral. An important lesson learnt from other Bank financed projects for
small and medium industries in the Philippines (see Schedule C) is that
cottage  firms  are unlikely  to gain access  to bank credit unless  the
collateral issue is addressed.
4.       One result of cottage firms being shut out of the formal financial
system is that they turn to informal moneylenders. However, interest costs
in such markets are extremely high, ranging from 3% up to 17X or more per
month.   The high cost of such credit clearly limits its use for normal
expansion or working capital requirements. Alternatively, firms limit their
operations to what can be financed with internally generated funds and fail
to expand and seek out new opportunities.
5.       This is a problem worldwide and one approach that is working
effectively in other countries, especially in Europe where it was pioneered,
is the establishment of Mutual Guarantee Associations (MGAs). In MCAs, firms



- 2 -
individual members. They each contribute to form a guarantee fund, which is
then deposited with a bank which agrees to lend to the members of the
association an agreed multiple of the guarantee.  The fund has particular
credibility with the banks since it is on their own books and can be debited
without complex recourse procedures. Further, since it is the members who
are liable if the guarantee is called, there can be considerable moral
suasion exercised on delinquent members.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed Project would enable
the Bank to play an important catalytic role in developing and funding an
innovative scheme to facilitate lending to cottage enterprises.
7.       Project Obiective.   The Project's objective is to help improve
access to credit by cottage enterprises that typically employ 10-20 persons
and have assets of about US$15,000.
8.       Proiect Description.  The proposed Project would involve onlending
by DBP to participating retail banks to rediscount subloans made to cottage
enterprises, to finance their investment and working capital needs during the
1991-94 period.   About 60 MGAs, each with about 40-100 members would be
established throughout the country to guarantee the loans of their respective
members. The member firms would voluntarily contribute to form a guarantee
fund.   This guarantee fund would be deposited with a participating bank,
which would then lend some multiple of the fund to the individual members of
the MGA.   To initiate the scheme with adequate leverage,  the members'
subscriptions to the MGAs would be supplemented with a matching loan advanced
and held in trust by DBP. As the MGAs' resources increase from new member
subscriptions and from interest earned on their equity, the matching loan
would be repaid and the funds used to assist new MGAs.
9.       The proposed Project would have three components:
(i)     subloan financing to fund projects of MGA member cottage
enterprises through accredited banks;
(ii)     technical assistance to set up, monitor, train and supervise
MGAs and provide pollution-abatement assistance to MGA member
cottage enterprises; and to train financial institutions; and
(iii)     a guarantee fund comprised of MGA member subscriptions and
supplemental matching loans used to guarantee MGA member
subloans.
The estimated total financing requirement for the Project is $44.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $12.4 million. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The disbursement
schedule is shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of up to US$1 million
for subloans made after January 1, 1991 would be permitted. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the
Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9030-PH, dated December 21, 1990,
is being distributed separately.
10.      Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with DBP
on the Operating Policy Guidelines (OPG), which incorporates the following:



exclusion of DBP as a retailer of funds under the proposed Project;
enterprise eligibility criteria and minimum and maximum subloan size;
minimum loan participation by retail banks and minimum equity contribution by
subborrowers; relending terms to the retail banks; onlending terms to
subborrowers; and matching loan fund account procedures and allocation of the
KfW interest differential income. Agreement with the government was reached
on: (1) the Policy Manual which incorporates: licensing criteria for MGAs;
MGA member firm size and subscriptions; monitoring and suspension
arrangements; auditing and reporting arrangements for MGAs; environmental
assistance; and the special focus on women entrepreneurs; and (2) the
mechanism for assuming the foreign exchange risk.
11.      Effectiveness of the proposed loan will be conditional on: (a)
approval of the Operating Policy Guidelines by DBP's Board; (b) approval of
the Policy Manual by the Review Committee; and (c) signing of five Subsidiary
Loan Agreements between DBP and the PFIs.
12.      Benefits.   The Project would increase the volume of credit for
lending to cottage industry and would reduce its cost.  The Project would
assist DBP and the PFIs in gaining experience and knowledge about lending to
cottage industries and in establishing an effective finance facility to
improve the access of cottage firms to bank lending.  It is expected that
about 4,200 cottage firms would be financed under the Project with subproject
costs of about US$33 million. The Project would cover every region in the
country and the vast majority of loans would be outside Metro Manila. The
regional phasing is indicated in the attached map. It is also expected that
the project design would enhance the ability of women entrepreneurs to obtain
formal credit.
13.      Risks.  The program is an innovative one which does not currently
exist in the Philippines. Accordingly, there are the risks associated with
any new program. One risk is that there will be significant defaults under
the program that will reduce the guarantee funds. This risk will be dealt
with by starting with moderate levels of leverage and by careful selection
and licensing of the MGAs. Since MGAs will play a major role in approving
the subloans of their individual members, it is expected that they will
monitor subloan performance and exert peer pressure to repay.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
