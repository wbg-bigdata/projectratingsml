A: Project Development Objective
1. Background
The transition from a centrally planned to a market oriented economy has brought rapid changes in all
areas of economic and social life of Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries in transition.
In the economic area, a massive privatization and the creation of many new, mostly small private
enterprises increased the number of economic entities several fold. New relationships have emerged
between the public and the private sector. An expansion of economic activities, particularly in service
areas which were underdeveloped or completely unknown before, are taking place at a record pace.
The economic reform has been accompanied by a decline in production, high inflation, increased
unemployment, and deterioration of living standards.
All these changes in the economy and society have posed challenges to the major data collection and
compilation issues for the statistical systems of the Russian Federation (RF).
The RF has met some of the challenges systematically and successfully. In the area of macroeconomic
statistics, the statistical agency began its preparation of new macroeconomic indicators, in compliance
with the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA), started collecting data on prices and introduced into
statistical practice Consumer Price Index (CPI) and other price indexes. The compilation of Balance of
Payments (BOP), money and banking, government finance statistics and new types of social statistics,
etc. have been introduced and data are collected and compiled.
To be able to produce the statistics required by economic and social policy, macroeconomic management,
and business decisions, Goskomstat together with other data collecting agencies, have to change the data
collection methods and the scope of collected data.
All these efforts of the Russian Government along with the assistance of international organizations and
bilateral donors have led to substantial improvements in the macroeconomic statistics.
However, the following problems continue to persist:
* Many new enterprises do not compile data according to statistical reporting requirements and in many
cases the old reporting system cannot supply good quality data and standards for macroeconomic
compilations and analysis.
*  Certain economic activities carried out by the shadow economy either fail to be captured or are
covered only partially by official statistical reports. This places additional challenges on statisticians
to make ad hoc adjustments to primary information.
* Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have not been adopted yet. Balance sheets of all business
entities and financial institutions are still done on Soviet type accounting standard.
The State Statistical System (SSS) of the RF has engaged itself in the reform process as a part of the
general reform of the public sector. However, the demand on data for policy and business decisions has
been emerging at a higher pace than the statistical system is able to develop and deliver.



The transformation of the SSS system will be a lengthy process requiring significant resources to all the
areas of statistics. It requires an introduction of new survey methods; improvements in the management
of the statistical system; the training and retraining of staff to new skills; and the procurement of
processing equipment; to store, share and disseminate information efficiently to meet the needs of the
users.
Despite all the achievements, massive efforts are still needed to achieve timeliness; quality, relevance and
comprehensiveness of the macroeconomic -statistics.
The objectives for the development are:
1. Improved economic management by providing a required information base.
2. Improved availability of data needed for a market economy.
Therefore, the implementation of priority projects for the development of the SSS of the RF should aim
to:
1. Eliminate data gaps in the macro economic framework used for economic policy and management;
2. Capture new and dynamic economic and social activities;
3. Meet the needs of analysis by policy makers and the business community;
4. Introduce international standards and methodologies;
5. Increase efficiency and productivity with improved organization, data collection and processing
methods and equipment;
6. Improve the quality of analysis and the monitoring of economic development along with the
modernization of decision-making methods for economic policy.
T'he World Bank (hereinafter called "Bank") has had successful experience in assisting the Goskomstat of the
RF. In 1994-95, a project was financed with a Bank Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant to revise
annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for the period of transition. The joint Bank-Goskomstat report
dealt with issues not only in macro statistics but also discussed the areas of general data collection,
dissemination and sharing among Government agencies, as well as the revision of policy for statistical
aggregates.
The Bank is currently financing improvements in statistical work in the areas of national accounts, input-
output analysis, and household and labor force surveys through the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
loan. The surveys work to develop a set of poverty indicators that are financed from the Social Protection
Investment Loan (SPIL). However, all of this work helps to improve macro indicators, but does not
comprehensively address the very important issue of general data collection. Only radical changes in the
methods of data collection and processing, storing and sharing can bring improvements in the coverage,
reliability, timeliness and usage of economic and social statistics.

2. Project Development Objective and Key Performance Indicators
The "Development of the SSS" project supports the initial phase of the long term program to strengthen
the SSS of the RF. The Development Objective of the project isto restructure the SSS for Goskomstat
and to strengthen other data collection agencies. The key performance indicators for this development
objective are presented in Annex 1, Project Design Summary.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported by the Project (see
Annex 1):
CAS document number: 16549-RU;
Date of latest CAS discussion: May 6, 1997; Progress Report: December 22, 1998.
Both documents addressed among others the importance of macroeconomic management issues. The
Government of the RF has expressed its interest in working with the Bank to address a number of
economic management and public sector reform issues. The Government must have the ability to
enhance economic management by increasing the capacity of the key institutions that contribute to this
task by improving coordination.
2. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy:
The SSS of the RF, as a part of the public sector, will assist the Government in policy making by
collecting, processing, storing, sharing and disseminating of quality and reliable data and will contribute
to the enhancement of economic management. The Government of the RF together with the Bank has
developed a program for restructuring of the SSS within its reform process. This project covers the initial
stage of the Program. If the Government considers it necessary, there might be a need in follow-up loans
to complete the Program (see Annex 12).
3. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
3.1. The current organization and management of Goskomstat and other statistical agencies are not fully
geared to the needs of a market economy due to the lack of feedback mechanism based on identifying the
needs of users and the problems of respondents. The selection of projects, and the assignment of
priorities, perspective planning based on a statistical framework of macro-economic and social statistics
are not utilized in the formation of statistical policies and plans. There is no systematic approach in
matching needs against resources. Areas for improving efficiency and increasing productivity, e.g. the
rationalization of data processing and the introduction of sample surveys, are not appropriately
recognized. With respect to the institutional arrangements, there is an inadequate appreciation of the need
to finalize legal arrangements, establish sound inter-agency coordination, and formalize public relations
with users of statistics. The provision of training for management strategy, the perspective and corporate
planning and a systematic approach to the senior-level management of the central and regional
Goskomstat, will contribute to the recognition of these issues and their resolution.
3.2. Since most of the training on international standards and methodologies has been received by a few
statisticians at headquarters, by either training and seminars abroad or as hands-on-training under the
visiting consultants, there is a great understanding of these principles. There is a need to foster this
knowledge among the statisticians in the regional offices so that they can understand the linkages among
various data sets, check data with awareness, and communicate better on technical issues. The provision
of training on standards and methodologies to regional staff would eventually contribute to the
3



improvement of the quality of data, the motivation of respondents, better service to users, and sound
feedback to headquarters.
3.3. The current data processing equipment and software available at headquarters for the processing of
incoming administrative data and maintaining frameworks for collection of data from establishments and
households through sample surveys, are being overwhelmed. In addition, the staff at the headquarters of
Goskomstat has limited experience with the processing and long term storage of large data sets and the
maintenance and use of high quality statistical sampling frameworks for drawing scientific samples to
survey various sectors of the economy and population. The component entitled the strengthening of the
statistical infrastructure, provides data processing equipment, training and consultants to improve the
maintenance of the business register as the sampling framework for establishments. This will improve the
household sampling framework derived from the population census results, and improve the timeliness of
statistical data processed by administrative records generated by other government agencies.
3.4. Goskomstat needs to reorient its data collection, processing, storage and dissemination systems by
using sample surveys instead of censuses and disseminating its data more widely; particularly to the
private sector, in more user-friendly publications and in a variety of electronic formats. It needs to
improve the coverage of statistical indicators, which support the macro-economic analysis as well as to
produce effective data for micro-economic analysis. This component will provide data processing and
communications equipment, training and consultants to improve coverage; quality and timeliness data by
supporting the more effective use of sample surveys, information technology and market oriented data
dissemination.
3.5. The introduction of International Monetary Fund's (IMF) standards to economic and functional
analysis of government accounts by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and sharing experience in and
resulted data with Goskomstat, will contribute to the elimination of data gaps and the compilation of
SNA's sequence of accounts for the General Government sector. There is a need for rationalizing
institutional arrangements and streamlining the classification, compilation, analysis and dissemination of
data on government debt. Through use of consultancies in government finance statistics and the
preparation of General Government sector, accounts and proper linkages to macroeconomic data could
contribute to the improvement and strengthening of a database in the Government sector which in turn
would improve monetary and fiscal policy and debt management.
3.6. There is a general lack of financial statistics in areas other than money and banking. Financial
asset/instruments need to be introduced such as 1993 SNA's and IMF's Draft Manual on Financial
Statistic's classifications on sectoring the economy, financial intermediaries and auxiliaries, and in the
collection of basic financial data. A strategy, of the program preparation on enhancing financial statistics
and its phased implementation by Goskomstat with participation of the Central Bank (CB) and other
regulatory financial agencies, needs to be worked out. The CB plays an important role in the
implementation process, but it will not receive any financing out of this project loan. Consulting and
training on financial statistics would build up technical know-how for enhancing financial statistics and
would eventually compile SNA's sequence of accounts for financial institutions and the flow of funds
accounts.
3.7. The statistics of BOP, which are compiled jointly by the CB and Goskomstat, need to be
strengthened in certain areas; namely merchandise trade, services on travel, transport, communications
and government, current and capital transfers, informal trade, portfolio and direct investment. To
improve the quality of these components, special objective-oriented sample surveys need to be launched
for which foreign consulting and some overseas training may be needed. The improvement of BOP
would contribute to the formulation of a sound monetary and exchange rate policy, the management of
international reserves, and the provision of reliable BOP data to international investors and bankers.
4



3.8. The implementation of the project is a result of a consortium effort on the Government of the RF and
the Bank. It contains spending for items that are not strictly statistical in nature, such as the improvement
of forecasts at Ministry of Economy (MOE). Goskomstat collects most of the data but this is insufficient
for economic policy. The component is aimed to increase the capacity of the MOE to perform timely and
reliable short and medium term economic forecasts, to receive information needed for the estimates on
line, as well as, to provide interested agencies with the results via computerized networks.
3.9. Goskomstat and regional administrations are planning to process electronically all data on births and
deaths, marriages and divorces by local statistical agencies. Due to the lack of a computer facility and
licensed software, the Registry Office (ZAGS) can not input initial data. In order to accomplish this data
processing successfully, the Registry Office has to be strengthened.
3. 10. An efficient mechanism has to be developed for effective management of the loan implementation,
which in itself is a massive investment into the SSS and other Government agencies. The creation of a
Directorate under BEA to support the development of the SSS will be such a vehicle. It will be
responsible not only for this project, but other related projects on the basis of grants and other possible
loans.

2. Key Policy and Institutional Reforms Supported by the Project:
* Approval and effective implementation of the Law on Statistics.
* Establishment of an Inter-agency Statistical Coordinating Committee and a Statistical Advisory
Council consisting of representatives of government, private data users and providers.
3. Benefits and Target Population:
* Improved policy making and economic management - Government agencies and the CB.
*  Well-informed and sound business decision making - domestic and foreign investors, producers and
traders.
* Improved comparability and standardization - International organizations, foreign governments and
multi-national corporations.
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Goskomstat will implement the main part of the project at federal and regional levels. Several sub-
projects will be implemented in other agencies, e.g. MOF; MOE; State Customs Committee and regional
Administrations to improve cooperation in data collection, sharing, analysis, and dissemination. The
project will be managed by the Directorate under BEA to support the development of the SSS of the RF.
The precise Governance structures of the Project will be worked-out, before effectiveness. The Project is
expected to be overseen by a Coordinating Committee, which is independent of the Board of Trustees of
the BEA and who will monitor project performance and approve the quarterly accounting and reporting
requirements prior to submission to the Bank.
Financial Management, Accounting and Auditing
An action plan has been drawn up which reflects the Bank's operating procedures and financial
management standards. While the capacity of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) needs to be
augmented to undertake the project the overall assessment of the key financial and administrative staff is
favorable. The system will be substantially in place prior to project effectiveness including the key
position of Project Accountant. Prior to effectiveness another assessment of PIU capacity will be
undertaken at the end of 1999.
The PIU will maintain separate projects accounts in accordance with accounting principles and practices
satisfactory to the Bank. Quarterly project management reports will be prepared by the PIU and will be
approved, along with the progress reports by the project Coordinating Committee.  Supporting
documentation for Statements of Expenditure would be kept for at least one year after the final
disbursement of funds for the project. Project accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. No later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, the PIU will
submit to the Bank copies of audit reports containing separate audit opinions on the project accounts and
the Special Account. Detailed terms of reference for auditors will be prepared following the guidelines
included in the World Bank's Financial Accounting and Auditing Handbook.

Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
Quarterly progress reports covering all project components will be prepared by the PIU and will be sent to
the Bank within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will include: (i) progress achieved
against agreed implementation and disbursement schedules and key performance indicators; and (ii) work
programs and cost estimates for the coming quarter and for the total project. Attached to the textual
reports will be the Project Management Report (PMR) with the key financial data for the quarter and
budgeted activities for the next two quarters. The main purpose of the reports will be to provide
managers and the Coordinating Committee timely and updated information on implementation of project
components, highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on progress
in resolving previous recommendations.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection:
Should data processing and management be centralized? Rejection would be based on being politically
unacceptable in the current environment. Certain decentralization is acceptable while introducing modem
technology. Full centralization is not acceptable in a country the size of Russia, which faces the
complexity of collecting and processing statistics in such a huge country within 89 regions across 11 time
zones.

3. Lessons  Learned  and Reflected in the Proaect Design:
The Bank and other agencies are providing technical assistance to the statistical systems worldwide. The
Bank is particularly active in the transitional economies of the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region.
Statistical components were included in the Institutional Building Loan (IBL) in Ukraine and Uzbekistan,
Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) in Armnenia and Kazakhstan. IDF grant financed projects have been
completed or are currently being implemented in the RF, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lithuania,
Moldova, Macedonia and Uzbekistan. These forms of technical Assistance (TA), however, can not
address institutional building issues adequately. The proposed project is addressing the basic issues of
7



data collection, data management, processing, storing, sharing, and dissemination in an orchestrated
manner.
4. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership
The Management of Goskomstat created a Project Preparation Unit and staffed it with three people
financed by the Goskomstat's budget. In order to facilitate and improve the project preparation, a grant
for US$408,000 has been allocated from the Portfolio Development Loan by the Government.
5. Value Added of Bank Support in this Project:
The Bank along with other donors has already contributed substantial value to the development of the
SSS of the RF (see D.2). This project is about to start the institutional reform in the SSS of the RF. The
beginning of this process requires substantial financial resources, knowledge of the substantive statistical
issues, as well as experience in the management of multi-topic projects of such scale. The Bank has the
capacity to do it.
E: Summary of Project Analyses
(Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4)
The Government is committed to enhance and stabilize economic management and is expected to keep it
as a high priority in the development of an adequate statistical base to monitor both economic and social
developments.
Cost Effectiveness Analysis
In order to evaluate the project impact to the economic growth, two types of estimates have to be
performed: i) the long term cost effectiveness of streamlining the statistical work with gains in the
reduction of labor intensive statistical operations; and ii) the impact of reliable data on policy decisions.
Both evaluation methods are highly speculative and have to rely on numerous assumptions. The
experience of other countries in this field indicates that there are factor-productivity and long-term cost-
efficiency gains from the streamlining of statistical works, the re-aligning of headquarters vs. Regional
office' relationships, as well as security gains in the reduction of labor-intensive statistical operations.
2. Financial
Cost recovery is only marginal in statistical projects, mainly through data dissemination.
3. Technical:
The technical resources provided by this project consist of hardware and software under the
"Reorganization of Data Collection, Processing and Dissemination" component and amount to 53.91
percent of total project cost. These resources will be provided together with consulting services and staff
training, which are designed to improve data collection, processing and dissemination. Technical
requirements for hardware and software are to be assessed by those who reviewed the needs of the SSS
(Goskomstat and other data collecting government agencies), together with international and local
consultants and approved by the Bank.
8



4. Institutional:
The issues of institutional structure and management of the SSS are addressed at early stages of the
project preparation. Project implementation will promote cooperation in data collection and data sharing
between relevant government agencies, and will define their respective responsibilities in the area of data
collecting. The Law on Statistics has been passed by the DUMA, but it is not effective yet. This version
does not fully meet all the requirements and conditions of the SSS during the proposed restructuring. It is
proposed, however, to draft a modified version of the Law and submit it to the DUMA. The Bank is
planning to provide technical assistance in the drafting of the Law.
5. Social:
The implementation of the project will have an impact on the staff of the statistical system. On one hand,
the work environment will be improved with the introduction of contemporary equipment for data
processing; and some of the staff will have to be retrained. On the other hand, some of the staff will
become redundant due to the streamlining of operations. The project will also improve the quality and
reliability of social statistics, which in turn will help the Government to conduct more, targeted social
policy.

Annex 2
Project Description
PART A: Institutional Strengthening of Goskomstat
Project Component 1 - Improvement of Organization, Management Strategy, and Perspective
Planning - US$2.0 million
This component will ensure and foster institutional capacity that is conducive to the dialogue and
awareness necessary for the formulation, coordination and implementation of the statistical policy and
programs geared to the needs of a market economy as well as better economic management. Expected
outputs will be finalized legal arrangements, effective machinery for inter-agency coordination,
formalized public relations with the users of statistics, restructured and streamlined federal and regional
statistical offices, and improved sustainable management outlook and skills. This consists of three sub
components: i) restructuring and strengthening of the SSS; ii) enhancement of management skills; and
iii) capacity building for human resource management.
Project Component 2 - Fostering Knowledge of Standards and Methodology - US$2.17 million
Successful restructuring of the SSS depends on the professional ability of staff and the possibility of
enhancing technical skills. The current staff members need to be trained on new standards and
methodology. The training objective is to engender an understanding of the general concepts and
methodology of economic, social, demographic and environmental statistics according to an international
model. This includes not only the general conduct of surveys, but also specialized methodology such as
sample surveys and the preparation of derived analytical statistics, including the SNA and index numbers.
The required body of methodology, based on proven international experience, involves compliance with
classification and other standards issued by international authorities which guarantee the soundness of the
proposed statistics, as well as facilitating their international comparability. The output of this project
component extends not only to the acquisition of new technical competencies, but also to wider skills
associated with effective relations with users and suppliers of statistics. This component consists of three
sub components: i) training in international methodology for official statistical surveys; ii) training in
statistical software and iii) other objects and specialist training.
The training will be conducted mainly with on and off-site training, but such training must normally be
supplemented by the tuition of controlling staff who have been trained previously on relevant skills. Some
training measures extend to these stakeholders.
Project Component 3 - Strengthening of Statistical Infrastructure - US$3.0 million
Every effective national statistical system in a modern state needs a basic range of facilities and
competencies, both tangible and intangible. A lack of infrastructure will compromise the system's
capability of achieving its objectives. The SSS of RF is handicapped by not possessing, in terms of
accepted international criteria, the desirable full infrastructure. This component provides necessary
infrastructure items for strengthening, except for the computer processing equipment (hardware) which is
treated under the project component 4. However, statistical applications software is included in this
component. Infrastructure items are grouped under six subheadings. The lack of statistical legislation is a
major infrastructure lack, but this item is discussed under component 1. Legislation, which confers a



Annex 2
Page 2 of 4
legal basis to the existence of the SSS, specifies an objective that serves, functions and provides
protection for the professional integrity of Goskomstat determines relations with suppliers of data
collected in surveys and right of access to statistics etc., is seriously needed. The lack of legislation on
statistics, thereof, detrimental to the development of full public acceptability and credibility of
Goskomstat as a neutral authoritative information source for public political purposes, and other accepted
roles of an official statistical system. This component comprises five sub components: i) legislation of
stakeholder relationship; ii) managerial and planning facilities; iii) survey design and operational
facilities; iv) general household survey facility and v) standard classifications unit.
Project Component 4 - Reorganization of Data Collection, Processing and Dissemination -
US$15.25 million
Goskomstat inherited a commitment to a scheme of enterprise surveys that linked this to individual
enterprises administrative reporting to controlling ministries under the former central planning system.
This reporting had to be on a full-coverage basis. However full reliance on census-type surveys is no
longer necessary and Goskomstat has made some progress with the replacement of enterprise censuses
with sample surveys. A legal requirement has also forced the use of sampling for surveys of "small"
enterprises. Acquiring the full expertise to design and conduct sample surveys up to international
standard is a lengthy and technically demanding exercise. Pressure on Goskomstat's resources makes it
imperative that a more concerted and coordinated effort be now made to implement a mixed scheme of
censuses and sample surveys for economic and business statistics, with sample surveys employed to the
maximum extent consistent with statistical requirements. This is a feature of the work of all national
statistical systems in developed countries with a market economy. The first essential element in the
survey plan for Goskomstat is for each group of enterprises producing goods and services for which a
production account is prepared in SNA statistics, (defined in terms of the standard industry classification)
is to conduct a periodic annual census probably three-yearly for most groups. However, five-yearly
censuses for groups producing most services, particularly services provided to households, including
those operating on a non-profit basis, are sufficient. At a later stage, when the economic transition is
completed, all enterprises can be fully surveyed five-yearly. A review is needed to identify which
patterns of regular annual, quarterly and monthly statistics are justified, and there is no doubt from the
international perspective that many monthly statistics, including monthly GDP, are unnecessary and are
only prepared because of customary reasons, in spite of user claims. Intervening annual, quarterly and
monthly sample surveys should be implemented to provide the minimum range of statistics needed, and it
should be determined that major cutbacks in survey budgets are necessary. Training of all staff involved
in this survey reorganization has been provided for in component 2. Progress has been made with the
introduction of sample surveys, but the process needs revamping, with more concerted management
measures, extra sample design specialist resources provided and properly organized, and standardization
of samnple survey implementation procedures across all regions. In addition, sample surveys require
improved response rates and a higher level of classification and editing of collected data to reduce non-
sampling errors below the equivalent census level. This component comprises of ten sub components: i)
development of a systematic plan to complete the process of replacing regular economic/business
censuses with sample surveys for all statistics; ii) expand and reorganize specialist sample survey design
work; iii) presentation of sample survey statistics with specification of sample error possibilities in key
estimates; iv) periodic benchmark censuses of economic activity must be conducted to a high statistical
standard; v) social sample surveys do not need reorganization, but updating techniques for last-stage real
sampling units for new households need to be reviewed and improved if necessary; vi) improvement in
data collection methods; vii) questionnaire design review; viii) computer facilities for survey processing;
statistical applications software and ix) reorganization and modernization of data dissemination.

PART B: Institutional Strengthening and TA to Data Collecting Agencies
Project Component 5 - Improvement of Government Finance Statistics and Compilation of the
"General Government Sector" Accounts in the SNA - US$0.6 million
This component would ensure that government finance statistics are developed to meet the needs of fiscal
management and policy as well as of macro-economic statistics and analysis. The Russian Government's
structure consists of federal, regional, city and district municipal administrations, which need to be sub-
sectored in accordance with the IMF and SNA standards, and their accounts need to the analyzed on a
regular basis. The MOF has introduced IMF's standards on economic and functional analysis of the
federal government's accounts and is sharing their experience and results of the data with Goskomstat
and other users. Their publication could contribute to the filling of data gaps in the compilation of the
SNA's sequence of accounts for the General Government sector and would educate the users on the data
underlying budgetary decisions. Moreover, there is an urgent need for rationalizing institutional
arrangements, particularly an appropriate link between MOF and MOE in respect to projected data used
in government debt information and streamlining the classification, compilation, analysis and
dissemination of data. The Central Bank is not involved enough in debt management despite the
influence of foreign debt flows on monetary policy and the efficiency gains obtainable from linking debt
and reserve management.
Project Component 6 - Introduction and Compilation of Financial Statistics - US$0.35 million
This component of the project is aimed at creating institutional environment, strategy, infrastructure,
methodology and procedures for enhancing the coverage of basic financial statistics beyond money and
banking statistics. The availability of basic data on the remaining financial intermediaries and on
financial auxiliaries classified by financial assets and instruments. Economic sectors and sub sectors
would promote a compilation of comprehensive financial surveys required by the CB, the sequence of
accounts for financial institutions for the 1993 SNA by the Goskomstat, and the flow of funds analysis
targeted by the Russian BEA under the World Bank Loan. The compilation of these data should
strengthen financial analysis, monetary policy, promotion and monitoring of capital markets, macro-
economic analysis etc., and economic and financial management suitable for a market economy.
Project Component 7 - Improvement of Coverage and Quality of BOP Statistics - US$1.6 million
This component will ensure that the coverage and quality of BOP statistics would improve and contribute
to the formulation and implementation of sound monetary and exchange rate policies, the management of
international reserves, the monitoring of capital flows, and simultaneously serve the needs of international
investors, banks and lenders for BOP data. The component could target certain major activities that
would improve overall BOP compilation. This strategy will also resolve certain internal inconsistencies,
arising from major data gaps, particularly in informal trade data. The allocation of responsibilities for
BOP data collection and compilation and overall coordination among agencies would be reviewed and
restructured to harmonize and strengthen concepts, methodologies, data collection, calculations, and
coordination.



Annex 2

Project Component 8 - Improvement of the Capabilities of the Government in Utilization of
Statistical Information Used for Economic Monitoring, Forecasting and Policy-Making - US$1.0
million
The project will help the Government to implement the Law on Forecasting where the MOE is required to
provide timely and comprehensive forecasts of economic developments of the RF to the Government for
policy implementation.
This component is aimed to increase the capability of the MOE to perform timely and reliable short and
medium term economic forecasts to receive information needed for the estimates on line, as well as,
provide the interested agencies with the results through a computerized network.
Project Component 9 - Improvement of Vital Statistics Processing - US$1.5 million
Goskomstat is planning to process electronically all data on birth and death, marriages and divorces
generated by local statistical agencies. Due to the lack of computer facilities and licensed software, the
Registry Office (ZAGS) is not able to input initial data. In order to accomplish this data processing
successfully, the Registry Office has to be strengthened.
PART C: Project Management
Project Component 10 - Establishment of a Directorate under the BEA on the "Support for the
Development of the SSS" for the Program Management - US$2.152 million
An efficient mechanism has to be developed for effective management of the loan implementation which
in itself is a massive investment into the SSS and other government agencies. Creation of a Directorate
under BEA on the "Support for the Development of the SSS of the RF" will be such a vehicle. It will
handle not only this project, but also other related projects on the basis of grants and other possible loans.

Cost Effectiveness Analyses Summary
Insufficient Funding and Statistical System Inefficiency
The period of transition was marked by a dramatic decrease in the funding for statistical services, both in
relative and real terms. Year after year the funds earmarked for statistical programs were not disbursed as
planned, the capital expenditures being the most jeopardized item: in four years (1994-1997) the actual
outlays accounted for only 46% of the planned (just 11% in 1996). The share of Goskomstat (including
its educational institutions) in total Federal Budget actual expenditures only from 1995 to 1997 dropped
by about 30% - from 0.16% to 0.11%.

In real terms (estimated by deflating the actual expenditures with the GDP deflator) the contraction
between 1997 and 1994 amounted to 60%, with the outlays for Headquarters (including educational and
research institutions) declined by more than 75%.



Annex 4
Page 2 of 2
As the result the Headquarters share of total expenditures decreased from 30% in 1994 to just about 18%
in 1997. At the same time the efforts of renovating the statistical system is carried out basically by
Headquarters, and the dwindling funds (partially because of the need to support the regional offices)
hinder the progress of restructuring the statistical system.
The same refers to insufficiency of funds for capital expenditures, particularly for computerization and
introduction of modem information technologies: ad hoc purchases of hard- and software whenever funds
are available lead to piecemeal improvements, which are more often than not incoherent, resulting in
waste of resources. Insufficient funding does not allow implementing a comprehensive modernization
program, which would considerably increase both productivity of the Goskomstat staff and the quality of
data produced.
Benefits of the Implementation of a Comprehensive Modernization Project of the SSS of the RF
In order to evaluate project's impact to the growth of the economy, two types of estimates have to be
performed: a) the long term cost effectiveness of the streamlining of the statistical work and gains in
reduction of labor intensive statistical operations; b) impact of reliable data on policy decisions. Both
evaluation methods are highly speculative and have to rely on numerous assumptions.
However, other countries experience in the field indicates that there are factor-productivity and long-term
cost-efficiency gains from streamlining statistical work, re-aligning Headquarters vs. Regional offices
relationships, as well as security gains in reduction of labor-intensive statistical operations.
Although it is not likely that the project would increase employment in the state statistical system, which
is anyway overstaffed as a total, it aims to considerably redistribute the number of employees working at
the headquarters and at the regional offices in comparison with the current situation. Certain functions
may become redundant due to streamlining of the operations and eliminating of the high cost-low value
exercises. At the same time the changing labor content will allow to attract more competent and qualified
specialists to make the positive changes more sustainable.
It is difficult to quantify net social-welfare gains from a higher productivity of Goskomstat staff and from
social data quality improvement, but there is evidence that it will be reasonable to expect, with other
things equal, better informed and timely policy decisions in social sphere and more focused social policy.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
A. Procurement
Summary of Procurement Procedure
The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table A. Procurement of works, goods and
services would be procured in accordance with the Bank procurement guidelines. A procurement plan
detailing the packaging and estimated schedule of the major procurement actions is presented in Table B.
All other procurement information, including capability of the implementing agency, estimated dates for
publication of General Procurement Notice and the Bank's review process is presented in Table C.
Procurement of Goods and Works
Goods and works will be procured in accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Loans published by the Bank in January 1995, and revised in January and
August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999. For Bank financed procurement, the appropriate
Standard and Sample Bidding Documents issued by the Bank will be used with minimum changes
acceptable to the Bank. For procurement under ICB, domestic suppliers and contractors will be given a
margin of preference in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines.
PROCUREMENT OF WORKS (US$0.38 MILLION). There are a total of 4 contracts consisting of: i)
repairing the PIU office; ii) turning a room into a training facility; and iii) installing adequate electrical
components to house a number of computers and printers.
NATIONAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING (NCB). NCB procedures will be applied for works contract
estimated to cost below US$200,000, up to an aggregate not to exceed US$384,000 will be procured
under this method.
PROCUREMENT OF GOODS (US$26 MILLION). There are about 13 packages consisting of computer
hardware and software, printers, copiers and scanners under procurement of goods, which will combined
into a large package to attract competitive national and international firms. The following methods of
procurement will be used:
*  INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING (ICB). ICB procedures will be applied for goods contracts
estimated to cost above US$200,000. Approximately US$25.8 million will be procured under this
method.
*  INTERNATIONAL SHOPPING (IS). Contracts for supplies readily available off-the shelf or equipment
of standard specification up to an aggregate not to exceed US$170,000 may be procured under IS
procedures by obtaining competitive price quotations in sealed envelopes from at least three suppliers
in two different countries.



Annex 6
Page 3 of 27
* NATIONAL SHOPPING (NS). Contracts for supplies readily available off-the shelf or equipment of
standard specification estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate not to exceed
US$ 100,000 may be procured under NS procedures by obtaining competitive price quotations in
sealed envelopes from at least three suppliers.
PROCUREMENT OF SERVICES (us$9.5 MILLION). Contracts for consultants' services will be awarded in
accordance with the provisions of the Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers published by the Bank in January 1997, and revised in September 1997 and
January 1999. The services financed under the loan are for improvement of the organizational structure
of the Statistical System, and enhancement of data collection, processing, sharing, storing, and
dissemination system bidding document preparation, project implementation and works supervision,
technical assistance, hands on training, study tours and fellowships abroad, etc. Selection of Consultants
and institutions and their contracts will be based on the Standard Request for Proposal issued by the
Bank.
*    SELECTION OF FIRMS: Since the jobs for the consultancies to support improvement in the
statistical services are specialized in nature, the following methods will be used: i) Quality
and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) (US$2.4 million); ii)Least Cost Selection (LCS) (US$1.9
million); iii) Selection Based on Consultant Qualifications (SBCQ) (US$0.3 million); and
iv) Selection under Fixed Budget (SFB) (US$4.7 million).
*    SELECTION OF INDIVIDUALS (Us$0.26 MILLION): Individual consultants for procurement
of IT and other components will be selected on the basis of their qualifications for the
assignment by comparing at least three CVs from potential candidates.
INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS (us$2.1 MILLION). The Operating costs of the PIU is to cover the
following: i) consultant fees; ii) office maintenance; iii) travel; and iv) other expenses. Besides the
administrative staff, it is also envisioned to have: i) 5 consultants responsible for all nine components of
the project; ii) a specialized Information Technology consultant, whose main responsibility is to prepare
the technical specifications for a large contract for the procurement of computer and related software
under ICB, as mentioned above; and iii) a Procurement consultant, whose main responsibility will be to
assist the PIU in the procurement of Goods and Services etc
B. Disbursement
The proposed loan would be disbursed over 4 years with effectiveness planned for the end of 1999. The
loan closing date would be June 2004. The allocation of loan proceeds is provided in Annex 3. The loan
will be disbursed against the categories indicated in Table D (of this Annex).
Use of statements of expenses:
Disbursements based on Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) will be used for: i) consulting firms below
$50,000 equivalent (including studies); ii) individual consultants below $20,000 equivalent (including
studies); and iii) conferences, workshops and seminars. All supporting documentation, including
contracts, procurement information, and evidence of payment will be kept at the PIU for review by the
Bank and independent auditors.



Annex 6
Page 4 of 27
Special Account
In order to help the Government overcome cash flow problems, as well as to speed up the necessary
project disbursements, the PIU will establish, within three months of effectiveness, maintain and operate,
under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in US dollars in a commercial bank. The
Borrower is required to disclose a summary of Special Account activities in the annual financial
statements.
C. Review of Project Financial Management Systems
1. Background
The current best estimate for effectiveness is the end of 1999. The project is to enhance the statistical
system of the RF. Financing will be through the Sectoral Investment Loan (SIL). The project is
scheduled for 1999-2003 and will require IBRD funding of $30m and counterpart funding of $8.5m.
Project Objectives
The objectives of the project are to strengthen Goskomstat and related data collecting agencies through a
combination of technical assistance, the introduction of information technologies, and the procurement of
hardware and software. The sub-components in the program are as follows:
*  improvement of organization, management, strategy and perspective planning;
=  fostering knowledge of standards and methodology;
*  strengthening statistical infrastructure including improvement of business and other registers;
*  reorganization of data collection, processing and dissemination methods, including the systematic
introduction of sample surveys;
- improvement of government finance statistics;
*  development of financial statistics in the area of non-banking financial statistics;
*  improvement of data for balance of payments;
* improvement of the capabilities of the Government in utilization of statistical information for
economic forecasting and policy;
*  improvement in processing of vital statistics.
Implementing Agency, and Relationship with Participating Agencies
Project Implementation Unit - The Government of the RF decided to appoint the BEA as the PIU. The
BEA is currently managing the Goskomstat component in the BEA loan. Using the BEA offers some
advantages in its experience of implementing previous projects financed by the Bank. Nevertheless there
are significant internal control implications which are outlined below. The BEA will carry out the
following activities:-



Annex 6
Page 5 of 27
*  coordination and support to the Goskomstat;
*  administration, accounting and financial management;
*  procurement, coordination and supervision - it should be noted that the BEA presently sub-contracts
its procurement activities but has been building up capacity and in addition PIU will be assisted by
experienced procurement consultants. For procurement contracts such as ICB of computers it may
still use procurement consultants;
* reporting in accordance with Bank requirements.
It is planned to hire necessary staff within the BEA as result of this Project. The Financial Management
Review discusses the capacity requirements of the finance and administration of the Project below.
Other agencies involved in the implementation are Goskomstat, MOF, MOE, CB and State Customs
Committee. The critical issue is the relationship between the BEA which will provide management and
administrative capacity and Goskomstat, which will provide the majority of intellectual capacity. The
issue of project governance will have to be solved before effectiveness. There might be some amendment
to the Board of Trustees, including a member of Goskomstat on the Board.
Sources of Project Financing, Including Funds Flow Paths and Timing of Flows; Direct Financing
or Reimbursements.
*  Sources of project financing are the IBRD loan ($30m) and Government of Russia ($8.5m).
*  The majority of Bank finance can be anticipated to be through the Special Account, with direct
disbursement only for major international procurement of computers and other equipment. The most
likely scenario is that the project will utilize traditional disbursement methods for the foreseeable
future but will ensure that the accounting systems are adequate to deal with full Project Management
Reporting in the future.
Cost Sharing Arrangements Including Percentages by Category of Expenditures.
The following categories are to be financed by the Bank:
Category               Amount (US$)        % of Expenditures to be Financed
Consultants' services, including training  8,628,000  100%
Goods                                    18,910,000  100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory costs), and 80% of
expenditures for other items procured locally.
Works                                      384,000  100%
Incremental Operating Costs               1,700,000  100% until the aggregate amount disbursed from
this Category is equal to $950,000;
85% until the aggregate amount disbursed from
this Category is equal to $1,400,000; and
45% until the aggregate amount disbursed from
this Category is equal to $1,700,000

Annex 6
Page 6 of 27
Laws, Rules and Regulations that May Affect the Project.
Tax Law - requires VAT to be charged by suppliers to the Project, with reimbursement of the counterpart
funds by the MOF. It is important that all counterpart funds are captured in the accounting system and
fully reflected in the financial statements.
Chamber of Accounting - The Chamber takes a close professional interest in adherence of the Project to
signed loan agreements.
MOF - Because of the present financial crisis in Russia the MOF has restricted those commercial banks
in which PIU can maintain Special Accounts to Sberbank, Vneshtorgbank and Vnesheconombank.
2. The Financial Management System
Risk Assessment
Country risks - the overall environment for internal controls such as support for an accountability culture
at a high level of government; salary structure within the public sector as compared to the private sector;
degree of independence from politics; and the status of the accounting profession in the country.
The Chamber of Accounts reports to the DUMA. This body is responsible for auditing government
entities and, as mentioned above takes a keen interest in IBRD projects. Previous Chamber of Accounts
audits have sought to demonstrate corruption and misuse of funds on Projects financed by the Bank in
Russia.
The salary structure for accountants employed in the private sector is higher than that of the public sector.
The current banking and financial crisis in Russia is causing considerable operational difficulties in
managing the Special Accounts in projects.
The status of accounting and auditing has been enhanced over the last few years although the traditional
view of the accountant as a bookkeeper still prevails in many organizations and the public sector. The
accountancy profession is in its infancy with many bodies and Chambers being formed seeking to create
influence or protectionism. The most likely to succeed is the Institute of Professional Accountants,
founded in 1997 with the support of the MOF. Financial reporting is still heavily influenced by tax
treatment, although the Government claims to be committed to the development of accounting principles
in accordance with International Accounting Standards.
Organizational risks - presence of honest and capable employees usually influenced by compensation,
education, and experience levels; clear delegation and segregation of duties (may be offset by exercise of
executive override and/or collusion); clear written standards and procedures; clear responsibilities
including levels of authority; clear control over assets; cash and bank accounts; easily available access top
supporting documentation; and timely and accurate financial reporting.
Two principle concerns regarding the controls surrounding this project have been identified:-
1. The expansion of the BEA as result of taking on this project. The Bureau has no formal operating
manual although, the administrative staff demonstrates a clear understanding of the control risks (i.e.
those key risks resulting in fraud or misappropriation of funds from the purpose intended) and procedures
required in order to keep these risks to a minimum.



Annex 6
Page 7 of 27
The following are the key control risks which will be addressed in the operating manual:-
* procurement of individual consultants and consulting firms, and large information
technology;
*  controls over the payment of consultant contracts against deliverables;
*  physical control over assets over the course of the life of the project.
*  allocation ofjoint costs between the project and its associated activities.
The Borrower will produce a revised Operating Manual prior to the effectiveness date.
2. The lack of effective overall governance procedures for the project (discussed above).
Given the issues raised above a Coordinating Committee will be to appointed to oversee the activities of
the Project on a quarterly basis over its life.
Project Accounting Systems and Procedures
General
Because of the early stage of the Project, the present systems of the BEA and their overall adequacy if
they were to be adopted for this Project have to be discussed. The essential elements of the system are:-
* budgeting and project planning
-  internal control procedures
-  accounting software requirements
-  financial and management accounting systems
Budgeting and Project Planning
Tracking of actual to budgeted expenditures will be required to control expenditures. Revisions of
budgets will be required on a regular basis on the advise of the project managers. Monitoring and
evaluation of budgets will be under the overall supervision of the Financial Director and reported to the
Coordinating Committee on a quarterly basis. The textual and management accounts (approved by the
Coordinating Committee) will be provided to the Bank on a quarterly basis.
The accounting system will be capable of producing several different reports, including:
* quarterly PMR in accordance with Bank requirements,



Annex 6
Page 8 of 27
* annual financial statements prepared in accordance with Bank requirements,
* reports in accordance with MOF requirements,
* other ad-hoc reports to meet internal users requirements.
Internal Control Procedures
Internal control procedures are being developed for the Project, and will be documented in the
Operational Manual. The following procedures which are adopted on the BEA's existing Bank projects
and which are intended to be extended to this Project:
*  All technical work is under the supervision of the Director General or the Project Managers.
*  Procedures are in place for the signing of contacts based on their size and complexity. These are
presently undocumented and will be recorded in the Operating Manual.
*  The function of approving payments and physical payment of consultants appear to provide strong
segregation of duties, but are undocumented and
*  The BEA has contracted out large procurement work to an agency, however, the Loan Agreement
provides for the recruitment of a procurement specialist prior to the data of effectiveness. The BEA
has also developed a system to control contract activity from procurement to disbursement.
The Financial Director will have overall financial reporting responsibility for the Project. Due to the
present work load of the BEA, the Loan Agreement provides further recruitment of the Chief Accountant
prior to the data of effectiveness.
With the number of staff and the present skill base of the BEA adequate segregation of duties will be
possible. The key control risks are outlined above and building adequate control mechanisms will be well
within the skill base of the Financial Director. These should be documented in the Operating Manual.
Accounting Software Requirements
The Chart of Account used on previous BEA projects and also financial reports for the BEA have been
reviewed. In order for the Project to prepared PMR's on a quarterly basis further investigation into the
capabilities of the Inatech system (currently in use by the BEA) is required. In particular the following
key issues need to be addressed:-
*  the production of quarterly PMR's acceptable to the Bank;
* the ability of the software to deal with multi-currencies.
Additional training and support will be given to the PIU in developing adequate accounting software.



Annex 6
Page 9 of 27
Financial and Management Accounting Requirements
Judging the format and structure of the BEA's own financial statements the Bureau has a good
understanding of the Bank's requirements outlined in the Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing
Handbook (FARAH). The requirement to produce quarterly management accounts will be introduced in
this project and will be linked into the management reports produced for the Coordinating Committee and
the Task Team at the Bank.
Audit Arrangements
The Bank has a list of approved auditors, who are available for both revenue and non-revenue earning
projects. We will ensure that the tender for auditors is completed as a condition of effectiveness.
3. Summary and Conclusions
The BEA has strong credentials to be able to run the Project effectively and a Coordinating Committee is
being appointed to improve overall governance. The key elements of a sound financial system are in
place, however, the following actions are required prior to effectiveness:-
a. Preparation of an Operating Manual which will cover the following aspects of the project:-
* governance procedures
* organizational chart
* detailed job descriptions of all management and administrative staff
* internal control procedures - identifying critical risks and control in place to reduce these
risks to a minimum
* accounting system and chart of account
* banking and cash procedures
* reporting requirements and formats - both textual and numerical.
b. The recruitment of an experienced Chief Accountant with exposure to international accounting
practices.
c. Further development of the accounting systems to produce timely and efficient information in line
with the Bank's requirements.

Sample Terms of Reference for Consultants on the Modification of the Institutional
Structure of Goskomstat at the National and Regional Levels
1. Background
The Russian Government has requested a loan from the World Bank for the development of the SSS to
support: the modification of data collection methods, improvement of the management of the SSS at the
federal and regional levels, improvement of the data processing, sharing and storing means and methods,
and the increase of the capacity of the SSS to supply the Government, business community and general
public with timely and reliable statistics for economic and social policy and business decisions.
The World Bank agreed to accommodate this request and extended a loan for the development of the SSS.
The project envisions assistance in the following areas: Improvement of organization, management
strategy and perspective planning of the S55; Fostering knowledge of standards and methodology;
Strengthening of statistical infrastructure; Reorganization of data collection, processing and
dissemination; Improvement of govemnment finance statistics and the compilation of the "general
govemnment sector" accounts in the SNA; Introduction and compilation of financial statistics;
Improvement of coverage and quality of BOP statistics; Improvement of capabilities of the' government in
statistics used for economic monitoring, forecasting and policy making; and Improvement of vital
statistics processing;
During the implementation the PIU requires services of short-term consultants in the drafting of a plan for
the modification of the institutional structure and management techniques at the national and regional
levels.
2. Description of the Problem
Historically, data in countries with centrally planned economies were collected through complete
enumeration rather then using sample surveys. Goskomstat is gradually moving into the direction of
wider introduction of sample surveys. It has introduced and has been bringing into statistical practice
many new previously not used indicators needed for economic policy and business decisions of a market
economy. Changes in the data collection and introduction of new macroeconomic and social statistics
require modifications in organizational structure of the SSS to reflect new processes.
3. General Objective
The general objective is to improve the institutional and management capacity of the Goskomstat at the
federal and regional levels.
4. Specific Objective
The specific objective is to provide professional assistance and support to Goskomstat in developing a
plan for the restructuring of the SSS at the regional and federal levels. There is a need to establish several
regional centers for the compilation of regional information and transfer it to the headquarters. In order
draft a plan to introduce the management techniques adequate to the new organizational structure it is
required to work out proposals for training for high and mid-level managers at federal and regional levels.

linkages between different levels in the hierarchy, and connections between Goskomstat and other data
collection agencies.
2. To draft a plan for the restructuring at the federal and regional levels of Goskomstat, with possible
establishment of several interregional centers for data processing.
3. To draft a plan for the introduction of new management techniques, and training of high and mid-level

federal and regional levels, improvement of the data processing, sharing and storing means and methods;
and increase the capacity to supply the Government, business community and general public with timely

Dear NMr. Carter,
As an important part of the public sector, the State Statstical System of the
Russian Federadon aims to contibute to the improvement of economic and social
conditions of the country by collecting, processing, storing, sharing and disseminating
high quality, reliable and timely data used by the Government for policy making and
enhancement of the economic management.
"I -le cang es 6f tl;e Russian economy and society have wimessed over the
las1 several years have posed major'cliallenges in data collection and compilation
issues for the statistical system of the country. Inorder to meet these challenges the
Government of Russia has embarked extensive changes in the statistcal system.
However, the full restuctunring of the State Statistical System requires substantial
financial resources, which the Russian Government lacks, aithough it expressed siuch
needs to the World Bank Eventually, the preparation of the STASYS project is now
underway.
The Government of the Russian Federation understands that f1l restrucruring
of the system recuires some time and extensive resources, and hence views the
development of the State Statistical System as a long term program beginning in 1999
and continuing through 2011 and beyond. The Government is committed to
implement this program in three phases with financiar support from the World Bank
through the Bank's "Adaptable Program Loan" instument. The World Bank financing
for the entire program is US$ 145 million. Phase I of this STASYS project runs from
1999-2003 and focuses on "initiation of restructuriag effort". Phase E begins in 2004
and extends until 2007. This phase will focus on "growth of the institutions and
human capacity strengthening process". Phase m begins in 2008 and terminates in
2011. The final phase focuses on "institutionalization of a Modem State Statistical
System".
The program development objective which represents a culmination of the
proposed propanm results from these three phases is to restructure, stengthen and

institutionaaize a modem State Statistcal System that is responsive to the economic
management and market economy needs of the Russian Federation.
The program addresses the following issues at the initial phase:
1. Fostering knowledge of standards and meithodology
2. Strengthening of statistical inftastructure
3. Reorganization of data collection, processing and dissemination
4. Improvement of government finance statistics and the compilation
of the "general Government sector' accounts in the System of
National Accounts
5. Introduction and compilation of fiacial statistics
6. Improvement of coverage and quality of Balance ofPayments

7. Improvement of capabilities of the govenment in statistics used for
economic monitormig forecastincg and policy making
8. Improvement of vital statistcs processing
9. Improvement of organtion, management strategy and perspective
planning of the statistical system
10. Program management by the Directorate on the "Support of the
Development of the State Statistical System't
The first initiation phase of the Program, proposed by the STASYS project is
the -most important integal part of the Proram due to the fact that the continuity of
the Program will be decendent on its successes. It is prepared as a USS 38,75 million
investnent operation with the World Bank financing 77,42% of it At this phase, most
of the necessary swuctural and infrastructure changes wil occur and will strengthen
further by the following phases.

Program for the Development of the SSS
1. Purpose and Program Phasing
The RF views the development of the SSS as a long term program, beginning in 1999 and continuing
through 2011 and beyond. The Government is planning to implement the program in three phases. The
program development objective, which represents a culmination of the proposed program results from
these three phases, is to restructure, strengthen and institutionalize a modem SSS that is responsive to the
economic management and market economy needs of the RF.
The program consists of the following three phases:
Phase I runs from 1999-2003 and focuses on the "initiation of the restructuring effort". Phase II begins
in 2004 and extends until 2007. This phase will focus on the "growth of the institutions and the human
capacity strengthening process". Phase III begins in 2008 and terminates in 2011. The final phase
focuses on the "institutionalization of a modern SSS". Figure 1 shows the program objective and
phasing.
