INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION
PROPOSED RURAL ROADS FOR
COTABATO AND SULTAN KUDARAT
I.   Introduction
1.          This is a component of APL-1 that is one of four Adaptable Program
Loans (APL) of the Mindanao Rural Development Program. An Initial
Environmental Examination (IEE) was conducted to assess whether there are
environmental issues that need to be resolved or if there are significant
environmental impacts that need to be mitigated. The proposed roads are located in
several municipalities in Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat.
2.          In preparing the IEE, sites investigation and discussions with local
officials and staff of MRDP were conducted on December 9 to 14, 1998.
1I.   Description of the Project
3.          Included are 30 rural road rehabilitation projects, 16 of which are
located in Cotabato and 14 in Sultan Kudarat with total lengths of 18 kilometers
and 69 kilometers respectively. In addition there will be 7 bridges constructed in
Cotabato and seven in Sultan Kudarat with total lengths of 158 lineal meters and
122 lineal meters respectively.
4.          The topography of the areas traversed by the different rural roads to
be rehabilitated varies. Some are located in very flat areas and some are in hilly and
mountainous areas.
5.          The vegetation along the roads ranges from crops such as rice and
corn to fruit trees, rubber trees, etc.
6.          The geometric and design specifications to be followed are:
4.00 meters wide graveled carriage-way with 1.00 shoulder width and drainage
ditches on both sides; 15 centimeters base course of item 201 on top of 10
centimeters sub-base course of item 200.
The average excavation and embankment is estimated at 0.3 meter.
IEE for Roads, Page I of 4



7.          Most of the roads to be rehabilitated are in very poor conditions.
Many of them have very deep mud-holes and gullies.
8.          The construction activities will include the following:
a.          Cut and fill operations.
b.          Excavation of ditches.
c.          Laying of cross drains.
d.          Construction of box culverts where necessarv.
e.          Construction of bridges.
f.          Transporting and laying the sub-base and base course.
-II.   Screening of Possible Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures
9.          The environmental impacts of the project may be grouped into three
namely impact as a result of the design adopted; impact resulting from the
construction activities; and impact resulting from the road usage.
10.         Impacts resulting from the design aspects include those arising due to
the road alignment and those due to the road elevation. The road alignment will
determine whether there will be encroachment into precious ecology, into historical
and cultural values, into forests, into agricultural lands, or into residential areas.
Since the project is rehabilitation of existing rural roads, if there is any
encroachment, this has already been done before. Based on the actual visits and
from discussions with local officials, the roads do not encroach on any of the above.
For those roads that will require some expansion in width, it is very unlikely that
there will be any encroachment since the roads have already sufficient right of way
and which are already cleared. Thus the impact of the project arising from the road
alignments is deemed insignificant.
11.         The impact arising from the road elevation would be the possibility of
flooding as a result of changes in runoff flow regimes. Where the roads crosses
creeks and other waterways, flooding will occur if the necessary drainage facilities
are not put in place. The present state of the roads indicates that this will be a
significant impact. The design criteria adopted took this into consideration such that
cross-drains; box culverts, bridges and side ditches will be constructed. If the
drainage systems will be sized properly, the impact will be reduced to acceptable
levels.
12.         The impacts arising from the construction activities will include:
IEE for Roads, Page 2 of 4



a.           In cases where there will be side cuts on hills or mountains to expand
the road, there will be possible landslides. Landslides may also occur when the
present roadway is excavated specially when one or both sides have steep slopes.
This impact could be significant in mountainous towns such as Antipas in Cotabato.
It could be avoided by careful planning of the work and installing shoring if
necessary.
b.           The material transport and soil handling activities such as the cut and
fill operations loosen soil. This intensifies erosion. Considering that the projects will
involve a lot of soil handling activities, this will be a significant impact. This impact
could be lessened if the activities are done during none rainy days. However, since
rainfall in the project area is evenly distributed, this option may not be very
effective. Careful planning of the activities and proper storage of spoils will also
lessen the impact.
Soil handling activities also intensifies dust problems. Whereas soil erosion is the
problem during rainy days, dust problems will be the problem during non-rainy
days. Considering that rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, this is
partly mitigated. However, during dry spells, this problem is reduced if water is
sprayed on the ground and the loose soil. This negative impact could be very
significant but it is also temporary and lasts only for the duration of the
construction period.
C.           Excess soil or spoils in the construction will have to be disposed of.
Improper disposal will result to dust and erosion and consequently siltation
problems in waterways. The magnitude of the problem will be dependent on the
method of disposal. Excess soil should be collected as soon as possible and brought
to the disposal site. To lessen erosion at the disposal site, grasses may be planted on
the mound of soil.
d.           Sometimes contractors build temporary quarters for their laborers
during the construction period. If they fail to provide adequate sanitary facilities,
this could lead to health problems that will not only affect the workers themselves
but also people living nearby. Considering that the road lengths are short, and since
it is expected that the laborers will be local residents, it is unlikely that the laborers
will stay in construction camps. They are expected to stay in their own homes. This
impact is therefore considered insignificant. However, in the event that construction
camps are erected, the contractor will be required to provide adequate sanitary
facilities to lessen the problem.
e.           There are times when there are negative impacts arising from the
construction stage but which are not the results of the construction activities but
rather on the failure to monitor the construction activities. This leads to defects in
the construction that may lessen the life or the effectiveness of the road. Early
deterioration of the road could lead to several problems such as landslides, erosion,
and consequently siltation of water bodies, traffic hazards, etc. This impact could be

very significant but this is avoided by making a good monitoring program and
having good people to do the monitoring.
13.         Impacts During the Operation of the Project will include the
following:
a.          Impacts as a result of vehicle passage include dust problems and
traffic hazards. During dry spells, the dust problem is significant but is reduced by
spraying water on the road or enforcing speed limits. Those affected will be
travelers and those living along the road.
The possibility of people being hit by vehicles passing through is a hazard.
Pedestrians and people living nearby will be subjected to this hazard. Considering
the volume of traffic and the fact that vehicles will not be able to move fast in a
gravel road, this hazard could be considered insignificant.
14.         Failure to have proper post construction monitoring will deprive us of
the opportunity to identify errors committed in the design as well as in the
construction. This causes errors to be repeated in future projects. Thus, it is not
only proper to have a good construction monitoring program but also a post
construction-monitoring program.
IV. Recommendations
15.        The IEE of the roads visited by the consultant is presented in the
Appendix from pages A-1 to A-20. The impacts are mostly not significant except
during the construction stage. However, impacts during the construction stage are
temporary in nature so that they will not have any lasting impact. It is suggested
that there is no need to undertake further environmental assessment. However, it is
necessary that the mitigating measures recommended be implemented specially the
provision of a good drainage system and the formulation of a good construction
monitoring program as well a post-construction monitoring program.
