REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on Bank loans
totaling the equivalent of U,$10.5 million to the Republic of Botswana to
help finance an education project. A loan of US$7.0 million equivalent
would have a term of 25 years, including seven years of grace, with interest
at 8-1/2 percent per annum. In addition, a loan of US$3.5 million equivalent
would be made on standard Third Window terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Development Strategy in
a Mineral-led Economy" (735-BT) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 30, 1975. Country data are given in Annex I.
3.        Botswana is a landlocked country located at the center of southern
Africa. Although it is the size of France, the population in 1974 was only
670,000, of which about 75 percent was concentrated in the eastern region.
Botswana has one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. After achieving
a growth rate of about 20 percent annually in the early 1970's, GDP is
currently expanding at about 8 percent per annum. Income per capita rose
from $210 in 1971/72 to about $300 in 1973/74.
4.        The country is well endowed with mineral resources of which dia-
monds, copper, nickel and coal are currently being exploited. In recent
years, minerals have been the main source of economic growth. Traditionally,
the principal resource was cattle; more than half of the country is covered
by a savanna type vegetation suitable only for grazing. Less than 10 percent
of the land area has a good potential for arable agriculture. The main
crops are sorghum, maize, millet, beans and cowpeas, all of which are grown
largely for subsistence consumption. It is estimated that 80 percent of
the population depends on agriculture and cattle rearing for their liveli-
hood.
5.        Despite this good potential for development, the country is faced
with a number of constraints: (i) water availability; (ii) infrastructure;
and (iii) skilled manpower. Rainfall is highly erratic, resulting in frequent
droughts; the climate is largely semi-arid. Water in the eastern region,
which comes primarily from boreholes, dams and seasonal rivers, could become a
serious constraint to development. In the sparsely populated northwest of the

country, however, the Okavango delta represents a large source of surface
water which flows in from Angola. Thie complex hydrology and ecology of this
region is being intensively studied as part of the Government's long-term plan
for water development.
6.        Infrastructure is at an early stage of development.    Most of the
road system is unengineered and presently less than 150 km of the 5,000
km of main roads are bituminous-surfaced; feeder and rural roads are often
little more than tracks. Investments are being concentrated in upgrading
the vital north/south road axis (about 690 km) to bituminous standards.
Existing airfields cannot yet accommodate jet aircraft but are being up-
graded to international standards. The main railway line is owned and opera-
ted by Rhodesia Railways and passes from Rhodesia through eastern Botswana for
640 km before connecting with the South African railway system. With public
utilities generally available in the main urban centers, the Government is
giving priority to extension of these facilities to the rural population.
7.        The major constraint to development is the shortage of professional
and technical skills. At Independence in 1966, general levels of education
and skills were low, with illit racy estimated at 75 percent of the adult
population. Government plans c 11 for a rapid expansion in education and
training at all levels, so as fj substitute local staff for expatriates
as rapidly as possible in the technical and professional positions in both
the private and public sectors. However, with the expected growth in the
economy, the need for additional skilled manpower will become even more
pressing, necessitating an increased reliance on expatriates and a step-up
in the level of educational investment. At the same time the economic growth
should reduce the relative number of workers migrating to South Africa.
8.        Botswana's development objectives were summarized in 1972 in the
five year National Development Plan (1973-78) as follows: (a) rapid
economic growth; (b) social justice, defined as achieving a more equitable
distribution of income and providing equal opportunities for all Batswana
in education and employment; (c) economic independence, particularly the
diversification of the country's external, economic and trade relations,
and the localization of skilled manpower; and (d) sustained production while
conserving the natural environment.
9.        The Plan called for an investment program equivalent to 30 percent
of GDP and public capital expenditures of R212 million in 1974 prices over
the 1973/78 period. Infrastructure investments were to account for about
60 percent of planned expenditure while education and social services,
particularly in the rural areas, were expected to be progressively expanded
and to receive about 13 percent of planned allocations. Given the size and
low level of infrastructural development, the acute shortage of skilled
manpower, and the need to modernize the traditional sector, these alloca-
tions of investments appear to be well directed. So far, the Government
has executed its development program satisfactorily. An accelerated rural
development program was launched in 1973 with international assistance.



On the whole, planning, hitherto largely project-oriented, has been effec-
tive. Attention is now being given to the formulation of long-term stra-
tegies based on more comprehensive economic planning.
10.       The growing urbanization as well as the development of mining have
tended to widen the gap between rural and urban incomes in recent years; the
results of a survey of incomes distribution carried out with Bank Group assis-
tance will soon become available. A new land use policy, involving a far-
reaching program of reform of traditional practices of cattle rearing, is
currently being implemented.
11.       Together with Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland, Botswana belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union which was established in 1910, and which
provides for free movement of goods between member countries. Under this
Union, all customs, excise and sales duties are paid into a common revenue pool
and allocated to members mainly in relation to the value of their imports and
excisable production. The 1969 revision of this agreement has resulted in a
four-fold increase in goverrLment receipts from the pool over the last five
years. These countries also comprise the rand monetary area, but Botswana
is in the process of establishing a Central Bank and has announced its inten-
tion to issue its own currency.
12.       Starting from a very low level of income, economic growth began
with substantial mining investments towards the end of the 1960's ancd con-
tinued with the production of diamonds in 1971 and copper/nickel in 1973.
The Plan targets for growth in GDP and employment of 14 percent and 9 percent
respectively are likely to be met despite a short-fall in estimated copper/
nickel production. The growth of the economy since 1971 has been largely
export-propelled. Prior to 1971, the value of minerals in external trade was
negligible; in 1974/75 it was estimated at about R 40 million or just over
half of Botswana's merchandise exports. At the same time, the strong demand
for beef, both in the Republic of South Africa and in the United Kingdom,
resulted in an expansion of agricultural output through an increased offtake
of the national herd. While meat and meat products have now been overtaken
by minerals as the country's main commodity, they still represent almost
40 percent of merchandise exports. During the ban on beef imports imposed
by the EEC during 1974, Botswana was able to increase exports of this com-
modity to South Africa. Under provisional arrangements, beef exports to -EEC
have been resumed, while a longer term agreement between the Government and
the EEC is being negotiatecl.
13.       Between 1969/1970 and 1974/75 government revenues increased from
R 11 million to R 63 million, mainly because of increased proceeds from
the Customs Union, direct taxation and mining revenues. Over the same period,
government current expenditures expanded from R 14 million to R 39 million imply-
ing an average growth of 22 percent per annum. In 1974/75, these expenditures
jumped by 50 percent following a revision of the salaries of government
employees. Over the first half of the 1970s, the Government has thus been in
a position to finance from its revenue surplus an increasing proportion of its
development expenditures which hitherto had to be fully financed from external
sources and which increased from R 3.3 million in 1968/69 to R 33 million in
1974/75.



-4-
14.       However, the growth in government revenues is expected to slow down
over the next few years, and Botswana will have to demonstrate its ability to
adapt to a relatively less buoyant financial situation. Largely because of
delays in the development of the new mine, diamond production is expected to
remain at its 1974 level of R24 million until about 1977. In addition,
customs revenues have now levelled off, and are expected to decline, unless
current negotiations to amend the 1969 formula are sucessful. These prospects
for a slowdown in the growth of government revenues appear at a time when the
administrative and political .machinery is just geared to rapid expansion in
financial availabilities and when a number of demands for extraordinary ex-
penditures will have to be faced.
15.       The country has been well served so far by multilateral and bi-
lateral agencies with substantial assistance on very soft terms. The Bank
Group has been the main multilateral lender, and bilateral assistance has
been well diversified, the main sources being the United Kingdom, Canada,
United States, Germany and the Nordic countries. Disbursements amounted
to an average of about $35 million per annum over the last three years.
Total disbursed public debt amotnted to $129 million at December 31, 1974.
Service payments on debt during 1974 wefe $3.0 million, or less than 5 per-
cent of export earnings. Projezted service payments for 1980 would not
exceed 10 percent of current .evenue and export earnings. Botswana now has
the ins;titutions through which the mobilization of resources could be signi-
ficantlY improved, and consequently, domestic borrowing should become a more
regular feature of its development financing.    However, the country will
still need much external assistance, both technical and capital, including
loans on concessionary terms. With a per capita income of $240 in 1972,
commendable development performance, and a need to further strengthen its
creditworthiness, Botswana should be considered eligible for Third Window
financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
16.       Bank Group operations began in Botswana with a road project in
1964. To date there have been nine projects, financed by six IDA credits
amounting to about $15 million, and three IBRD loans totaling $47.3 million
(net of cancellations). The credits have financed two road projects, a water
supply project, a livestock project, engineering studies on the infrastruc-
ture relating to the Shashe mining compiex, and an urban project. The loans
have helped finance the Shashe infrastructure project, a development finance
company and a road project. As of December 31, 1974, the Bank Group's
share in Botswana's external public debt (disbursed only) was 33 percent (of
which the share of IBRD was 24 percent), while its share in Botswana's debt
service payments in 1974 was 65 percent - a relatively high figure reflect-
ing the predominance of soft funds in Botswana's external debt. Over 90
percent of the debt service payments to the Bank Group were accounted for



by the Shashe infrastructure project which is guaranteed by the mining com-
panies concerned. For 198C0, the Bank Group's share in the country's external
public debt (disbursed) and ts debt service payments is estimated at 23
and 28 percent respectively. A summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits to Botswana is given in Annex II, together with notes on the execution
of on-going projects. Botswana is not a member of IFC.
17.       Overall, the Botsw.Lna Government and its agencies have demonstra-
ted good performance in the planning and execution of development projects.
Of particular note is the coTipletion on schedule of the major parts of the
large Shashe infrastructure! project. The major technical problems that have
beset the related Bamangwato Concessions Limited mining scheme now appear
to be in hand and rated capacity may be reached by end-1976. Under present
financial arrangements, the large increase in capital costs of the scheme
could result in a substantial reduction in the benefits (royalties, taxes and
dividends) received by the Government. The Government is concerned about this
possibility and is seeking ways to safeguard these benefits. The Bank has been
studying various financial and technical possibilities for improving the
financial prospects and has been assisting the Government and private companies
involved to arrive at an understanding. Although no general agreement has yet
been reached on the financLaL issues, the parties are actively exploring possible
solutions.
18.       We propose to corLt.nue our active support for the Government's
development plan. Two operations are now being prepared, a fourth road
project that would improve a 150 km section of Botswana's main north-south
road, and a second livestock project that is expected to encompass major
changes in land tenure in tri.bal areas. In addition, assistance is being
considered for the proposed clevelopment of a township and infrastructure to
support a large soda and soda ash project based on brine deposits at Sua Pan.
We also hope to continue our support for medium-scale industrial growth
through the Botswana Development Corporation and to give some additional help
to the Government for meetinng the mushrooming urban problem which the country
faces.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
The Role of Education in Botswana's Development
19.       At Independence in 1966, Botswana had no public education system;
there were only five secondary schools and all were private. The sector had
developed neither as a result of local initiative nor by the colonial govern-
ment. Rather, education had been introduced by variou.s missionary societies
and the structure and content of the system still bears the stamp of this
origin. At present, the st:ructure of education is similar to that of various



- 6 -
African countries and provides for a seven-year primary education course,
followed by a junior secondary course of three years leading to the Junior
Certificate and by a senior secondary course of two years leading to the
Cambridge Overseas School Certificate. There are also various small post-
secondary courses in institutions of recent creaticin such as the National
Center for Vocational Training , the Botswana Agricultural College, the
Botswana Training Center, the primary teacher training colleges and the
University of Botswana and Swaziland. In addition, a number of institutions
provide accelerated training and nonformal education; of these, the most
important are the Botswana Extension College and the Youth Brigades. The
growth of the system has been slow and uncoordinated, partly because admini-
strative responsibility was until recently divided among several Ministries,
parastatals and private agencies. Furthermore, the legacy of the system's
origins is still reflected in the heavy emphasis placed on arts and literature
and the comparatively low priority given to scientific and practical subjects.
As a result, the sector fails to provide the manpower required for the expand-
ing modern sectors of the economy and the skills necessary for improved farm
productivity and rural development. The illiteracy rate of the adult popu-
lation is estimated at 75 percent. Including overaged students, school
enrollments are equivalent to 70 percent of the relevant age group at the
primary education level and to thirteen percent at the secondary level.
20.       At Independence, Botswana had a very small pool of trained local
manpower. Despite the efforts made by the Government since then, rapid
economic growth in recent years has resulted in a widening gap between the
demand for and the supply of educated manpower. At present, some 80 percent
of university graduates in wage employment are expatriates. Foreigners also
account for nearly half the workers with senior secondary schooling and
for some 20 percent of those with a junior secondary certificate. The shortages
of educated manpower are so acute that less than half of the requests for
employment of secondary school leavers can be met. In addition, the educa-
tional background of those in wage employment is among the lowest in Africa.
Among those in professional and technical occupations, only ten percent
have had university education and over 60 percent have left school after
junior secondary education. Shortages of trained manpower and the low educa-
tional background of the population in general and of those in wage employment
in particular are becoming a major constraint to economic growth. Projections
of future manpower requirements indicate that the output of general secondary
schools would need to double by the late 1980's in order to sustain expansion
in the modern sector of the economy and allow for a gradual replacement of
expatriates. Current government plans for education are geared to meet
somewhat more conservative projections of manpower needs. However, it will be
possible to increase educational facilities in the early 1980's if it then
appears that needs are larger than expected by the government at present.
21.       Education plays an important role in determining the level of wage
earnings in Botswana. For instance, in wage employment monthly earnings of
Batswana with university degrees are five times greater than those with only



- 7 -
primary educatLon and ten times greater than those who are unskilled.
Opportunities for access to education need to be expanded by devoting spe-
cial attention to the geographical areas and the target groups that have
been comparatively neglected in the uncoordinated education development of
the past. Although the geographical distribution of primary school enroll-
ment is satisfactory as compared to other developing countries, funds for
new school construction need to be directed towards a number of areas, and
a vigorous program of bursaries to assist needy and deserving students
should be developed.
22.       In spite of the rapid growth of the modern sector and of wage em-
ployment, a large propoction of Batswana will continue to derive theLr live-
lihood from agriculture, cattle raising and the informal sectors of the urban
areas. In particular, some 70 percent of those in the 14-18 years age group
are not likely to find jobs in the modern sector in the foreseeable future.
As a part of the government program to promote agricultural development,
nonformal education is ro be strengthened and improved.    Programs like the
Botswana Extension College and the Youth Brigades, which address themselves
to increasing rural skills of youths and adults and providing "second chance"
education for those who had no access to the formal school system, will he
stressed.
The Reorganization of the Sector
23.       To respond to the needs outlined above, the Government has initi-
ated a major reorganizai:ion and restructuring of the sector. Administration,
control and financial responsibility for the formal education system are
now centralized in a much-strengthened Ministry of Education that until
recently exercised littLe control over teacher qualifications, teaching
methods and materials, and the quality of school facilities. Within the
Ministry, a Planning Unit, a Curriculum Reform Unit, a Unified Teaching
Service and an Education Evaluation Unit have been established. The quality
of teaching at both the primary and secondary school levels is being upgraded.
While one-third of the primary school teachers are presently untrained, a
major in-service training program is underway and facilities for pre-service
training are being expanded. At the secondary school level, where 80 percent
of the teachers are expatriates, the quality of the system has been plagued by
the brief average tenure period. The length of the initial contract has
therefore been extended to five years. A vigorous recruitment program has
been launched and plans have been formulated for increasing the supply of
Batswana teachers. In addition, a National Commission for Education has been
established to review the content of the education system and new curricula
and syllabi are being introduced.
24.       Determined efiorts are also being made to promote cooperation
within the agencies involved in the various nonformal education programs. A
Rural Extension Coordinating Committee has been established recently and its
membership includes all the Ministries involved in rural development. Under
this Committee, the Government has also established a special sub-committee
to focus on non-formal education.



- 8 -
Strategy and Programs for Education Development
25.       With a strengthened and reorganized education administration, the
Government has laid the basis for maximizing the contribution of the sector
to Botswana's economic and social development. In the next National Develop-
ment Plan (1976-81), which is now under preparation, the Government intends
to: (i) continue the planned growth of primary education; (ii) expand and
improve the secondary and post-secondary systems, together with curriculum
reform and with special reference to the needs of the rural population;
(iii) provide rural educational centers for both formal and nonformal educa-
tion, as appropriate to the needs of the community being served; and (iv)
increase the emphasis on nonformal education by enlarging the facilities for
distance teaching (e.g., radio and correspondence courses) and improving the
facilities for skill training. With the Government's planned investment
program over the next Plan period, primary enrollments should rise to 80
percent of the 7-13 age group and universal primary education should be
available by the late 1980's. The sparsely and widely scattered pattern of
population distribution in the desert regions prevents reaching these targets
at an earlier date. Through extensions to existing schools and the addition
of five new schools, enrollment in the secondary system will be expanded to
accommodate 40 percent of those who complete the primary cycle; this expansion
is justified in terms of manpower requirements to replace expatriates, and is
in compliance with the policy of spreading the benefits of growth throughout
the country. Students eligible for enrollment in secondary education who
cannot afford the costs would be subsidized by government bursaries. There
would also be an expansion of primary teacher training from 190,the present
annual output, to 410. The output of secondary school teachers from the
University of Botswana and Swaziland would be increased from the present 24
per annum to 85 per annum. Post-secondary institutions such as the Botswana
Agricultural College, the Botswana Training Center, the National Center for
Vocational Training and the University would also be expanded and improved so
that enrollments can be increased gradually in line with manpower needs and
the availability of students and teachers.
26.       The development of rural education centers would help bring edu-
cational opportunities to all sectors of the population. About five centers
would be constructed to provide training in health, nutrition, agriculture,
animal husbandry and rural skills, and each would include facilities for a
junior secondary school. Opportunities would be further expanded by increas-
ing the work capacity of the Botswana Extension College and the number and
size of the Youth Brigades which provide training for primary school leavers.
There would also be improvements at national and regional levels for the
coordination of activities in nonformal education, to ensure that unnecessary
duplication of effort is eliminated. Finally, there would be a concerted
effort to develop close links between the schools and the communities they
serve.



- 9 -
28.       To reorient the content and increase the effectiveness of educa-
tional programs, the Government would: (i) continue to support the work on
curriculum reform in the primary schools to make primary education more
productive and responsive to the needs of rural development; (ii) make the
changes necessary in the secondary curriculum to ensure that the emphasis is
on preparation for employment and rural development; and (iii) reorient the
teacher training programs in line with the changes in the curricula to ensure
that the emphasis is shifted accordingly and that teachers are able to play a
direct role in village and community development.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A staff report. entitled "An Education Project in Botswana"
No. 1013a-BT dated May 10, 1976 is being circulated separately. A Loan and
Project summary is provided as Annex III.
30.       The proposed project was identified by Bank missions that visited
Botswana in August 1974 and April 1975 to review Botswana's education develop-
ment plans and priorities. A specific government request for a Bank loan was
received in May 1975. The project was appraised in October 1975 by a Bank
mission which also assisted the Government in completing project preparation.
Negotiations were held in Washington from April 26 to 28, 1976. The Botswana
delegation was led by Mr. M. Stevens, Director of Economic Affairs, Ministry
of Finance and Development Planning, and included Mr. T. Hillier, Project
Manager.
Objectives and Description of the Project
31.       The proposed project would be the first phase of the Government s
education investment program which is designed to meet the manpower require-
ments of the economy in the early 1980's. It consists of a number of meas-
ures to increase the output of the existing system. It would be specifi-
cally designed to: (i) increase the number of secondary school places by 30
percent; (ii) provide additional secondary school teachers to replace expa-
triate teachers and meer expansion needs; (iii) expand adult education pro-
grams to provide formal and nonformal educational opportunities for out-of-
school youths and adults; (iv) assist expansion of the Youth Brigades Program
to train primary school leavers tor wage employment; and (v) provide a rural
education development center to serve the needs of the western Kalahari re-
gion. The project-would consist of:
(a) the provision of buildings, furniture and equipment
for the following:
(i) five new junior secondary schools providing 2,100
student places;



- 10 -
(ii) expansion of secondary school teacher training
facilities at the Botswana branch of the
University of Botswana and Swaziland for 96
additional trainees;
(iii) expansion of the adult education facilities at
the Botswana Extension College to provide a service
center to develop materials for radio and correspon-
dence training programs which would reach about
9,000 additional adults;
(iv) expansion of the Botswana Youth Brigade Program
including the establishment of a National Brigade
Development Center, to provide places for an additional
1,500 primary school leavers; and
(v)  one multipurpose education center in the Kalahari
area to provide education and rural skill training
for about 3600 youths and adults per annum as well
as a junior secondary school for 320 places; and
(b) professional services, technical assistance and operational
expenses in support of the items under (a) and for project
evaluation and preparation of future education projects.
Project Items
32.       Junior Secondary Schools.   Following the 1972 Manpower Survey
(updated in 1975), the Government began an active program of expanding exist-
ing schools. The expansion program has now reached its limits and additional
schools are required. The Government intends to build five new junior secon-
dary schools in addition to the school in the Kalahari Center (paras. 39-40).
Two of the proposed schools would be day schools and three would be mixed day
and boarding schools. The day schools would be located in Caborone and
Francistown where the school age-group population density is high. The other
three schools would be located in areas adjacent to potential growth points
which do not have secondary schools: one near the diamond mine (Orapa); one
near the abattoir (Lobatse), which provides major employment, and one near
the copper-nickel mine (Selebi-Pikwe). The population density in the areas
surrounding these schools is sufficient to provide the required student flow.
The schools would provide facilities for practical subjects such as workshops,
domestic science, handicrafts and agricultural skills. During off-hours and
vacation periods the schools would be used by adults and out-of-school youths
for craft, commercial and other special skill training. The schools would be
integrated closely with village and community development programs.
33.       Secondary School Teacher Training.    Currently, Botswana has 350
secondary school teachers, 80 percent of whom are expatriates. Due to the
low output of local secondary school teachers, half the teachers in 1980 will



st[l1 be expatriates. The low annual output of local secondary teachers
is the result of the shortage of qualified candidates and the lack of training
facilities at the University where secondary teacher training iLF provided.
Enrollment in secondary teacher training prograns is now about 120 giving an
output of about 40 per annum. The Government is planning to increase the
number of places by 96 which will increase the output of teachers to about 75
per annum. With this output and the projected increase in secondary school
enrollment, 90 percent of the expatriate teachers would be replaced by 1985.
The project would provide the facilities for this planned expansion and, in
addition, would provide quarters and equipment for a center which would
develop simple teaching materials.
34.       The Botswana Extension College.   This college, established in
1974, provides correspondence courses, radio programs and some classroom
teaching.  The Government intends to incorporate it into the permanent non-
formal education program in the country. Its expanded roles would be to
provide: (i) support to all the nonformal extension work in the rural areas;
(ii) in-service assistance to primary school teachers, particularly to those
working in rural areas:: and (iii) "second chance" courses at whatever level is
in demand.
35.       At present, the College is providing radio and correspondence
courses for approximately 1,000 students per annum. The courses are primarily
directed towards the completion of academic qualifications for education
certificates. The College has developed an active training program for
members of the Botswana 4-B Club, an association of young farmers, which
reaches about 3,000 youths on a regular schedule. The College is engaged in
the preparation of materials for a radio and correspondence program which
would explain the new land use policy to the rural population (para. 10).
The project would provide the College with permanent service center facili-
ties in Gaborone. With these additional facilities and programs, the College
could reach more than 10,000 youths and adults per annum with radio, cor-
respondence and group training services. To be capable of fulfilling the
tasks assigned to it, the present staff of the college is now being increased
from 11 to 19, with budgetary allowance for part-time course writers. In
addition, the College is being given an adequate allocation of radio time at
periods in the day which are suitable for adult listening.
37.       The Youth Brigades.   The Botswana Youth Brigades were developed over
the past ten years as a means of providing skill training for primary school
leavers. The system is voluntary; the trainees, both boys and girls, undergo
three years of on-the-job training, their work and resultant products generat-
ing much of the resources needed to maintain the Brigades. The Brigades
originate through local initiative; each Brigade teaches a particular skill
(carpentry, building, dressmaking, farming, motor mechanics, forestry, weav-
ing, etc.), and several Brigades in a locality join for administrative pur-
poses into a Youth Brigade Center. The Brigade centers consist of a collec-
tion of very modest buildings built by the trainees. Each center is governed
by a Trust, or Board, made up of interested local residents. Every proposal



- 12 -
for a new Brigade activity is reviewed by the Trust and, if approved, the
proposal is forwarded to the National Brigade Coordinating Committee. Gov-
ernment financing of a new Brigade proposal is dependent upon the approval of
the National Committee. This method of project approval assures a control on
the creation of Brigade centers and additions to existing centers. It also
ensures that all new Brigade activities are originated and approved by the
local community. At present, there are 12 centers, with 66 individual Bri-
gades and about 2,000 trainees. However, since the centers are concen-
trated in the eastern section of Botswana, a wider geographical distribution
is desirable. The project would provide the Brigades with two features
urgently needed for their continuing development:
(a) A National Brigade Development Center at Gaborone -
This would serve as the administrative and accounting
center for the movement as a whole and as a training
center for instructors and administrators.
(b)  The establishment of three new Brigade    centers and the
improvement of existing centers - Locations of the three new
Brigade centers and specifications for the improvement of the
existing centers would be identified by the National Brigade
Coordinating Committee and reviewed by the Project Implementa-
tion Unit (para. 42).    Bank review of the individual sub-
projects would be carried out in the course of project
supervision.
38.       The project would result in an improved Brigades system, and enable
the Brigades to develop and expand during the forthcoming Plan period by some
70 percent, from an enrollment of 2,000 to about 3,500 with establishment
of the new centers and improvements to existing centers. The required
upgrading of instructors and administrative staff would be the task of the
proposed National Youth Brigade Development Center.
39.       The Kalahari Multipurpose Educational Center.     The proposed Center
in the Kalahari area would: (i) provide nonformal education for youths and
adults, both male and female; (ii) offer training in rural skills; and (iii)
include a secondary school for 320 pupils with a curriculum designed for rural
students. The Center would be provided with facilities, including a few
vehicles, for training about 3,600 adults per annum in short courses and
seminars. The Center compound would also include facilities provided by
Ministries other than Education; e.g., offices, training facilities and
stores for Agricultural Extension, a clinic operated by the Ministry of Health
and a depot for the library services. An interministerial committee is being
formed to coordinate the work involved. A Center Council, consisting of local
inhabitants and representatives of all ministries participating in the pro-
gram, would be established and given autonomy in the operation of the Center.
The Center will, however, be under the ultimate jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Education. In order to be effective, the Center would be provided with
appropriately trained staff including:



- 13 -
(i) a Director to be in charge; (ii) three staff for the nonformal program
who have had training in this type of education; and (iii) 17 staff for
the secondary school component who could also work in nonformal education.
40.       The Borrower has agreed to submit to the Bank for comment within
one year of the date of the Loan Agreements: (i) a plan for the organizational
structure of the Center; (ii) a plan for training the teachers and instruc-
tors; and (iii) a curriculum for the rural junior secondary school (Section
3.06, Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
41.       The total project cost is estimated at- US$15.0 million equivalent,
excluding taxes and duties amounting to $0.5 million equivalent. About
US$10.5 million equivalent, or 70 percent of the project cost, would be
for expenditures on goods and services outside Botswana. The proposed Bank
loans totaling US$10.5 million equivalent would cover all of these expendi-
tures. The balance would be financed by the Government. A detailed break-
down of the costs and the proposed financing plan are given in Annex III.
Project Implementation and Evaluation
42.       A Project Implementation Unit would be established in the Ministry
of Education to administer the project and to provide for the physical plan-
ning of possible future projects. The Unit would include a manager, an
architect, a quantity surveyor, a procurement specialist, an accountant
and a clerk of works as welL as supporting staff. The estimated foreign cost
of the manager, procurement officer and clerk of works would be financed by
the proposed loans. Qualified staff have been selected, but not appointed,
for all positions except the clerk of works. Recruiting for this position is
underway. The establishmeni: of the Project Implementation Unit and the
appointment of the project nianager, the architect and the procurement officer
has been made a condition for effectiveness of the proposed loans (Section
5.01, Loan Agreement). Moreover, the Borrower has agreed that any future
appointments to these three ppsitions would be made only after consultation
between the Borrower and the Bank (Section 3.07, Loan Agreement). The project
is already well advanced in its formulation and preparation. Standardized
plans already exist for most, of the buildings to be constructed. Private
architectural services would be required for the University construction but
these would be minimal because the hostels to be constructed would be dupli-
cates of existing structures. The Unit would oversee the implementation of
the project, train counterparts to replace expatriate specialists, maintain
liaison with the Bank and assist in the planning of possible future education
projects. In addition, the Unit would cooperate with the efforts of the
Education Elvaluation Unit, which has been established recently (para. 23).
The Evaluation Unit would evaluate the project and develop a tracer system to
follow up school graduates in the labor market. In addition to the key staff
of thie Implementation Unit, the proposed loans would help finance the operating
expenditures (excluding local salaries) of the Implementation Unit as well as
consultants's services for civil works, project evaluation and preparation of
future education projects.

Procurement and Disbursements
43.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Group Guidelines for procurement except for: (a) civil works costing
less than US$200,000 equivalent each which are small units to be constructed
in scattered locations primarily by the Youth Brigades; (b) construction of
new and expansion of existing Youth Brigade Centers that would be carried out
on force account; (c) furniture and equipment contracts costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent which can be purchased more economically locally since
the small amounts involved and the variety of the lots are not likely to
interest foreign suppliers; and (d) locally procured construction materials
and transportation services. Contracts for items procured under (a), (c) and
(d) above would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with local procedures which have been reviewed
by the Bank and found acceptable. In those cases where international compe-
titive bidding is used, domestic manufacurers of furniture and equipment
would be allowed a preference of 15 percent, or the existing rate of customs
duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing suppliers.
In addition, local civil works contractors would be allowed a preferential
margin of 7-1/2 percent over bid prices of competing foreign contractors.
44.       Disbursements would be on the basis of:    (a) 64 percent of total
expenditures for civil works and construction materials; (b) 100 percent
of foreign expenditures for directly imported furniture, equipment and vehi-
cles; (c) 90 percent of local expenditures for locally manufactured furniture
and equipment; (d) 80 percent of total expenditures for imported but locally
procured furniture and equipment; (e) 80 percent of total expenditures for
consultants services; (f) 85 percent of total expenditures for technical
assistance for the Project Implementation Unit; and (g) 100 percent of foreign
expenditures or 30 percent of local expenditures for the other operating
expenditures (excluding local salaries) of the Project Implementation Unit.
Expenditures on consultants' services and the Project Implementation Unit
that are incurred after February 1, 1976, would be eligible for retroactive
financing from the loans. These expenditures are estimated to total less
than US$150,000 equivalent, of which US$100,000 would be eligible for reim-
bursement. Disbursements would be fully documented. However, disbursements
for project administration and for civil works carried out by the Youth Bri-
gades would be made against certificate of expenditure documentation which
would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by the Borrower
and reviewed in the course of project supervision. Disbursements would
be made pro-rata from the conventional Bank loan and the Third Window
loan.
Benefits and Justification
45.       The proposed project would:   (i) provide a 30 percent increase
in student places at the secondary level; (ii) enable an additional 9000
adults annually to take radio and correspondence courses; (iii) enable about



- 15 -
500 primary school leavers annually to receive on-the-job skill training;
and (iv) provide rural training facilities for about 3,600 youths and adults
in the Kalahari Area, which is the most disadvantaged region of Botswana.
The principal risk is that the innovative non-formal education features
of the Kalahari Multipurpose Educational Center, which would serve as a
prototype for further centers in the rural areas, might not achieve full
success because its operation depends upon effective cooperation of several
ministries. To minimize this risk, the Government has established inter-
ministerial task forces to oevelop the adult education programs and the
modified secondary school curriculum to be used at the Center. Also, close
monitoring of all project items would be done by the Evaluation Unit. The only
other important risk in the project relates to the Youth Brigade program,
which offers an unusual opportunity to provide employment-oriented training
for primary school leavers. The success of the Brigades has already been
demonstrated and the proposed project would provide needed support for their
continued development. However, development in the past has been exclusively
through local village initiative, and there is a possibility that Government
involvement might reduce this initiative.
46.       The objectives of the croject and its expected benefits point
to its suitability as a part of Botswana's overall strategy to improve the
productivity of the rural sector, provide amenities for and raise the liv-
ing standards of the rural population, reduce manpower shortages and gradually
replace expatriates, and improve the efficiency of the education sector.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Loan Agreements between the Republic of Botswana and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the texts of draft Resolutions approving the
proposed loans, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 40 and 42 cf this report. The establishment of the Project
Implementation Unit and the appointments of a Project Manager, an Architect
and a Procurement Officer has been made an additional condition for effec-
tiveness of the loans (Section 5.01(b), Loan Agreement).
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank and with the established criteria for Third
Window loans.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 776              Shashe Infrastructure Project:   $32.0 million loan of
June 29, 1971; Effectiveness Date: March 7, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1978;
$5.5 million supplemental loan of June 7, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: July 17, 1974
Work on the infrastructure project as originally
envisaged was completed on schedule and the project
is operational. A later decision to bituminize the
Seruli-Pikwe road has delayed project completion.
W4ork on the road is not scheduled to be completed
before end-1976, and the loan of $37.5 million
will not be fully disbursed until about mid-1977.
The technical problems with the surface treatment
plant that have beset the associated Bamangwato
Concessions Limited mining project have resulted
in serious cost overruns and loss of production.
The major difficulties now appear to be in hand
and rated capacity may be reached by end-1976.
The large increase in capital costs of the mining
project could result in a substantial reduction in
the benefits to be received by the Government.    How-
ever, various financial and technical possibilities
for improving the financial prospects of the pro-
ject are being actively explored.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered and action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 325            Livestock Development Project:   $1.65 million credit
cf June 30, 1972; Effectiveness Date: April 10,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Seventeen cattle ranches in the Western State Lands
are now nearly ready and 12 have been allocated. Test
borehole drilling for the development of new Karakul
Sheep Farms has been unsuccessful and the unspent
funds may be used to develop a further 10 Western
State Land ranches. The fully developed Makalamabedi
ranch purchased about 9000 head of cattle and sold
about 6,000 to give a trading profit margin of
ap?proximately US$200,000 which is satisfactory. Five
Eastern Tribal Land fattening ranches are now ready
but a policy decision for their use has still to be
made. The new Board of the Botswana Livestock
Development Corporation is shaping up well and a new
General Manager has been appointed.
Credit No. 471           F_ancistown Urban Development Project:    $3.0 million
credit of May 9, 1974; Effectiveness Date: October
41 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily.
Most of the civil works are nearing completion. Resi-
dential plots are being allocated and self-help
housing construction is progressing rapidly. The
houses are of much better quality than usual in site
and services areas. The Town Council is satisfied
