I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal, some 54% of Malawi’s 11.6 million population, were living
below the country’s poverty line. Gross domestic product (GDP) of the country was about
US$1.9 billion (about US$164 per capita) and there was very little diversification of the
economy. Agriculture was by far the dominant economic activity, with tobacco and a few other
farm products providing Malawi with about 80% of its export revenues. Malawi was
experiencing fluctuating but generally low growth rates (averaging about 3.5% per year). There
was very little reduction in poverty from 1998 to 2006.

2.      Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were making a significant contribution to
Malawi's economy. These enterprises, which include firms with up to 50 employees, were
providing livelihoods for over 1.7 million people or about 40% of the total working population.
Most of Malawi’s SMEs revolved around simple agro-processing activities. Other common
businesses included hotels, restaurants, and other amenities that cater to people who come to the
town market centers.

3.       One of the biggest constraints to economic growth and improved household welfare in
Malawi was the lack of core infrastructure services. For the 85% of the people who live in rural
areas, access to electricity was less than 1%. About 60% of rural households had access to water
but mainly from hand-pumps that require a considerable time to collect water required, often
more than 2 hours per day. Most institutions and businesses had inadequate water supply. Road
transport, which is extremely important in Malawi given its landlocked position, had considerable
deficiencies with only 13% of the rural access roads in good condition. Telephone penetration
was only 0.3 per 100 people – far less than the average of 0.5 per 100 people for Sub-Saharan
Africa. In addition to low access levels, the high cost of services was a constraint to growth.

4.        It was within this context that the Infrastructure Services Project was initiated in an
effort to support the Government’s efforts to improve household welfare and strengthen economic
growth by providing coordinated infrastructure services necessary for expanding social and
economic activities. The project design included provision of core infrastructure services
(electricity, telecommunications, water and sanitation, and roads) in about thirty market centers in
five economic corridors located in Malawi’s three main geographical divisions – north, central
and south.

5.       The rationale for Bank’s involvement was founded on similar and relevant experience. In
Malawi, the Bank had substantial experience with projects in the water, roads and private sector
development and had been involved in policy dialogue in all of the infrastructure sectors. The
Bank also had experience in designing and supervising multi-sector infrastructure projects in
Africa (Madagascar and Mali) and in other regions (Chile and Peru). Furthermore, at the time
there were no other international agencies in Malawi providing the same type of strategic support
for infrastructure development linked to key economic activities. The Bank was also gearing its
involvement towards greater support to areas outside major urban areas.

6.       The project was formulated to contribute towards a number of higher level objectives and
strategic programs, including several economic and social objectives of the World Bank's Africa
Action Plan (AAP). Most notably from the AAP was the priority objective of closing the
"infrastructure gap" in Africa to help achieve the economic growth required for a substantial
reduction in poverty. In addition, the project would contribute to AAP objectives of: (1)

                                                 1
connecting poor populations to markets; (2) identification of drivers of growth, (3) development
of an African private sector; and (4) strengthening of partnerships at the country level.

7.       At the country level, the project was to support the economic and social objectives of the
Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS). The MGDS emphasized the importance of
well-developed infrastructure as a facilitator of growth in economic and social activities. In line
with this emphasis, the project’s main contribution was to support the economic empowerment of
rural areas by removing infrastructure barriers to business development in areas outside Malawi’s
main cities. At the same time, the project planned to balance the focus on productive activities by
providing infrastructure services to social institutions, such as schools and clinics, located in the
market centers of the project areas.

8.       In line with Malawi's poverty reduction goals and the MGDS, the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (Report No. 25906 of May 14, 2003), applicable at the time, had three main
pillars: (a) strengthening economic management (Pillar 1); (b) establishing a platform for
economic growth (Pillar 2); and (c) improving social service delivery along with strengthening
the safety net (Pillar 3). The project was designed to directly support Pillar 2 and indirectly
support Pillar 3. It was the largest project at the time, listed in the CAS as a key initiative
towards constructing a platform for economic growth.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.      The original project development objective was to improve household welfare and
strengthen economic growth in market centers and surrounding rural areas through the
provision of core infrastructure services. Specifically, at appraisal the project was designed to:
     finance coordinated priority investments in roads, water supply and sanitation, electricity
        and telecommunications within the five corridors with economic growth potential
        selected for participation in the project; and
     assist the Government of Malawi in developing a coordinated approach to planning and
        implementing infrastructure development in these areas.

10.     The key indicators established to measure progress towards achievement of the project
objectives were as shown in Table 1.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11.     The World Bank Board approved a project restructuring on October, 24, 2011, which
involved a revision of the Project Development Objectives: to improve access to basic
infrastructure services in target areas. This modification was intended to increase measurability
and to ensure accountability. Associated changes in the indicators were also introduced; the
revised indicators are as outlined in the Table below.

12.      The Level One restructuring was initiated as a corrective measure to account for
challenges faced during project implementation. The project had experienced delays in
implementation and issues associated with the initial cost estimates. Most of the preparatory
activities for the infrastructure works (i.e. feasibility studies and technical design) were carried
out after Board approval and during project implementation. Once feasibility studies and
engineering designs were completed, it became evident that total investment costs of the proposed
infrastructure packages far exceeded the original project cost estimates. In light of this
discrepancy, the Government proposed to reduce the scope of infrastructure activities to match
available funds. Accordingly, the project restructuring also involved a reallocation of funds and
revision of the results targets to reflect changes in the scope of works. A request to extend the
Grant closing date by seven months (to June 30, 2012) to account predominantly for the delay in
effectiveness was also approved as part of the restructuring. A summary of the key modifications
to the project scope initiated through the project restructuring is presented in the Table below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

13.      The original project included provision of core infrastructure services in thirty market
centers in five economic corridors. The selection of market centers gave preference to those with
significant potential for economic growth and development though agro-business, mining, and
tourism. It was estimated that the project would directly benefit some 160,000 people within, and
in the areas surrounding, these market centers.

14.     The market centers themselves were also considered beneficiaries of the project. These
centers typically consisted of: (a) small shops selling basic necessities such as cooking oil, soap,
sugar and salt, meat and fish, and clothes; (b) service providers such as maize mills, bicycle repair
shops, tailors, battery charging stations; (c) entertainment establishments, such as video stores
and bars; and (d) public / social institutions such as clinics, schools, police posts etc. On average,


                                                   5
5,000 people lived within a two kilometer radius of a market center. Many more people who used
the market centers lived in the surrounding rural areas.

15.      The primary target group of beneficiaries and secondary beneficiaries remained the same
after the project restructure, however, the total number of people expected to benefit decreased as
a result of the modified scope of activities. After the restructuring the number of direct
beneficiaries was estimated to be 90,000 people.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

16.      The project components were designed to form part of a coordinated infrastructure
package that once implemented would begin to address infrastructure imbalances between urban
and rural areas, stimulate and strengthen economic growth in the market centers - leading to
improvements in household welfare. While the national government, in consultation with district
authorities, selected the economic corridors where the project will operate, the investments
themselves were demand-driven reflecting the specific needs and priorities of the districts. The
key elements of the project components are summarized below.

17.      Electrification. This component involved enhancing electricity access for businesses,
public institutions, and inhabitants in the project areas. It included financing construction of
power lines connecting market centers to the national grid as well as transformers, poles, low -
voltage distribution networks and consumer meters. The component supported the use of low-
cost distribution technologies wherever possible to enhance efficiency. Public lighting in the
market centers and connections for schools and clinics, along with housing for teachers and
health workers, were financed under this component. In project areas where electricity
distribution lines already existed, the component involved upgrading the distribution network
through the installation of transformers and other equipment necessary to meet projected
increases in demand. Furthermore, the component financed the required design and supervision
assistance for ESCOM and training in cost-saving electrification technologies.

18.      Information and communication technology (ICT). This component was designed to
provide subsidies to improve access to telecommunications and information services in the
project areas, under an output based aid scheme. The component activities also involved
expanding internet access and ICT services through establishing small-scale, multi-purpose
community tele-centers in project areas. In addition, under a grant from the Public-Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility, a consultant was engaged to review and update the
Government’s 1999 Universal Access Policy and provide other related policy and strategy
support.

19.     Water supply and sanitation. This component financed the establishment of water user
associations to oversee each water supply system, and a local utility operator to handle routine
operations and maintenance, plus construction of a water supply scheme serving the market
centers. The type of improved water supply varied based on location. Market centers, which had
a dense core, received piped water. More sparsely populated fringe areas received public
standpipes. In addition, schools, clinics and other social institutions received water and sanitation
services. The specific layout of the distribution system within the service areas was determined in
consultation with users and physical planning authorities.

20.     Roads. This component financed the rehabilitation of secondary, tertiary roads and
feeder roads to improve transportation accessibility to and from the project corridors in general
and the market centers in particular. Major pavement and realignments were not included, in
order to avoid unnecessarily high standards that would affect costs. The rehabilitation work

                                                 6
entailed spot improvements, including sectional re-gravelling, strengthening/replacing drainage
structures, provision of additional drainage, and minor adjustment to road widths if necessary.
Periodic maintenance also formed part of the component. These activities included resealing,
resurfacing, re-gravelling, and strengthening of base material using design standards for low
volume roads. Furthermore, the component financed activities to: (a) support the establishment of
community contractors; (b) put into place adequate contract arrangements and payment systems;
(c) provide on-the-job assistance/training on technical, work organization, financial management
and accounting, and business administration skills; and (d) supervise and monitor the activities to
ensure smooth implementation of the maintenance program.

21.      Institutional strengthening and capacity building. This last component involved the
provision of technical assistance and training support, including environmental training, to the
various governmental agencies (including district authorities) and the private sector engaged in
infrastructure service delivery. This component also involved financing of the project’s
management costs, and supported activities associated with the screening of project areas for
environmental and social impacts, preparation and implementation of related Environmental
Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), if required, as well as the
costs of the project’s monitoring and evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

22.    The number of project components (as discussed above) were not changed during the
Level One restructuring. However the scope of activities to be carried out under each component
was modified, as summarized previously in Table 2.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

23.    A second request to extend the project closing date by six months (to 31 December,
2012) was approved by the Bank (May 31, 2012), in order to allow more time for completion of a
number active infrastructure contracts.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis
24.      The project objectives and key activities, defined under the components listed above,
identified and targeted a number of key development issues and constraints, supported by the
CAS and the Government’s development strategy. In line with these strategy documents, the
background analysis identified infrastructure issues as a key factor limiting economic
development in market centers along the selected potential growth corridors.

25.     The rationale for the Bank’s involvement was that the Bank, had considerable in country
and regional experience and in particular, relevant experience with implementation of multi-
sectoral projects. Based on this experience the Bank identified a number of lessons which had
been learned from experience in other projects and reflected these in the project design.

26.     Furthermore, the background analysis reinforced the multi-sectoral approach by drawing
upon the experience of other similar Bank projects, indicating that when several infrastructure
services become available simultaneously in the same area, the impact is greater than the sum of
the individual parts - when services are provided individually or in different areas. This lesson

                                                7
was central to the design of the project, and was further justified at appraisal, when considering
single sector approaches as a potential alternative. Associated with this, at appraisal the potential
risk of experiencing implementation delays, and possible problems with coordination were
identified, and mitigation measures introduced. These included the establishment of a Project
Management Unit (PMU) to coordinate and oversee the work of the implementing entities and a
Project Steering Committee comprised of senior management level representatives.

27.     The background analysis did, however, have weaknesses related to the design of
economic and social assessments. Specifically, the economic analysis did not support the key
rationale for the project design, which emphasized the potential synergies arising from multi-
sector investments in target areas. Rates of return were estimated on a sector-by sector basis,
without capturing the incremental benefits from their combined provision. In addition, the social
analysis, related to the demand side, did not include local market community qualitative and
quantitative socio-economic studies to support demands for the mix and sequencing of
interventions, expected response, and particularly the capacities for self-management on which
sustainability assumptions rest.

Assessment of the Project Design
28.      While the overall design of the Project was sound, due to the higher costs of investing in
the infrastructure proposed at appraisal, the original project development objective was modified
during restructuring to increase measurability and to ensure a greater attribution towards
outcomes. This involved focusing the revised objective on an outcome in which the operation
could be reasonably held accountable, given the duration, resources and approach.

29.      The project components did not change at the time of restructuring, as they were
appropriately focused on the provision of basic infrastructure services as a means to achieve the
original objective. They therefore remained relevant and applicable after the PDO revision.
However, the actual scope of activities under each component was reduced to reflect the revised
cost estimates and tailor infrastructure investment packages to the project financing allocations.
However, an inadvertent consequence of this process was the decision to reduce the scale of
investments in all corridors rather than eliminating one corridor. Although, it is unclear what
impact this had on achieving the greater development impacts and synergies associated with
simultaneous provision of several infrastructure services (i.e a diluted outcome). This choice was
assessed and considered during the restructuring process, but the decision was taken by the
Government to proceed with a reduced scope across the 5 original corridors (as the process of
engaging beneficiaries was advanced in all corridors), rather than reducing the number of project
corridors (say from 5 to 3).

30.       The project was affected by the decision to use a programmatic approach - as the level of
readiness for implementation at appraisal. Project cost estimates and associated activities for
each component defined in the PAD, were based on findings from a preliminary feasibility study
carried out during project preparation. It was planned that these estimates would be further
refined through more detailed feasibility studies and engineering designs to take place during the
initial stages of project implementation. However, the feasibility studies and detailed design took
some 3 years to be completed, and the preliminary cost estimates used at appraisal and delays in
finalizing designs and detailed cost estimates, coupled with external market forces (e.g increase
unit costs associated with fuel prices, foreign currency shortages and local currency devaluation
etc), led to a substantial increase in the estimated costs for the project activities – to the extent
that it was estimated that implementation of the full scope of works would cost almost double the
original project cost estimates. Whilst the potential risk of infrastructure investment costs



                                                 8
exceeding project cost allocations was foreseen in the PAD, the magnitude of the difference was
not anticipated.

31.      The institutional and implementation arrangements were defined in the PAD and
reinforced through separate project agreements for each implementing entity. This involved the
establishment of a PMU, under the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development, who were
charged with overall responsibility including design of the project and final investment packages,
coordination and monitoring of the implementing entities and administrative aspects of the
project. Other implementing entities were nominated to take the specific responsibilities for each
component of the project, related to the sector. For example ESCOM the power utility, was
responsible for implementation of the electricity components, the roads component was
implemented through the National Roads Authority and water activities were implemented by the
relevant Regional Water Boards etc. This approach – assigning implementation responsibilities
(including procurement) to the appropriate sector institutions – is considered good practice for
multi-sectoral projects as it enhances ownership, sustainability, technical coordination with other
project activities and efficiency.

32.      Two potential issues related to institutional aspects of the project design appear to have
negatively affected implementation and outcomes: (1) lack of adequate involvement of the
implementing entities during the project design; and (2) lack of clarity with regards to asset
ownership and mandates for water supply and sanitations in small towns. The first issue, relates
to the process of project design, in which the activities to be carried under each component of the
project were not defined with adequate participation of the implementing entities. While MEPD
played the lead role in the planning and design phase of the project, with some inputs and
direction provided by a multi-sectoral task force represented by various line ministries; the basis
for the definition of the scope was a prefeasibility study carried out by external consultants
contracted by the MEPD, as part of the project preparation fund. Once the project scope was
defined, agreed during appraisal, and the project was approved and became effective, these
activities were handed over to the relevant institutions for implementation.

33.     The second issue relates specifically to the implementation of activities under the water
component – which were affected by the lack of clarity with regards to ownership of the assets
and the related legal mandate for small town water supply and sanitation. More specifically, the
project agreements were signed with the Regional Water Boards as the implementing entities,
however during implementation it was unclear: (1) whether these institutions are legally
mandated to manage water supply and sanitation in small towns; and (2) who owned the assets,
and what arrangements for transfer and associated conditions were. This design issue was
thought to have a significant effect on the implementation of the water systems, because Regional
Water Boards, if not legally mandated by the Government to own asset s and manage operations
and maintenance, may not have sufficient incentives (beyond the Project Agreement) to
implement planned activities – to be taken over by water user associations. Furthermore, the
project design did not address in detail the technical and commercial capability of the water user
associations being supported through the project to own or manage the water systems, nor was it
clear what assistance they may require after the project and the potential implications of capacity
constraints on sustainability.

Adequacy of the Government’s Commitment
34.     The Government was committed to the initiation and preparation of the project and
nominated a project Task Force during the early period of preparation, represented by senior
personnel from sector Ministries, to provide inputs and coordinate the project design. MEPD was
designated as the lead Ministry and established a PMU in mid-2005 in an effort to focus the

                                                9
Government’s preparation activities and progress project design towards having it ready for
appraisal in April, 2006. MEPD also demonstrated its commitment by establishing an inter-
agency Steering Committee that managed to bring all implementing agencies together to
undertake planned activities within the timeframe of the restructured project.

Assessment of Risks
35.     A number of risks to the project were identified during project preparation and several
mitigation measures were incorporated into the design. The key risks were implementation
delays and coordination problems resulting from the multi-sectoral nature of the project. To
address these risks the project introduced a PMU, established within MEPD with overall
responsibility for management and coordination and a Project Steering Committee designed as a
mechanism through which senior management from each sector could be involved in directing
and coordinating project activities towards achievement of the development objectives. However
the risk associated with substantial cost increases in the project activities was not adequately
considered and potential impacts on sustainability in the water component, related to the asset
ownership issues and capacity of the WUA’s, were not identified and addressed.

36.     The project at appraisal had a number of risks, due largely to the institutional weaknesses
within the country, one of the poorest in Africa, the focus on growth corridors located in
provinces (which had received little attention from the implementing entities in the past), the
challenges posed by having to coordinate several agencies, that had to follow Bank procedures
and operate outside the capital city in more remote and difficult places to supervise, and from
financial concerns linked to sustainability after project completion. Despite the identified risks, it
was clear that the risk-reward tradeoffs were significant – considering the context of the project
and strategic objectives.

37.     Quality at Entry Rating – Moderately Satisfactory (discussed in Section 5.1)

2.2 Implementation

38.     During project implementation there were a number of important factors which affected
progress towards the achievement of the development objectives. Those factors which
contributed most significantly to successes or gave rise to problems are discussed below.

39.      Delays in preparing feasibility studies and designs after project approval. As discussed
in the previous section, the decision was made to appraise the project based on initial investments
identified through a preliminary feasibility study. As such, it was planned that more detailed
feasibility studies and engineering designs for the key infrastructure activities would be prepared
after Board approval. However, the PMU and implementing entities, experienced start up
difficulties – delaying the completion of feasibility studies and engineering designs – and more
than three years passed before bidding documents were prepared and physical works ready to
commence. Several reasons are cited for the difficulties in completing the design work as
planned including: (1) a 7 month delay in effectiveness, (2) procurement challenges; (3)
complexities associated with managing and supervising work in multiple sectors geographical
dispersed across the country; (4) inability of some of the consultants to deliver outputs as per their
contract delivery schedules; (5) lack of capacity of the implementing entities in procurement and
technical management / oversight of the consultants; (6) weak capacity and coordination from the
PMU; and (7) fragmented implementation and supervision support from the Bank. In summary,
these preparatory design related activities, consumed more than 60% of the time for project
implementation, which affected the projects ability to achieve results within the design horizons.



                                                 10
40.      Discrepancies in engineering costs estimates. Further and related to the above point,
once detailed designs had been completed the Government realized that actual updated cost
estimates for implementation of activities defined at appraisal were almost 100% more than the
original estimate. The main reasons for the cost escalations include: (1) original estimates were
not accurate; and (2) as final designs were completed some 3 years after the preliminary designs,
unit rates had increased significantly. This was a significant issue which created uncertainty on
behalf of the Government about how to proceed and ultimately led to the project restructuring.

41.      Shortage of foreign currency and fuel in the market. Implementation of civil works
commenced in 2011, under a revised / re-prioritized implementation schedule. However, around
this time weakening macro-economic conditions constrained project activities – affecting
implementation. More specifically, the Malawi economy was subjected to multiple shocks:
adverse terms of trade, significant reductions in tobacco proceeds, and a drop in donor in-flows
(especially budget support); compounded by inappropriate policy responses. Together the shocks
triggered a severe foreign exchange shortage. Excess demand for foreign exchange led to
increasing shortages of critical goods, especially fuel, and of other production inputs. In addition,
with international reserves plunging, the authorities devalued the Malawi Kwacha (MWK) by
10% —but at the same time tightened restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. The lack of
foreign exchange and fuel had a substantial impact of the implementation of the civil works
under the project, as the contractors were unable to procure the necessary materials and supplies
including bitumen, large galvanized pipes, ductile iron, valves and fittings, steel plate tanks,
modular treatment plants and spare parts for dozers and excavator, pumps, etc. Furthermore, the
contracts signed in MWK, were seriously affected by devaluation. This issue affected the project
significantly in 2011 – but was proactively managed and impacts mitigated, by the Borrower and
the Bank as discussed in more detail in Section 5.

42.      Management coordination and supervision challenges. The multi-sectoral nature of the
project coupled with the geographical dispersion, led to challenges for the implementing entities,
PMU and the Bank in the coordination and supervision of the project activities – both during
design and construction. Some of the works were interdependent and had contract interfaces
which required careful and coordinated management. For example, water treatment systems and
pumps were dependent on energy supplied through connections made by the project; and the
installation of electricity and water distribution and transmission lines was expected to be
coordinated with road works in order minimize damages and requirements for repairs. This
proved challenging for the project team as several consultants and contractors were working on
the ground towards their respective TOR’s, contract deliverables and schedules. However,
despite the challenges presented it was in general successfully managed; particularly during the
construction phase – which was largely facilitated by the enhanced inter sectoral coordination
arrangements that had been established through the Steering Committee.

Effects of Project Restructuring
43.      In response to implementation issues associated with the design and the resulting cost
escalations, it was decided to restructure the project and to carry out a joint comprehensive review
(or mid-term review) and stock-taking exercise. The comprehensive mid-term review,
commenced in February, 2010. The main findings from the review were: (a) actual
implementation of the infrastructure works had not begun after 3.5 years (including 7 months lost
due to a delay in project effectiveness) due to major delays in completion of technical designs, (b)
procurement capacity of implementing agencies, and project coordination, management and
oversight were weak, and (c) due to under-estimation of the cost of infrastructure investments, the
project faced major potential cost overruns in civil works if the full scope was to be implemented.



                                                 11
44.      With less than 2 years remaining until the grant closing date, the Government and Bank
considered two options: cancellation or restructuring. After consultations, a decision was made to
restructure the project, while maintaining the original approach of delivering integrated
infrastructure services. In light of this decision and with a view to turn-around the project, in July,
2010, a joint Government-Bank team agreed on a detailed Action Plan and revised
Implementation Schedule for each of the project components. The key actions agreed were: (a)
reducing the scope of the infrastructure components of the project in line with available funds; (b)
speeding up procurement processing and contract signature; (c) preparing a revised procurement
and implementation plan; and (d) strengthening the implementing agencies’ and the PMU’s
capacity in procurement and contract processing and supervision.

45.     By November, 2010, most of the key action points were complied with and a number of
contracts were awarded and under implementation. Contract commitments and disbursements
increased substantially and the project started to make tangible progress towards the results
targets. Due to effective collaboration over this period, the renewed commitment of the
Government and implementing agencies in particular, and sustained technical and procurement
support from the Bank, a practical way forward was found. The major project changes associated
with the agreed Action Plan were later formalized through the project restructuring document
approved October 24, 2011.

46.      The joint comprehensive review and restructuring were initiated as corrective actions, to
account for design and implementation issues; and they represented a turning point for the project,
enabling it to proceed and produce important outputs. The restructuring therefore achieved the
intended impact of refocusing activities towards a revised scope of works, and allowing results to
be more measurable and objectives to be more attainable. This was a significant achievement
considering the status of the project at the time and the corrective action appears to have
facilitated progress.

47.      The project extension of six months, to a revised closing date to 31 December, 2012,
allowed more time necessary for implementation progress and completion of component
activities.

Mid-Term Review
48.    The mid-term review was carried out in the form of the comprehensive review, discussed
above. The mid-term review was critically important for this project, informing the decision
making and restructuring process.

Actions Taken in Response to Problems
49.       Further to the above points, related to the restructuring and extensions, a number of other
important actions were taken in response to the problems discussed above. Most notably, during
the foreign exchange and fuel access crisis, on-going civil works contracts were revised to allow
payments in US dollars (rather than local currency), and to allow contractors greater access to
foreign currency in order to make purchases of fuel and other materials directly from suppliers –
facilitating progress of physical works. This action was initiated, by the Government and
strongly supported by the Bank as a practical means to overcome a substantial issue affecting
implementation of the project. A second notable action from the Bank’s side, included the
decision to provide closer implementation support and supervision, utilizing in country and
regional expertise, to assist the Government to carry out the comprehensive review (commencing
Feb, 2010), develop the Action Plan and implement the key activities on the critical path
thereafter with added attention from the project team. This more intense and consistent


                                                  12
supervision lasted for a period of about 2 years and through sustained efforts, helped to support
the project through a number of challenging circumstances.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design
50.     The quality at entry assessment of the project identified the design of M&E arrangement
as one of key areas which needed improvement, as they were not considered to be sufficiently
developed and socio-economic outcomes and indicators inadequately specified. Moreover, it was
noted that the results monitoring framework comprised essentially output indicators instead of an
outcome framework, in which results related to the PDO could be assessed.

M&E Implementation and Utilization
51.      Implementation and utilization of the monitoring and evaluation systems experienced
some challenges. As part of the impact evaluation exercise a baseline survey was carried out in
treated and non-treated market centers and a final impact evaluation survey completed in
December, 2012. The mid-term survey was not undertaken, as per project design, as the focus at
that time was on implementing works under a compressed construction period. The final impact
evaluation, carried out by local consultants contracted by MEPD, presented some positive
findings towards the PDO, but also had a number of inherent limitations. More specifically, due
to project delays, implementation of physical works was largely condensed to a two year period
(2011-2012), with not all activities completed at project closure. This lead to one of the major
limitations of the final impact evaluation study, which was the short time horizon over which
beneficiaries have had access to infrastructure services due to the late completion of works. For
instance, of all the treated trading centers included in the survey, water services were only
commissioned at one (Nthalire), while commissioning was scheduled for the 1st quarter of 2013
for the others – which was after project closure and after the impact evaluation surveys. Similarly,
although most of the centers are connected to electricity, some were just a week old with
electricity at the time of the impact survey

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

52.      For the most part, compliance with environmental and social safeguards was rated as
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. However, the ratings were downgraded during the final
supervision mission to moderately unsatisfactory – reflecting three issues observed during the
mission: (1) compensation to some Project Affected Person’s (PAP) had not been made on time
by two of the implementing entities, (2) a number of borrow pits used for the roads contracts, had
not been properly reinstated as required by their contract, (3) land donations to the project were
not adequately document as per Bank’s operational policies, which presented a risk for future
land disputes. These identified issues were outlined during the last supervision mission in
November, 2012 and the Government committed to rectify the problems.

53.     There was no serious procurement issues under the project, with any deficiencies noted
being corrected. The procurement experience mirrored that of a number of other projects in
Malawi, whereby considerable unfamiliarity was found to exist among the Ministry and
implementing entities with regards to the Bank procurement procedures. Strong and sustained
technical support was, therefore, required from the Bank, for the PMU and implementing entities
to become better acquainted. As a result, the project procurement performance improved with
experience and closed with a satisfactory rating during the last supervision mission.



                                                13
54.      Financial management performance was generally rated as satisfactory, with the project
submitting reports and audits compliant with fiduciary requirements of the financing agreement.
Furthermore, Bank review missions assessed the projects financial management systems and
concluded that systems were in place to ensure project funds are used for the intended purposes,
transactions and balances were recorded accurately, financial reports are accurate, reliable and
submitted in a timely manner, project assets are safeguarded, and appropriate external auditing
arrangements are in place.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

55.      The project design intended for the activities implemented under each component of the
project to be self-sustaining after project completion. The responsibility for ensuring
sustainability lies with the implementing entities, as per the specific project agreements.
Investments in electrification are owned, operated and maintained by ESCOM, who have
committed to provide sufficient budget, collected through the tariffs, to ensure sustainability and
further expand systems as required. The roads authority have committed to providing
maintenance of the roads constructed under the project. They are bound (as per project
agreement) to develop and implement comprehensive annual work plans for road maintenance
and the Government have advised that a budget will be provided for this through the road
allocations in the national budget. With respect to ICT (internet and public phone), the services
providers are contractually committed until 2015 – after which continuation of these services will
be subject to demand and case by case business plans. It is envisaged that in most areas these
services will be provided by private operators – without subsidies from the Government.

56.     During the Bank implementation support and supervision mission (November, 2012),
however, it was noted that there was some uncertainty with regards to the post project operations
of the water supply systems. Given the unclear roles and responsibilities of the RWB’s, when
combined with weak capacity of WUA and local operators, modalities for long term technical
assistance for system operations, improving efficiency, setting and adjusting tariff’s, billing and
revenue collection, implementing more complex repairs / maintenance, expansion works etc,
were unsettled.

57.      Further to the above point, some of the WUAs and local utility operators were not ready
and prepared to take over the water supply schemes. However, in response to this issue raised,
the Government put in place measures for the WUA’s to be supported through the start-up period,
after project closure, under the on-going National Water Development Project – thus mitigating
the above potential risks.

58.      The Government of Malawi has expressed interest to continue providing similar support
through a second phase of the Infrastructure Services Project (ISP-2). It is proposed that similar
activities are extended and scaled up to other selected economic corridors using similar
institutional arrangements, whilst benefiting from the experience and lessons learnt. ISP-2 was
not specifically featured in the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for FY13-FY16, but would
however contribute significantly to its strategic objectives and results areas – particularly Theme
1 - Promoting Sustainable, Diversified, and Inclusive Growth.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation




                                                14
Relevance Rating: Substantial
59.      The project objectives (original and restructured) remain highly relevant to the country’s
development agenda and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy. The Government of Malawi,
articulated its development priorities and objectives in the Second Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (MGDS II 2011 -2016), approved by cabinet in April, 2012. Two of the
six thematic areas are directly relevant to this project’s development objectives: (1) sustainable
economic growth and (2) infrastructure development. Furthermore, the MGDS II emphasizes
growth strategies focused on key export industries including agriculture, manufacturing, mining,
and tourism, which is akin to the founding principles of the projects design and objects.

60.      The MGDS II, and the Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS FY13-FY16),
specifically identify the provision of infrastructure services as a key development and growth
constraint. Furthermore, a government-initiated National Dialogue on the Economy in July 2012
resulting in the preparation of the Economic Recovery Plan, launched in October 2012, identified
commercial agriculture, mining, tourism, transport infrastructure, and energy as the five priorities
to fuel the economic rebound, together with improving the investment climate and regional
integration.

61.     The project objectives remain relevant and aligned with the Bank’s Africa Regional
Strategy 1 . Furthermore, the project objectives and design are relevant to the Millennium
Development Goals, in particular through the provision of infrastructure services, including safe
drinking water and sanitation.

62.      The design is also considered to be relevant, in that it set out to respond to a very real and
significant development challenge of stimulating economic growth and improving household
welfare through extending infrastructure service provision to poor, underserved and relatively
remote rural areas. The majority of activities defined under each component was particularly
relevant at the time of project approval, and have remained relevant at completion. Due to
technology changes some activities under the ICT component of the project, reduced in relevance
throughout implementation, particularly the demand and rationale for the provision of public pay
phones and internet service centers - subsidized by the Government. This became evident during
the last review mission, where it was noted that independent private companies2 had established
similar business centers for computer access, internet and printing etc., in some of the market
centers and availability of affordable mobile phone handsets had weakened the demand for public
phone usage.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Original PDO Efficacy Rating: Low
63.      The original PDO was to improve household welfare and strengthen economic growth in
market centers and surrounding rural areas through the provision of core infrastructure services.
Achievement towards this original objective, evaluated from the time that the project restructure
was approved (October, 24, 2011), is rated Low. This assessment rating is based largely on the
results indicators recorded in the Bank’s Implementation, Status and Results (ISR) report of
October, 2011. The recorded results at this time reflect low progress towards the original PDO as


1
    Africa’s Future and the World Bank’s Support to It. The World Bank, February 2011

2
  The independent internet / business centers had been established by the private sector in a number of the market
centers offering similar services in direct competition with the subsidized centers provided under the project.

                                                            15
per the target values indicated in the PAD. For example, the proportion of the population with
access to improved water supply and all season roads had not increased because the civil works
contracts were still under implementation. Reported results for the percentage of population with
direct access to electricity had at this point in time increased marginally, as the works contracts
had progressed further. The ICT component made more substantial progress through the
installation of 8 internet services centers and around 1000 public phones.

64.     Despite the low rating above however, it is worth noting that the Bank’s assessment of
progress towards achievement of the PDO was rated as moderately satisfactory at the time of
submitting the ISR (October, 2011). The ISR’s assessment considered the significant turn-
around in project performance, since initiating the comprehensive review and action plan (July
2010), and substantial progress in the physical works at this time. Furthermore, the project’s
disbursement rate had increased substantially to 47% and 96% of the total project funds were
contractually committed. As such, at this point in time, there were strong indications that the
project was progressing, and was expected to achieve the PDO, with moderate shortcomings.

65.      In summary, at the time the project restructuring paper was approved by the Bank
(October, 24, 2011), the project had taken a number of important steps towards improving project
performance and delivering infrastructure outputs under each component and therefore
progressing towards the achievement of the result and the original PDO. Infrastructure works
were at varying degrees of progress (5-50% completion) – outputs were partially completed and
progressing towards the outcomes indicator targets. However, despite the project turn around
and substantial progress since, due to the limited time remaining in the project, the reported
results against key outcome indicators remains low (although these works have now been
completed/are nearing completion with Government financing) - the rating for the achievement
against the original PDO has therefore, also been rated as low.

Restructured PDO Efficacy Rating: Substantial
66.     At closure, the project had demonstrated significant results and progress towards
achieving the revised PDO – leading to a Substantial rating. Specifically, progress towards
achieving results under the electricity and telecommunication components exceeded or met target
values, with some 3,060 people provided with access to electricity under the project by household
connections (against the target of 2,760) and some 573,300 people provided with access to a
public phone service (which was equivalent to the target value). Both of these results met the
revised targets and represent a major improvement in access to basic infrastructure services.

67.      The roads and water components also achieved significant results leading to major
improvements in infrastructure access in the project areas. The core indicator results for these
components however fell short of the end target values, primarily because significant works were
to be commissioned after project closing. The final commissioning and household connections
were expected to be completed in 2013. As such the total number of people provided with access
to improved water under the project at closure was 23,8003 compared to the end target of 76,310.
It is noted however that this figure is expected to exceed the end target once the connections have
been completed and represents a major improvement in access to basic infrastructure services in
the target areas. The situation for the roads contract is similar, but the PDO indicator result for
the proportion of the population with access to an all season road (65%) is closer to the target
value of 75%. The lag in this result was due largely to a delay in completion of two civil works



3
  This number accounts for those people with access to an operating/commissioned system – with access through a
household connection or community water point.

                                                        16
contracts – which were also scheduled for completion in 2013. Once these contracts are
completed the reported results are also expected to exceed the target values.

68.      In summary, through the project activities under the electricity, water, road and ICT
components, the revised PDO indicators were substantially achieved, and as a result the project
activities led to a major improvement in access to basic infrastructure services in target areas.
As the final commissioning and use of some of the infrastructure is expected to be completed
with Government support in 2013, the full achievements identified in the restructured project will
be realized in the coming months.

3.3 Efficiency

Efficiency Rating: Substantial
69.      The efficiency of the project is rated substantial, reflecting the achievement of significant
results and with reasonable costs. Project costs remained largely within the restructured
allocations, focused towards achievement of the PDO. The period of implementation which
followed the completion of the comprehensive review and action plan was particularly efficient,
as efforts were focused and concentrated towards delivery of the infrastructure outputs within a
condensed implementation timeframe. The delay in completing the feasibility and designs
marginally affected the efficiency of the project – which is considered a minor short coming. The
six month extension granted4, to account for delays, slightly increased operational costs, but this
is considered to be within reasonable limits in comparison with other similar projects.

70.     The project investments, where possible, strategically utilized low cost technologies, to
maximize the potential impacts within the economic corridors with available resources. This was
particularly evident in the electricity, roads and water supply activities – where low cost solutions
were developed and applied in a number of market centers.

71.      The economic and financial analysis carried out at closure showed positive results
supporting the substantial efficiency rating for the project, – as shown in Annex 3 5 . The
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) estimates for the electricity component at completion (43.1%) is
higher than at appraisal (33.7%) – due to an increase in the tariffs at completion – demonstrating
that these investments are economically viable. For water supply the ERR value at completion
(1.2%) was significantly lower than at appraisal (16%) – due to the lower actual customer take up
at completion than originally planned given delays in commissioning the works. This figure is
expected to increase above the appraisal estimate as the systems are commissioned and
connections completed in 2013. Reports from the Government indicate that there is a high
demand for connections to the new water supply systems – which will increase the viability
beyond what was originally planned. Notably the ERR results at completion (54.7%) for the
roads component were significantly improved (12.4% at appraisal), due to an increase in the
number of users and efficient utilization of resources to maintain relatively low costs for the civil
works.

72.     The infrastructure works contracts, were all let out through competitive bidding processes
and bids were awarded to the lowest qualified and responsive bidders, as per the Bank procedures.
Costs were reviewed and considered to be reasonable in comparison with both the outputs and the

  The initial seven month extension granted to account for the delay in effectiveness did not significantly impact upon the
planned costs from the project.

  The economic and financial analysis at completion was carried out by an external consultant contracted by the MEPD as
part of the Borrowers Completion report. A summary of the findings is presented in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
73.      The overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory. This rating
reflects substantial, efficient achievement of relevant development objectives – particularly after
the project restructuring.

74.      The overall assessment considered the ratings against both the original and revised PDO
and weighs this assessment against the proportion of funds disbursed before and after the
restructure (as shown in Table 3)6.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Overall, the project had positive impacts on reducing poverty and improving social development
through increased access to services, such as water supply and sanitation. While there was
inadequate monitoring of gender impacts, it is expected that the primary beneficiaries of the water
supply and sanitation component will be women and girls. Benefits in other components were
shared (e.g. electricity and roads) and no effort was made to measure the distribution by gender.

  The overall outcome rating against the Original PDO is Moderately Unsatisfactory – which is a result of the combined
evaluation of substantial relevance, low efficacy and substantial efficiency. Against the Revised PDO, the project has
been rated Moderately Satisfactory as a result of substantial relevance, substantial efficacy, and substantial efficiency.
When combined and weighted, as shown in Table 3, the final overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory (when rounded to
the nearest whole number). This result is marginally above the line and because of the disbursement weightings, the late
restructuring keeps the rating only marginally in the Moderately Satisfactory range

                                                             18
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
75.     MEPD and the implementing entities benefitted through various institutional
strengthening and capacity building activities carried out through the project. This included
technical assistance and training programs. The project also helped to strengthen Government
sector coordination and integrated planning – one of the founding principles for supporting the
multi-sectoral approach. These activities are expected to have a longer term impact through
improved capacity and institutional development across agencies and within Government as a
whole.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
76.      The overall risk to development outcomes has been rated as Moderate.             The key
identified risks are discussed below.

77.      Water source constraints. It was noted during the closing review mission that two of the
water schemes may have water availability constraints at the source. Specifically, the mission
observed that sources of water at Chididi and Kambilonjo water supply schemes (river off takes)
had limited water availability during the dry season and as such abstraction quantities may not be
sufficient to meet demands. As such, measures need to be put in place to mitigate the potential
impacts and assure reliability of the water supply (e.g through supplementing the source),
particularly during the dry season.

78.     Continued road serviceability and maintenance. Due to limited funding towards
addressing the significant needs for road improvements in the 5 corridors, the project activities
were focused on critical sections of roads with the objective of achieving year round access
(including rainy season). Maintenance of these sections of road will be critical, and if not carried
out the use of these road corridors will be limited and connectivity impacts substantially reduced
during these periods. At this point it is noted that the Government has committed to ensure road
maintenance is a priority and these road sections will be prioritized in the implementation of the
road maintenance plans.

79.     Full realization of impacts through the electricity component. The capacity of ESCOM
to provide domestic connections was observed as a potential constraint to the full realization of
impacts of activities implemented under the electricity component. ESCOM's capacity to meet
the connection demands is critical, along with their ability to provide continuous, reliable supply.
This point relates predominantly to the planning and financial management systems of ESCOM,
which is a developing in its capacity to budget sufficient funds for generation and supply system
expansions to connect new consumers and improve reliability of supply

80.      Street lighting operations. Whilst it is a relatively small activity under the electricity
component. It was observed that street lights installed in the project market centers were often
not utilized / energized because the respective District Assemblies had not budgeted for the cost

                                                19
of electricity. Systems are to be put in place within these local authorities to ensure the effective
use of the street lights and realization of the intended associated impacts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
81.     The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry has been rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory, due to the significant short comings identified in project preparation and
appraisal.

82.     Lack of readiness at appraisal. As discussed earlier, the institutional arrangements were
not sufficiently clear for the water component and cost estimates were inaccurate as they were
based on preliminary feasibility studies. Furthermore, the economic and financial analysis did
not consider the combined impacts associated with the multi-sectoral approach and risk
assessment the monitoring and evaluation systems could have been further developed. In essence,
at appraisal and as approved, the project was not sufficiently ready for implementation and it was
unlikely from the onset to achieve the planned implementation schedule.

83.      Long preparation time. Despite the project not being ready at appraisal, the preparation
period was over 2.5 years, from Project Concept Note review (January 15, 2004), till Board
approval June 27, 2006. This assessment recognizes the complexities associated with the mulit-
sectoral project design, working in geographically disperse areas and the institutional capacity
constraints of the counterparts – but despite this however, the long preparation time is considered
to be a quality at entry issue – particularly with consideration of the lack of readiness at appraisal
and approval.

84.     The Bank’s internal QAG carried out an assessment of the quality at entry in 2007 and
rated the Bank’s performance as Moderately Satisfactory7. The QAG commended the region for
taking on difficult challenges and acknowledged the projects consistency and relevance towards
higher level objectives. Despite this however the QAG assessment identified some shortcomings
in project preparation, with the following key areas identified as needing improvement: (1)
premature board presentation resulting in weak implementation arrangements; (2) insufficiently
developed M&E arrangements and inadequately specified socio-economic outcomes; (3) no
diagnostic assessment of capacity gaps leading to unfocused training program, and (4)
fragmented managerial guidance due to multi-sectoral nature of the project. Despite these
shortcomings, QAG considered that such issues could be addressed and resolved during
implementation to enable satisfactory project outcomes. This ICR supports the findings of the
QAG assessment. However, the Quality at Entry Assessment rating presented herein, considers
with the benefit of hindsight, an increase in the significance of the identified short comings –
which results in a downgraded assessment rating to Moderately Unsatisfactory.




7
  The QAG identified the following aspects as strong elements of the project preparation: (1) sound selection of
geographical areas of intervention; (2) willingness to take well considered risks by bringing together four sectors; (3)
Government commitment and support; (4) promotion of low cost technologies to facilitate access to the poor; (5) reliance
on national sector agencies for implementation.



                                                           20
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
85.      The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. This rating considers two distinct phases of the project implementation
supervision: before and after the comprehensive review/restructuring which commenced in
February, 2010. Quality of supervision provided by the Bank for the period before this
restructuring had a number of significant short comings whilst the period during and after the
restructuring was characterized by strong, effective and consistent support from the Bank. The
combined evaluation of these two periods is considered to be Moderately Satisfactory.

86.    Notable weaknesses of the Bank’s supervision prior to the commencement of the
comprehensive review are as follows.
    Lack of Bank team continuity. From appraisal through to the commencement of the
       comprehensive review, the project was led by 4 different Task Team Leaders and the
       sector specialist support was equally fragmented over this period. The Project was also
       transferred from its original unit at around mid-term and the last 2 TTLs were involved
       post-restructuring. As a result, the Bank’s role in providing overall guidance and
       specialist technical support was limited along with the ability to proactively identify and
       resolve threats to the achievement of the development outcomes.
    Infrequent implementation support and supervision. Further to the above, for a period
       of around 2 years (2008-2009), the implementation support and supervision provided was
       infrequent and not comprehensive. Over this period, there was limited on-the ground
       supervision from the TTL, and sector specialists carried out infrequent independent
       reviews. As a result, the Bank’s ability to provide overall strategic guidance and support,
       through this important period in the project was again substantially limited.

87.      The Banks quality of supervision improved substantially from the period in which the
comprehensive review commenced till project closure, with consistent, regular and effective
supervision provided. During this later period of project implementation, the Bank team
proactively identified and supported the Government to manage a number of challenges which
could have adversely affected the implementation of the project. Most notably, as discussed in
Section 2.2, through introducing foreign currency payments to the civil works contractors, during
the international currency reserve and fuel access crisis facing the country in 2011. In addition,
the Bank’s team provided guidance and specialist support in the technical fields related to each
component and was responsive and supportive to facilitate procurement, disbursements, and
physical progress more generally - during the condensed implementation schedule.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
88.     The project is inherently complex, attempting to address major development challenges
in severely underserved, geographically dispersed areas, within a setting which had substantial
risks. Furthermore, the multi-sectoral approach, adds a layer of complexity, related to the
planning and coordination of integrated sectoral activities. Within this context, sustained Bank
support is particularly important to support the Government and facilitate achievement of the
development outcomes. The effects of providing such support were clearly demonstrated from
early 2010 to project closure, over which time the Bank provided guidance through the review
and restructuring process and substantial results were achieved within a compressed
implementation period. As a number of issues were identified for the quality at entry and quality


                                               21
of supervision prior to the restructuring – as discussed above, the overall performance of the Bank
has been rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
89.      The Government was represented by the Ministry of Economic Planning and
Development (MEPD), the agency in charge of the overall project, including project design and
coordination of implementation across other agencies. The performance of MEPD has been rated
as Moderately Satisfactory, indicating that there were moderate shortcoming with respect to
their role in ensuring quality of preparation and implementation towards the achievement of
development outcomes.

90.     The identified strengths of the Governments performance include: (1) ownership and
commitment to achieving the development objectives both during preparation and throughout the
implementation. (2) Fiduciary aspects including compliance with financial management
procedures, governance, provision of counterpart funding, procurement and compliance with
covenants. (3) Overall coordination with the Implementing Entities, other Government agencies
including the sector Ministries and District Assemblies and relationships with other stakeholders
and the Bank. (4) Ensuring adequate transition arrangements are in place for the regular
operation of the project investments – particularly the water systems

91.     The main weaknesses, which are considered moderate shortcomings, in their performance
have been identified as follows; (1) Lack of readiness for implementation – including facilitating
the effective involvement of the implementing entities during project preparation; (2) lack of
familiarity and limitations in capacity to use Bank procedures; and (3) Delays in having the
monitoring and evaluation system set up and effectively used for the management of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
92.     This assessment considers the performance in aggregate terms of the six Implementing
Entities (IE) (ESCOM, MACRA, NRA, SRWB, CRWB and NRWB) responsible for
implementing their respective activities under each component of the project. It is acknowledged
that some of the Implementing Entities performed better than others. However, this discussion
focuses on common identified strengths and weaknesses to arrive at the overall rating.

93.     The performance of the Implementing Entities has been rated as Moderately
Satisfactory, indicating that there were moderate shortcomings. Key strengths and weaknesses
(or shortcomings), with respect to the criteria for assessment, are identified and discussed below.
94.     Key strengths include: (1) commitment to achieving the development objectives,
demonstrated through the ability to overcome the challenges of design and implementation of a
wide range of activities scattered across the 30 market centers in the 5 growth corridors. (2)
Fiduciary aspects including compliance with financial management procedures, governance,
provision of counterpart funding, procurement and compliance with covenants. (3) Coordination
with the other IE’s – represented by a number of cases in which activities were successfully
coordinated between the sectors (particularly the road, power and water investments). (4)
Adequate reporting and relationships with MEPD, the Bank and other stakeholders. (5) Ensuring


                                                22
adequate transition arrangements are in place for the regular operation and maintenance of the
project investments.

95.       The main weaknesses, are as follows. (1) Ownership of the project activities –
particularly during the first 1-2 years of implementation. As discussed earlier, this would have
been enhanced through greater involvement and assignment of responsibilities during project
preparation. (2) Monitoring and supervision limitations, particularly in the water sector. (3)
Compliance with environmental and social safeguards – which was an issues noted during the last
supervision mission, as discussed previously which was promptly rectified by the implementing
entities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
96.     The overall performance of the Government and the Implementing Entities has been rated
as Moderately Satisfactory which considers the substantial strengths and moderate shortcomings
discussed above, to ensure quality of preparation and implementation, and compliance with
covenants and agreements, toward achievement of the development outcomes.

6. Lessons Learned

97.      Readiness for implementation at approval is critical for achievement of planned
implementation schedules. The Malawi Infrastructure Services Project faced significant
implementation challenges due largely to quality at entry issues – affecting readiness for
implementation at approval. As a result, significant amount of time was utilized to define the
specific activities to be implemented, during project implementation, within the available budget.
Ultimately restructuring was required to rationalize necessary modifications to the original
project design.

98.     Institutional arrangements are particularly important for successful project design and
implementation. The selection of implementing entities should be consistent with Government
mandates, and responsibilities need to be clearly articulated in project agreements. Furthermore,
the involvement of the implementing entities during project preparation can benefit the project
through enhancing their capacity and readiness for implementation, improving technical designs,
sector coordination and can enhance ownership and sustainability.

99.      Implementation of multi-sectoral projects require strong and effective coordination by
Government at a range of levels. The design and implementation of this project involved several
sectors for investments in geographically dispersed locations. Strong management and
coordination at different levels with the Government was required to ensure effective planning,
integration and facilitation of the project activities.

100.     The Bank’s performance during preparation and implementation is critically
important towards achievement of development outcomes, particularly for projects set in
weaker institutional environments and for multi-sectoral works. The project experience has
demonstrated that strong implementation support and supervision from the Bank can help to
facilitate project progress through the timely identification and resolution of issues and through
the provision of technical guidance. This is considered particularly important for multi-sectoral
project and with implementing entities which are not experienced with the implementation of
Bank financed projects.



                                               23
101.    Timely and thorough mid-term reviews and restructuring are important to the
achievement of development outcomes and performance ratings. Progress towards achievement
of the PDO was facilitated by an important midterm review and subsequent restructuring – which
represented a major turning point in the project performance.

102.     Well defined internal Bank systems are required for effective support to multi-sectoral
projects. The Bank’s internal systems to support preparation and supervision of multi-sectoral
projects should facilitate the provision of sector specialist inputs and cohesive coordination and
management. Furthermore, it is important that the approach for multi-sector projects ensure
adequate resources are allocated, inputs are prioritized and that there is clear ownership over the
project.

103.    Further analytical work would strengthen and support the contextual appropriateness
and benefits associated with the multi-sectoral approach and role of local governments in the
delivery of services. The multi-sectoral approach can provide substantial benefits through
optimization of synergies, improved integration and sectoral coordination, and magnified benefits
through simultaneous provision of multi-sectoral services. However, further analytical work
could benefit future projects through analyzing the potential benefits and pitfalls and contextual
appropriateness for adopting a multi-sectoral approach and mechanisms to enhance the role of
local governments – which can play an increasingly pivotal role in the delivery of services.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A summary of the outputs per component is provided in the following sections:

Electrification
This component brought electricity to the businesses, public institutions, and inhabitants in 26
market centers. It involved financing construction of power lines connecting market centers to
the national grid as well as transformers, poles, low -voltage distribution networks and consumer
meters. Also, the component supported the use of low- cost distribution technologies. The
component also provided public lighting in the market centers, which is expected to extend
benefits of electrification to people who will not receive household connections. A number of
schools and clinics in the market centers and other social public institutions were connected under
the project. In project areas where electricity distribution lines already existed, the project
activities involved upgrading the distribution network through the installation of transformers and
other equipment necessary to meet increases in demand. Furthermore, the component financed
the design and supervision assistance for ESCOM and training in cost-saving electrification
technologies.

A summary of the key outputs under this component in each of the 5 project corridors is below.

Information and communication technology (ICT)
This component provided subsidies to improve access to telecommunications and information
services in the project areas. Specifically, this included the expansion of the telephone network
and access to public payphones and internet services. Specific outputs under this component are
as follows.

       Establishment of 10 Public Internet Access Centers (PIACs).
       Established 1274 public payphones in the targeted 10 districts.

Water supply and sanitation
The project financed the establishment of a water association to oversee the water supply systems
and a local utility operator to handle routine operations and maintenance, plus construction of a
water supply scheme serving 10 market centers. In addition, schools, clinics and other social
institutions were provided with water and sanitation services.

Whilst the specific design configurations differed in each market center depending upon the
source and demand requirements, the physical outputs under this component included the
construction of the following:

       Water production boreholes;
       Intake facilities;
       Treatment systems;
       Storage / distribution reservoirs;
       Pump stations;
       Transmission pipelines;
       Distribution pipelines;
       Community water points;
       Household connections (including meters);
       Construction of an office for the WUA and LUO.
       Market sanitation facilities.

Roads
The road component financed the rehabilitation of secondary and tertiary roads and the
construction of feeder roads to improve transportation accessibility to and from the project
corridors in general and the market centers in particular. Major pavement and realignments were
not included, in order to avoid unnecessarily high standards that would affect cost. The
rehabilitation work entailed spot improvements, including sectional re-gravelling,
strengthening/replacing drainage structures, provision of additional drainage, and minor
adjustment to road widths if necessary. Periodic maintenance also formed part of the component.

                                                27
These activities included resealing, resurfacing, re-gravelling, and strengthening of base material
using design standards for low volume roads. Furthermore, the component financed activities to:
(a) support the establishment of community contractors; (b) put into place adequate contract
arrangements and payment systems; (c) provide on-the-job assistance/training on technical, work
organization, financial management and accounting, and business administration skills; and (d)
supervise and monitor the activities to ensure smooth implementation of the maintenance
program.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

An updated economic and financial analysis was prepared at closure by a consultant contracted to
MEPD. A summary of the analysis and findings is presented below.

Overview

Economic and Financial analysis was conducted for the project during preparation as well as
towards implementation closure. During preparation, a preliminary economic and financial
analysis was done before the actual designs of the various sub-projects and it covered three
components namely electrification, water and sanitation and roads, leaving out ICT. The analysis
did not cover ICT because the component was planned to finance investments that would be
proposed by the private sector during the course of the project’s execution. The economic and
financial analysis was therefore conducted again in order to determine the viability of the project
at closure and address some of the shortfalls in the preliminary analysis based on some
assumptions.

Approach

Both the preliminary and ex-post economic and financial analyses were based on cost-benefit
analysis comparing two scenarios where one is ‘with project’ and the other ‘without project’. The
analyses were based on the calculated Net Present Values (NPV) and Internal Rates of Return
(IRR). The preliminary analysis used discount rates of 10%, 12% and 15% while the ex-post
analysis used discount rates of 20%, 25% and 30% given changes in the financial market. The
current discount rate stands at 25%, and it therefore justified the adjustment to take into account
the opportunity cost of resources. Following this adjustment, the discount rates (social discount)
used in the ex-post economic analysis were doubled to 10%, 16% and 20% from 5%, 8% and
10%. Both analyses used the same Benefit Scale Factors (BSF) of 5 for water, 5 for electricity,
1.5 for telecommunications and 8 for roads. The preliminary economic and financial analysis
showed that the net benefit of the project ranged between US$4.3 million and US$19.5 million
with internal economic rates of return ranging from about 12-34. In aggregate terms, the IERRs
for the components in each sector exceeded the bank hurdle of 10% indicating the investments
were economically viable.

Financial and Economic Analysis Summary by Components

Electricity

The financial and economic analysis of electricity investments under the infrastructure services
project is presented in the table below. About US$2.5 million has so far been invested in the
component. With respect to the financial analysis, the number of connections to electricity is low
leading to negative Net Present Values for the project but positive NPV if we consider revenues
and operational costs streams only. At a discount rate of 25%, the NPV for the project is US$-1.5
million but if we only focus revenues less operational costs we obtain US$0.35 million. The
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 3.5% is obtained for investments in electricity, and this rate is
much lower than the current bank discount rate in Malawi.

The economic analysis shows that the investments in electricity are socially viable with positive
economic NPVs at all social discount rates. At a social discount rate of 16%, we obtain an
economic NPV of US$4.2 million, resulting in a positive social return. The Economic Internal
Rate of Return (EIRR) of 43.1% is obtained for investments in electricity which is higher than
33.7% obtained at the project appraisal stage. One contributing factor to the increase is the higher

                                                30
connection fee rate and tariff rates assumed in the analysis given the introduction of new tariffs in
2012.

Table A3.1: Economic and financial analysis for electricity investments




Water Supply

The financial and economic viability of water supply investments in the 10 market centers in the
four corridors is presented in the table below. These market centers have benefited from water
supply investment amounting to US$8.158 million in total. The original allocation to the water
sector was US$8.98 million, but more resources have been invested in the ten centers. However,
the demand projections are less optimistic than assumed in the feasibility studies.

The financial analysis shows that the investments in water supply are not financially viable at all
the discount rates used in the analysis. Negative NPVs are obtained throughout, and at 25%
discount rate we obtain a negative NPV of US$-3.817 million. The IRR is also negative,
indicating that overall the project is not financially viable. The economic analysis also shows
negative economic NPVs but a positive EIRR of 1.2% which is much lower. In contrast, at
project appraisal stage an EIRR of 16% was obtained for water investments. The poor
performance of the water supply investments are due to low customer base for water relative to
the size of the investments. In addition, the services were only complete at one market center out
of the 10 centers with water investments, such that most of the benefits to consumers are likely to
commerce in 2013.




                                                      31
Table A3.2: Economic and financial analysis for water investments




Roads

Road investments have been made in all the five corridors. A total of US$14.5 million has been
invested on 79.4 kilometers of roads translating into US$0.182 million per kilometer. The total
road length invested is only 16% of the planned road investments. It also turns out that the
planned cost of the planned 500 km road investments was US$16.3 million (World Bank, 2006).
One contributing factor for the high cost of road investments is the delay in the implementation.
These road investments were undertaken in 2011 and 2012 and the benefits may have started
being felt in 2012.

As shown in the table below, the financial and economic analysis for road projects under the ISP
using both the revised discount rates and the discount rates used in the feasibility study. The
financial analysis shows negative NPVs both at the revised and feasibility study discount rates.
The IRR of 3.9% is obtained and this is less than the lowest discount rate used in the analysis.
The economic analysis, however, shows that the road investments are socially viable with
positive economic NPVs and an EIRR of 54.7% which is above the discount rates used in the
analysis. According to World Bank (2006) an EIRR of 12.4% was obtained for road investments.
The improvements in EIRR is partly due to improved traffic as a result of improved road
conditions in some of the corridors and other roads such as in the Zomba – Phalombe – Mulanje,
the Karonga-Chitipa road linking the Rumphi-Nyika-Chitipa corridor and the in-land port
developments in the Bangula-Tengani-Nsanje-Makoko corridor.

Table A3.3: Economic and financial analysis for road investments




ICT

The total investment for the provision of ICT facilities is US$1.17 million. This investment is
91% of the planned investments of US$1.28 million in ICT as per project appraisal (World Bank,
2006).The financial analysis shows positive NPVs at different discount rates, indicating that these
investments are financially viable. This aggregate picture is a result of high positive NPVs from
public internet access and negative NPVs from public pay phone investments. At a discount rate
of 25%, we obtain NPV of US$368,302. Overall, the investments in ICT entail an IRR of 38%
which is much higher than the current bank discount rate. The economic analysis also shows that
ICT investments are economically viable with a positive economic NPV of US$1.97 million at
16% social discount rate and an overall EIRR of 58.4%.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

During appraisal, Malawi had infrastructure challenges as part of the constraints to economic
growth and household welfare. These include low access to services; high cost of services and
low level of service maintenance and reliability.

With respect to low access to services, 85% of the Malawi population lived in rural areas where
less than 1% had access to electricity. Most institutions and businesses had inadequate water
supply and only 60% of the rural households had access to potable water that was taking over 2
hours per day for a household to collect. 13% of the rural road access was in good condition and
telephone penetration was at 0.3 per 100 people, below the average of 0.5 per 100 people for Sub-
Saharan Africa.

Malawi lacked access to enough electricity resulting into high costs of doing business as this
required use of diesel/ petrol powered electricity generators. The lack of adequate water supply
resulted in people buying water in small quantities at very high cost from vendors. Furthermore
the costs for internal transportation were two to three times more than those of the neighbouring
countries. In addition there were high costs and long waiting periods for internet connectivity as
well as mobile communication.

The lack of maintenance for the little infrastructure available also affected reliability in all the
four components of electrification, ICT, water supply and sanitation and roads.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The development objective of the project was to improve household welfare and strengthen
economic growth in market centers and surrounding rural areas through the provision of core
infrastructure services. Key indicators were establishment to measure the progress and
achievement of the development objective.

1.3 Original Project Development Objectives, Key Indicators and Reasons / Justifcation

The revised PDO is ‘to improve access to basic infrastructure services in target areas’. The
revision of the PDO was done due to the reduction in scope of interventions necessitated by the
realization that the available resources would not suffice to attain the original scope of the project.
The key indicators and targets were also revised to reflect changes to the PDO and scope
modifications.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project was intended to mainly benefit the population at the market centers. It was also meant
to benefit the population in immediate catchment area of the market centers who frequent the
center to access essential goods and services. The project investments have catalysed investments
in agriculture production, agro-processing, tourism and other commercial activities. Provision of
social services such as health and education has improved since school buildings and clinics have
been connected to electricity and water. Investments in roads will benefit the communities
through reduced transport costs and improved road linkage connecting the isolated market centers


                                                  36
to nearby centers and towns. The communities would also access potable water, thereby reducing
the incidence of water-borne diseases.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component A: Electrification (US$4.7 million). The project would finance the extension of
power lines and equipment required to connect new consumers to electricity supply, including
distribution lines and transformers.

Component B: ICT (US$l.5 million). Project funds would cover the provision of subsidies
needed under an output-based aid (OBA) scheme to improve access to telecommunications and
information services in the project areas. The project would provide Internet access and ICT
services by establishing small-scale multipurpose community tele-centers in the project areas.

Component C: Water Supply and Sanitation (US$9.9 million). This component would
finance the establishment of a WUA to oversee each system, and a local utility operator to handle
routine operations and maintenance, besides construction of a water supply scheme serving each
market center.

Component D: Roads (US$16.5 million). This component would finance the rehabilitation of
secondary and tertiary roads and the construction of feeder roads to improve intra and inter
market center accessibility in the project corridors.

Component E: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$3.15 million). This
component would provide technical assistance and training support including environmental
training to the various governmental agencies and the private sector engaged in infrastructure
service delivery.

1.6 Revised Components

While the project components were not revised, the scope in all but the ICT component was
reduced to match the available funds.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

The project completion date was extended twice from the planned completion date of 30th
November, 2011. The first extension was granted up to 30th June, 2012 (seven months) to cater
for delay in effectiveness, adjustment in scope of works; implementation schedule and improve
the likelihood of project completion. The second extension to 31st December, 2012 (six months),
was granted to accommodate the completion of ongoing works contracts.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality in the Project Preparation

The Infrastructure Services Project (ISP) was prepared to contribute to the MGDS overall
objective of reducing poverty through sustained economic growth and infrastructure development.
Preparing this multi-sectoral project took two years due its complexity and lack of past
experience in similar projects by the preparation team. Previous Bank-financed projects were
focusing on development of one sector but this project was being prepared on the premise of
packaging four basics infrastructure services to address varying needs of the districts of the five
economic growth corridors.

                                               37
Project preparation benefitted from a number of studies conducted to identify and prioritize the
intervention areas. The nine identified economic corridors were reduced to five most viable. It is
these five that were selected and costed for project interventions.

Communities along the five targeted project areas were sensitized and their roles in all stages of
the project were clearly defined. While this was done to ensure necessary support is gained, it
also raised community expectations on the project deliverables in all the components.

Preparation of the ISP was done with strong Government commitment and support to project
preparation activities such as the establishment of Project Management Unit (PMU) as well as
facilitation of various project preparation studies. The Bank’s experience with projects in water,
roads and private sector development also contributed to the success of designing a multi-sectoral
but achievable project.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was highly relevant, focusing on provision core
infrastructure services in order to improve household welfare and strengthen economic growth in
market centers and surrounding rural areas. In order to achieve this objective the project directly
financed coordinated priority investments in roads, water supply and sanitation, electricity and
telecommunications within corridors with economic growth potential; and assisted the
Government of Malawi in developing a coordinated approach to planning and implementing
infrastructure development in these areas.

The project’s institutional arrangement had a number of players participating at different levels.
These had varying, interests, incentives and therefore attached different priorities to project’s
activities. For instance ESCOM, on one extreme had an interest in increasing the distribution
network and prospects for increased revenue while the Regional Water Boards, on the other
extreme, were establishing water schemes which they would neither own nor operate. The
designation of MEPD for providing overall project leadership ensured that there is convergence
of effort for successful implementation of the project.

2.2 Implementation

The project implementation encountered challenges with regard to project cost escalations,
shortage of foreign exchange and fuel, performance of consultants and contractors. Furthermore,
the fact that the project is multi-sectoral in nature brought about coordination challenges on the
part of the Government, particularly with respect to coordinating engagement of the consultancy
works in the project. These problems were handled proactively by the Government of Malawi and
the Bank teams in a manner that ensured achievement of project outcomes.

Carrying out designs during implementation phase. Actual implementation of the project had
been affected by the decision to carry out designs during the implementation phase of the project.
In an ideal situation the designs were supposed to be concluded during the project preparation
phase.

Design consultants delays. Delays in completing the designs and production of sub-standard
work meant in some cases that designs had to be redone.

Suspension of award of No Objection for project’s procurement activities. Whilst carrying
out the comprehensive review process the Bank suspended approvals of all works-related project
activities.



                                                38
Project cost escalations. Delays in implementation had coincided with escalations of materials
costs resulting into a general underestimation of the project components costs. The feasibility
study also did not take into account Government taxes on the consultancy works which in the
process took up more resources than envisaged at the appraisal stage of the project. In view of the
above, it was apparent that the Government would not achieve all the intended objectives of the
project. Based on the consultants’ estimates, implementation of full scope of works of the project
as planned in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was not feasible. The full scope of works
would require US$75 million which is much higher than the approved grant. Owing to the above,
the Government strategically re-prioritized the scope of works to be within the available
resources.

Shortage of foreign exchange and fuel. In the course of implementation of the project, the
country experienced long spells of foreign exchange shortage which further resulted into
shortages of fuel (diesel and petrol), machinery spare parts and construction materials. This
slowed progress of construction works.

Consultants and contractors performance.            Inadequate capacities of contractors and
consultants at times impacted project implementation.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The results indicators in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) focused on the key elements of
the original PDO which related to improved household welfare and strengthened economic
growth. In the light of project restructuring, the PDO was revised to focus on provision of basic
infrastructure services to the project targeted areas and this led to revision of the results indicators.
In recognition of the need for strengthening its coordination of the project, MEPD developed a
progress monitoring strategy and guidelines to assist the project in meeting its goals and
objectives. The Monitoring and Evaluation division of MEPD developed an M & E framework to
facilitate data collection, aggregation and analysis.

The project was implemented with concerted efforts by all stakeholders. Through oversight
provided by the project’s Steering Committee, regular monitoring and reviews were conducted to
ensure achievement of results. The project restructuring in October 2010 brought significant
changes to the M & E framework that were discussed with all the implementing entities and Bank.
M & E data was collected and consolidated by the Project Management Unit (PMU) and
regularly shared with the Bank through the implementation status and quarterly Financial
Managements Reports (FMRSs).

The M&E framework assisted in informing implementation in several ways: (1) As indicated in
the results framework in annex 9, the project disaggregated some indicators to enable tracking of
impact of different types of infrastructure. (2) The regular World Bank supervision missions and
Video Conferences (VCs) were timely and instructive. (3) The high sub-projects costs compared
to PAD budget were analyzed and a significant reduction in project interventions was proposed to
match the available funds and indicators adjusted to realistic targets. (4) Most of the indicators
developed for the project, such as number of new connections in the established water schemes
will continue to be useful in the post project completion period in tracking performance of WUAs
both in terms of customer base and revenue collected to ensure sustainability.

2.3 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance was rated moderately unsatisfactory in the latest World Bank Supervision
Mission (November 2012) due to failure to reinstate burrow pits on some of the roads projects

                                                  39
and outstanding compensation including lack of supporting documentation for land voluntarily
offered for the project’s work.

At the time of compiling this report, the project had finalized compilation of list of PAPs and
payment of compensation had been effected. Most of the burrow pits had been reinstated and
documentation of land transfers prepared.

Financial Management is rated satisfactory. The rating is attributed to timely submission of
financial management reports, audit reports and project’s compliance to WB Financial guidelines.
Procurement is rated satisfactory. Projects procurement processes improved over the course of the
project leading to engagement of contractors to undertake proposed construction works in all the
components along the targeted project corridors.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase Operation and Maintenance Arrangements

All interventions under this project were designed to be self-sustaining in the post completion
operation period. The ISP, being a pilot project on addressing infrastructural bottlenecks to
economic growth, has set the foundation for the continued support to the implementation of the
MGDS.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The ISP objectives were highly relevant and in line with the MGDS objectives. One of the nine
key priority areas of the MGDS is Integrated Rural Development, which the ISP was designed to
deliver. The project was designed to provide good access to water and sanitation, electricity,
telecommunications and roads in market centers along the five development corridors. In the past,
the type of infrastructure services provided by the project were either none existent, inadequate or
in poor state. Road infrastructure in most parts was in a bad state and posed serious challenges to
movement of goods. The main sources of water were boreholes, streams and shallow wells which,
in most cases, had water of poor quality. Lack of electricity along these corridors affected
economic activity and the delivery of social services such as education and health. The project
pursued an integrated approach whereby all the four components would be implemented at the
identified market centers. It was envisaged that upon implementation, the project would go a long
way in solving some of the socio-economic needs and challenges that were identified and, in the
process, accord people in the market centers access to passable roads, portable water, electricity
and ICT services. This was therefore going to translate into improved well-being and livelihoods
of people in these areas.

The project design continued to be relevant throughout project implementation. Use of ESCOM
for implementation of the electricity component, the three regional water boards for water and
sanitation, Roads Authority for road infrastructure and MACRA for the ICT, enhanced efficiency
of project implementation. These implementing entities were tasked with management of
contracts under their respective components. The ministries responsible for energy, water, roads
and ICT provided oversight to these entities. Apart from enhancing implementation efficiency,
this arrangement also ensured continued alignment of project interventions to sectoral strategies
and policies.

In the course of implementation, appropriate adjustments were made for continued relevance of
the project. For example, interventions in electricity were harmonized and/or complemented with
those of another ongoing programme, the Malawi Rural Electrification Programme (MAREP).

                                                40
Similar adjustments were made for the water component based on timely information on pipeline
interventions by other partners in the water sector. On the contrary, the payphone sub-component
of the ICT component faced a relevance challenge as, in the course of project implementation,
mobile handsets became more readily available, thereby reducing the demand for this service.
However, the Public Internet Access Centers (PIACs) continued to be relevant throughout project
implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Despite reduction in scope, late commencement of works and other challenges, achievement of
project objectives was satisfactory as the project met or surpassed some of its targets. The
institutional arrangement and partnerships were crucial to the attainment of project results.
Project coordination by MEPD provided good interaction between the implementing entities, the
Bank, stakeholders and the PMU. The engagement of service providers in the various
components was key to attainment of the various project objectives and results. Their
involvement gave the project an opportunity to build on the existing structures for realization of
results. In the roads component, the Roads Authority (RA) engaged consultants and contractors.
The consultants programmed and supervised works done by contractors, whereas the RA and the
Roads Department in Ministry of Transport, provided quality oversight. In the water component,
the water boards engaged contractors to do the water installation. The water boards supervised,
certified the works and provided training to WUAs. This was the best option for implementing
such highly technical works in order to achieve set outputs. The public pay phones sub-
component of the ICT component did not perform as expected because it had programming
challenges. As mentioned earlier, the introduction of public payphones coincided with the
emergence of cheaper phones and affordable airtime as such they were not being used as
expected.

At national level, the implementation of this project contributed to the attainment of the MGDS
objectives and MDGs targets. In particular, implementation of the project, among other things,
contributed to the achievement of Integrated Rural Development objectives, one of the key
priority areas. Once all the components are finalized, the project will also contribute to the
attainment of some of the MDGs which include MDG 1 (eradicating extreme poverty and hunger),
MDG 7 (ensure environmental sustainability) and MDG 8 (develop global partnership for
development).

3.3 Efficiency

The efficiency of the project is assessed on the basis of the results achieved with the amount of
resources consumed (input/output). This is rated as moderately satisfactory. The total cost for
the project was based on estimates made in 2006. However due to delayed implementation of the
project, coupled by increasing costs, funding was not adequate to meet the total anticipated scope
of works. This led to reduction in scope and hence affected implementation of the project
components. Time efficiency was also an issue for the ISP. Fuel and foreign exchange scarcity
slowed the pace of implementation and hence delivery of results. There was also low
disbursement of funds at the beginning of the project due to delays in commencement of works.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The project is rated satisfactory because it managed to achieve its objectives despite the reduced
scope and the challenges it faced. The objective of the project within the reduced scope was
relevant and in line with the objectives of the MGDS and the attainment of some of the MDGs.

                                               41
The project would have scored higher if it was not for some of the challenges that led to some
delays and thus had some effect on the efficiency of the project.

3.5 Overarching themes, other outcomes and impacts
Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

Despite the reduced scope of the project, there are likely impacts that will emanate from the
implementation of this project and these include: Increased income levels as a result of increased
business activities due to the installation of electricity and improved road network within project
areas; Reduced rural-urban migration within the project areas due to increased/improved
provision of basic social amenities right in the rural areas; Enhanced security due to the
installation of streetlights; Increased pass rates in schools due to electricity connection; Enhanced
health service delivery in clinics within the corridors that have been connected to electricity;
Improved access to social amenities and markets due to improvement in the road network;
Reduced prevalence of water borne diseases due to improved access to potable water; Improved
staff retention in schools, clinics and other public institutions as a result of improved access to
services and goods; and Enhanced capacity of community contractors to maintain and rehabilitate
roads and water facilities project areas.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The realization of development outcomes expected faces some risks. The overall rating of risk to
development outcomes is moderate. The specific risks are assessed as follows:

The risk that partial construction of roads will lead to high maintenance costs and
deterioration of road condition. Results of the project’s impact evaluation study (Wadonda
Consult, 2012) show that roads in some treated centers may not be passable for one month in a
year. This is attributed to the spot improvement approach adopted by the project that omitted
some other potentially difficult sections due to budget constraints. Furthermore, the treatment of
stretches at market centers with low volume seal may not be sustainable due to projected
increased volumes of traffic. This kind of road finish will therefore call for frequent and routine
maintenance, resulting in high maintenance costs that could further strain the roads allocation in
the national budget. This risk is rated high.

The risk of vandalism of provided infrastructure by the community. Vandalism of project
infrastructure might minimize intended development outcomes of the project. Vandals may
include frustrated individuals who feel they do not own the project, thieves and resentful people
from non-benefiting communities around a benefitting market center. The project, however,
solicited community commitment that has facilitated the institutionalization of local management
structures that will ensure that facilities are protected. This risk is therefore rated low.

The risk of failure to meet operational costs. In electricity, there is risk that the local councils
may not sustain street lighting. Councils are expected to use market fees to service the street
lights (payment of electricity bills). The sustainability of paying for street lighting depends on
properties available, types of services that are being offered as well as the level of economic
activities in the market centers. District councils have, nonetheless, committed to incorporate
street lighting bills in their annual recurrent budgets. This risk is rated moderate.

The risk of non-payment and under collection of utility bills. The inability to sustain
provision of services could be compounded by non-payment and under-collection of utility bills
especially in the water component. There are some indications that the WUAs may, in the initial
months of operating the schemes, face challenges in revenue collection. The beneficiary survey,

                                                 42
however, indicates that the beneficiaries are aware of the need to pay for these services and
expressed their readiness to pay if these services are made available. In this regard, the provision
of backstopping services to WUAs Associations by the Regional Water Boards shall be critical in
the early stages. This risk is rated low.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

During the design phase of the project, the Bank facilitated a participatory process that led to
submission of all required documents to the World Bank Board for approval. The Bank’s project
team was composed of well trained personnel who, with the Borrower’s team, were able to
review and agree on proposed project concepts, preliminary designs and expected outputs.
Through the commitment of the Bank team, the documents were submitted to the Bank’s Board
and the project was approved on time.

Since the inception of the project, the Bank’s coordination of the project has been passed to
various Task Team Leaders (TTLs) with varying perceptions of project activities. In addition,
whilst there was a consistent availability of sector specialists during the preparation of the project,
there was little guidance from these experts in the implementation phase of the project. The Bank
had opted for independent consultants who in some cases also held views not in line with the
agreed concepts and approaches. This resulted in delays and increased costs as consultants had to
redo their work several times and clients had to do multiple reviews of the designs. Notably is the
concept of Low Volume Sealed Roads (LVSR) on which later Bank commissioned consultants
had negative perceptions. The LVSR roads have been built and accepted in many parts of Malawi
and the concept was approved during the appraisal mission but it kept on getting condemnation
from Bank’s review comments on roads.

The Bank was able to competently undertake supervision missions to review progress on agreed
action plans and provided guidance on implementation arrangements and compliance with the
Banks requirements.

The overreliance on video conferencing and submitted documents between 2008 and 2009,
however, did not provide a good platform for effective supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The rating of overall Borrower performance is based on the ratings for each of the two
dimensions: (i) Government performance; and (ii) implementation Entities performance.

The Government’s performance is rated satisfactory because of the commitment demonstrated by
Government to achieve the PDO. Despite deferred declaration of project effectiveness, GoM
maintained its commitment to the project by providing its counterpart funding to sustain some of
the project activities. Government equipped the implementing entities with the necessary tools
in terms of political support and empowerment to implement the project and complied with its
commitments as per the Financing Agreement. Notably, throughout the project there was no
violation of both procurement and financial guidelines to stop funds disbursement.

Overall performance of implementing entities is rated satisfactory. Performance would have been
higher if it were not for two entities in the water and sanitation component which did not provide

                                                  43
adequate oversight on contractors and failed to follow up on work progress. Poor supervision of
construction consultants by these entities was also evident.

6.      Lessons Learnt

The Government of Malawi draws a number of lessons from the project. The following have been
singled out as key in informing future programming of similar investments:

Design Issues and project quality at entry. The ISP was a packaging of investments
implemented simultaneously to unlock the economic potential and ultimately work to reduce
poverty. This is considered by most stakeholders as a very sure way of meaningfully impacting
on poverty unlike where investments come without complementing efforts providing synergies
for optimal outcomes. An integrated approach to rural development adopted in the design and
followed during the project implementation has been very instrumental in uplifting the lives of
people in project corridors. The Project presents an innovative model for implementing multi-
sectoral projects in Market Centers. Whereas the reduced scope meant that the components were
not implemented in the market centers as a full package, implementation of two or three
components in a market center has, nevertheless, led to improvement in the livelihoods of people
and is likely to lead to desired impacts within the medium to long term period.

Timely implementation of project activities helps in efficient delivery of results. The lag
between project preparation and implementation affected project implementation through
increased costs and outdated designs. It is noted that if there are large time lags (of two years and
more) between project design and implementation, the plan does not become an appropriate
blueprint to guide implementation. Due to late start of project implementation coupled by
increasing costs, funding was not adequate to meet the total anticipated scope of works. Given the
cost constraint, this resulted in reduced scope. The project experienced delays partly because
some components had to be redesigned during implementation phase.

The beneficiary survey suggests that for maximum impact, the re-scoping of the project should
have reduced number of corridors rather than reducing the quality and magnitude of
works in all corridors. The project impacts on poverty may have been weakened partly as a
result of reduced scope in all the components and corridors.

Engagement of appropriate institutions with technical capabilities in an infrastructure
project is crucial to the attainment of desired results. The engagement of Implementing
Entities in the relevant components was key to attainment of the various project results. Their
involvement gave the project an opportunity to reap on the existing competencies and experience
for the success of the project.

Inadequate capacities of contractors and consultants had also contributed to the slow pace of
project implementation. It is observed that while working on the ISP project, some
contractors/consultants had multiple and concurrent assignments. Such contractors and
consultants did not meet scheduled deadlines and output targets and this led to compromised
output in some components. From this project’s experience it is suggested that the management
of contractors and consultants should be improved through close supervision and review of their
work besides strengthening contract management capabilities in the public sector. It is also
recommended that projects of this nature should be using multi-disciplinary consultants as
opposed to sector specific consultants as this helps in coordination of activities.

The involvement of local communities in the project, particularly through WUAs facilitated
a sense of ownership by the community and will ensure that the facilities are protected for

sustained benefits. Instilling a sense of ownership is key to the sustainability of project benefits.
The WUA concept has been pin-pointed as one of the success stories that brought a sense of
ownership to the community.

Project leadership management style. The management model was the right set-up to deliver
efficiently the projects outputs as it allowed the right institutions to implement the right
components. The arrangement allowed for use of the country’s technical competencies in its
various components for best results with a wholesome view of the project in mind. Project
coordination by MEPD provided good interaction between the implementing entities, donor,
stakeholders and the PMU.

Project outcome and need for projects next phase. Having brought water and electricity to the
rural market centers, the beneficiary survey and the consultative workshop clearly highlight that
demand for water and electricity in most of the centers surpassed the design estimates. This calls
for expansion of the capacities by ESCOM and the respective Water Users Associations for
electricity and water respectively to allow for growth of the market centers. In future
programming, the projected growth should be considered in the planned provision of
infrastructure.

ISP, being a pilot project on addressing infrastructural bottlenecks to economic growth, has set
the foundation for the continued support to the implementation of the MGDS. Under the proposed
phase 2 of the project, the Government wishes continue to engage and support the provision of
the basic infrastructure services to other selected economic corridors using the institutional
arrangement of the pilot phase while benefiting from lessons learnt.
