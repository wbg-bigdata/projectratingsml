F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the capacity of the Ministry of
Environment (MoE) to plan, implement and monitor an effective system of National Protected
Areas (NPAs). Toward that end, the project had two related immediate objectives:

        First, to develop and test proactive measures to minimize unsustainable exploitation and
        degradation of the biodiversity of national and global significance in the Virachey
        National Park (VNP).

        Second, to use the experiences gained from the VNP to formulate institutional models for
        the development of the National Protected Areas (NPAs) system of Cambodia.

Global Environment Objectives

The Global Environment Objective (GEO) was to assist the government to achieve sustainable
long-term utilization of its natural resources, especially its mountain forest ecosystems of regional
and global significance. In particular, the project aimed at developing an effective NPA system
based on a consistent and well articulated set of management, financial and institutional
procedures within a well functioning legal and regulatory framework. The project was to
contribute to higher order global environmental goals of biodiversity protection in one of the most
important remaining forest areas of South-East Asia, widely recognized for its conservation
importance.

                The VNP Management Plan was developed through a participatory process and
                implemented. Detailed Annual Operations Plans (AOPs) were prepared and
                implemented. A management plan up-date was planned toward the end of the project but
                was not completed. The VNP Protection Plan 2006 - 2008 is under implementation. The
                base-line does not reflect the management planning efforts of WWF which supported the
                VNP before the project.

Comments        Achievement: Moderately satisfactory.
                Overall, the incidence of illegal activities in the VNP appears to have declined by more
                than 30 percent based on Management Information System (MIST) data (2005-2007).
                Earlier data are deemed unreliable due to extensive falsification uncovered in 2005 (later
                addressed). The "moderately satisfactory" rating is linked to the short time series (due to
                falsification) and concerns with new road construction (which could facilitate access and
                illegal activities).

                Environmental awareness and education programs were developed and implemented
                nationally and locally.
                National programs included:
                     -    press releases in Khmer, English and French
                     -    project quarterly newsletter in Khmer and English
                     -    12 videos
                     -    Environmental education TV and radio spots of 45 seconds broadcast seven
                          times a day, four days a week for six months (June ­ December 2005)
                     -    Radio debate `People and Nature' for the same period
                     -    Three-part TV documentary (Heritage of our Ancestors) broadcast four times
                     -    National environmental drawing contest for primary and secondary schools with
                          324 participants, with a calendar made from the best drawings
                The impact of the national program was evaluated based on Phnom Penh high school
                audience only (methodology not robust).
                Local programs in the VNP (Siem Pang, Stung Treng, Veunsai, Taveng and Banlung
                districts) :
                     -    Environmental awareness visits in 21 pilot villages
                     -    Malva nut campaign video
                     -    Environmental protection video (Protecting Environment is Protecting Children)
                          in Brao language
                     -    Showings of documentary (Heritage of our Ancestors I - III)
                     -    13 environmental awareness information sheets
                     -    34 poster illustrations for environmental awareness
                     -    general environmental awareness poster
                     -    newsletters (Our Schools and Our Pagodas, Our Community)
                The impact of local programs was limited. Programs did not reach a large percentage of
                the target audience. A majority of the target audience developed only a superficial grasp
                of the issues. Messages sent out in the first half of the project were confused and
                inconsistent [Mid-Term Review - MTR)]

                 Three PRAs were completed in 2001, a report was prepared in 2002 and two additional
                 village case studies were conducted in 2003. Five Community Protected Areas (CPAs)
                 were identified with their boundaries mapped and CPA committees organized; four of the
                 CPAs were legally established and regulations approved; one of the CPAs with draft

                 There was a lack of coordination that led to a duplication of effort ­ the Ministry of
                 Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) has organized committees in the same
                 villages to manage natural resources outside of park boundaries. Limited use was made

                 Two livelihood programs (a Small Grants Program and an Ecotourism Program) worth
                 nearly US$100,000 were implemented. Disbursement was partly through government
                 decentralized structures.
                 Under the Small Grants Program:
                 Agriculture: about 60 farmers received a one-time grant of improved seed, tools or
                 production techniques.
                 Employment: About 30 villagers were employed as rangers and others as casual labor.
                 Under the Ecotourism Program:
                 Two communities received community-managed guesthouses; about 20 villagers are
                 occasional tourist guides and porters with total earnings of US$700 by mid-2006.
                 Anecdotal evidence suggests a wide appreciation by beneficiary communities but without
                 monitoring or quantitative assessment of impacts this is hard to verify.

1.     Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives, and Design

1.1.   Context at Appraisal

      1.1.1. The project context was determined by the principal role that natural resources play
      in driving Cambodia's rural economy and in providing livelihoods to a majority of its
      population. Recognizing the significance of natural resources, the 1997 Country Assistance
      Strategy (CAS) identified the sustainable use and management of natural resources as one
      of its key objectives. The CAS focused specifically on the need to support implementation
      of the 1997 National Environmental Action Plan, which identified protected areas
      management as an immediate priority. The 1997 CAS also focused attention on forestry
      sector reforms. This project was seen as complementary to Bank and other donor efforts to
      support forest sector reforms.

      1.1.2. Country Background. At the time of project preparation and appraisal in 1998-
      1999, the economic, social and institutional context in Cambodia was similar to that of the
      least developed countries. The income and socio-economic indicators were at the level of
      the 1960s, and the country was severely indebted, vulnerable to external shocks and
      suffering from internal governance problems. Eighty-five percent of the population was
      rural, the annual per capita income was the equivalent of about US$260, infant mortality
      was 110 per thousand births (twice as high as in other low income countries) and life
      expectancy was 52 years (ten years less than in other low income countries).

      1.1.3. Sector Background. Natural resources ­ land, forests, fisheries, mineral wealth
      and tourism potential ­ featured prominently in Cambodia's development prospects. At the
      same time, government capacity to manage these resources sustainably was limited. Illegal
      logging threatened the forests and was the primary environmental issue of the day.
      Resource conservation was chiefly donor-executed, uncoordinated, unaccountable to the
      MoE, and often implemented with the MoE playing only minor supporting role. The
      concern about the sustainable use of forest resources was linked to concerns about the
      management of PAs, particularly those with significant forests like the VNP.

      1.1.4. Project Background. Cambodia's PA system was recent ­ established only in
      1993 by a Royal Decree ­ and vast, encompassing 23 protected areas covering 18 percent
      of the country's land mass. Nearly one-third of communes lived either in or adjacent to
      protected areas. The PA system was, however, not well managed and suffered from the
      following issues:

(a) Weak Institutional Capacity. The agency responsible for PAs (the MoE) was weak, with a
broad mandate. It lacked the staff skilled in PA management. It also lacked a long-term vision,
laws, regulations and operating procedures for PA management. Similarly, considerable lack of
human, institutional and budgetary capacity existed at the provincial level and at the level of
individual PAs.

(b) Insufficient financing. The MoE annual budget covered chiefly (inadequate) staff salaries
and left little funding for operating expenses related to PA management. PA management
activities depended mainly on intermittent donor support.

(c) Outdated biodiversity data. The information about Cambodia's biodiversity was incomplete,
and dated to the 1960s except some preliminary biodiversity surveys in the VNP and other PAs.
It was not sufficient for informed PA management.



                                                  1

(d) Increasing pressures from improved access, forestry and land concessions and wildlife
trade. The end of the Khmer Rouge regime and clearing of land-mines improved security and
access to the PAs. Large logging and agro-forestry concessions increased pressure on the PAs
and their buffer zones. Finally, the profitable1 international wildlife trade and poaching continued
unabated.

1.2. Original Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

       1.2.1. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to improve the capacity of the
       Ministry of Environment (MoE) to plan, implement and monitor an effective system of
       National Protected Areas (NPAs). Toward that end, the project had two related immediate
       objectives:

         First, to develop and test proactive measures to minimize unsustainable exploitation and
         degradation of the biodiversity of national and global significance in the Virachey
         National Park (VNP).
         Second, to use the experiences gained from the VNP to formulate institutional models for
         the development of the NPAs system of Cambodia.

       1.2.2. An additional overarching objective presented in the main text of the Project
       Appraisal Document (PAD) was to improve the capacity of the MoE to plan, implement
       and monitor an effective system of NPAs. Annex 1 in the PAD included an objective
       related to minimizing illegal exploitation of the VNP consistent with (but not identical to)
       the first objective listed above.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

       1.2.3. For reasons that are not clear, the PAD included two versions of project
       performance indicators2 (one in the main text and one in the Results Framework). This
       Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) uses the indicators as presented in
       the Results Framework, since this version was used, with some modifications, for
       Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and Global Environment Facility (GEF) evaluation.

PDO indicators:

(1)    Results of organizational, finance and management studies are adopted and promoted
       widely within the MoE.

(2)    Management plan for the VNP based on community and stakeholder participation is
       produced and accepted.

(3)    Incidence of unplanned agricultural expansion, wildlife poaching, and illegal logging is
       reduced in the VNP.

Component 1 indicators:




1As noted in the PAD illegal wildlife trade was seen as a direct threat to biodiversity in Cambodia. Despite the
government's ban on poaching trade persisted and the sale of a single live tiger could could pay more than an average
annual income.

2See Annex 10 for a detailed comparison of the two versions of KPIs.



                                                          2

(4)   National leadership and ranger training programs are developed, tested and implemented.

.

(5)   All national organizational, sustainable finance, environmental decision support system,
      legal and regulatory reviews are completed and major recommendations accepted by the
      MoE.

(6)   PA management planning models are evaluated and adopted as national standards;

Component 2 indicators:

(7)   Patrolling systems in place and operational.

(8)   Organizational and management framework developed and implemented for the VNP.

(9)   Number of ranger training programs implemented.

(10) Boundary demarcation in key areas completed.

(11) Number and quality of awareness programs.

Component 3 indicators:

(12) Resource and social surveys are completed and fed into park and community planning
      process.

(13) PRA procedures are tested and understood by practitioners and communities.

(14) Number and quality of livelihood programs adopted.

Component 4 indicators:

(15) M&E systems developed, in place, and operational.

(16) Extent to which project activities are delayed due to funds release or availability of
      resources.

1.3.  Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

      1.3.1. In addition to the PDO, the PAD also presented a GEO associated with GEF co-
      financing. The GEO was to assist the government to achieve sustainable long-term
      utilization of its natural resources, especially its mountain forest ecosystems of regional and
      global significance. In particular, the project aimed at developing an effective national
      protected areas system based on a consistent and well-articulated set of management,
      financial and institutional procedures within a well-functioning legal and regulatory
      framework. The project was to contribute to global environmental goals of biodiversity
      protection in one of the most important remaining forest areas of South-East Asia, widely
      recognized for its conservation importance.

1.3.2. The project did not have specific key indicators related to the GEO. The legal documents
specified that the PDO indicators be used for GEO monitoring and evaluation.

1.4.  Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.4.1. There was no formal revision of the PDO or the key indicators.




                                                   3

1.5.  Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.5.1. There was no formal revision of the GEO or the key indicators.

1.6.  Main Beneficiaries

      1.6.1. The primary project beneficiaries were the MoE's Department B (responsible for
      PA management), Department D (responsible for Geographical Information System (GIS)
      and information management) and the VNP management team. The primary beneficiaries
      also included members of the eight pilot communities and 21 villages included in the
      project community activities. More broadly, the project beneficiaries included the
      provincial authorities in Ratanakiri and Stung Treng Provinces, central government and the
      people of Cambodia who may, in the future, benefit from improved PA management.
      Beneficiaries also include the global community that derives benefits from biodiversity
      conservation in Cambodia.

1.7.  Original Components

      1.7.1. The project had four components. The estimated costs at appraisal did not include
      physical or price contingency provisions.


      1.7.2. Component 1. National Policy and Capacity Building (appraisal cost estimate of
      US$1.41 million). This component was designed to help the MoE to develop the key
      elements of a long-term strategy for the NPAs system of Cambodia through: (a) a
      comprehensive review of the existing organizational and management systems within the
      MoE; (b) the development and implementation of national leadership and ranger training
      programs; (c) the formulation of a sustainable financing strategy for the entire protected
      areas system; (d) the development of prototype information systems to support protected
      areas management; (e) the development of national protected areas management planning
      guidelines; (f) a review of legal and regulatory constraints facing the establishment and
      management of protected areas; and (g) public awareness and education programs related to
      protected areas management.

      1.7.3. The financing was for up-grading of physical facilities in the MoE; the procurement
      of vehicles, computers, furniture and office supplies; technical assistance (TA) and short-
      term consultants; domestic and overseas training programs; and various national
      workshops.

      1.7.4. This was expected to lead to: (a) a stronger consensus among MoE, related
      government agencies (i.e., the Ministry of Economy and Finance, MAFF), NGOs and other
      stakeholders involved in protected areas management on the long-term vision for
      Cambodia's protected areas; (b) an action program for the priority national initiatives; (c)
      strengthened MoE professional capacity in terms of overall PA leadership within the
      Ministry as well as field and operational staff; and (d) a stronger voice for the MoE in key
      national policy issues affecting PAs.

      1.7.5. Component 2. Park Protection and Management (appraisal cost estimate of
      US$1.92 million). This component was designed to develop and test pilot activities that
      support the basic management needs of the VNP. It was to finance park infrastructure, park
      management planning, staff development, community education and outreach, and park
      protection. Specifically, it included financing for the construction of a park headquarters at



                                                 4

Voen Sai District, two field operational bases at Ta Veng (Ratanakiri Province) and Siem
Pang (Stung Treng Province) and field outposts within the park; radio communications
systems; vehicles, boats, motorcycles and other essential field equipment; access trails;
public conservation awareness and educational programs; patrolling; ranger training;
biophysical and socio-economic surveys; stakeholder workshops; park zoning; map
production; boundary demarcation; and long-term and short-term TA.

1.7.6. This was expected to lead to: (a) a five-year management plan for the VNP
addressing both the biological and the human dimensions of conservation including the
definition and partial demarcation of the park boundaries; (b) strengthened capacity to
manage the VNP field operations through professional development and ranger training; (c)
increased conservation awareness among communities and other land stakeholders; (d) a
reduction in unsustainable and illegal exploitation of VNP resources; and (e) a stronger
voice for provincial environmental and PA stakeholders in major land-use decisions
affecting the VNP.

1.7.7. Component 3. Community Development (appraisal cost estimate of US$1.08
million). This component was designed to develop and test approaches for involving
communities in and adjacent to the VNP in park management as an integral part of park
conservation. The component financed (a) natural resource and social assessments to
understand the livelihood practices, natural resource use patterns, cultural values and other
socio-economic conditions in and around the VNP; (b) assistance to communities in pilot
areas to formulate proposals for village and commune development consistent with park
management goals and community needs; and (c) the implementation of community-based
natural resource management plans, small-scale alternative livelihood initiatives, and small-
scale infrastructure.

1.7.8. Specifically, the component was to finance: training in PRA and community
interaction techniques for staff in provincial line agencies; community outreach and
education programs; natural resource assessments; in-depth community appraisals; and
community development initiatives. The project was to provide vehicles, office equipment,
technical assistance and field allowances for staff involved in PRAs and surveys.

1.7.9. This was expected to lead to: (a) the strengthened capacity of MoE and provincial
government staff to facilitate community development; (b) the evaluation of methodologies
for involving communities in park protection and management; (c) increased community
willingness to participate in activities that further park management objectives; (d) the
establishment of a zoning system in pilot areas to guide land use within and adjacent to the
park; (e) the evaluation of incentive systems and livelihood alternatives that complement
park protection and management initiatives.

1.7.10. Component 4. Project Management (appraisal cost estimate of US$0.5 million).
This component was designed to support project management activities through a project
management office in Ban Lung and a project liaison office in Phnom Penh. The financing
included the upgrade of MoE offices in Phnom Penh, the construction of an office in Ban
Lung, computers, office equipment and furniture, vehicles, communications equipment,
operating costs and field allowances for traveling staff as well as consulting services for
management activities (e.g., monitoring, accounting and procurement).




                                             5

1.8.    Revised Components

       1.8.1. The components were not formally revised.3

1.9.    Other significant changes

       1.9.1. Change in the implementation schedule. The closing date of the Credit was
       extended three times (once by two years and twice by one year), doubling the original
                    4

       implementation period to nearly eight years . This extension led to significant increases in
                                                             5

       actual project management costs over those estimated at appraisal. Cost increases included
       both the daily operational costs of managing Virachey National Park and the extension of
       consulting contracts for advisors supporting the project. The original project scope was
       unchanged, although some related activities (e.g., ecotourism) were added .                 6



2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

       2.1.1. Key factors during project preparation included a high level of government
       commitment demonstrated by borrowing from the International Development Association
       (IDA), which is uncommon for conservation projects, and implementing agency
       commitment demonstrated by the continued personal involvement of the Senior Minister
       and top MoE management. The choice of a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) as the
       lending instrument emphasized the focus of the project on "learning by doing" but did not
       match the broad national policy agenda (outlined in Component 1); simplified LIL
       processing may have contributed to insufficient treatment of safeguards (see section 2.4);
       and the high standards set for M&E under LIL guidelines were not met (see Section 2.3).
       In hindsight, the ICR finds that a LIL was not the best choice of instrument for the project
       as designed; at the time of project preparation LILs were viewed favorably because of their
       relatively shorter preparation time compared to SILs, and the Task Team proceeded on this
       basis..7

2.2.    Implementation

       2.2.1. Key factors that affected implementation included:




3The Community Development Component (Component 3) was operationally merged with the Park Management
Component (Component 2) following the MTR recommendations to reflect that the community activities were integral
to park management. The resultant Park Management Component retained the activities of the two original project
components.
4The extensions were not approved by the RVP as required for cumulative extensions of two years or more.
5The three extensions were from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2005, then to December 31, 2006 and December
31, 2007. The stated reasons for the extensions varied and included the completion of activities, the consolidation of
achievements, and delays caused by long rainy seasons.
6The disbursement categories and disbursement percentages, however, were changed several times to alleviate funding
constraints in different parts of the project.
7The Project Concept Review, the PAD review and the QAG portfolio review all questioned the use of a LIL for this
operation.



                                                           6

(a) A new approach to PA management, based on increased community consultation and
participation, greater involvement with local government and a leading role for the MoE,
increased ownership and capacity building but slowed implementation considerably as
government staff took on new roles and engaged a larger number of stakeholders than they had
traditionally.

(b) The implementation of the project through MoE fostered (even required) more rapid MoE
capacity development than donor-executed conservation projects typical required in Cambodia,
but the MoE's limited conservation and project management experience remained a constraint
throughout the project period.

(c) National decentralization devolved power to local levels but created a shifting legal
environment creating challenges for integration of community activities into government
programs.

(d) Remote location and difficult field conditions at the VNP affected park staff retention and
limited communications both within the VNP and between the VNP and central MoE.

(e) High personnel turnover at the MoE caused by uncompetitive pay and poaching of staff by
donors for work in other projects.

(f) Corruption and patronage undermined both conservation and public credibility as large-
scale logging within the VNP was linked to the Park Director and Provincial Governor, and
patrolling data was falsified by rangers.

(g) The strained relationship between the MoE and the MAFF hampered cooperation and led
to the creation of parallel community groups for NRM management.

(h) Multiple extensions of the project affected staff morale and focused management attention
on outputs rather than outcomes.

(i) An initial lack of experience with procurement and a decision to procure TA through             8

individual rather than firm contracts led to significant delays and stretched the project
management capacity, but brought cost savings and stimulated MoE capacity development.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

       2.3.1. M&E Design. M&E design, as reflected in the results framework, failed to
       establish clear links between objectives, outputs and indicators. KPIs in the results matrix
       were not consistent with the main text of the PAD (see Annex 10). Nearly all of the
       indicators were insufficiently specific, lacked base-lines and targets values and did not
       clearly identify data collection methods. The M&E design did not meet the high standards
       required to rigorously test the LIL's learning hypotheses.




8Technical assistance was the largest project cost at 60 percent of the appraised project value.




                                                            7

        2.3.2. Implementation. The KPIs were not tracked during the original project period.9
        Base-line and target values were retro-fitted but not always logically linked to the
        respective indicators, and some values did not accurately reflect the baseline.10 The
        tracking of the KPIs improved in the second half of the project, although shortcomings
        remained.11 In parallel to the results framework, a robust monitoring system was
        implemented from 2003. AOPs tracked activities, responsible staff, milestones, timeline,
        inputs and budgets and produced regular detailed reports. AOPs tracked progress using a
        more detailed set of activities and indicators than those outlined in the PAD.12 The project
        also implemented a GIS-based MIST for spatial analysis and decision support in PA
        management.13 Other M&E efforts were also made.14

        2.3.3. Utilization. The original project M&E (KPIs, results framework) was not used
        except for reporting to Bank management. The AOP was extensively utilized as an
        effective project management tool although it was not linked to the original project M&E
        or to its learning objectives. The observed actual use of the MIST for decision making was
        below potential.15 Given the limited use and small MIST staff (two technicians and two
        technical staff, one at the VNP and one at the MoE), sustainability and expansion to other
        protected areas will depend on additional external support.16

2.4.    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

        2.4.1. Safeguards. The project was rated as an Environmental Assessment Category "B"
        based on the anticipated benefits to the environment from improved PA management and
        limited potential adverse environmental impacts due to small-scale park infrastructure. The
        anticipated impacts on indigenous peoples were also expected to be positive as these
        communities would gain greater access to and control over natural resources through the
        introduction of Community Protected Areas. As the project itself was considered to be an
        instrument of implementing the safeguard policies, no separate safeguards instruments were
        prepared or disclosed (as duly noted in the PAD - paragraph 6, page 14).




9The first attempt was made three months before the original Closing Date in the context of the first project extension.
10For example, the two-year pre-project efforts by the WWF and the MoE in VNP to develop patrolling and ranger
training were not reflected in the baselines for patrolling and training.
11For example, there were unexplained changes to some indicators; e.g., `national leadership' was dropped from the
indicator for `national leadership and ranger training programs are developed, tested and implemented'.
12For example, the 2006 AOP tracked more than 220 activities under eight programs and 41 indicators.
13The capabilities of the MIST and MIST staff were demonstrated to the ICR mission at both its VNP and Phnom Penh
terminals. MIST staff were able to generate detailed thematic maps and data on patrol coverage, threat locations, and
key-species presence although the accuracy of data in the system is suspect due to falsification of ranger-collected input
data (e.g., threats, key-species, and illegal activities) uncovered in 2005.
14`Parks in Perils' management scorecard by The Nature Conservancy was used before 2002, and IUCN Management
Effectiveness Scorecard was used during the MTR in an effort to understand the difficult issues of monitoring
performance. These efforts and findings were not tied to the original project M&E against KPIs. The continued use of
`Parks in Peril' scorecards was recommended by the MTR but was not carried out.
15For example, the ICR mission found no indication that the site-level monitoring data already in the system was
routinely considered when planning future patrols. The tracking and analysis of law enforcement action in the MIST,
while technically possible, was not used as the respective records were not fed into the MIST data-base.
16The MTR questioned the feasibility of using and sustaining electronic data-bases at the level of the individual PAs.
At project completion, the conditions for sustained use of the MIST do not exist in most PAs. The MIST was
introduced in Bokor NP in 2004, but stopped functioning in 2005 after project funding ended. In the VNP, the district-
based ranger stations are large and well equipped, and are able to maintain the MIST and make simple analyses of data
obtained, although the analytical expertise and culture of using the system requires strengthening.



                                                               8

    2.4.2. Although this decision was noted in the PAD and was considered appropriate at the
    time, the ICR team in evaluating against current standards finds that the project erred by
    not formally triggering the appropriate safeguard policies and by not preparing and
    disclosing an Environmental Assessment to describe the anticipated impacts of the project.
    The project should have triggered OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, OP 4.04 on
    Natural Habitats, OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples, OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement,
    OP 4.36 on Forests, and OP 4.11 on Physical Cultural Resources. Even in projects that are
    expected to provide positive environmental and social benefits, these policies are now
    routinely triggered "proactively". Despite this serious initial lapse, the ICR team also notes
    that the Bank's due diligence obligations were fulfilled during implementation through the
    inclusion of the adequate expertise to monitor and ensure compliance with these policies
    during supervision.

    2.4.3. Fiduciary. During project implementation the quarterly Financial Monitoring
    Reports and the annual audit reports were submitted on time. However, as no civil servant
    was assigned to work with the financial management consultants during project
    implementation, limited financial management (FM) capacity was built within the Ministry.
    Greater emphasis should be placed on FM and procurement training during the preparation
    of the follow-up operation to ensure adequate capacity development within the Ministry.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

    2.5.1. The project is expected to be succeeded by an IDA-financed follow-on operation,
    the Cambodia Environment and Protected Areas Management Project, the preparation of
    which began before project closing. The government agreed to fund ranger and MoE staff
    salaries until a system of Merit-Based Pay Incentives (MBPI) can be designed and
    implemented.

    2.5.2. Bridge funding. To prepare the new operation and to provide bridge funding to
    continue support for VNP protection and piloting activities, funding amounting to nearly
    US$1 million was mobilized from the Japan Policy and Human Resource Development
    Fund and the Project Preparation Facility.

3.   Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

    3.1.1. Relevance of objectives. Project development and global objectives remain
    relevant. The threats to Cambodia's biodiversity remain high as natural resources continue
    to play an essential role in the country's growth-oriented economic strategy. The relative
    importance of Bank support to MoE has grown as other major donors have reduced their
    support.

    3.1.2. Relevance of design. The relevance of project design was high with respect to: (a)
    protecting the VNP; (b) strengthening voice and customary rights of neighboring
    communities; (c) strengthening the VNP and MoE institutional capacity; (d) transferring
    international conservation practices to Cambodia; (e) taking initial steps toward
    decentralization and fiscal sustainability; and (f) blending IDA and GEF resources to
    support both national and global conservation outcomes. The relevance of design was low
    with respect to safeguards and M&E, especially in light of the high LIL M&E standards
    (see Annex 12).




                                                9

     3.1.3. Relevance of implementation. Implementation relevance is rated as high, given
     the successful replication of park planning procedures at one other PA, the establishment of
     links with adjacent communities and local government, and progressive improvements in
     MoE capacity. The relevance of implementation was low with respect to slow
     development of the national training curriculum and fiscal sustainability strategy.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

     3.2.1. First objective. The first objective was to develop and test proactive measures to
     minimize unsustainable exploitation and degradation of the biodiversity of national and
     global significance in the VNP. The first objective was achieved with moderate
     shortcomings, as demonstrated by progress against the respective PDO indicators, in
     particular by: (a) the successful development and implementation of a VNP 2003-2007
     management plan based on community and stakeholder participation; and the development
     of supporting plans including the Park Protection Plan 2006-2008 and five consecutive
     AOPs; and (b) the number of illegal logs decreased from more than 70 in 2004 to less than
     20 in both 2006 and 2007, while wildlife poaching increased about 2.2 times and illegal
     agriculture remained at low levels between 2004 and 2007. The combined incidence of all
     illegal activities for that period declined by more than 20 percent, but illegal roads
     increased from 0 to 12 (see Annex 11).

     3.2.2. Second objective. The second objective was to use experience gained from the
     VNP to formulate institutional models for the development of the NPAs System of
     Cambodia. The second objective was fully achieved, as demonstrated by progress against
     the respective PDO indicator, in particular by the development and adoption by MoE for
     nation-wide replication of eight organizational and management studies that together
     outlined a strategic vision for development of the NPAs system. (See Datasheet, Section F
     for list of studies.)

     3.2.3. The project contributed to the achievement of the objectives by:

     3.2.4. Creating a physical enabling environment for VNP management through material
     inputs including: (a) the construction of the VNP headquarters at Banlung, three ranger
     stations and nine ranger out-posts, and a ranger training center in Bokor National Park; (b)
     establishing a high-frequency radio communication network, internet connection, and other
     communication systems; (c) providing vehicles, motorcycles and boats for ranger transport;
     and (d) financing field gear, uniforms, medications and food rations.

     3.2.5. Creating an institutional enabling environment for the management of the VNP and
     other PAs through (a) the provision of substantial technical assistance (TA) on all aspects
     of PA management; (b) establishing the organizational and management structure at the
     VNP; (c) developing staff competency profiles; (d) financing staff costs; (d) promoting the
     decentralized management of PAs; (e) strengthening the capacity of the VNP and the MoE
     to monitor management effectiveness through the MIST; (f) developing a cadre of
     dedicated conservation professionals at the MoE; and (e) integrating 21 communities and
     local governments in three districts of Ratanakiri and Stung Treng Provinces into the park
     management planning and operations.


Achievement of GEO

     3.2.6. The GEO was to assist the government to achieve sustainable long-term utilization
     of its natural resources, especially its mountain forest ecosystems of regional and global



                                                 10

      significance. Although differently worded in the PAD, the PDO and GEO are considered
      to be the same. The achievement of the GEO was measured by the same indicators as the
      achievement of PDO, and is considered achieved to the same moderately satisfactory level.

3.3.  Efficiency

      3.3.1. The cost-effectiveness of VNP management under the project (about US$132/km²
      per year) was comparable with that elsewhere in the region. (See Annex 3 for details.)

3.4.  Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

      3.4.1. The overall PDO/GEO outcomes are rated as moderately satisfactory. The
      PDO/GEO remains highly relevant. Most planned outputs and additional relevant outputs
      added during implementation were delivered efficiently and cost effectively, although they
      were significant delays as previously noted. The shortcomings rest in the mixed success
      achieved in decreasing illegal activities that degrade the VNP, the delayed development of
      the national ranger training curriculum, the low sustainability with respect to MIST, and the
      financing and main-streaming of the developed PA management models. The rating is
      consistent with the Independent Evaluation of the project by the GEF.

3.5.  Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

      3.5.1. The project did not have a poverty focus and did not measure variables allowing the
      quantitative assessment of its poverty impact. On one hand, it probably contributed to
      poverty alleviation by providing community grants and creating local employment
      opportunities in the VNP. On the other hand, it probably reduced income generation from
      lucrative illegal activities such as hunting, fishing, logging and unregulated collection of
      non-timber forest products. Measuring livelihood impacts would have been desirable given
      the livelihood program of the project and the relevance of livelihood support to park
      management.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

      3.5.2.   The project had positive institutional impacts at both the VNP and the national
      levels. At the VNP level, it supported decentralization by fostering collaboration among
      provincial agencies and integrating customary users into the planning process of local
      government. At the national level, the project (a) promoted a new vision of NPAs as a
      comprehensively managed system; (b) contributed to the passage of the new protected area
      law and supported prosecution of forest crimes in the VNP; and (c) demonstrated for the
      first time in Cambodia a government-led PA management model. Although the planned
      MoE institutional assessment was not carried out, organizational weaknesses were
      identified and to some extent reduced through project implementation.




                                                  11

       3.5.3. Institutional strengthening was somewhat limited by the project's heavy reliance on
       non-MoE staff (e.g., in 2006, only eight of 123 project staff were MoE employees17).
       While more mainstreamed than other donor-funded operations, the project was still limited
       by insufficient integration into the MoE's own structures.18


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

       3.5.4. There were no other significant outcomes or impacts.

3.6.   Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

       3.6.1. There was no formal beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop (see Annexes 5
       and 6).

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Significant

       4.1.1. There is a significant risk that the PDO and GEO outcomes will not be sustained.

       4.1.2. Few PAs in the world are self-financing, and park funding generally relies on a mix
       of sources. Government budgetary support to PA management in general and to the VNP
       in particular is insufficient and relies heavily on external sources19. Under the project, the
       planned sustainable financing strategy was never completed and continued international
       support to the VNP and other parks is threatened by the recent government decisions to
       grant large-scale mineral exploration licenses in and around PAs.

       4.1.3. The MoE's ability to recruit and retain qualified staff is limited. This is of
       particularly concern for remote hardship posts such as those at the VNP. This problem was
       highly evident during project implementation, and will require mitigation through improved
       human resource management at the MoE .               20


       4.1.4. Finally, realizing the vision of a unified national PA system led by the MoE will
       require continued strengthening of the Ministry's managerial and coordination skills.
       Strategic studies and key recommendations supported by the project and endorsed by the
       MoE must still be tested, adapted, and eventually adopted and implemented by key
       stakeholder groups including conservation NGOs, local government, local communities,
       and other government agencies.




17The project also supplemented the salaries of nine MoE staff in their regular jobs in Phnom Penh.
18For example, project-financed staff and structures, especially Project Liaison Office, are perceived as project rather
than MoE personnel; park staff and some reports use the project acronym - BPAMP - as a synonym for the VNP.
19For example, although the government increased its funding for the project by nearly 18 percent it represented only
7.5 percent of the project cost (2006 GEF evaluation).
20Loss of rangers near the end of the project and earlier difficulties maintaining full staffing suggest this risk is high.
Rangers with low salaries lack incentives to patrol in harsh conditions, and may revert to exploitation of park resources
to improve their income. Some of the rangers are ex-hunters hired because of their field skills.



                                                            12

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1.    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

        5.1.1. The Bank effort to ensure quality at entry was mixed and had significant
        shortcomings. Strengths included facilitating the selection of highly relevant objectives,
        encouraging a leading role for the MoE and supporting active stakeholder engagement.
        The main shortcomings are related to the selection of a LIL as the lending instrument (see
        Section 2.1). Simplified LIL processing led to inadequate attention being paid to
        sustainability, analysis of alternatives, and safeguards. Shortcomings with regard to the
        treatment of safeguards are outlined in Section 2.4. Significant shortcomings in the M&E
        design and implementation in turn resulted in a limited availability of data to test the LIL
        learning hypotheses (see Section 2.3). Shortcomings in realistically assessing project
        readiness for implementation and complex project design contributed to a delayed start and
        slow implementation of the project and led to multiple project extensions (paragraph 2.2.1).

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        5.1.2. The Bank's supervision performance is rated as having been moderately satisfactory
        with minor shortcomings. Strengths included a thorough MTR that provided renewed
        momentum, direction and guidance to the project (see Annex 4); strong and sustained
        support for addressing illegal logging within the park; multiple learning events provided
        opportunities to exchange ideas and experience with other conservation actors ; and active          21

        support for public consultation on the draft PA law. However, there were also significant
        weaknesses identified: in the realism of ISR ratings22; in fiduciary practices (see Section
        2.4); and in reporting on compliance with safeguards23. Regular reporting on performance
        indicators began only shortly before the first extension, and weaknesses in the results
        framework (discussed in Section 2.4) remained unaddressed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        5.1.3. The overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.




21ICR team interviews with conservation NGOs in Cambodia suggested that a broad spectrum of practices and
approaches exists in different conservation projects with respect to patrolling and law enforcement, habitat and wildlife
survey, outreach and participation, TA input, staffing, budgeting, etc.
22For example, implementation progress was always rated as "satisfactory" although there were major implementation
delays that doubled the project implementation period.
23For example, the satisfactory ratings vis-à-vis the degradation of natural habitats from large-scale logging in the VNP,
the indications of an international territorial dispute, and the construction of a ranger outpost in the community sacred
forest (GEF evaluation report).



                                                              13

5.2.   Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

       5.2.1. The government performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory with significant
       shortcomings in governance and inter-ministerial coordination. Both national and local
       levels of government have demonstrated commitment and provided significant support. In
       a highly visible illegal logging case within the VNP, decisive action was taken at both
       levels. The Protected Areas Law was finalized and signed into law. The Ministry of
       Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation cooperated in the organization of a trans-
       boundary collaboration workshop. Counterpart contributions were provided in full and
       generally on time. However, in 2007 the government issued mining exploration licenses
       covering approximately 60 percent of the VNP, including some overlapping the core
       conservation zones. Exploration licenses were issued without adequate inter-ministerial
       consultation and, because licenses are not publicly disclosed, concessionaire obligations
       with respect to relinquishment are not known. Without access to this information, the MoE
       has difficulty in effectively implementing regulatory oversight. At the time that this ICR
       was finalized, none of the exploration licenses had been converted into an exploitation
       agreement and the impacts of exploration activities on biodiversity conservation have been
       minimal. However, the decision to engage in exploration has already resulted in negative
       publicity internationally and has raised concerns among Conservation Partners about the
       commitment of the government to PAs. Such decisions may have an impact on
       contributions to the national conservation fund and may limit the availability of financial
       support for the VNP in the future. With respect to coordination with other stakeholders, the
       relationship between the FA and MoE remains strained at both the national and provincial
       levels, which limits the effectiveness of coordination efforts.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

       5.2.2. The performance of the MoE was satisfactory (in the face of difficult                        24political and
       logistical circumstances) with only minor shortcomings. The MoE assigned some of its
       best technical staff to strategic project positions at both the national and the VNP level, and
       maintained engagement of top management in the project throughout implementation. The
       shortcomings included the failure to provide baseline expenditure data for the development
       of sustainable financing strategy, limited utilization of the MIST for decision-making, and a
       hesitant assumption of its leading role as the manager of the PA system and coordinator of
       the donor and NGO assistance in Cambodian PAs.




24Difficulties included death threats to individual project staff during the investigation of illegal logging in the VNP.




                                                            14

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

      5.2.3. The overall borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.

6.    Lessons Learned

General

      6.1.1. A longer time-frame should be considered for PA/NRM projects with a
      capacity-building focus. PA and NRM projects are complex by definition and often
      involve unclear legal and regulatory frameworks, low capacity of government officials, and
      poor understanding of rights and obligations of stakeholders. Addressing these
      fundamental constraints takes time and involves false starts. Projects should have time-
      frames long enough to address such constraints or should be designed as parts of longer-
      term programs.

      6.1.2. More attention must be paid to M&E. Adequate attention to M&E design,
      implementation and utilization is important for every operation, but is essential for a LIL
      where it facilitates the testing of the learning hypothesis. Hypotheses should be framed to
      ensure PA management effectiveness (including internal and external over-sight).

      6.1.3. A strategic approach should be adopted to the development of institutional
      capacity. To design an effective institutional capacity-building intervention, the whole
      organization should be first assessed to understand how its departments and systems
      interact and function in fact, not just on paper. When strengthening institutional capacity,
      the creation of external structures should be minimized, and functions should be assigned to
      the appropriate units within the institution.

      6.1.4. Safeguard policies should be applied proactively. Trigger and comply with
      applicable safeguard policies in all projects, including those whose explicit objectives aim
      to protect people and the environment.

      6.1.5. Investments should be made early in counterpart implementation capacity and
      such limitations should inform project design. Government capacity to implement
      Bank-funded projects requires detailed of knowledge across a range of technical specialties
      including procurement. Efforts to build or to strengthen this capacity must start early and
      focus on the practical skills necessary to run projects effectively and efficiently.

      6.1.6. The appropriate modality of technical assistance should be carefully evaluated.
      Large firms can bring consistency and stability but can be expensive and contribute little to
      local capacity and project leadership. Individual TA contracts give flexibility and cost-
      effectiveness, but can be difficult to manage and can create problems with continuity of key
      messages and programs. Appropriately balancing these options contributes to the
      efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of technical inputs.

Specific

      6.1.7. Strategic partnerships should be sought early in project implementation. The
      project eventually developed partnerships with conservation NGOs and provincial agencies
      but rather late in the process. The development of partnerships early in the implementation
      allows for greater leveraging of other resources and expertise and creates better
      opportunities for sharing experiences and lessons.



                                                   15

     6.1.8. A constant effort should be made to ensure that key stakeholders share the
     vision of park management and protection. Decisions about PA management often elicit
     strong opinions from a range of stakeholders. To build and maintain a common
     understanding across national, provincial and local levels, PA managers should engage
     stakeholders in regular discussions of key goals and strategies focusing on review and
     revision of the objectives and goals of site management.

     6.1.9. Flexibility is important in a dynamic context. One of the important challenges in
     Cambodia during the life of the project was the rapidly changing social and economic
     context of conservation programs and NRM generally, and the community role in leading
     development programs at the local level. Flexibility in project implementation is important
     in this situation and projects should be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise
     and to modify the structure and nature of project elements if needed. Linkages to the local
     planning processes developed under the Rural Investment and Local Governance Project
     should be developed.

     6.1.10. Ranger-based data collection should be employed. RBDC combined with a
     GIS-based information system is potentially a powerful tool for assessing management
     effectiveness and informing the planning process, and it provides an immediate purpose
     and context for ranger training and capacity building. If RBDC and a MIST are introduced,
     data quality assurance measures should be put in place and the system should be used to its
     full potential in supporting management decisions.

     6.1.11. The park should be viewed through the AOPs. Detailed AOPs with hundreds
     of activities are an effective management tool, but must not lose the sight of key issues
     (e.g., identification of key conservation assets and key threats, such as in poaching and road
     building) from non-essential ones (e.g., nascent eco-tourism programs, and fire
     management in areas with little fire risk).

     6.1.12. Up-front agreement should be achieved on community involvement. It should
     be made clear whether community involvement is an instrument in achieving conservation
     goals (e.g., being the "eyes and ears" of rangers) or a goal in itself (e.g., in the protection of
     customary user rights of indigenous people) and the community involvement program
     should be designed accordingly.

     6.1.13. MoE leadership should be supported to continue to develop in its role as the
     manager of the NPA system, while asserting itself vis-à-vis other sector agencies in
     dialogue on developing hydroelectric power generation or mining resources within PA
     boundaries.

     6.1.14. Civil servants pay should be moved towards a Merit-Based Pay System. Civil
     servants cannot be expected to perform if they are not adequately remunerated. Although
     merit-based payment schemes are still under development in Cambodia, their introduction
     into the MoE should be encouraged through the development and piloting of an appropriate
     system.

7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

     7.1.1. The time required with the Bank procurement requirements was noted.
     Procurement procedures do take time, but also protect economy and efficiency of resource
     use, and are applied consistently to all projects.




                                                16

(b) Co-financiers

     7.1.2. Issues raised in the GEF Independent Evaluation Report were discussed in the main
     text of the ICR. No additional comments are provided.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

     7.1.3. A formal stakeholder workshop was not organized. However, a workshop to
     present the main outputs of the project and the preliminary findings of the ICR mission was
     organized to solicit feedback from key conservation NGOs. (See Annex 6 for a list of
     participants.)

     7.1.4. Participants discussed the achievements of the project and endorsed the need for the
     increased role of the MoE in coordinating the efforts of conservation NGOs and capturing
     more systematically the competence that exists outside the MoE. The MoE ­ NGO
     relationship was not considered yet fully developed. The need for improved collaboration
     between the MoE and the MAFF's Forest Administration and other ministries (such as
     Land and Interior), was highlighted.

     7.1.5. Participants recognized that funding for PA management remains a critical issue
     and that no exit strategy from externally-funded conservation was formulated. A
     conservation trust was mentioned as a possible solution. Calls were made for more funding
     of PAs from the government's own resources. A move towards a MBPI system was
     considered promising to provide a living wage to MoE staff, but it was noted that the MBPI
     has yet to penetrate to sub-national level. The need for a realistic assessment of risks from
     real estate market, land titling, mineral exploration, road building, etc. was noted in regard
     to the future conservation efforts under the follow-on operation (the Cambodia
     Environment and Protected Areas Management Project).

     7.1.6. Reasons for failure to deliver national training curriculum on time were discussed
     together with pros and cons of establishing a centralized training unit at the MoE.

The project identified 13 competencies profiles required for the various positions in protected area management
appropriate for conditions in Cambodia. The project also designed a standard format for the evaluation of staff
performance and conducted annual performance reviews. A 136 page document describes competences,
performance standards, and assessment formats for all positions envisaged for the protected area system. A
ranger training curriculum was developed based on the list of competences and the associated training needs.
Content and materials of three training modules were prepared with focus on basic skills, law enforcement, and
tourism. Trial deliveries of each training module were conducted and modules were revised according to
evaluations made by both trainers and trainees. No training module was produced for community outreach
aspects other than eco-tourism. However the methods commonly used are adapted versions of those applied in
rural extension and community development for which training providers and materials are comparatively easy
to find.

Course materials prepared by WildAid on behalf of the project deal with law enforcement. They are well
organized and presented, available in the Khmer language and have been approved by the MoE. Combined with
the training modules (patrolling guide, standardized field observations, tourism ranger skills) developed by the
project, the curriculum content is relevant, appropriate, and covers the essential skills and knowledge. BPAMP
has contributed to the construction of the Bokor Ranger Training Centre. National leadership training program
was not developed but substituted by way of experiential learning during study tours, participation in
international meetings, and participation in problem solving and planning workshops.

Beginning in 2004, the project began to address a general audience on national TV, broadcasting a series of
videos and three feature documentaries on protected areas in different regions of Cambodia. Public service radio
spots were broadcast daily as well as a popular debate program on Sunday mornings. Print media included press
releases, a quarterly newsletter, calendars and posters. The programs were relevant to the project's mission but
had no aim beyond generating publicity.

Additional comments:

· The ranger training curriculum needs a user's guide specifying minimum requirements, optimal timing,
     refresher trainings, essential field practice and verification of learning objectives in the field, plus a listing of
     competent trainers/training providers, available materials, and approximate costs.

· There was little evidence at VNP that thematic maps were used in work planning and reporting. A module
     on field data analysis and the use of thematic maps would be a valuable addition to the training of ranger
     team leaders, heads of ranger stations, and wardens.

· Specialized training for Cambodian marine parks and wetlands has not yet been incorporated but may be
     provided by organizations currently involved in their management.

· The project was not expected to deliver training at the national level and number of persons trained and
     quality and effectiveness of delivery are not relevant here.

The outputs here are discussed in regard to policies. Outputs that are more relevant to techniques and procedures
in protected area management are discussed under indicator 3.

In July 2004, the project launched a collaborative protected area system planning process. Its first major result, a
Gap Analysis was completed. It provides a thorough analysis of Cambodian biodiversity assets, both in terms of
habitat types and species as well as conservation values and their distribution. It draws attention to under-
represented habitat types and highlights the remaining options in maintaining connectivity between protected
areas. The area west of VNP and contiguous with Xe Pian National Protected Area was one of several identified
as having high priority. The Gap Analysis constitutes a useful tool for MOE and individual protected areas even
without its compendium, the Protected Area System Plan. The PA system plan entitled "A Plan to enhance the
Representativeness and Effectiveness of Cambodia's Protected Area System" was started but not completed.

BPAMP organized a Rapid Assessment and Prioritization of Protected Area Management. The process is useful
for system-wide assessment and yielded useful information for the Gap Analysis as well as management relevant
recommendations. The method has been well tested and applied in over 850 protected areas worldwide and
seems appropriate for periodic application in Cambodia, especially if all protected areas of the same or similar
designations can be included. RAPPAM assessed the pressures and threats as being much less severe than was
understood at appraisal.

Efforts towards the formulation of a Financing Strategy began in 2003 with an attempt to identify financing
needs from empirical data obtained through questionnaires. This and subsequent attempts to elicit the necessary
baseline information were unsuccessful. Instead of the Strategy, a concept with preliminary analysis and
pertinent recommendations was prepared. Failure to prepare the financing strategy is considered a major project
shortcoming ­ both against its stated target and for practical sustainability reasons ­ and should be addressed
under CEPAMP.

The project facilitated awareness raising and public consultation of the Protected Areas Law which is expected
to bring about improved law enforcement while increasing tenure security of use rights by local communities.
This Law was signed in January 2008.

Considerable project effort went into the strengthening of trans-boundary collaboration between Cambodia,
Laos, and Vietnam. A draft text of a tri-partite agreement was prepared. Trans-boundary cooperation raises the
visibility of conservation efforts in border areas and facilitates regular contact between officials from the
protected areas concerned. On the other hand, border areas remain largely terra incognita and with low
management capacity cooperation easily lacks substance. The ICR mission considered the activity as relevant
and potentially useful but not necessarily essential at this point in time.

The project codified a participatory process for developing a protected area management plan. The process is
detailed in a guide entitled Participatory Development of Management Plans for Protected Areas in Cambodia.
The VNP management plan produced by the process is concise and logical. Both preparatory process and plan
have MoE approval for replication elsewhere. The plan structure has already been used elsewhere (e.g., Phnom
Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary). The plan content has shortcomings which are discussed under indicator 5.

Concepts and documentation were prepared for policy initiatives relevant to data sharing, research and
monitoring. The most significant of these was the introduction in 2003 of the MIST software for information
management which greatly facilitates the processing and interpretation of large amounts of data from the field.
The system comes complete with a well thought out training module and data collection formats. It is being
used by several conservation NGOs and was formally approved by MoE. It has not yet been fully adapted to
Cambodian conditions.

Several community outreach initiatives constitute potential models for replication; the initial Participatory Rural
Appraisal, the Co-Management of Natural Resources (in Community Protected Areas - CPA), Community
Grants, and Eco-tourism.

The document Community Development in VNP 2000 ­ 2006 provides a structure for outreach operations but
contains no explicit overall strategy with policy guidelines, realistic objectives, and verifiable targets. The
operations described in detail are Co-Management of Natural Resources, Environmental Awareness Raising, and
Community Grants. Eco-tourism is not included in this document although it is given considerable expectations
in VNP.

Performance of the stated outreach methods will be discussed under indicators 8-10. The comments here refer to
the strategic dimension and suitability for replication.

The origins of PRA are in community development. It is intended to start off a process in which people take
charge of improving their living conditions in a variety of ways including natural resource management. The
PRA reports contain a wealth of interesting information of which much is potentially relevant to outreach
planning. However, the reports fail to condense the information into community profiles and does not
summarize and highlight opportunities for cooperation between park and community. Neither was it evident that
the selection of outreach approaches was influenced by the PRA findings. In the light of the substantial cost and
effort, PRA potential for replication should be assessed on a case by case basis.

Co-management of peripheral portions of a protected area has scope for replication provided that it can give
people the tenure security that they seem to desire most. It remains to be seen whether CPA management under
the new law and regulatory framework (yet to be prepared) will provide sufficient motivation especially in the
absence of project sponsorship.

Awareness-raising was not carried out in a strategic sense aiming at verifiable attitude and behavior changes. To
avoid spending scarce resources on unverifiable objectives, awareness-raising should concentrate on an outcome
oriented approach and be delivered in focused campaigns.

Community grants provide a tangible motive for local people to reciprocate by assisting the protected area
authority suggesting a general scope for replication. Detailed guidelines have been prepared but strategy
development should await conclusive evidence from the VNP experience.

Eco-tourism without project subsidies is feasible in only very few protected areas. This limits the scope for
replication. A strategy needs to be complemented by a realistic business plan, have a deliberate plan for phasing
out park involvement and handing over to the community, and be clear about the control the protected area

authority needs to retain. The Ecotourism Strategy 2006 ­ 2010, approved by MoE in March 2006, provides a
thorough treatment of the subject but lacks sections on how to get professional help for determining the eco-
tourism potential of an area, how to conduct a cost-benefit analysis including subsidies in the form of training,
ranger staff-time, equipment and construction, and how to draw up a business plan.

Additional comments:

· Activities in the annual operations plans are not cross-referenced to their respective performance indicator
    used in the Project Appraisal Document.

· The 2007 Operations Plan follows the accustomed structure but is inconsistent in the indicator titles and
    activity coding.

· The operations planning process and the management planning process should be followed only after
    credible field investigation capacity has been created and staff have acquired first hand knowledge of
    conservation assets and threats.

The Park Protection Plan 2006 ­ 2008 complements the management plan in guiding law enforcement and
monitoring effort. The plan content follows the structure of the management plan, requires action to move from
a current to a desired situation and specifies targets and responsibilities. The plan incorporates a threat analysis
referring to publications by four different authors from 2002 to 2006. It shows the geographic distribution of
past patrol coverage but does not analyze it in terms of frequency of visits although this is not difficult to do with
MIST. An excess of rationale and process descriptions would be best incorporated in training rather than the
plan itself.

The project has introduced Ranger Based Data Collection as its main tool for site level monitoring. The data
collection process, record categories and formats, and reporting procedures are well documented and technically
sound. Training has been given to ensure adequate observation and data recording standards, although these
were not followed when data entries were extensively falsified (rangers made up the entries without going on
patrol). The problem was reported as corrected through Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) tracking and daily
photographic documentation of patrols. The associated MIST software is capable of producing tables and
thematic maps useful for data interpretation.

Aerial monitoring complements ground patrolling. It was added as a monitoring tool after a reconnaissance flight
had chanced upon an illegal logging operation in Dragon's Tail part of the park. It can reach remote areas of the
park but is able to detect only highly visible illegal activities, such as forest clearing, logging and road
construction. These are most likely to occur in areas outside the park.

In 2002 the project carried out a rapid management effectiveness assessment using the WWF Tracking Tool
method. A repeat of this assessment in 2007 was recommended but there was no provision for it in the 2007
Operations Plan.

Project provided the necessary logistical inputs for field work, i.e., transport, field gear, communications
equipment, ranger outposts and field work incentives. This is expected to lead to effective protection and
monitoring verified by a declining encounter frequency (observations per patrolling effort) of threat observations
and a sufficiently high number of key-species presence records to allow inferences about their distribution and
continued presence.

The incidence for about a half of illegal activity category, however, increased, including that of wildlife
poaching, which is the most significant pressure on the park (based on RAPPAM). See Borrower ICR for data.

Patrol coverage was very uneven with at least one-third of the park never visited by a patrol, and a further third

visited at a rate of 1-7 visits in four years. Deliberate data falsification regarding presence in the field was
detected in 2005. Indications that rangers filed field reports without spending time in the field were recorded
already in the November 2001 Aide Memoire. The problem is said to have been eliminated, it raises questions
about reliability of the data in the MIST. In addition, the October 2006 version of the Park Protection Plan notes
a number of shortcomings in current implementation of patrolling practice.

During the ICR mission, senior rangers seemed familiar with the terrain frequently patrolled and the preferred
habitat of the species encountered. While staff were able to point out on a map, the areas that are seldom visited
and the often used patrol routes, the use of thematic maps and critical discussion and interpretation of field data
was clearly not part of their work culture. Snares and other confiscated items attest that law enforcement is
carried out but no statistics were available to demonstrate changes over time in the number of warnings, arrests,
and convictions. The protection plan refers to at least 13 serious shortcomings, i.e., there is currently no duty
schedule in place.

The central planning document is the VNP Management Plan 2003-2007. Approved by MoE in December
2003, the plan provided guidance and continuity in operations planning. The plan was developed in a deliberate
and participatory process detailed in a manual. It is concise and well laid out. The plan text was drafted by an
advisor who, at the time, was new in the project with limited access to information from the field. The situation
in which the plan was prepared provides a plausible explanation for its focus on activities rather than problem
solving.

Plan content is generic in nature due to an effort to introduce a streamlined, "business plan model" and promote
a lighter approach to PA planning. The model is based on experience from the US Park Service and was
endorsed by consultants from South African and Ugandan Park Services. It is not based on thorough spatial
VNP specific analysis of conservation values and significance. Threats receive a cursory treatment under the
section on land use. In the absence of a description of conservation asset types found in VNP, and without
analysis of their distribution and their vulnerability to threats, no priorities can be set.

The conciseness of the plan is partly due to the fact that it does not specify standards and targets. To a varying
degree these are dealt with in complementary plans. Although management planning requires looking ahead,
some of the over 250 activities in eight management programs seem premature or not realistic relative to
management capacity, i.e., species censuses, habitat restoration, fire management. Zoning seems to have been a
desk exercise to satisfy a requirement of the Protected Areas Law. Zones are entirely defined by the rules that
apply but no explanation was given on how they were determined in the first place. Although alluded to, there is
no evidence that the distribution of known conservation assets was a criterion in identifying zone boundaries.
The placement of the sustainable use zone seems particularly irrational with a strip along the Lao border as in
anticipation of frequent incursions from Laos.

Nonetheless, it should be noted that VNP management plan is still the only MoE PA management plan
implemented on the ground, and the streamlined and simple plan serves the interest of management in VNP well.

Annual operations and budget planning followed the management plan and the process outlined in the September
2006 reference manual. The process was consistently followed from 2003 onward with minor deviations in
2007. AOPs were detailed and precise, and facilitated tracking of progress.

VNP has a clear and well functioning organizational structure. Each position in this structure carries a
competency profile which was used as terms of reference for annual staff performance evaluations. The park
infrastructure established by the project, headquarter building and visitor centre in Banlung, a sub-office in Stung
Treng, three ranger stations and nine ranger outposts) is adequate and functional. As of June 2007, all
management sectors are linked to headquarters by high frequency radio. The ICR mission could not determine
whether undisciplined use of radio equipment mentioned in the protection plan remained an issue.

The training concepts and materials were discussed under indicator 1. The discussion here pertains to
implementation at or for VNP.

BPAMP's final report notes a total of over 1,100 staff trained over the duration of the project through 2006. The
relative weighting of importance can be inferred from the number of trainees per topic (see table 3 from the
BPAMP final report). Although the training did not exactly follow the ranger training curriculum which was
developed only at the end of the project, it was appropriate in emphasis and sufficient to establish an elementary
capacity for conducting field work. However, no refresher training was given and field staff capacity was
assessed as basic in the Park Protection Plan. No training was given in the last two years of the project. Because
of staff attrition, at the end of the project 44 out of 52 rangers were hired after the ranger training was delivered.

Some training took place through on-the-job coaching by advisors. Unfortunately, the project did not use its
competency profiles and the annual staff performance evaluations to determine the extent to which skills had
been internalized, and identify training gaps at the end of the project. The Park Protection Plan itself rates field
staff capacity as basic.

Additional comments:

· The number of training events conducted, their duration and the number of people trained is a poor indicator
     and cannot substitute for an assessment of the extent to which training has contributed to attaining
     competences. Training was evaluated event by event but not against competence standards and individual
     staff performance. The project had the means but - being in a perpetual state of catching up ­ probably did
     not have the time to conduct a more meaningful analysis.

Forty boundary markers were installed while nine others were cancelled for plausible reasons. Markers had to be
rebuilt due to not meeting specifications. The markers in place are well documented and acknowledged by
representatives of local communities and government. Additional markers of a less permanent nature are
required in some areas. The project has met the stated requirement.

Additional comments:

· At the time VNP was established in 1993, the straight sections on VNP's southern boundary were an
     expedient shortcut to what could have otherwise turned into a protracted process. These boundary sections
     are not identifiable in the field unless one carries a GPS device. To be proactive VNP management should
     identify a more rational, identifiable and defensible boundary, provide the appropriate arguments and locally
     promote the provisional recognition of the revised boundary prior and link these efforts to development of
     the subsidiary legislation under the Protected Areas Law.

· A few major entry points to VNP can be inferred from the frequently travelled patrol routes. Population
     density within walking distance from the boundary, the number of major entry points, and trail density per
     unit area are possible indicators for the vulnerability of boundary sections and peripheral areas of the park.
     Maps showing the major entry points, the regularly used trails, and navigable stretches of the rivers would
     constitute a valuable tool in assessing the vulnerability of boundary sections and use areas within VNP.

In the VNP Management Plan, Community Education and Awareness Raising is part of VNP's outreach
program. Its central task is to provide education about issues identified by the National Biodiversity Action Plan
( NBAP) and to reduce misunderstandings and win support for resource protection. The plan emphasizes that
education must be contextual and related to people's living condition as well as resource conservation. While
awareness raising activities were part of project operations all along, a dedicated Information and Education Unit
with two staff was established at VNP in 2004. It has produced materials for Community Protected Areas and
Small Grants related training as well as general environmental topics for village audiences and for schools.
Considerable effort was made to use local languages.

It is unclear how often the target villages are visited annually and how many people participate and benefit from
the programs. Without strategic objectives (i.e. changes in attitude and behavior), outreach activities are difficult
to evaluate. It is unclear that Unit has the capacity to deliver general environmental education at sufficient reach
and depth and adapted to the needs of different target groups.

Materials produced in support of eco-tourism in VNP include two color brochures about the park and one
pamphlet for each of the three hikes currently offered, bilingual pocket booklets on the do's and don'ts for ranger
guides and visitors, and a ten minute video about VNP. The materials are attractive, informative and
appropriate.

The Banlung visitor centre has an exhibit section with flatwork displays and a topographic model of the park.
Service at the reception desk is friendly and efficient. The displays are adequate though with scope for
improvement by adding and explaining objects of interest relevant to management, such as, camera trap
destroyed by elephants, snares, traps, confiscated animal remains. In Stung Treng an annex of the new MOE
building houses a VNP liaison office from where VNP eco-tours to the Siem Pang area of the park will be
arranged in the future. The annex also has a spacious exhibit room, still empty. The desk staff responsible for
tour bookings was unable to answer questions about VNP or how to get to it.

Additional comments:

· Among the past awareness raising activities, the Samrong (Malva nut) Campaign against destructive
      harvesting has received good recognition for responding to a real need. High visibility campaigns on an
      inspiring topic and aiming at specific behavior change are probably the most effective approach to
      awareness raising and education.

· Considering that one staff of the Information and Education Unit works only part-time for the unit and that
      both staff have limited communication skills, the Mission doubts its usefulness.

· The Stung Treng liaison office is difficult to find for tourists and should be moved to a more central
      location.

A number of resource surveys were completed. Their use for park management and community outreach had
limitations due to general nature of recommendations or late timing.

The natural resource (conservation assets) related surveys conducted on behalf of or in cooperation with the
project included camera trap surveys (2005 to 2006), a two-week Biological Survey of VNP (2006) and several
species or species group specific surveys. Relevant information is also contained in the GAP Analysis (2006)
and in a report on Wildlife Hunting and Trade (2002). None of these surveys was comprehensive enough and
detailed enough to provide a spatial and conceptual overview of VNP's conservation assets. All but one were too
late to be considered during management plan preparation.

Probably the most detailed and well analyzed spatial information on key-habitats and on key-species originated
from camera trap surveys supported by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-Cambodia from May 1999 and detailed
in two reports dating from 2000 and 2001. Much of VNP ranger staff's knowledge of field craft and species
recognition was probably acquired during that period partly through training provided by the Wildlife
Conservation Society (WCS)/WWF)and partly through field practice (about 75% of WWF efforts during the two
year period were focused on training). These two documents were not acknowledged in either the Management
Plan or in the Park Protection Plan, and there is no evidence that they were used to inform the management
planning process.

Outreach planning started with a Park Wide Assessment based on a desk study and investigations during a one
week visit to each district. The conclusions drawn were general and resulted in the recommendation to provide
support for CPA establishment, income generation, and awareness-raising. Equally general and almost identical
conclusions emerged from the more detailed PRA investigations in four target communes. In addition, three case
studies were undertaken. PRA and case studies added some insights by, for instance, refuting earlier statements
made in the Park Wide Assessment about significant shifting cultivation in VNP, and correcting assumptions
about a large population residing in the park.

The initial assessment, the PRA and the case studies were not logically linked. The choice of target communities
was vaguely based on their status as traditional users. While the information obtained was relevant, not all of it

· Prior to drafting a VNP Management Plan 2008-2012, baseline information needs to be condensed into fact
    sheets and profiles supported by thematic maps. Two sets of such information are required; fact sheets for
    each of the management sectors and profiles for each of the communes adjacent to the VNP boundary or
    external forest. To the extent that relevant information is not available, additional inquiries are necessary.

    Indicative information contained in the fact sheets: description of the terrestrial habitats and point resources
    (i.e. mineral licks), a description of the wetlands types, distribution of selected key-species and main
    population strongholds, priority areas for conservation based on their importance for the conservation of
    key-habitats and species, areas that are vulnerable or under acute threat;

    Indicative information contained in the commune profiles: foraging areas used frequently and infrequently
    inside and outside VNP, main entry points and trails used, shifting cultivation fields, description of resource
    uses and source areas that are economically/culturally most important, description and enumeration of
    households considered, by a given definition, to be highly dependent on legal or illegal extraction of
    resources;

    Conclusions drawn from review of fact sheets and profiles: priority areas for management interventions
    based on degree of conflict between known uses and the integrity of conservation assets, integrated set of
    activities to reduce/eliminate specific conflicts in named locations, involving specific villages, authorities,
    and ranger outposts; protection and monitoring/research priorities;

· The socio-economic survey findings should be summarized in a map showing all communes/commune
    boundaries adjacent to VNP, their villages, their spirit forests and their frequent/infrequent use areas.

Participatory Rural Appraisal was the first step in VNP's participatory management approach and followed by
the establishment of Community Protected Area Committees. Despite its limited use for outreach planning, PRA
seems to have been successful in sparking interest in land use issues and cooperation with the protected area
management authority. The detail and relevance of the report content suggest that PRA implementation was
professionally sound and produced the desired insights into local livelihoods. The process by which follow-up
activities were developed is not clear but what had been recommended by the initial Park Wide Assessment did
eventually emerge as the mainstay approaches of the outreach program.

CPA Committees were established in anticipation of their role in facilitating the establishment of community
protected areas and the implementation of small grant projects. Some of the committees survived until they did
have tangible tasks to do while others became defunct. Committees had periodic elections, monthly meetings,
quarterly report writing obligations but their function was not fully clear to many community members including
committee members. It would be useful to track committee decisions to assess how and whether they effectively
function.

The Small Grant Guidelines approved by the Ministry of Environment and the World Bank in September 2005
enabled the implementation of small grants projects starting in April 2006 and comprising community meeting
halls (4), tourist accommodation (2), agricultural tools (19) fruit tree/seed and training (6), and veterinary
training (9). By June 2007, disbursements totaled US$46,161. The paperwork involved was considerable but
the steps were clearly described in the Guidelines and in themselves induced a learning process. Community
meeting halls and ecotourism guesthouses were not identified as needed by the villagers but promoted by the
project as a way of facilitating ecotourism and community engagement (GEF Independent Evaluation Report).

The benefits to the local people in terms of livelihood improvements resulting from small grants projects are
difficult to quantify and to separate from similar support provided by NGOs. The benefits for the park in terms
of good will and increased support for park protection efforts are positive but similarly difficult to measure.
Suitable indicators and long term funding sources are necessary to make this management aspect sustainable.

Community based natural resource management is central in the outreach approach at VNP. Its aim is to
gradually transform resource use in Community Protected Areas from open access to controlled access enforced
by the respective community itself.

The Mission's impression from talking to Committee members and others at Koklak, Yorn, and O'Chay was that
the areas now included in CPAs are perceived as important for people's livelihood but are not essential for
survival. The Committee members seemed genuinely enthusiastic over the opportunity to take greater control of
their resources. Aware of land acquisition by outsiders and the resulting displacement of locals, they seemed
most motivated by the desire for tenure security and increased village authority to prevent non-authorized use of
their forest resources by outsiders.

The only form of CPA management was periodic boundary inspections and maintaining records of forest product
types and quantities collected. The latter is part of the project's monitoring of outreach efforts. For a realistic
estimate of harvested quantities the records seem too incomplete and unreliable. There is currently neither an
obvious need nor the capacity for management interventions, such as harvest controls and enrichment planting.
Given that the community pressure on CPAs appears low, absence of active management is not considered a
shortcoming at this time. Thus, to assess progress predominantly based on the number of approved CPAs and
CPA management plans would miss the point.

Additional comments:

· A concern voiced by the GEF Final Evaluation Mission bears repeating here. The CPA Committees
     facilitated by the project may only take decisions on natural resource management issues that relate to
     CPAs in the Park. In some areas outside the Park other natural resource management committees had
     been established before the project started. This means that some communities now have two committees,



                                                       14

     one for natural resource management on land managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
     Fisheries (MAFF) outside the Park, and the other one for resource management in MOE-awarded CPAs
     inside the Park. In this context the role of the CPA Committee is still unclear to many people including
     some of the CPA Committee members themselves.

· The imposition of strict rules and over-regulation of the CPA could cause the people to lose interest in co-
     management (not in use of the areas) particularly if the decision-making authority of the village is perceived
     as insignificant and/or tenure security is diluted by the need for periodic lease renewal. The de facto
     provisional recognition of CPAs by the local management authority should be possible as long as the
     community agrees to abide by the general articles 9 to 14 of the CPA regulations and to cooperate with the
     park authority in providing intelligence on outsiders and illegal activities.

Number and quality of livelihood programs adopted.          · Income generation through eco-tourism


Two programs were designed to contribute to livelihoods, the original Small Grants Program and the later-added
ecotourism program.

Small Grants Program was based on grant applications from the community or commune investment plan. Grant
decisions were made by an evaluation committee and had good support among local politicians and
administrators. Benefits from the grants approved reached some 2,000 families at an average value per family
of approximately US$20. Without a strategy and targets for reducing dependency on park resources there is no
way of telling if the grants affected the demand of people for park resources. Even if such a strategy had been
formulated it seems unlikely - given the limited financial resources and extension/development expertise ­ that
park supported income generation would have had a significant overall impact. The significance of the small
grants seemed to have been in generating goodwill for VNP among communities. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that project efforts were widely appreciated by the beneficiary communities and local government alike but no
evidence is available to evaluate the achievements in a meaningful way against baseline conditions or
quantitative targets. There was no monitoring of impacts of small grants projects.

Eco-tourism activities were under development for the three districts of VNP and were organized by the park in
collaboration with villages. The park capacity to organize and run eco-tours was thoroughly prepared and
assisted by an expatriate adviser. Post tour evaluations by the clients were overwhelmingly positive. A benefit
sharing policy was developed by the project. Pending approval of the policy, the accumulated profits over and
above direct costs are kept in a bank account. The leading role of the VNP in running the business side of the
ecotourism operations is plausible under current circumstances but bears the risk of a conflict of interest and
spreading the VNP management too thin.

Continued TA is essential for developing the tour options from Siem Pang which are probably the most
promising from a business point of view, and for guiding the devolution of park involvement in tour organization
while increasing the capacity, responsibility, and benefits of the communities involved.

Since the eco-tourism program would require substantial increase in tourists to cover its costs, the likely earning
potential of eco-tourism at VNP should be realistically assessed, and a business plan prepared accounting for
support and possible hidden subsidies from park management.

Component 4: Project Management

Project M&E management monitoring was implemented through progress reporting against AOPs and regular
financial reporting using Peachtree software (implemented for financial management) are suitable for and have
been used for their respective purpose. Planning and reporting by VNP was integrated with other project
activities. The emphasis was placed on detailed operations planning which provided a clear structure but kept
the focus on activities rather than problems and opportunities.

Result monitoring of conservation assets condition and threats at VNP was carried out through RBDC and twice
annual aerial inspection. The project compiled aerial photo and satellite images providing a record of baseline
conditions for possible future use. Monitoring data from field reports were processed with the help of MIST.
The MIST generated reports were primarily used to increase accountability by verifying field work effort and
coverage. MIST map printouts on species presence and threat records distribution in A4 format were on display
at Banlung park headquarters and the ranger stations. They showed numerous and difficult to distinguish
categories and did little to illustrate monitoring results. MIST reports did not relate threat evidence to
conservation assets, i.e., identify acute threats occurring in the core-zone although the system is capable of doing
so. MIST data were not consistently used in reporting or planning, probably due to the uneven coverage and
data falsification discussed earlier.

At each CPA, monitoring by villagers of resource extraction was initiated to ensure sustainable use and
adherence to targets set in the CPA management plan. The approach would be of greater value if it concentrated
on sample households to estimate consumption or to sensitize people to an element in resource management. As
an instrument to ensure sustainable use it is limited as it is neither physically possible nor cost-effective to
inventory growing stock and determine harvest limits for most non-timber forest products (NTFPs), except for
the very few that are both commercially valuable and concentrated in relatively small areas. To expect the
extraction records to reflect real extraction levels seems unrealistic.

For eco-tourism, detailed tracking of visitors was established.

Extent to which project activities are delayed due to funds release or
availability of resource.

The moderate delays in the flow of funds from Phnom Penh seem to have been caused partly by the time
required to follow Bank procurement rules, Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) procedures, as well as
VNP's financial management system and shortcomings in the park internal procedures.

There was a significant delay at the beginning of the project due to changes in TA delivery modality from firm to
individual consultants. As a result, TA was not available at a critical early stage in project development.

National staff recruitment was delayed by slow MEF approval of the contract. The problem was corrected by
changes in the standard operating procedures.

During the ICR mission to VNP, park staff indicated that available resources to cover salaries, field benefits, etc.
were not sufficient. Considering that VNP has lost several key staff to other organizations, and many rangers left
the job, the shortage of resources at VNP requires urgent attention.



Annex 3:        ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

3.1.  The project did not undertake an economic analysis. Instead, a GEF incremental cost
analysis was prepared, assessing the total cost of GEF alternative at US$4.9 million. This was
also the actual cost of the project. A rough assessment of cost-effectiveness is possible on the
basis of comparing PA management cost per unit area with other countries. Considering the total
project cost of US$4.91 million and the 3,325 square kilometers of VNP, the project provided a
degree of park protection and management for eight years of its duration, which translates to
about US$185 per km² per year. Correcting for the cost of the national policy and capacity
building component which was not focused only on VNP park management, the annual cost of
VNP management was about US$132 per km².

3.2.  This was broadly consistent with a mean budget of PA budgets from developing countries
during 1990s, which was US$157/km2 but a lot less than the 696/km2 in Thailand and
US$2,061/km2 in Malaysia in 1994 (James et al, 1999). It is also consistent with the cost of
managing similarly sized and funded protected area the Philippines ­ Malapaya Sound, 2,000
km² , funded by the EU ­ which is US$110/km2, (Rimbaldi and Bacudo 2000) or the average cost
of managing national parks in Indonesia, which is US$97/ km2 (Indonesia Clearinghouse
Mechanism for Biodiversity, Indonesia Ministry of Environment) and about twice as much as the
South East Asia average annual funding for protected areas of US$54/ km2 (2004).

Mid-term Review

A comprehensive and thorough November 2002 MTR helped to reorganize and refocus the
project. The MTR made a large number of recommendations. The key recommendations
concerned project organization and management, refocusing the components and activities for
greater impact, and improving its sustainability.

The key recommendations, their handling and impact are summarized below.

Annex 5:     BENEFICIARY SURVEY RESULTS

5.1.   Neither the project nor the ICR exercise carried out a formal beneficiary survey. The ICR
team, however, included an indigenous community development specialist and interviewed
individuals and families in Lalay Village, Koklak Commune, Veunsai District; and Modul Yorn,
Taveng Commune, Taveng District (Ratnakiri Province), and O'Chay Village, Sentepheap
Commune, Siem Pang District (Stung Grent Province). The principal feedback and findings were
as follows. First, the project was welcome and appreciated by the communities and individuals.
Second, the awareness of the project, or even the VNP, was not universal, which was surprising
given the duration of the project and the support of the project to direct work with the
communities, including posting resident liaisons in selected villages, but was consistent with the
findings of the MTR. Third, the principal benefit of the project to the communities was increased
tenure security, small grants, and, to the leaders, the ability to participate in various meetings with
sitting allowances.

5.2.   Interestingly, the benefits from actual participation of the communities in active VNP
management (e.g., through the community protected areas) did not figure in the feedback from
people interviewed and did not seem to play a significant role in mobilizing the community
support for the VNP. This is an important indication for the follow-up operation that the
participatory PA management in VNP needs to be further refined to ensure that it yields tangible
benefits and incentives to the VNP communities, including secure use rights and improving
village control over its resources.

Annex 7:      SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR

Minimal comments were received from RGC in response to the draft ICR prepared by IDA
however a comprehensive borrower ICR was prepared and shared with the IDA ICR mission
members. The full borrower ICR is filed in IRIS and is listed in the supporting documents
section below. The main findings and lessons learned from BPAMP implementation as presented
in the borrower ICR are as follows:

1: Increased participation by MoE in national and provincial land and natural resource use
decision-making processes can reduce the pressure of illegal logging and other major land
allocation decisions affecting national parks

The project has demonstrated that increased participation by MoE in national and provincial land
and natural resource use decision-making processes can reduce pressures on Cambodia's national
parks. However, both the national and provincial decision-making processes remain highly
centralized and dependent on a small number of people located in senior positions in the overall
political and administrative structure. Future WB support for Cambodia's protected area system
should include specific activities that identify and target these key people for a comprehensive
program of environmental awareness raising activities.

2: A sustainable financing system for protected areas is realistic and achievable

The project has spent three years trying unsuccessfully to obtain the basic financial data required
for the preparation of a sustainable financing strategy for Cambodia's national protected area
system. The lesson learned from the BPAMP experience is that (a) the necessary conditions for
the development of a transparent sustainable financing system for the national protected area
network will be done in Cambodia if we have enough equipment to control; and (b) these
conditions are not likely to be created until more adequate financial management arrangements
for individual protected areas have been introduced.

3: Community participation in protected areas management provides sufficient incentive to
reduce the pressure of ongoing agricultural and illegal hunting practices

This hypothesis is unproven. Project community development activities are insufficiently far
advanced to provide an incentive to reduce the pressure of ongoing agricultural and illegal
hunting practices.

The project has used a number of staff and a range of PRA tools in the development of its
Community Protected Area activities. The lesson learned is that these tools should only be used
by an experienced facilitator because, if they are not used correctly, local community
expectations can be unrealistic, which neither the Project nor the GoC may later be able to satisfy.

4: A decentralized approach to protected areas and conservation management programs is
replicable in other parts of Cambodia.

The GoC's administrative system remains highly centralized. Most key decisions related to PA
administration and management are made by senior MoE officers in Phnom Penh, when the Park
has problems. The decision-making process is often labored.The MoE administrative structures
at provincial and district levels are weak if considering human resources . They do not have
enough experience and skills in the resolution of conflict at provincial, national and international
levels. Positions in the VNP organizational structure have been filled either by MoE staff



                                                  24

seconded from Phnom Penh or by external consultants. The MoE staff have often been asked to
fill positions for which they do not have the right qualifications. As management models for
Cambodia's PA system become more sophisticated, MoE in Phnom Penh simply will not have
enough staff to be assigned to the field, whether they have appropriate qualifications or not. The
BPAMP model for protected area management is replicable in other parts of Cambodia but the
key lesson learned is that while capacity building at the national level is still needed, assistance
from GEF and other donors in this sector should also prioritize the need for capacity building at
both the provincial and the district levels of MoE administration.

Annex 8:      COMMENTS OF CO-FINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS

Introduction

8.1.   An independent evaluation of the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project
(BPAMP) was conducted between 15 May and 10 June 2006 by two international consultants, Mr.
Roger Cox (Team Leader and Biodiversity/Protected Areas Management Specialist) and Dr.
Karen Lawrence (Team Member and Community Resource Management Specialist.

8.2.   BPAMP represents a collaborative effort between the Royal Government of Cambodia
(GoC) and the International Development Association (IDA), with the latter also acting through
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as implementing agency for
the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The project is implemented by Cambodia's Ministry of
Environment. The MoE is responsible for the management of the project's field site - the
Virachey National Park (VNP), which covers an area of 3,325 km² in Ratanakiri and Stung Treng
Provinces in north-eastern Cambodia.

Project objectives

8.3.   The project's development objective (see PAD page 2) is to improve the capacity of the
MoE to plan, implement and monitor an effective system of national protected areas. The global
environment objective (see PAD page 2) is to assist the GoC to achieve sustainable, long-term
utilization of its natural resources, especially mountain forest ecosystems of regional and global
significance. Project activities designed to address these objectives are grouped into four
components: (a) National Policy and Capacity Building; (b) Park Protection and Management; (c)
Community Development; and (d) Project Management.

Project Appraisal Document (PAD)

8.4.   The PAD demonstrates several inconsistencies. There are different versions of the
project's development objective as expressed in the text (section A.1) and Annex 1 (the Project
Design Summary). There are also two different versions of the project's immediate objectives
and outputs. The project's key performance indicators as listed in the PAD text (section A.3) are
formulated differently to those in PAD Annex 1, and both these versions differ in minor ways to
the indicators included in Supplemental Letters (dated 7 March, 2000) to the IDA and GEF Grant
Agreements. The discrepancies have not had an adverse impact on project implementation, but
they are indicative of a less-than-thorough project preparation.

Coherence of project activities

8.5.   BPAMP activities began in 2000 and were originally scheduled to finish on 31 December
2003. Initial progress was slow and implementation was adversely affected by a number of
factors including: (a) insufficient international TA input during the early stages of the project; (b)
delays in the procurement of goods and services; (c) the physical distance between the two
project offices; and (d) a weak legislative framework which made it difficult to develop a
coherent strategy for addressing both the needs of local communities and VNP conservation
priorities. Many project activities could not be completed on time and two project extensions
were requested and approved. Overall, project performance and efficiency has improved
noticeably since the beginning of 2003 following the recruitment of the present Project Manager.

Intermediate outcome indicators

8.6.  The project has 13 intermediate outcome indicators (PAD Annex 1, Project Design
Summary). Each indicator was assessed in terms of: (a) the implementation status of the
outcome's associated principal activities; and (b) an evaluation of the extent to which these
outcomes are relevant and have been achieved (or are expected to be achieved). An overall
performance rating was then assigned to each outcome, ranging from Highly Satisfactory through
Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, and Unsatisfactory to Highly
Unsatisfactory and not applicable. The intermediate outcome indicators and their ratings are
summarized in the following table.

Achievement of global environment objective

Indicator 1: Management plan for VNP based on community and stakeholder participation is
produced and accepted.

8.7.   The Virachey National Park Management Plan 2003 ­ 2007 was formulated in the context
of an integrative, participatory and consultative planning approach that involved the participation
of local communities and other stakeholders. Workshops were held in February 2003 for
representatives, administrators and opinion leaders from communes adjoining VNP. Five
workshops were conducted with the help of professional facilitators. A total of 51 villages was
covered during these consultations and feedback was obtained. Feedback was also obtained
from: (a) workshops held by the Park Director and support staff in both Ratanakiri and Stung
Treng Provinces for local government agencies and the private sector; (b) workshops held in
Phnom Penh with staff from MoE and NGOs; and (c) park rangers and community facilitators
working closely with communities around VNP.

8.8.   The management plan was approved by MoE in December 2003 and distributed to a wide
range of stakeholders. It has not yet been used as a model for the preparation of management
plans for Cambodia's other national parks (no PA management plans have actually been
produced since the VNP model was published).

Indicator 2: Incidence of unplanned agricultural expansion, wildlife poaching, and illegal logging
is reduced in VNP

In 2003, the project facilitated the introduction of Ranger-based Data Collection protocols and a
spatial management information system (MIST) so that the data collected by rangers during their
patrols could be made more easily accessible to managers for planning and monitoring and
evaluation purposes. Analysis of data from MIST for the years 2004 and 2005 shows a gradual
improvement in patrol deployment both in terms of the number of patrols carried out and the area
of the park that is being patrolled. However, the accuracy of this data, and the RBDC records of
animal sightings and illegal activities, is open to question because extensive falsification of patrol
data by rangers was discovered in July 2005. One unfortunate consequence of this has been that
the ability to show the beginning of a downward trend in illegal activities in the Park has been
compromised.

8.9.   Achievement of the project's Global Environmental Objective is rated as Moderately
Likely if: (a) MoE works actively to promote the VNP management plan as a national model, and
(b) existing VNP protection activities are maintained at existing levels.

Achievement of project development objective

Indicator: Results of organizational, finance, and management studies are adopted and promoted
widely within MoE

8.10 BPAMP has been effective in helping MoE to formulate a long-term strategic vision for
Cambodia's national protected area system and in determining which management planning
approaches are effective in the field. The recommendations included in a number of important
organizational and management studies that have been facilitated by the project have already
been adopted and officially approved by MoE. More are likely to be approved before the project
ends on 31 December, 2006. However, although the results of BPAMP studies have been



                                                  28

accepted by the MoE, there is an urgent need to promote these results more actively among all
stakeholders, particularly: (a) the other national parks in Cambodia's protected area system; and
(b) the NGOs that help MoE to manage Cambodia's parks. This is a current activity that will
require attention beyond the end of 2006 if the BPAMP development objective is to be realized.

Sustainability of project benefits

8.10. The sustainability of BPAMP project benefits was assessed in terms of four criteria: (a)
financial resources; (b) socio-political context; (c) institutional framework and governance; and
(d) replication and catalysis. A number rating 1-6 has been provided in each category according
to the achievement and shortcomings: Highly Likely = 6, Likely = 5, Moderately Likely = 4,
Moderately Unlikely = 3, Unlikely = 2, Highly Unlikely = 1, and not applicable = 0.

         A                    B                   C                    D                  E
     Financial         Socio-political      Institutional       Ecological (not     Replication and
     resources                            framework and           applicable)          catalysis
                                            governance
          2                   4                   3                    0                   3

8.11. The BPAMP's overall sustainability rating is assessed as (A+B+C+E)/4, giving a total of 4
(Moderately Unlikely). The principal sustainability issue relates to Category A (financial
resources) and the inadequate funding available to sustain project benefits after 31 December,
2006. Government resources (particularly operating expenses) for the VNP's protection program
in particular are very limited.

Project M&E system

8.12. The project's M&E system was evaluated in terms of: (a) its overall effectiveness; and (b)
its value for adaptive management. The project management M&E system can be considered
good practice. Despite the ranger data falsification problem, the MIST information system used
by the project can also be considered to be good practice. The project has been proactive in
responding to specific management needs as they have arisen. The following key activities which
were not described in the PAD or Project Implementation Plan but which were later identified as
important issues during the VNP management planning process have been comprehensively
addressed by the project: (a) GAP analysis and system plan for Cambodia's network of national
parks; (b) strengthening of trans-boundary collaboration in the management of the Virachey -
Dong Am Pham ­ Chu Mom Ray Protected Area Complex; (c) development of a program of
activities to enhance VNP's eco-tourism potential; and (d) development of a CPA prakas.
Adaptive management responses at VNP have focused mostly on improving the ranger patrolling
system. The overall rating for the quality of project M&E systems is shown below.

                         A                                                  B
         Effective M&E system in place                         Information used for adaptive
            (indicators, baselines, etc.)                              management
                         4                                                  4

8.13. A number rating 1-6 has been provided for each criterion according to the achievement and
shortcomings with: Highly Satisfactory = 6, Satisfactory = 5, Moderately Satisfactory = 4,
Moderately Unsatisfactory = 3, Unsatisfactory = 2, Highly Unsatisfactory = 1, and unable to
assess = 0.


                                                  29

8.14. BPAMP's overall rating on the quality of its M&E system is assessed as (A+B) / 2 = 4
(Moderately Satisfactory). The project would achieve a satisfactory rating for criterion `A' above
if MIST is institutionalized into MoE and all databases that can be linked are connected and
functioning effectively by 31 December, 2006. Similarly, a satisfactory rating for criterion `B' is
achievable if the capacity of MoE staff to analyze MIST data for adaptive management purposes
is enhanced and institutionalized before the project ends.

Project costs

8.15. The bar chart below shows the proportions of total BPAMP expenditure for IDA, GEF and
GoC. The disbursement percentages for the budget lines from IDA, GEF and GoC were changed
when the project was extended for two years at the end of 2003 and an additional GoC
counterpart input of US$10,100 was required for the extension period. The amendments to the
credit and grant agreements, which formalize the changed disbursement percentages, were not
finalized until November 2004. In addition, an error in the amendment letters concerning
procurement of goods was only corrected in May 2005. All this resulted in a higher spending of
GoC counterpart funds than planned.




               0%

     Agreed Budget 2000     Actual Expenditure 04/2006




As of April 30, 2006 unspent BPAMP funds totaled US$1,009,042. The largest amount left
unspent (US$453,896) was for consultant services. A large amount is also unspent for training
(US$166,574). The National Ranger Training Curriculum is still incomplete and it is likely the
project will not have the opportunity to use this money for implementing the curriculum before
the project ends.

Annex 11: INCIDENCE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES IN THE PROJECT

It should be noted that the incidence of illegal activities in the VNP ­ the only quantitative
indicator of project performance ­ is difficult to assess because of a poor base-line, short time
series, and uncertain accuracy of data before 2005. The MIST data from 2004 - 2007 suggest that
there was a decrease in some illegal activities (e.g., logging, fishing, fire, and gold mining) but an
increase in others (e.g., poaching, roads, and trespassing). Poaching, identified by RAPPAM as
the most significant pressure/threat in the VNP (relative to other PAs), increased 2.2 times based
on combined poaching signs. The annual total of illegal logs found by patrols decreased from 72
in 2004 to 19 in 2007. Swidden agriculture remained low. The overall combined incidence of
illegal activities declined by about 20 percent since 2005 but the increase in roads in 2007 is
worrying since roads can facilitate other illegal activities in the park.

Annex 12: CONSISTENCY OF THE PROJECT WITH LIL REQUIREMENTS

12.1. The project was processed as a LIL, based on the effort to generate local experience with
global good practice in the changing context of Cambodia and to promote local learning about
conservation through international TA. This did not require a LIL, as learning by applying
international practice is inherent to any TA project. Simplified LIL processing led to insufficient
attention being paid to the discussion of sustainability and alternatives, and was not suitable for
the complex, high-risk setting of the project. The project's weak M&E design was in contrast to
heightened M&E requirements for a LIL. The QAG country portfolio review in 2004 noted that
the project "... scarcely qualified as a LIL."
