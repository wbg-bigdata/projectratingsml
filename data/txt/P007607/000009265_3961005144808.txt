MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
FOR A RAINFED AREAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$85.0 million equivalent with the guarantee of
the United Mexican States to help finance a project for Rainfed Areas Development. The loan would
be repayable at the Bank's standard variable rate with a maturity of 15 years, including five years of
grace. The Fideicomiso de Riesgo Compartido (FIRCO), an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Water Resources (SARH), would be the executing institution.
2.    Background. Rainfed agriculture is important in Mexico. The 1991 census showed rainfed
agriculture occupying 26 million hectares of the national total of 31.7 million hectares in annual,
perennial, and semi-perennial crops. Irrigated agriculture occupied the remaining 5.7 million
hectares. The main rainfed crops -' corn (6.55 million hectares in 199!), beans (1.82 million
hectares), sorghum (1.06 million hectares), wheat, forage oats, and barley (all roughly 250,000
hectares). The productivity of those crops is much higher when they are grown with irrigation.
Rainfed crop yields were: corn, 1.76 metric tons per hectare (mt/ha); beans 0.56; sorghum, 2.44;
wheat, 1.74; forage oats, 5.38; and barley, 1.61. The corresponding yields with irrigation were:
corn 3.70 mt/ha; beans, 1.34; sorghum, 4.74; wheat, 4.84; forage oats, 19.23; and barley, 4.04.
The value of agricultural output in 1991 dorrestic prices was N$50 billion, of which 45% was from
rainfed crops and 55 % from irrigated. The average value of production per hectare from all crops in
rainfed agriculture is typically about 50 percent of that in irrigated agriculture.
3.    Rainfed agriculture confronts serious difficulties. Rainfed farmers achieve lower crop yields
and, as a result, are typically poorer and have lower investment capacity than farmers with irrigation,
because they lack the reliable and timely water supply provided by irrigation. Without irrigation and
other investments, rainfed areas will fall farther behind. Much of the rainfed area is in the semi-arid
tropics, where problems of crop and livestock pests and diseases, soils and weeds are more acute than
in arid irrigated zones. Agriculture incurs environmental costs from soil erosion, which will become
more severe as land use intensity rises. An additional problem is that much of the rainfed area is
sown in corn, a crop that will be severely affected by the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA). As NAFTA is implemented, it is expected that wages, employment and income from corn
production will fall and that it will therefore be even more important to seek means of raising the
productivity and competitiveness of rainfed agriculture.
4.    The Government's agricultural sector strategy is to reduce public sector involvement, to
eliminate nearly all trade and price protection, to move to non-distorting income support programs, to
cut subsidies to producers and consumers, and to target public spending on public goods and poverty
alleviation. The proposed operation is consistent with those objectives as it: (i) targets poor corn-
growing areas that will lose from NAFTA; and (ii) promotes productive investment, not consumption.
The Government's irrigation sub-sector strategy is to: (i) encourage private sector involvement in
new investments through the transfer of the Irrigation Districts to user groups; (ii) transfer costs of
capital, operations and maintenance to the user groups; (iii) modify the legal framework of the sub-
sector so as to promote private investment and water markets; and (iv) target public investment to
priority rehabilitation of existing works, and limited investments in new works, in line with economic
and environmental criteria. The rainfed areas strategy has two aspects. First, in the rainfed areas
with higher productive potential, the Government seeks to promote development of irrigation where it
is economicallv and environmentally feasible, and to re-orient research, extension and credit to those



- 2 -
areas with d.ie goal of raising productivity, Second, in the areas with lower productive potential,
where irrigation and conventional research and extension are either infeasible or have a very low
economic return, the Government seeks to target public poverty alleviation programs, such as the
National Solidarity Program (PRONASOL), which are aimed at the most marginal rural producers.
S.     Project Objectives. The project objective is to raise agricultural productivity in selected
rainfed areas. This would be done through: (a) investing in small-scale irrigation and other productive
investments; (b) transferring both new and existing agricultural technologies through private sector
extension; (c) reducing soil erosion; and (d) strengthening the capacity of the executing agency,
FIRCO. The proposed project is targeted to small farmers in the ten states, chiefly in semiarid and
temperate zones, with rainfall less than l,Q00 mm annually and where moisture deficit is the main
constraint to productivity.
6.     Project Description. ThL  -oposed operation would have three components:
(a)    Rural Investment (US$147.2 million total cost) would include: (i) tubewells
and related irrigation struc ures (US$21.7 million); (ii) other small-scale
irrigation and drainage (US$62.1 million); (iii) soil conservation works
(US$ 17.7 million); (iv) other investment, including livestock production
facilities and nurseries for reforestation (US$6.4 mi!lion); (v) supervision by
FIRCO (IJS$13.5 million); and (v) recurrent costs of operation and
maintenance paid by producers (US$25.8 million).
(b)    Agricultural Technology Transfer (US$61.0 million) is needed for the
central corn-producing area of Mexico to reorient agriculture away from the
traditional heavily protected corn towards activities that can compete under
free trade. The ,ub-components are: (i) agricultural extension services o
producers (US$24.1 million); (ii) validation and demonstration plots (US$2.8
million); (iii) soil conservation practices and equipment (US$15.5 million);
and (iv) recurrent costs of soil conservation practices paid by producers
(US$18.6 million). All extension services and soil and water conservation
services provided under the project would be contracted competitively through
private firms. The proposed operation would give additional emphabis to the
creation of producer organizations to support agricultural extension, to the
resolution of site-specific technology transfer problems, and to provision of
technical assistance to producers shifting from rainfed to irrigated agriculture,
or undertaking new practices.
(c)    Institutional Developmenit and Trining (US$17.4 million) would strengthen
FIRCO's: (i) capacity to design investments so as to improve rural investment
sub-projects (US$4.4 million); (ii) staff training (US$3.7 million); (iii)
information management (US$3.6 million); (iv) expertise in the areas of soil
conservation, livestock production, and monitoring and evaluation of the
productivity and environmental impact of the project (US$1.6 million); and
(v) project unit (US$4.1 million).
7.     Project Costs and Financing. Total project costs are estimated at US$225.6 million
including contingencies. The project would be implemented over a five year period, which roughly
coincides with the period of initial adjustment to lower corn prices. The Bank would finance



- 3 -
38 percent of total project costs, including up to US$8.5 million for retroactive financing to allow
initiation of priority project activities. The rural investment component will be co-financed by the
state governments as determined by the annual agreements signed between FIRCO and the state
governments. These agreements are an established part of FIRCO's operations and provide an
adequate foundation for the additional project activities. State co-financing will be at least 20% of the
average incremental costs of the rural investment component. Under the proposed project, the state
governments would maintain their contribution to existing costs and would bear about 12% of total
project costs. Agreements between FIRCO and the high priority states for 1994 have been signed for
1994; the appraisal mission reviewed these agreements and found them satisfactory. Beneficiaries
will finance a minimum of 15% of the incremental costs of the rural investment component.
Agreements between producer organizations and FIRCO are an established part of their operations
and are required for all activities of FIRCO.
8.    Project Coordination and Implementation. Under the proposed project, FIRCO would be
principally responsible for evaluating, supervising, monitoring and financing programs and investment
projects, but not for implementing them, which would be the responsibility of producer groups and
private contractors. Investment p;ojects would be proposed by producers either directly to FIRCO or
through the Rural Development Districts (DDR), who would submit them to FIRCO. All projects
that meet FIRCO's eligibility criteria including economic rate of return analysis pass through an initial
screening process at the DDR level, followed by a field visit by FIRCO staff before a full technical,
financial and economic evaluation is carried out. This is done either by FIRCO or by consultants
contracted by FIRCO. Approval of the state working group, a technical committee of the state
government's executive agencies, and by the State Planning Committee (COPLADE) is required
before the project agreement is signed. FIRCO's evaluation is done in accordance with the norms
defined in its operation manual. A project unit would be created to oversee the operation within
FIRCO and would report directly to the Director General. The project unit would be responsible for
managing contacts with the Bank, including on matte-, of procurement, disbursement, audits, and
contracting of consultants.
9.    Project Sustainability. The project is expected to have a positive effect on sustainable
agriculture and on the consolidation of the private sector's role in the agricultural sector. Under the
project, the new regulatory and administrative reforms related to water and land use will create an
environment conducive to private investments and to more efficient use of land and water resources.
In addition, the project will introduce priority-setting mechanisms for public infrastructure cost
sharing between the Government and the private sector, as well as for improved water use and better
drainage on irrigated land.
10.   Lessons from Bank Experience. A major lesson from previous Bank projects is that once
the incentive framework is appropriate, ift is difficult to do much for agriculture in the more arid
rainfed zones beyond agricultural research, extension, and some environmental measures, such as soil
and water conservation, without irrigation. Hence, the project components are limited to small-scale
irrigation and drainage, livestock production, agricultural extension, soil and water conservation, and
the related institutional development of the executing agency. A second lesson is the need to involve
beneficiaries closely in the design and management of the investments. Because the investments are
small and dispersed, centralized public management has proven to be unsustainable because it is too
costly. Management by the beneficiaries has also been shown necessary to reduce costs and hence
increase efficiency. Individual investments will be prepared in close collaboration between the
project executing agency and the benefitting producers with adequate financial contribution from the
producers. A third lesson is the imnportance of technical assistance to the beneficiaries. Technical
assistance, in this case in the form of agricultural extension, can improve productivity on its own and



- 4 -
has many positive interactions with investments in small-scale irrigation. Project design incorporates
research results from lending operations and sector work in Mexico and elsewhere. Those results
include not only technica' recommendations which can be made to producers benefitting from project
investments, but institutional arrangements for more efficient transfer of technology to the project
area. A fourth lesson is the need for efficient infrastructure operations and maintenance, as seen in
many other operations. Poor maintenance has led to inefficient u . of the works and to delays in new
construction as the implementing agencies have slowed new works while trying to do better
maintenance on the existing ones. The proposed operation requires producers to own and manage
project investments, thus creating adequate and sustainable incentives for maintenance.
11.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Bank involvement is justified mainly by the need to
bolster productive investment in the areas anticipated to be affected seriously by the fall in corn
prices; the government of Mexico, in requesting Bank's assistance for this project, has specifically
made this point. While investment funds will eventually become available from fiscal savings arising
from changes in producer and consumer prices, palliating the income effects of the new policy on
poor producers requires funds more immediately. Bank invo1vement in this project, and in related
operations, is also important in helping Mexico channel spending on agriculture toward investment
and away from subsidies as it adjusts to free trade. In addition, the Bank has a long history of
agricultural operations in Mexico and has established credibility in supporting successful investments
of the proposed type. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's sector strategy, as
elaborated in the most recent Country Assistance Strategy (discussed with the Board on June 9, 1994)
which promotes: (i) a reduction in Government involvement in agriculture; (ii) an increase in the
snare of investment in public agricultural spending; (iii) a reduction in the share of subsidies and
transfers; and (iv) targeting public investments to poor areas that are not well served by the private
sector.
12.   Agreements reached. During negotiations, the Government agreed: (i) to a final list of
eligible project states; (ii) to a final list of eligible investment types; (iii) that the investments costs of
activities financed under the rural investment component of the project would be shared in a
percentage of not less than 15 percent by the producers; (iv) to present the economic analysis for
inveatment projects in the rural investment component to the Bank in a format acceptable to the Bank,
apply the NPV of the net economic benefits to the project at international input and output prices as
the economic return criterion in the project, use a 12 percent real discount rate to estimate the NPV,
and accept only investments with a positive NPV in the rural investment component of the project; (v)
that there would be no minimum farm size limit on participation in the project; (vi) that eligible
producers participating in irrigated crop activities would not own farms larger than 20 hectares, that
projects in which any producer participating in irrigated crop activities had more than 10 hectares
would be subject to prior review by the Bank and the share of such projects in the total of investments
would be monitored as one of the project implementation indicators; (vii) that the eligibility of
producers participating in livestock activities would continue to be determined by the DDR Technical
Committees; (viii) that beneficiaries would be organized into groups for operating and managing
project investments and for obtaining technical assistance; (ix) that beneficiaries would obtain
agricultural technology transfer services acceptable to FIRCO; (x) that FIRCO would be required to
produce a plan of trials of innovative activities for each project state by April 15, 1995; (xi) to,
satisfactory terms of reference for consultancies to be done under the institutional development and
training component; (xii) to maintain in FIRCO an organizational structure, functions, and adequate
staff, all satisfactory to the Bank, to coordinate and supervise the implementation of the project, to
promptly inform the Bank of any proposed change in the organizational structure or functions of
FIRCO, to continue to apply FIRCO's Operating Rules and not change those Operating Rules without
the consent of the Bank; (xiii) to maintain the Project Unit with appropriate functions, structure and



- 5 -
staff; (xiv) to submit the feasibility studies of the first two investment projects to be financed in each
state under the project for the Bank's prior review and approval; (xv) that state governments would
bear at least 20 percent of the investment costs for activities financed under the project's rural
investment component; (xvi) that FIRCO and the state governments would sign annual agreements
governing project implementation in each project state; (xvii) that FIRCO would maintain its practice
of signing agreements with producer organizations for all rural investments financed under the
project; (xviii) to standard terms of reterence for agricultural technology transfer contracts and to
make express provision in those agreements to show that producers have been informed adequately of
their rights to choose freely extension services under the project; (xix) to contract a consultant on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank to review the first 50 agricultural extension contracts
procured under the project and to make modifications as necessary; (xx) to have the project accounts
audited in accordance with the procedures acceptable to the Bank; (xxi) to a set of indicators to assess
progress in project implementation; (xxii) to terms of reference for a study of the socioeconomic and
environmental impact of the project to be done as part of the midterm review of the proposed
operation; (xxi.i) to furnish to the Bank satisfactory semiannual reports covering all project activities
of the previous six months no later than April 30 and October 31 of each year; (xxiv) to provide to
the Bank a satisfactory annual work plan and budget no later than October 31 of each year; (xxv) to
hold an annual project review no later than October 31 of each year to assess project implementation;
(xxvi) to review and approve the annual work plan and budget for the following year; (xxvi) to terms
of reference for a midterm review of the project to be held no later than October 3i, 1996 to assess
project implementation and impact, and to make necessary changes in project implementation as
recommended by the midterm review; (xxvii) to apply acceptable environmental screening and
eligibility procedures acceptable to the Bank for the project; (xxviii) to app!y national standards and
procedures for the utilization of pesticides in connection with research and extension activities that are
acceptable to the Bank; (xxix) to require that all extension agents contracted under the operation apply
integrated pest management techniques as part of all technology transfer activities involving significant
additional use of pesticides; (xxx) to submit to its Congress annual fiscal budgets for the project that
provide adequate resources to carry out the agreed annual work plan; and (xxxi) to furnish the Bank
by April 30 of each year satisfactory evidence of the approved budget.
13.   A condition of effectiveness would be that NAFIN and the Government would have signed a
satisfactory agreement for transferring the loan proceeds. There would be no special conditions of
disbursement.
14.   Project Benefits. The project targets farmers owning fewer than 10 hectares of crop land.
Benefits from the project would be increased and sustainable income for project beneficiaries from
crop and livestock production, brought about through higher productivity; decreased soil erosion and
increased water use efficiency; diversification of production; and improved access to private technical
assistance for producer groups. Civil works and soil conservation activities would offer employment,
especially to the poorer segments of the targeted population. It is estimated that at least 280,000
people will benefit from the project's rural investment component alone. The ERR of the project is
estimated to be at least 12 percent; only investments with an ex-ante ERR above 12 percent would be
accepted for financing under the project and the ex-post ERR is expected to be much higher.
15.   Environmental Aspects. The project has a "B" environmental rating and the project is
expected to produce significant environmental benefits from soil and water conservation and from
more efficient irrigation water use. The proposed operation will fortify the institutional capacity of
FIRCO to carry out environmental assessments of new investments and to monitor environmental
issues in ongoing investments. Environmental issues would be covered as they are identified from the
environmental analyses in each investment before they are accepted for financing under the operation.



- 6 -
The project area would be in land now cultivated; no land clearing would be done under the project.
The project area would exclude all environmentally sensitive wetlands, wildilands, and lands severely
affected by salinity. The Bank's Operational Directive on pesticide use wili be applied to activities
financed under the project.
16.   Program Objective Category. The expected project impact on poverty will be indirect as
additional income and employment for small farmers and landless laborers will be generated through
incremental crop and livestock production and diversification into high-value crops like fruits and
vegetables.
17.   Project Risks. There are six principal risks potentially involved in the implementation of the
project: (i) lack of counter-part funding; (ii) lack of producer contributions; (iii) lack of appropriate
technical packages; (iv) failure of farmers to pay for private extension services; (v) failure to
adequately operate and maintain project investments; and (vi) lack of funds from rural banks to supply
credit to participating farmers. These risks have been and will be addressed by: (i) receipt of a first-
year budget commitment of Federal Government funds as a condition of negotiations; budget
commitments in subsequent years would be obtained during the annual project reviews; (ii) requiring
cost-sharing commitments by the producers before sub-project implementation; (iii) continuous review
by FIRCO's technical staff in order to ensure that unsuitable extension packages are quickly modified
to mtet actual requirements; (iv) competition among private extensionists to provide quality services
that farmers are willing to pay for; (v) transferring ownership, operation, and maintenance of project
investments to producer organizations; and (vi) estimating in the annual plan preparation each year's
financial needs and discussing them with commercial banks, to ensure that the needs and available
resources correspond.
18.    Recommcndation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
the Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
