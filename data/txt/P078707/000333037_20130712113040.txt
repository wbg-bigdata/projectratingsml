F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project Development Objectives are to
a) Create effective capacity within the Government (Ministry of Power, Energy and
   Mineral Resources) to put in place power sector policies, industry structures, and a gas
   supply strategy needed for a balanced development of Bangladesh's power sector.
b) Create capacity within the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to regulate the
   sector effectively.
c) Prepare and secure financing for, at least two well-structured power sector investment
   projects that are then efficiently implemented.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The PDOs were not revised.




                                            iii
(a) PDO Indicators

Originally, seven PDO Indicators were listed. The number of PDO Indicators was
reduced, however, during the project implementation, according to the regional guidance
for all projects. In the second ISR (April 14, 2005), when the baseline and target values
for each indicators was shown first time, the number of indicators were reduced from
original seven to six by merging Indicators 2 and 3. In the fifth ISR (November 9, 2006),
the number of indicators was reduced again from six to five by merging Indicators 4 and
6.

In the table shown below, data for “Baseline Value? and “Original Target Values? refer
to the fifth ISR and for “Actual Value Achieved at Completion or Target Years? to the
seventeenth ISR, archived on January 1, 2013, since these values were not clearly stated
in the PAD.

Since the reduction of the indicators was executed only in ISRs, the original seven
indicators listed in the PAD were used for this ICR report.

                                                                                  Formally        Actual Value Achieved

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal (2004), Bangladesh had performed well on many macroeconomic
indicators, was getting integrated into the world economy, and had achieved laudable progress
on several social indicators. While the progress of the 1990s was heartening on many fronts,
Bangladesh was still far short of its growth potential compared to most other low-income
countries, in large part because of the still-nascent stage of its infrastructure development. Low
electricity coverage (only 35 percent of households) and erratic electricity supply were, in
particular, major obstacles to economic growth and poverty alleviation. The energy sector’s
weak institutional framework and dismal financial situation were constraints to scaling up
investment and improving performance in the sector.

Faced with substantial challenges, the sector’s main development objectives were to (a) expand
access to efficient and reliable electricity services to the 65 percent of the population that did not
enjoy access at that time; (b) improve the quality of service to consumers who already had
access; (c) make the sector financially sustainable; and (d) revitalize service providers within an
enabling institutional framework.

Bangladesh’s power sector had already made some progress towards putting in place policy
measures to achieve these objectives, including, (a) policies for private power development (for
independent power producers (IPPs) and small power plants), (b) rationalization of power prices,
(c) improvements in the legal framework, (d) a promising model of rural electrification, (e)
advances in sector “unbundling? and utility corporatization, (f) adoption of an institutional
framework for the sector, and (g) a steady reduction in system losses. Despite these successes,
however, there were symptoms of continued systemic weaknesses, such as (i) poor sector
finances that creates pressure on public resources and undermined sound sector development; (ii)
a slow pace of institutional reform; and (iii) pervasive power outages that imposed a high cost on
the economy.1

The Bank had not processed any new lending operations to the energy sector in Bangladesh since
1990 due to the poor performance of the sector and an overall assessment of limited Government
commitment and capacity to undertake meaningful reforms. In 2002, the Bank approved the
Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development I (RERED I) project to support
electrification program in the rural area, though the Bank remained reluctant to finance a project
in the urban area due to the continued institutional and policy weakness.

It was in this context that the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) requested from the International
Development Association (IDA) financial assistance and global experience to help overcome the
prevailing capacity constraints and create the institutional framework envisaged in its Three-
Year Road Map for power sector reforms. Underlying this request was a growing

  Lost production because of power outages was US$772 million a year, equivalent to 11.5 percent of industrial
production and 1.7 percent of 2001-02 GDP, as per the study “Economic Impact of Poor Power Quality on Industry
- Bangladesh? carried out by the USAID-SARI Energy Program in 2002.


                                                       1
acknowledgment that a sound institutional and policy foundation was necessary for the effective
asset utilization and the substantial mobilization of much-needed financing for adequate
investments that could improve performance of the power sector and allow it to contribute more
fully to the country’s development.

The requested project was consistent with the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Executive Directors on December 12, 2000. Specifically, it complemented the
CAS objectives of better governance and private sector-led growth. By building institutional
capacity in a vital sector of the economy, the project aimed to support the government’s evolving
poverty alleviation strategy by eliminating a key bottleneck to a higher economic growth path.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objectives (PDOs) stated in the Development Financing Agreements
dated June 23, 2004 were to:2
(a) Create effective capacity within the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources
    (MPEMR) to put in place power sector policies and industry structures needed for the
    balanced development of Bangladesh’s power sector.
(b) Create regulatory capacity within the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) to
    regulate the sector effectively.
(c) Prepare and secure financing for at least two well-structured power sector investment
    projects that are then efficiently implemented.

As set out in the PAD, the PDOs were to be measured by the following seven key indicators:
1. Power sector policies adopted (particularly for underpinning financial recovery, faster access
   for all, and private participation), which are based on robust analysis and are consistent with
   principles of commercial viability with safeguards for social and environmental protection.
2. Regulatory processes in place, particularly for power tariff-setting and quality-of-service
   monitoring, which are effective in ensuring that customers receive acceptable levels of
   service at the least cost (based on a broadly accepted investment, operational, and financing
   plan).
3. Improved public perception of the power sector’s performance and customer satisfaction
   (measured through periodic surveys).
4. Corporate governance structures and policies put in place for at least two power enterprises,
   which would facilitate transparent and efficient decision-making, efficient and accountable
   management, and credible and timely monitoring of performance (including accounting and
   audit arrangements consistent with international practices).
5. Gas Sector Master Plan and Strategy (GSMPS) updated, ensuring it includes a strategy for
   meeting gas demand from power, industry and other sectors.
6. Management and operations of at least two power enterprises improved through the
   participation of qualified global experts.
2
    PDO (a) in the PAD has an additional phrase, “a gas supply strategy?, after “…industry structures.?


                                                             2
7. Monitoring, reporting, and invoicing of power flows between “unbundled? enterprises based
   on accurate system metering.

1.3 Revised PDOs and Key Indicators, and Reasons and Justification

The PDOs and the indicators were not formally revised during project implementation. However,
from November 2006, the PDOs were monitored using five PDO indicators (not seven) in the
Implementation Status and Results (ISR) Reports (indicators 2 and 3, and indicators 4 and 6 were
merged as explained in section F of the Data Sheet). This change was based on the regional
management guidelines to reduce the number of PDO indicators to five for effective monitoring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Originally intended beneficiaries of the project were the main institutions dealing with the
broader power and natural gas sectors, as well as the sector utilities. In particular, the direct
beneficiaries were the three governmental implementing agencies (IAs) - Power Cell (PC),
Petrobangla (PB), and BERC; the power and gas utilities (as reviewers and recipients of
outputs3); and the MPEMR (as the supervisory ministry). IPPs, captive power suppliers, and
local/global power sector investors were beneficiaries of investment promotion activities
supported by the project. The new policies, strategies, regulations, and investment opportunities
supported by the project were expected to eventually benefit the end-users through increased
electricity connectivity, supply better services, and longer-term access to the power sector.

1.5 Original Components

The project originally comprised the following five components:

A. Technical Assistance (US$5.5 million)
    A.1 Power Sector - Policy Making and Enterprise Restructuring (US$3.5 million) to provide
    the government (Power Division/PC) with the consulting support to scale up sector reforms
    by preparing a detailed restructuring plan, using this plan to shape government policies and
    the regulatory arrangements, and creating corporate structures for at least two urban
    electricity distribution entities.
    A.2 Energy Sector Regulatory Framework (US$0.5 million) to be defined after the BERC is
    staffed, and to complement activities being funded from other sources.
    A.3 Gas Sector Support (US$1.5 million) to assist the Energy and Mineral Resources
    Division of the MPEMR to strengthen planning and management capacity; prepare and
    update the GSMPS; and for PB to prepare implementation and financing plans, which will
    ensure reliable and adequate gas supply to power, industry, and other sectors.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

No significant changes to the project were made during implementation. The only changes made
to the project were reallocation of funds to provide additional resources for some fast-moving
categories and new tasks and time extensions to allow for completion of some ongoing/planned
tasks. The project was extended twice for a total extension of four years and finally closed on
December 31, 2012. In October 2012, an amount of SDR 0.51 million of credit funds was
cancelled, as it was not expected to be utilized by the project closing date.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis. The background analysis for the design of the PSDTA was
well executed at entry, as shown in Annex 1 in the PAD. A robust analysis, which included a
matrix on utility commercial and financial performance, was carried out on the country context,
power sector issues, and the challenges of scaling up development of the power sector. The
analysis examined the Government’s reform framework and concluded that accelerating sector
development would require substantial financial investment.

The analysis precisely captured the situation of the energy sector at the time of project
preparation. The power sector was facing growing demand as access to electricity was expanding
at 11.5 percent (about 500,000 new connections added) per year. As a result, unmet demand
remained high, even though peak demand served rose from approximately 1,600 MW in 1991 to
3,600MW in 2003. At the same time, the sector remained financially unsustainable, with system
losses as high as 25 percent due to many factors, including poor planning, inadequate
maintenance, and transmission and distribution equipment failures. Tariffs remained below costs,
despite increases in average tariffs of 5 percent in both January and August 2002. Since tariffs


                                                 4
were still below the costs, the sector significantly relied on subsidies from the Government.
Accumulated account receivables in the sector piled up to the equivalent of 4.6 percent of GDP.
While the need for additional investment was clear, the analysis convincingly concluded that the
creation of sound institutions, policies, and an enabling framework was essential to attracting
such investment and realizing its potential.

In May 2003, the Government adopted the Three-Year Road Map for Power Sector Reform,
aimed at accelerating the slow pace of reforms in order to attract the substantial investments
needed to provide electricity to all in a sustainable manner by 2020. The Government then asked
IDA for assistance with overcoming prevailing capacity constraints and creating the institutional
framework to implement the Road Map. It portrayed this as an urgent need. Therefore, it was
rational for the Bank to provide the TA to implement sector reforms involving multiple
stakeholders, to prepare a well-structured investment program, and to help the Government
mobilize the private and public financing for expanding access and improving service quality.

Some core lessons from past IDA projects that had successfully created and strengthened the
institutional and policy foundation for the sector were taken into account for the project. For
example, past lending by IDA and other development partners to state-owned entities in the
energy sector over the past decade resulted in short-term performance improvements that were
not sustained because the projects did not achieve institutional reforms. This project therefore
included a strong capacity development to generate sector reform. Another lesson was that
institutional development requires focused attention from a competent and empowered reform
team within Government to coordinate, debate, arbitrate, disseminate, and implement consultant
recommendations. Thus, the PSDTA provided the reform implementation tools to the
Government, which could then be supported through investment and lending.

Assessment of Project Design. When the project was being prepared, other donors had proposed
a number of development projects that lacked effective sector coordination mechanisms, and the
Bank had not provided lending support to the energy sector for a long time. The energy sector in
the country was in great need of capacity support to (a) make sound decisions about which
proposed projects should be undertaken with what prioritization, (b) prepare investment projects
according to such prioritization, and (c) create an enabling environment for these investments to
be realized and yield services improvement. Thus, this project, with its strong TA support, was
appropriately designed to meet the country and sector needs.

The project design reflected all of the outcomes that the Government aimed to achieve within the
scope of energy sector reform over the three-to-five years following PSDTA preparation.
Specifically, these were: (a) an effective separation of policy making, regulation, and service
providers; (b) improved utilization of existing assets and manpower through an optimal mix of
better corporate governance, regulation, and investment in infrastructure; (c) transparency and
efficiency in selection, financing, procurement, and implementation of investment projects; and
(d) preparation, adoption, and concerted implementation of a realistic financial rehabilitation and
recovery plan. In addition, to establish an effective sector coordination mechanism, the
Government agreed to invite development partners to a meeting every six to 12 months to review
progress in implementing the Three-Year Road Map.



                                                 5
The PDOs selected were highly relevant to the challenges that the energy sector was facing. The
main constraints to sector development - lack of sound institutions and policies, and financial
mobilization - were well-targeted through the PDOs. Specifically, the PDOs focused on the
policy, institutions, and regulations for improving the enabling environment to complement the
investments committed by other donors. The project components were also well structured, since
they were highly relevant and supportive to the achievement of the PDOs. To maximize the
benefits from the sectoral and institutional reforms, the project also provided TA to prepare
investment projects to mobilize investment financing for the sector.

However, the project design may have been too ambitious in its estimation of the implementation
period of the TA given the Government’s limited institutional capacity and the large number of
implementing and beneficiary agencies. The project implementation plan of four and a half years
was clearly very ambitious given its objectives of long-term capacity building and the
weaknesses of the institutions in the Bangladesh power sector. This is particularly evident in the
fact that the project had to be extended for four additional years.

Assessment of Government Commitment. The GOB was and has remained highly committed to
the project objectives. This commitment has been demonstrated, for example, in its assignment
of high-level officials to guide and review the project. In particular, PC was assigned to be the
leading organization of the project implementation, and a high-level Project Steering Committee,
headed by the Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office was formed to review policy
recommendations arising from the project activities. A Task Force headed by the Secretary,
Power Division, was established to provide more frequent operational guidance to and
coordination for the project and was responsible for reviewing overall policy recommendations.
Furthermore, the GOB promised to establish and functionalize BERC as one of the IAs of the
project. Although achievement of this promise was delayed, the GOB did functionalize BERC in
2007.

Assessment of Risk. The appraisal document correctly identified the overall risk rating at
appraisal to be substantial, as the project was significantly more ambitious than a typical TA
project. However, it included appropriate risk mitigation measures. For example, the operation
was prepared and implemented in conjunction with several policy reform and investment
projects that provided additional policy leverage and financing support in support of the overall
development objectives.

The appraisal document appropriately highlighted the risks of strengthening PC and
operationalizing the regulatory body, BERC, and empowering them to shape sector policies,
regulations, and reforms. Among the other seven major potential risks identified in the PAD,
four of them indeed proved to be major risks during implementation: (a) the politicization of key
appointments to new institutions, (b) the obstruction of reform by vested quarters, (c)
procurement/other procedural delays, and (d) frequent transfers of ministry and agency key
officers. Although mitigation measures were identified for each of the potential risks, and the
GOB took some steps to empower policy support and regulatory bodies (e.g., strengthening
staffing of PC) during appraisal, some aspects of these risks were outside the control of the
project. They necessitated broader elements of civil service reform over the medium-to-long
term, but appointments in PC and BERC continued to be subject to three-to-five year terms. The


                                                 6
realization of some of these identified risks led to some of the issues encountered during project
implementation - specifically, the implementation delays and the resistance to corporatization of
power companies.

2.2 Implementation

Slow Startup and Implementation Delays. At the outset, issues arising from adverse factors and
the design of implementation arrangements caused significantly delays in project implementation
by delaying procurement and other task completion. The adverse factors included frequent
transfers of the Power Division Secretary, periodic transfer/removal of key PC and PB staff, and
occasional understaffing in PC and BERC. The main complication with the implementation
arrangements were that PC was the IA for the entire Power Sector Component, which was an
implementation bottleneck, as the beneficiary power utilities preferred to implement their
activities directly rather than routing through PC. Another complication with the IAs was that
project funds were implemented through two different divisions of the Ministry of Power,
requiring frequent meetings to review project processing and eventual streamlining of
implementation. A final factor that significantly delayed project implementation was that BERC
was established in April 2003 yet took four years to access project assistance due to the delays
from the administrative apparatus in the Government.

From 2007 onwards, however, project implementation improved substantially, and this improved
performance continued till the end of the project. The Power Secretaries were highly committed
to the agenda and took personal initiative to resolve the implementation bottlenecks. As a result,
project implementation was expedited and smoothened. Personnel appointments to BERC, in
particular the appointment to BERC of an activist chairman in 2007, also helped move the
project agenda forward and make PSDTA component A.2 (Energy Sector Regulatory
Framework) operational. As a result, BERC started to access project funds in 2008 (refer to
Annex 2 for detailed outputs and outcomes).

Government Commitment to Sector Issues. A key factor that supported the project
implementation positively was the GOB’s continued commitment to the broader reform agenda,
which it demonstrated in several ways. This commitment sustained despite a change in
government and was reiterated in various public fora and recorded documents, including the
annual review of the Three-Year Power Reform Road Map. In particular, continued high-level
monitoring of key outputs, indicators and performance measures was a critical positive factor in
influencing overall project outcomes by providing appropriate high-level management attention
to and timely resolution of emerging issues. For example, the Ministry and the Power Division
regularly reviewed the progress of the Results Matrix triggers and convened annual briefings
almost every year for development partners. These focused on the progress achieved on
implementing power sector institutional and policy reforms, summarizing how sector operations
were aligned with the evolving sector structure and policies. Inter-IA issues were periodically
discussed to resolve implementation issues, such as reallocation of funding categories, ramping
up of disbursement, time extension, and finalization of the procurement plan to finance new or
large tasks.




                                                 7
The flow of public funds to the sector was regularly communicated to the sector stakeholders,
development partners and people at large through websites. The Government’s, BERC’s, and
utilities’ websites publish power and gas sector statistics, progress, procurement, and other
necessary information for greater transparency and access to information on the sector.

Additionally, the GOB’s commitment and political support to power and gas distribution
governance improvement persisted through the change of government. The respective divisions
of the Power Ministry also continued to support and monitor the systems loss reduction and
collection drives, the power sector financial restructuring and recovery plan, and the sector
corporatization plans, all of which helped them achieve the non-tariff measures of the power
sector financial restructuring plan and improve utility finances.

Mid-term Review and Restructuring. In the August 2007 mid-term review, the GOB requested a
2.5-year extension of the project term to allow for completion of ongoing tasks and improve the
disbursement ratio from the then 15.4 percent. The project performance rating at that time was
“Moderately Satisfactory? for the Development Objective (DO) and “Moderately Unsatisfactory?
for Implementation Progress (IP); together these ratings prevented the project extension. To
upgrade the project rating to Satisfactory, the Government agreed to complete three key actions:
(a) increasing the capacity of Power Cell by hiring at least three experts in the fields of finance,
information technology, and engineering; (b) awarding the contract for the Owner’s Engineer to
the Siddhirganj Peaking Power Project (SPPP); and (c) preparing the bid evaluation report for the
power system interface metering contract. The IAs completed almost all key actions within six
months. The project rating was then upgraded to “Satisfactory? for DO and “Moderately
Satisfactory? for IP by the implementation support mission of December 2007, which made the
project extension possible. Further, project restructurings were carried out as needed to fit with
the fast-evolving sector development, meet the emerging demands of the clients, keep the project
relevant, and respond to the project implementation delays.

Complementary Bank Operations. As noted above, complementary interventions by the Bank
and other multilateral partners were integral in supporting the overall development objectives of
this TA operation. The Bank’s four multi-sectoral development policy loans (DPLs) and one
Power DPL (totaling US$720 million in budget support) provided complementary support to the
implementation of PSDTA, as these had several energy sector triggers for improving utility
finances and creating an enabling environment to i) reduce account receivables, ii) reduce system
loss, iii) prepare and implement a financial recovery plan, iv) establish BERC, v) upgrade energy
prices and specially index petroleum prices to international fuel oil price, vi) reduce Bangladesh
Petroleum Corporation’s debt, etc. Other donors, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
also provided additional TA in parallel and supported the preparation of the 2006-Power System
Master Plan, corporatization of BPDB, and the preparation of investment projects in power
generation and transmission. All the above tasks were aligned to the capacity building objectives
of the sector and contributed to achieving the sector’s main development objectives. USAID also
supported capacity building of BERC and helped it draft and finalize several regulations. With
Australian Government Overseas Aid Program (AusAid) trust funds executed by the World Bank,
six energy sector companies designed for themselves Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to
strengthen corporate governance and accountability. All six energy sector companies have signed



                                                 8
an MOU to adopt KPIs with the Power Division. The KPIs are part of PDO indicator 4 of
PSDTA.

Though these projects started off well, towards the end of the project period, the Bank support to
the energy sector in Bangladesh suffered a significant setback. Concerned with the country-wide
quality of the governance of procurement arrangements in the sector, the Bank and some other
financiers withdrew much of their support. This led to significant delays in the financial closure
of some of the expected IPPs, as some of these had planned to approach the World Bank for
financial guarantees. At the time of finalizing this ICR, some of these IPPs are now closer to
reaching financial closure by tapping different financing sources, including other parts of the
World Bank Group, such as IFC and the MIGA.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

Monitoring and Evaluation Design. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of PDO achievement
based on the PDO indicators was difficult. In part, this was simply the result of the nature of a
TA project that includes sector reforms; in such projects, the indicators are somewhat perforce
subjective, and it is difficult to foresee outputs, outcomes, and degrees of achievement at project
entry. However, the linkage between the PDOs and indicators was also unclear, and there were
no specific baseline and target values in the PAD (likely as a result of the challenge of foreseeing
outcomes). Another cause of this M&E challenge was that the project was designed when the
Bank still used a logical framework in project appraisal.

In addition, as explained in the section 1.3, the original seven PDO indicators were reduced to
five, by merging PDO indicators 2 and 3 in the second ISR (April 14, 2005) and merging
indicators 4 and 6 in the fifth ISR (November 9, 2006) in response to the regional guidance for
all projects to make the implementation monitoring more manageable. As a result, however,
monitoring of some of the indicators lacked continuity.

M&E Implementation and Utilization. As noted in section 2.2 (paragraph “Government
Commitment to Sector Issues?), the GOB set up good systems for monitoring project
implementation. The Government’s Task Force for power sector reform, chaired by the Power
Secretary, regularly reviewed the project processing progress, outputs and policy
recommendations and provided guidance for and endorsements of outputs and policy decisions.
The project results were duly monitored and utilized appropriately by the ministry, IAs, and
utilities through the preparation and adoption of a financial recovery plan; a corporate
governance framework design for Siddhirganj and South Zone; an O&M contract design; the
IPP contract revision; an interagency transaction design (PPA and GSA); a generation support
framework and updated power system master plan (prepared with ADB support); a gas sector
master plan and strategy and its updating; energy pricing policies; and monitoring of sector
performance and procurement data, including publishing such data on websites.

The GOB used the results of project M&E in a variety of mechanisms to increase sector
transparency and enhance public understanding of tariff reform. As a periodic survey method to
monitor public perception of power sector’s performance and customer satisfaction, a public
hearing has been held during electricity weeks every year. Information regarding the improved


                                                  9
power supply and utility services was disclosed to the public through the IAs’ websites, some of
which were developed with funds provided by the PSDTA, to enhance a public understanding on
the necessity and effectiveness of the sector reform and tariff increases. BERC, strengthened
with project support, has been carrying out utility tariff reviews in connection with every utility’s
tariff application and seeking public opinions in this regard through websites and media
advertisements. This provides scope for transparent flow and dissemination of sector information
including utility performance improvements and customer satisfaction. In addition, the EMR
Division, PB, and operating companies prepared and disseminated, with BERC support, a report
on “Communication Strategy and Campaign for Natural Gas and Energy Reforms? that created
awareness and support in favor of gas sector reforms and pricing within stakeholders and
consumers.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards. The project was categorized C, and no safeguards policies were triggered.

Fiduciary. The process of finalizing project outputs from the procurement stage and approving
and implementing policy decisions was time consuming and burdensome. The concerned IAs
from time to time asked for simplification of the process including some delegation of authority.
The IAs did not have the incentives to efficiently implement the TA. The GOB and the IAs did
not prefer to supervise firm-level contracts, as these took away their valuable operational time.
They rather preferred using high-quality individual consultants housed in their offices and
making them available full time with resolution of issues and with advice.

As of the project closing date, PC had settled all outstanding audit observations. At the earlier
part of the project, PB failed to report project activities in entity audit reports. After the Bank's
follow-ups, however, reporting of project activities in entity audit reports began and continued
till closing of the project. Financial management computerization of BERC and its audited report
for FY 2012 were not completed by the project closing date. However, BERC's audit report for
2012 has now been completed and reviewed by the Bank. Disbursements were very slow due to
slow project implementation until the second project restructuring in November 2008 and the
project implementation support mission in June 2009. After that, disbursement improved
consistently, and final disbursement reached 92 percent (or SDR 9.35 million) by the project
closing date.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation and Next Phase

Given the long-term nature of institutional development and sector reform objectives, continued
support to these core sector agencies (PC, PB, and BERC) is needed to continue and sustain the
sector reform process and to secure financing to facility development. The support provided
through PSDTA went a long way towards furthering the development of institutional capacity of
these institutions, but - as would be expected of sector institutions at the level of development of
Bangladesh - a significant agenda remains. The GOB has sought continued Bank support to help
complete the agenda. They requested financial support for seven activities that the Bank agreed
to support under a TA of Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development II (RERED
II) project recently approved by the Bank. It is presently under implementation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

The objectives of project are still highly relevant for the country’s priorities and are reflected in
the Bank’s current CAS for Bangladesh. Specifically, the project objectives are relevant for the
CAS pillar “Accelerate Growth: Increase Transformative Investment and Enhance the Business
Environment?, stated in Strategic Objective #1 in the 2010 CAS. The power deficit is cited as the
biggest constraint to doing business in Bangladesh. Thus, fulfilling this objective requires a
sustainable, broad-based investment program that includes conventional new capacity,
rehabilitation of older capacity, and additional natural gas supply. In addition, one of the risks to
achieving results under the CAS is “weak institutional capacity?, and institutional capacity
development is recognized as a long-term agenda. PSDTA took the first steps toward providing
the relevant support to address the sector weaknesses, though further support will be required to
address this long-term agenda.

The project design was appropriately aligned with the GOB’s “Three-Year Road Map for Power
Sector Reform (2009-2012)?, particularly through its focus on improving policy and regulatory
frameworks, developing capacity in the power sector, preparing energy sector projects, and
making progress on the GOB’s corporatization agenda. These were very relevant and adequate
objectives to accelerate the power sector’s institutional and policy reforms program, improve
utility finances, and create an enabling institutional framework to revitalize the service providers.

The project implementation was commendably kept relevant, particularly in its flexibility in
adjusting project activities in response to obstacles and a changing country environment. For
example, it added, dropped, and adjusted the activities from the project’s original plan based on
discussion and agreement with the GOB, the IAs, the Bank, and other donors, such as the ADB
and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Some dropped activities were
completed by PC in-house officers or executed by other donors instead of using PSDTA funds.
New activities were added based on emerging demands, such as for partial support to prepare
new investment projects.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives: Satisfactory

Achievement of each component of the PDO is assessed against the subset of the seven PDO
indicators listed in the PAD relevant to that component. Annex 2 provides more details on
achievement of the indicators, and Annex 6 illustrates that achievement with graphs and tables.

Achievement of PDO (a) Create effective capacity within the MPEMR to put in place
power sector policies and industry structures needed for the balanced development of
Bangladesh’s power sector, measured against PDO indicators 1, 5, and 7, was rated
Satisfactory. Through the critical studies and the development and adoption of vital sector
policies and strategies under PSDTA, a significant capacity in systems planning, private
participation promotion, and financial recovery has been established in both the power and gas
sectors. The training programs also contributed to the effective capacity building of PC,


                                                  11
according to the information obtained from participants of 56 trainings (details shown in Annex
4). Result/PDO indicator-wise achievement of outcomes is noted below.

The target for PDO indicator 1 was fully achieved. Five robust studies were completed, and
seven power sector policies4 were prepared, approved, and adopted. These outputs contributed to
the major outcomes in the power sector, such as (a) increased electricity generation capacity -
achieved 8,525 MW installed capacity exceeding the 7,158 MW target by December 2012 of the
Power System Master Plan, with 3,922 MW added by private IPPs after 2004, 3,207 MW under
construction, and 3,635 MW under process; (b) utility balance sheet cleaning for the country’s
power sector continued, including making within- and inter-utility adjustments and keeping long-
term debts in provision; (c) a significant reduction in system losses (or cost of services) from
20.04 percent in 2004 to 12.26 percent in 2012; (d) a significant reduction in accounts receivable
from 6.45 months in 2004 to 2.21 months in 2012; and (e) improved operating income to the
power sector.

The target for PDO indicator 5 was fully achieved. The Gas Sector Master Plan and Strategy
(GSMPS) has been developed, approved, and adopted. The GSMPS has been guiding the actual
investment and development programs in the gas sector. In total, PB completed six studies
related to the GSMPS. The GSMPS revealed that the country’s domestic gas supply capacity
would diminish after 2020 as reserves dry up. As a result, the government decided to gradually
shift electricity generation to combined cycle and coal-based thermal power plants to reduce gas
consumption and to start importing LNG to balance domestic gas supply. PSDTA activities were
therefore modified to fund preparation for construction of an LNG import terminal.

The target for PDO indicator 7 was fully achieved. The power system interface metering system
with 415 meters was installed in 2011 based on an in-house assessment by PC with Bank
supervision support in 2006-07. As a result, inter-utility disputes on energy flow have been
reduced, and invoices have been published based on accurate readings of the system meters.

Achievement of PDO (b) Create capacity within the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory
Commission (BERC) to regulate the sector effectively, measured against PDO indicators 2
and 3, was also rated Satisfactory. BERC is functioning and regulating the power sector
adequately with in-house capacity built with PSDTA through various studies, preparation of
technical standards and codes, reviewing and processing license applications, and preparation
and enforcement of tariff regulations. BERC received trainings on related areas under PSDTA
that also built capacity in the institution (details are in Annex 4).

Toward PDO indicator 2, six regulations on licensing and energy tariffs (excluding for petroleum
products) were prepared, and four of them have become effective. Based on regulations in place,


4
  Seven power sector policies prepared were 1) Private Sector Power Generation Policy(amended in 2004 & 2009),
2) Policy Guidelines for Power Purchase from Captive Power Plant (2007), 3) Policy Guidelines for Enhancement of
Private Participation in the Power Sector(2008), 4) Guidelines for Remote Area Power Supply System(RAPSS)
(2007), 5) Renewable Energy Policy(2008), 6) . Emergency Energy & Power Supply Special Act (2010), and 7)
National Energy Policy (updated in 2012), as shown in “Outputs? for Indicator 1 in Annex 2.



                                                       12
1,460 licenses (1,250 for electricity sector and 210 for gas sector) and 43 tariff orders (excluding
for petroleum products) and directives were issued between 2008 and 2012. As a result,
wholesale and retail electricity tariffs were increased by 118 percent (from USC 3.09/kWh to
USC 6.71/kWh) and 62 percent (from USC 5.09/kWh to USC 8.21/kWh), respectively, after
2008. This is a significant contribution to the financial recovery and sustainability of the power
sector. Different categories of gas tariffs were also increased by between 8 percent and 79.1
percent after 2008. In total, four technical and financial codes and standards were prepared to
realize the least-cost investment. The Power Factor Improvement Plan was developed and
implemented. As a result, customers are receiving improved power supply and utility service:
electricity access increased (from 35 percent in 2004 to 60 percent in 2012); utility services,
especially from DESCO and DPDC) improved; and per-capita consumption increased (from 133
kWh in 2004 to 220 kWh in 2012). Setting tariff regulations (or benchmarks) by BERC made
private investment to the energy sector more attractive: four IPPs expressed interests, and three
among them developed power plants to sell electricity to the grid.

PDO indicator 3 was partially achieved. Public perception of the power sector’s performance and
customer satisfaction were monitored through a public hearing held during electricity week every
year. However, there is no way to capture and trace the improvement of public perception
quantitatively for these sector performance and customer satisfaction. The project developed a
mechanism to provide information on better sector performance and services to customers. Now
people have improved access to disclosed energy sector data and operations, including on utility
operational and commercial performance, acts, regulations, codes, tariff orders, public hearings,
procurement notices, and open meeting notices, through BERC and respective utility websites.
Online application for new connections was established. Electricity bill-pay facilities, including
automated teller machine (ATM), mobile phone, and online, were also improved.

Achievement of PDO (c) Prepare, and secure financing for, at least two well-structured
power sector investment projects that are then efficiently implemented, measured against
PDO indicators 4 and 6, was rated Moderately Satisfactory. The target of PDO indicator 4 was
partially achieved. The project targeted to establish corporate governance and relevant operations
in SPPP and the South Zone Power Distribution Company (SZPDC) and provide preparations
support to them. PSDTA prepared six investment projects in power generation, transmission,
distribution; energy efficiency; and gas transmission and distribution. Two well-structured power
sector investment projects (SPPP and SZPDC) were fully prepared, but financing was secured
only for the SPPP. Although the SZPDC was also considered for Bank financing, the Bank had
to hold the financing because of backtracking of corporatization in the power sector and the
Government’s inability to move ahead with the SZPDC corporatization. This was, however,
beyond the control of PSDTA.

Four other investment projects (except SPPP and SZPDC) - (a) Siddhirganj 335 MW Combined
Cycle Power Project, (b) Ghorasal Repowering Project for increasing power generation
efficiency, (c) NG-3 and NG-4 400 kV Transmission Project; and (d) the Remote Metering
Project - were prepared with the intention of obtaining Bank financing. However, the Bank was
not able to proceed with the appraisal of these projects for financing due to the Bank’s
suspension of financing large infrastructure projects.

Taking into account of the experiences of the corporatization program of the Bangladesh Power
Development Board (BPDB), which caused opposition to the corporatization agenda due to fear
of job loss in energy sector, the government is now considering following a new model for
unbundling: the Strategic Business Unit (SBU) model. The SBU model establishes separate
business units within the parent company (in this case, the BPDB) that have relatively
independent decision making in business operations and clearly defined accountability. Under
this model, each SBU will have to introduce KPIs in order to maintain accountability,
transparency, and good governance through continuous monitoring, evaluation, and
responsibility fixation. Under a separate capacity development program supported by the AusAid,
six corporatized entities of power and gas sectors developed separate KPIs that encouraged the
Power Division to enter into MOUs with its utilities on the KPIs. In early 2012, the Power
Division signed an MOU to adopt selective KPIs with all of the power sector entities.

PDO indicator 6 was achieved. Efforts were made in improving the governance and management
of enterprises in the energy sector. Management and operational support with global expertise
was provided to two power enterprises: the BPDB and the EGCB. PSDTA provided global and
local expertise to various utilities (the BPDB, the EGCB, and the Rural Electrification Board
(REB)) to help with investment project preparation; company governance framework design and
implementation; financial modeling and tariff analysis; design of transactions, including
operation and maintenance contracts; an institutional effectiveness study; high-quality
procurement; and environmental and social impact assessments. This has resulted in improved
management and operations capacity of these utilities. Contract documents for several
engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and IPP power plants were also reviewed and
prepared with the support of global expertise. Design of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
System has been advanced with PSDTA for EGCB and Gas Transmission Company Limited
(GTCL).

Based on the assessment of achievement of the individual PDOs, the consolidated PDO
achievement is rated Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

From a cost-benefit viewpoint, the project was excellent. With only limited investment (US$15.5
million), the project achieved tremendous outputs and outcomes in the country’s energy sector.
These included cost recovery, financial sustainability, increased generation capacity, increased
access, improved customer services, institutional capacity development, adoption of explicit
policies, legally vetted regulations, transparent project selection, better management and decision
making, and private investment. In addition, the project prepared at least six projects (one project
was implemented with Bank financing, and five of them are now ready to implement), totaling
more than several-hundred-million US dollars, and other donors are already interested in
financing some of them.

Time-wise, the project efficiency was not up to the mark. The project period was extended by a
total of 48 months through two restructurings, neither of which increased the project financing
nor expanded the PDOs. In other words, the project required an additional four years to achieve
its original PDOs. However, this extension is likely due to an overly ambitious original time


                                                 14
estimate rather than to project inefficiencies. Technical support for sector reform typically takes
a long time, and delays in the initial few years are common while new institutions are put in
place, competitive resources are acquired, and procurements occur. Therefore, in such projects,
the outputs and the outcomes are often delivered only at the late stage. In fact, legal vetting for
regulations, tariff orders, corporatization of utilities, adoption of improved governance and
management, new projects preparation, and studies were only realized in the last a few years of
the PSDTA. Therefore, an earlier closing of the project would not have allowed for delivery of
the significant outputs and outcomes that will sustain the project’s impact in the long term.

Evaluation of efficiency through economic and financial analysis was not applicable to the
project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Achievement of PDO-Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of the project is Satisfactory based on the large number of outputs
and significant outcomes achieved in a critical sector. The outcomes are expected to deliver
significant positive impacts in both the near and distant future. Significant outcomes included the
commissioning of new power generation capacity that went beyond the targets of system
expansion planning, with active private participation. A robust financial restructuring and
recovery plan was prepared to restore the sector’s financial creditworthiness, and its tariff and
non-tariff measures are being implemented across the board. Institutional arrangements for sector
regulation - particularly power sector regulation - were put into place, and the regulatory body
became adequately functional, especially in setting power tariffs in-house and monitoring service
quality. A corporate governance framework and international management practices were
introduced to the targeted public enterprises in the energy sector, and many more than the
planned investment projects were prepared for implementation, though only one of them reached
financial closure due to issues beyond the control of PSDTA.

Institutional Change/Strengthening. The most important institutional change PSDTA brought
about in the power sector is the elimination of hostility and resistance of the service providers to
power sector reforms and against PC and the ministries, particularly by rejecting
recommendations and actions on Power Sector Reforms and the Three-Year Reform Road Map.
The Power Division, especially in the latter years of PSDTA, succeeded in bringing together all
of the utilities and PC under one umbrella on sector reform strategy, regulations, and
transmission and distribution expansion program.

In 2009-10, the GOB embarked upon a massive power generation expansion program supported
by a fuel diversification program that established the GOB position in terms of accelerating
procurement and finalizing contracts of both public and private power plants. This is in contrast
to the slow pace of tendering/retendering of public and private power plants in the earlier regime.
PSDTA provided strong technical and procurement support with high quality global technical,
financial and legal expertise to make this happen. All project implementing agencies and utilities
involved developed capacity (which was significant on some areas) in sector reforms and
strategy, financial recovery, regulatory response and tariff filing, development planning, physical
project preparation, implementation, operations and maintenance of assets, procurement,
financial management, and supervision of consultants, through the project.


                                                 15
PC expanded its position in the sector as a “think tank? for the power sector to assist in solving
technical problems and carrying out analytical work. It plays an advisory role to the Power and
Energy Ministry on inter-utility and gas-to-power issues and on long-term power sector planning,
and participates in all IPP and EPC procurement of GOB/BPDB. BERC became operational as
the energy regulator and is demonstrating its due role to issues service providers’ licenses and
power tariff orders. The mindset of the power sector has changed through PSDTA
implementation and the institutions concerned have acquired confidence and motivation for
sector reforms and development.

The Power and EMR Divisions; PC, PB, and BERC; and the power and gas utilities acquired
targeted institutional and policy capacity. Capacity building in policy formulation and
implementation, investment promotion, utility operations, project preparation/implementation,
and regulations contributed to achieving the sector’s development objectives. Utilities in both
electricity and gas sectors benefitted from improved financial, planning, and operational
performance; customer service; and an enabling environment. The project also contributed to
creating a favorable investment climate and attracting more private capital to the energy sector.
The new policies, strategies, regulations, and investment opportunities benefitted the end-users
through increased connectivity, electricity supply and better services; and better information
about sector updates. The government and all citizens were able to benefit from the
supply/service of a scaled-up and improving power sector (refer to Annex-2 for outputs and
outcomes).

3.5 Summary Findings of Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshop

As part of the ICR preparation, a Stakeholder Consultation Workshop for PSDTA was scheduled.
However, due to frequent strikes and hartals in Bangladesh in recent months, the workshop had
to be cancelled, so an opportunity to get stakeholders’ opinions directly was missed. However,
according to the Borrower’s Implementation Completion Report (ICR) attached in Annex 5, the
IAs were satisfied with the project and evaluated it as successful. They noted, for example, that
discipline, transparency, and accountability in the energy sector have been established; operating
efficiency improved; prepared policies by the project created attractive investment environment
to private investors; sector regulations supported financial recovery; credibility to future
investment from donors improved; systematic development of the sector was achieved; quality of
services improved; and customer satisfaction improved.

The questionnaires on quality of training received and how to apply the obtained knowledge and
techniques to actual jobs and tasks were distributed to all invitees to the workshop, and their
answer sheets were received by email by February 24, 2013. Answers were obtained from 61
respondents (the response rate was 60 percent). Obtained data and information are summarized
in Annex 4. In general, trainees were satisfied with the qualities of the training provided.

Based on the results of the data analysis, the training programs contributed to the outputs and
outcomes of PSDTA quite efficiently:
    - Among the 49 training programs that respondents participated in, 80 percent were linked
      to produce outputs and outcomes of PSDTA. High Relevance.



                                                16
   -   Eighty-three percent of the trainees actually participated to produce outputs and outcomes
       of PSDTA. High Participation and Motivation.
   -   Fifty-nine percent of the outputs and outcomes of PSDTA were produced by applying
       knowledge and techniques obtained through the training programs. High On-the-Job
       Application of Acquired Knowledge.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome: Moderate

In terms of the sustainability of the capacity building through the training activities, only eight of
the 16 PC officers who worked during the PSDTA project period remained with PC only eight of
the 15 officers who took at least one of the PSDTA training programs remained at BERC. No
information regarding officer turnover ratio for PB was available. However, at a working level,
frequent turnover or transfer was not observed in PB, and PB retained the last Project Director
for more than five years. The capacity of PC and BERC was indeed affected by staff turnover.
Since there have been no mitigation measures to dissuade them from leaving, maintaining the
capacity developed in PC and BERC through the project is a challenge. Fortunately, all the
senior staff who retired from the PC and other power utilities during PSDTA have remained
active in the energy sector; therefore, capacity earned through PSDTA has not been fully lost.

The risk that development outcomes are not maintained is moderate. As explained in Section 3.2,
the sector policies and regulations and industry structures formulated are now widely accepted,
and there was significant capacity improvement within the Ministry of Power and BERC for
policy formulation and sector regulation. Through successive tariff increases and decreasing
system losses, the Government has also demonstrated its ability to make movement towards
sector financial sustainability and improvements in service.

However, further improvements in sector performance to scale up the development outcomes
will require a continued improvement in overall sector governance and transparency in decision
making to continue to attract private and public sector financing in all ends of the sector.
Continued resistance to corporatization from entities such as the South Zone Corporation gives
some cause for caution. At the moment, the Government has given in to resistance of
corporatization over its fear of losing utility employees. Instead, the Government is promoting
the SBU model, which establishes separate business units with independent decision making
power on business operations and clearly defined accountability. Under this model, however, the
Government needs to make continuous efforts to accomplish adoption of KPIs for its targeted
SBUs (to maintain accountability, transparency, and good governance) and to monitor, evaluate,
and fix responsibility every six months. At this moment, without a market test, it is uncertain
whether the SBU model with KPIs will take firm hold in the energy sector.

To sustain the outcomes achieved by the PSDTA, such as attracting private investment and
setting cost-recovery tariffs, the energy sector needs to make continuous progress toward
improving the accountability of its management, transparency in decision making, and service
quality, among others. This is now being taken care of by the TA of RERED II, where PC is still
the IA and can use the capacity it acquired through the PSDTA.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Satisfactory
Background analysis was done well; lessons learned from previous operations were taken into
account in the project concept; and the project was relevant to the sector’s needs, the
government’s priorities, and the Bank’s country strategies. In addition, as is best practice, the TA
operation was complemented by other policy-based and investment support interventions to
maximize development impact through concerted complementary actions for sector performance
improvements. However, the results framework of the PAD could have presented PDO
indicators more explicitly linked to the PDOs.

Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory
Supervision was conducted regularly, with approximately two missions per year plus
interventions with the government and IAs as needed. During the project implementation, a team
with a task team leader (TTL) based in the field office supervised the project. The project
benefitted from the continuous support of the Bank team, and implementation support to the
government and IAs ensured the delivery of project outputs and outcomes. The team also
modified and restructured the project to (a) keep the project relevant; (b) avoid redundancy with
other donors; (c) maximize the production of useful outputs that would lead to meaningful
outcomes in future; and (d) meet newly emerging demands according to the transiting sector
environment during the project period with limited funds under the flexibly designed project.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Satisfactory
Although there were shortcomings in the design of the results framework, the Bank team made a
commendable effort in supervision and succeeded in maximizing the project outputs and
outcomes with the implementing agencies. The Bank provided four DPLs during PSDTA
preparation and implementation that secured several energy sector actions that complemented the
PSDTA objectives. Thus, the Bank’s overall performance was rated Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government Performance: Satisfactory
In general, the Government has been supportive of the project. Strong Government commitment
to sector reforms and capacity building was critical to the successful enforcement of the policy
developed and sector regulations recommended under the project. Conditions and covenants that
the Government committed to at the project appraisal, such as setting up the Project Steering
Committee for project monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, were achieved. Functionalization of
BERC was achieved, but with a four-year delay. Frequent Government-initiated changes in PC
top management also caused project implementation delays through 2007. These delays were
largely the reason for the first project restructuring.

Implementing Agencies Performance: Satisfactory
The project was implemented by PC, BERC, and PB, all staffed with committed and qualified
personnel (although the turnover rate for the officers during the project implementation period


                                                 18
was quite high). The three IAs collaborated well under the leadership of PC. With close
communication with the Bank, the IAs succeeded in amending the activities in order to comply
with the PDOs, and they produced a large number of outputs. These outputs contributed to sector
reform and to the functionalization of organizations, as well as to improving both the quantity
and quality of energy supply, increasing private investment, and preparing and implementing
new investment projects, among others. The technical capacity of all three agencies was
enhanced by training programs and on-the-job-training from international consultants provided
through the PSDTA. A key shortcoming, however, was the somewhat high turnover rate in PC
and BERC due to the issuance shorter-term contracts that is typical in civil service, making it
difficult to retain some of the trained staff. This leaves sustainability of the project outcomes in
capacity building as a challenge if no mitigation measures are taken. At this time, however, the
continuation of a similar TA component under the RERED II project using the same
implementing agencies has significantly mitigated this risk.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Satisfactory
Strong Government commitment supported endorsement and implementation of new sector
policies, strategies, development plans, regulations, and sector reforms. The implementing
agencies succeeded in producing a number of meaningful outputs for the energy sector and
developed the necessary capacity. However, frequent changes in the core management staff of
PC and delayed functionalization of BERC by the Government at the early stages of the project
caused project implementation delays. In a balanced assessment, the overall borrower’s
performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(a)     A TA project can provide strong support for furthering sector reforms and capacity
development, as well as for developing investment opportunities if there is a strong
commitment of Government and continuity of Senior Executives and Utility Heads. A TA
project can provide useful technical, intellectual, and global best practice support to the
Government, regulator, and utilities on cross-cutting reforms and capacity building and
knowledge on Bank’s multiple investment operations. Strong government commitment is critical
for enforcing the new sector policies, regulations, and reforms recommended by this type of TA.
Also, it takes time for the Government to make decisions and get clearance on a major move in
sector reform (such as was the case with operationalizing BERC, launching the major tariff
increase, corporatizing South Zone etc.).

(b)     TA projects, especially those aiming at sector reforms, should not be too ambitious on
what can be achieved and the time frame required to achieve the expected outcomes. In
particular, they should account for the time it will take to build consensus among key
stakeholders and for the Government to make hard decisions on the major steps of sector reforms
that affect many people. In addition, it takes a long time to implement and produce results,
including a reasonable time to put in place institutions upon acquiring competitive resources,
and completing procurement. The outputs and outcomes, such as policies, strategies,
regulations, corporatization, and project formulation, may therefore only be delivered at a late
stage in project implementation. Ideally, the project timeline should be sufficiently long to allow
the delivery of meaningful outputs and outcomes. In case the original project timeline is not long
enough, an early closing (rather than extension) of such project may disrupt project momentum


                                                 19
and undermine the set-ups created for project implementation and will not allow time for
delivering meaningful outputs and outcomes.

(c)     Evaluation of an overarching TA project is complex. For projects that aim to achieve
sector reforms (i.e., policy making and regulatory adoptions), it is difficult to foresee at
appraisal how outputs will shape policies and reforms and how concerned stakeholders will
react to the policy recommendations. Project monitoring indicators should be selected carefully
and be objectively measurable. For a project aiming at capacity development for a specific
beneficiary group, specific capacity to be developed need to be listed with a clearly defined
target value. A baseline value for each of the capacity development items should be provided in
the original project design. The degree of improved capacity is intangible and impossible to
monitor unless it is specified as (or broken down into) measurable items. Therefore, specific
capacities to be developed need to be listed as measureable items during the project design stage.
However, subjective evaluation beyond the indicators could be also necessary to evaluate
achievement of PDOs practically, in case the originally selected indicators do not fit.

(d)     Baselines for the capacity development monitoring items are unable to be collected
retroactively; thus, a baseline value for each item must be collected for a targeted beneficiary
group and included in the original PAD. Each of the selected measuring items also needs to
have a single target value as an achievement goal by project implementation. If the PDO
indicators are changed (such as by merging some of the original indicators) during project
implementation, a project restructuring process based on prevailing guidelines needs to be
undertaken.

(e)    Participants that undergo project training program should be retained in the project or
involved in similar capacity building activities or in sector reform implementation for as long
as possible. This can help retain the capacity and competencies in the sector. For a TA project
that involves multiple stakeholders at different stages of preparation and implementation
including other ministries, the selected trainees come not only from the parent ministry, utilities
and the regulator, but also from other concerned ministries, such as, Planning Commission,
Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Department, Ministry of Finance (Economic
Relations Division), Ministry of Law, Ministry of Establishment, and Prime Minister’s Office.

(f)     The experience of corporatizing the South Zone utility makes a case for thinking about
alternative models of corporatization that can still achieve the same autonomy, accountability
and a legal title. The SZ experience shows how vested interests stalled the corporatization
program. The SZPDC was established, but the Government faced resistance to corporatize and
therefore did not move ahead over fear of losing employments. Resolution of this issue was
outside the control of the PSDTA, so the Bank pulled out the funding that was initially intended
to improve the Chittagong (South Zone) Distribution area. Based on BPDB’s ongoing
corporatization experience, the Government is now proposing to experiment on a SBU model.
Under this model, separate business units may be established with independent decision making
power on business operations and clearly defined accountability, yet they will remain a part of
the BPDB. At some point in the future, if an SBU establishes itself, it can be converted into a full
corporate body as per the Company Act.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

7.1 Borrower and Implementing Agencies

The Borrower’s Completion Report is attached as Annex 5. Comments received from the
Borrower on this ICR were as follows:

(a)     There are factors that led to the project delayed beyond just the institutional weakness in
the power sector, such as the time required to judge the effectiveness of a project, the time lag in
receiving initial deposit, the Bank’s delay in giving clearances on procurement packages, etc.

(b)    The key appointments to new institutions were not always politicized.

(c)    Frequent transfers of the Power Division Secretary were a regular phenomenon and were
not supposed to affect project implementation.

(d)    There has been no formal declaration thus far that the Bank and other financiers withdrew
much of their support from the energy sector due to concerns about the country-wide quality of
the governance of procurement arrangements.

(e)  The institutional capacity of the power sector was improved commendably by the
PSDTA.

(f)    The implementation of sector reform took time, not only for decision making but also for
necessary procedures to be cleared.

(g)    Corporatization of SZPDC has not yet been given up.

Other editorial comments from the Borrower were generally incorporated.

8. Conclusions

When the PSDTA was appraised in 2004, the energy sector in Bangladesh faced chronic power
shortages and rapidly increasing electricity demand (both for additional consumption by
connected consumers and for new connections). Electricity system losses were high, electricity
tariffs were below cost, the sector was subsidized by the Government, and account receivables
piled up. Institutional capacity in the sector was too weak to overcome this situation.

Against this backdrop, the GOB requested Bank assistance in addressing the prevailing capacity
constraints and creating the institutional framework to urgently implement its Three-Year Power
Reform Road Map. The Bank decided to provide strategic assistance for the sector reform,
focusing on (a) capacity development for the energy sectors to prepare policies, strategies, and
facility and development plans; introduce accurate interfaces (system metering) among
unbundled power sector entities; and improve the level of customer service; (b) energy project
preparation through the enhancement of management and operation; and (c) operationalization of
BERC.

The project was implemented under extremely difficult condition, including political turmoil,
high officer turnover rate, slow procurement, vested interests obstructing reforms, and, more
recently, the Bank’s decision to suspend large infrastructure financing. Despite this, the project
used its limited funds well, particularly by showing flexibility in project design in coordination
with the GOB, IAs, the Bank, and other donors. An extension of the project period from four and
a half to eight and a half years was necessary for the project to achieve its objectives, but this is
more reflective of an overly ambitious timeline for this type of project and the challenging
implementation conditions than poor implementation. With strong support from the Government
and IAs staffed with committed and qualified personnel, the project brought tremendous outputs,
outcomes, and impacts to the energy sector. These included cost recovery, financial
sustainability, increased generation capacity, increased access, improved customer services,
institutional capacity development, adoption of explicit policies, legally vetted regulations,
transparent project selection, improved accountability of management and transparency in
decision making, and increased private investment. The mindset of the power sector has changed
through project implementation, and the institutions that received capacity development are now
confident.

Evaluation of the project was complex, as the project included sector reforms whose outputs and
outcomes were difficult to foresee at the appraisal stage and the PDO indicators were therefore
relatively subjective. The project evaluation was executed as objectively as possible, employing
the numerical evidence included in the Annexes. While the overall rating was concluded
“Satisfactory?, the sector reforms needs to be continued, and thus continuous efforts are still
required to ensure that the project’s outcomes are sustained. This project provided a starting
point for reform and institutional capacity building in the power sector that requires additional
follow-up operations.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1.   Introduction
Electricity is a key ingredient for economic development of a country. To ensure a sustainable economic development of a
country adequate, reliable and reasonably priced electricity is desirable. In Bangladesh annual per capita electricity
consumption was about 110 KWh and access to electricity was only 32% of total population in 2003. Installed capacity of
power plants was about 4300 MW at that time and there was a gap of about 1500 MW between demand & supply. On the
other hand, Government has a vision to provide electricity to all by 2021. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has taken
power sector reform programs to achieve this goal within stipulated time. The GoB, with the assistance of the World Bank
had undertaken the “Power Sector Development Technical Assistance (PSDTA)? project with the main intend to assist
implementation of power sector reform programs. PSDTA was a follow-on project to the previous Power Sector Reform
Program (PSRP) project implemented during 1996-2003. The PSDTA design was based substantially on the previous project
experience.
The objectives of the PSDTA project were to: (a) create effective capacity within the Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral
Resources (MPEMR) to put in place sector policies and industry structures needed for the balance development of its power
sector; (b) create regulatory capacity within the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) to regulate the sectors
effectively; and (c) prepare and secure financing for a number of well structured power sector investment projects.
PSDTA project was implemented since its fund effectiveness date on 31 October 2004 with an International Development
Association (IDA) Credit amount of SDR 4.9 million (Credit No.-3913 BD) and Grant amount of SDR 5.8 million (Grant
No.-H092 BD). Consequent to the success of the project, its huge positive impacts and the strong demand, PSDTA project
implementation period was extended for four years since its original closing date of 31 December 2008 with additional scope
of works but same financing limit. The project was implemented during June 2004 to December 2012 until final closure on
31 December 2012.
The project was consist of four parts, namely (A) Technical Assistance (For Power sector policy making and enterprise
restructuring; Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission; & Gas sector support), (B) Management Strengthening, (C)
Training and other Capacity Building Measures, and (D) Goods and Equipment.
The project was executed by the three separate agencies namely the Power Cell, Power Division, the BERC and the
Petrobangla. They maintained three separate special deposit accounts (CONTASA) in the commercial bank to make
expenditures through RPA.

The project implementation was guided by a high level National Steering Committee, headed by the Principal Secretary,
Prime Minister’s Office; having Secretary, Power Division; Secretary, Economic Relations Division (ERD); Secretary,
IMED; Secretary, Finance Division; Member (Power and Industry), Planning Commission; Secretary, Ministry of
Establishment as the members of the Steering Committee. A Task Force headed by Secretary, Power Division taking
members from the concern ministries and agencies was established to review and monitor the progress of implementation of
the project activities.

2.   Assessment of the project objectives, design, implementation experience and outcomes

The project development objectives were highly relevant with the government vision and mission at the time of project
preparation and continued to be relevant till the end of the project period. Bangladesh power sector was facing major
challenges. Its coverage was low, reliability and quality was poor. The utilities were inefficient and loss making. Private
investment in the sector was absent due to inadequate incentive support through proper policies. Under that prevailing
situation GoB made vision to provide reliable and affordable power to all by 2021. GoB stated policy statement in 2000 to
materialize the vision of the government and to increase the efficiency of the utilities & move them to commercial viability
and to increase private participation through sector reforms & restructure. Due emphasis has been given in the “National
Energy Policy? to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of the sectors and
to ensure financial viability of the utilities. Moreover, in the gas sector there had been no long term gas master plan. But, the
gas consumption had been increasing so rapidly that the constraints in gas production (due primarily to incommensurate E&P
activity), as well as bottlenecks in the transmission system, peak and average-day supplies would have been short of peak
demand. As a result gas demand versus gas management went almost beyond expectation/prediction. As such, development
of natural gas sector for improving supply of gas to power plants and to other consumers, as well as to attract foreign
development partners/donors for financing in the gas sector, Gas Sector Master Plan and Strategy was necessary. Policy
formulation, reform & restructuring, regulatory and capacity development activities done under the PSDTA project has
played a vital role towards the achievement of the GoB targets. Assessment of the project objectives, design, implementation
experience and outcomes are described below:
                                                              40
(a) Assessment of the project objectives:

(i) Create effective capacity within the Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources (MPEMR) to put in place sector
    policies and industry structures needed for the balance development of its power sector:

Creation of Power Cell:

In order to translate the policy commitment into actual investment projects, GOB created and set up Power Cell under the
Power Division, Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources (MPEMR) in 1995 under PRSP project of the World
Bank. After successful completion of the project, World Bank has taken PSDTA project in 2003 to continue its support to
Power Cell. The Power Cell has a mandate to lead private power development, recommend power sector reforms &
restructuring, conduct studies etc. Power Cell under the guidance of the Power Division implements power sector reform &
restructuring programs in Bangladesh; formulates & updates Acts, Regulations, Policies & Guidelines related to power
sector; performs studies for improvement of the power sector and to establish accountability, transparency & responsibility in
the sector; monitor the performance of the power utilities; implements power generation projects in private sector; prepare
model contract documents & security packages for IPP projects; prepare power sector development plans & suggests the
utilities for implementation; co-ordinates with the utilities regarding IT & e-governance issues; implements HRD programs;
assists to implement the renewable energy – energy efficiency & energy savings programs in Bangladesh. Power Cell works
as a “Think Tank? for the Power Division and assists them in any technical issues.

Preparation of Sector Policies:
Government policies have a significant impact on attracting private sector investment both in local & foreign. Government
declared fiscal incentives and exempted taxes to create an environment to attract private investment in power sector. To attain
the objectives of electrification through balance development of conventional and non-conventional energy the following
policies have been prepared by the Power Cell under the PSDTA.

x   Private Sector Power Generation Policy of Bangladesh (Amendment in 2004 & 2009)

3.         Factors Affecting Implementation:

The Power Sector Development Technical Assistance (PSDTA) project has executed by the Power Cell, BERC and
Petrobangla during 2004-2012. During the long implementation period executing agencies performed all the project activities
government rules-regulations as well as World Bank’s guidelines. So there were many positives as well as negative factors
that affected implementation of the project.

The major success factors were:

 (a) Most of the private power generation projects implemented under the policies prepared by power cell under PSDTA
     projects of World Bank.
 (b) All the private power generation(IPPs) projects followed the same model security packages (PPA, FSA, LLA, IA)
     developed by power cell
 (c) Power cell worked as central procurement entity for policy preparation and IPP tendering process.
 (d) Entire power sector reform programs implemented under the PSDTA project. Power sector reform programs prepared
     & implemented by the same organization (Power cell).
 (e) Power Division and other concern ministries were very helpful for the rapid implementation of reforms programs.
 (f) According to the objectives of the project GOB has prepared required policies, plans and programs/road maps.

                                                                46
 (g)     Government as well as World Bank strictly monitor the implementation of reform programs taken under this project
 (h)    Power sector improvement and reform activities implemented creating individual working group in each utility.
 (i)    There was a very close coordination among the ministry, power cell/BERC/pertobangla and the World Bank.
 (j)     Sectors agencies (BPDB, REB, DESCO, DPDC, PGCB, WZPDCo, EGCB etc.) were very cooperative and helpful
        during implementation of the project.
 (k)     The PSDTA project objectives were in line with the government vision and mission.
 (l)    Long term support with adequate amount of technical assistance under PSDTA was the key success factor.
 (m)    World Bank increased scope of works and extended the implementation period according to the demand of the project.
 (n)    PSDTA provide support for capacity buildings and HRD which was supportive for project execution and continuation.
 (o)    Formulation and adoption of regulations, technical codes and quality standards, , financial codes, generation price
        benchmarking
 (p)    Tariff setting for electricity (bulk and retail), gas and petroleum products
 (q)     Processing and issuing licenses
 (r)    Creation of funds-Gas Development Fund and Electricity Maintenance and Development Fund
 (s)    Themes for development of the energy sector

Negative factors that affected PSDTA project implementation were:

(a) Delay of fund effectiveness. DFA signed between the Government of Bangladesh and IDA in June 2003 but its fund
     effectiveness date was 31October 2004.
(b) In some cases implementation of power sector reform and restructuring programs opposed by the labor unions.
(c) The main component of the project implemented by the power cell but DG, power cell was not delegated as head of
     procuring entity.
(d) Lengthy procurement process of GOB sometimes delayed the implementation progress.
(e) Existing power generation crisis has delayed the implementation of interface metering program.
(f) Changed government policies and strategies for power generation program affect implementation of few activities like
     Siddirgonj Owner Engineer, Sirajgonj CCPP etc.
(g) Frequent change of project director (DG, power cell). Change occurred 7 times during project implementation.
(h) Directly so many organizations (Power Cell, Power Division, BPDB, REB, PGCB, EGCB, BERC, Petrobangla, Energy
     Division etc.) were involve in implementation process.
(i) Project man power was recruiting for short term (one year) basis not for the project period.
(j) Activities done under the PSDTA project were special as well as technical in nature which requires experienced and
     expertise man power. But the remuneration provided for project key staff was very poor.

Negative factors those affected the implementation of BERC portion of PSDTA were:

       a) Delay of project starting and engagement of consultants by 17 months.
       b) As per TPP there was provision for engagement of 16 counterpart staff and assistants but in effect there were only
          five.
       c) The Commission was provided approval with skeleton staff and all of them couldn’t be recruited and retained due to
          absence of market-based compensation.
       d) Delay of recruitment of staff as well as insufficient staff , on the job training was unmatched with the expectation and
          obviously capacity building could not be achieved fully.

4.         Transition Arrangements for Sustainability of project Achievements

Foreign consultant engaged under the project prepared study reports, Policy documents, standard tender documents and
security packages which have already been shared with the stakeholders. Interface remote metering technology, financial
model for cleaning balance sheet of the utilities, project monitoring software etc have been developed during project
implementation and handed over to the concern stake holder's with proper training.

5.         Risks for Sustainability:

Probable risks for sustainability of the project output and outcome are given bellow:

(a) The Power Sector Development Technical Assistance (PSDTA) project was taken by the Government of Bangladesh
mainly to implement the power sector reform programs through Power Cell. Power Cell has conducted many studies on
power sector reforms and restructuring, power sector improvement, energy efficiency etc. Some of the recommendations
provided in the study reports already implemented and the rest will be implemented gradually. To implement study
recommendations properly, continuous monitoring and technical support will be needed.
                                                                47
(b) Under the reform program the power industry has been restructured to increase efficiency, promote competition and
attract private investment. As outcome of the project South Zone Power Distribution Company (SZPDCo), North West
Power Generation Company (NWPGCo), North West Power Distribution Company (NWPDCo), Ashuganj Power Station
Company Ltd. (APSCL), Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) & Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh
(EGCB) has been established and few of them not yet stared its commercial functioning. To make all these newly
corporatized companies full functional and to run them on a commercial basis management strengthening & technical support
are essential.

(c) Under the PSDTA project power Cell has prepared the following plans to improve power sector and to implement reform
& restructuring programs based on the policy guidelines provided in the Vision Statement and Policy Statement.

9    3 years Road Map for power sector reform programs;
9    Financial Restructuring and Recovery Plan (FRRP);
9    Power Sector Master Plan (PSMP)
9    REB strengthening action plan
9    Energy Efficiency Action Plan
9    Model(South Zone) for distribution companies
9    Renewable Energy Development plan
9    Result Base Management system for performance improvement
9    Central Server based programmable remote metering system (Interface Metering)
9    Web based digital monitoring and data communication system etc.

The aforesaid plans and activities are being implemented by the Government under direct supervision of the Power Cell. The
above mentioned plans are rolling and need continuous technical support for their sustainability.

 (d) The TA project has been implemented in a comprehensive way as an umbrella project under the close supervision and
directives of the government (Power cell) to provide services to the utilities BPDB, REB, DPDC, DESCO, PGCB,
WZPDCL, NWZPDCL, IPPs and other emerging entities. Some important activities are still ongoing and will continue for
the betterment of the sector. Proper monitoring and support will be required for successful completion of those activities.

(e) Most of the power sectors utilities are newly formed under the project as outcome of the reform program. They have lack
of expert and specialized human resources to run the utility efficiently and commercial viability. Absence of HRD activities
will increase the risk of sustainability of the project.

To sustain improved performance, consumer satisfaction and accelerated development of the sector additional support from
the GoB as well as from the Bank will limit the risk of sustainability of the project outcome.

6.       Lessons Learnt:

Under the Power Sector Development Technical Assistance (PSDTA) project some new activities & systems have been
implemented as well as several new technologies have been introduced for improvement of the sector and to increase the
customer services. Through implementation of new systems and technologies there was a scope to learn and gather
experience.

(a) Power Cell has prepared Private sector power generation policy, Captive Power Policy, RAPSS Policy, Renewable
Energy Policy and Commercial Power Policy etc. to create an environment to attract private investment in power sector
under the project. Government has declared adequate financial incentives and benefits for private investors through those
policies. As a result of appropriate policies about 3721 MW power plants have been installed and 6850 MW under
procurement process under private sector. So to achieve the targets and objectives appropriate policy framework is a first
priority.

(b) Before installation of Interface Metering System there was a gap between bulk power purchase and sale. Power Cell has
implemented server based, programmable remote metering system in coordination with the concern utilities to establish
transparency and accountability. After successful compilation of the above program system loss has been reduced remarkably.
Use of modern and appropriate technology increase efficiency and improve customer services.

(c) From the government point of views the performance of the project is highly satisfactory. One of the key success factors
is the top management involvement. Implementation of the reform programs were guided by a high level National Steering
Committee, headed by the Principal Secretary, Prime Minister’s Office and the progress of project activities were reviewed
                                                            48
and monitored by a Task Force headed by Secretary, Power Division. Involvement of decision makers in the implementation
process, ensure rapid and smooth implementation of project.

(d) EA's have done lot of activities and successfully completed the project. Under the project power sector reform and
performance improvement activities have been done on the basis of prepared plans as well as on the basis of objectives
oriented time bound targets. Preparation of appropriate plan with attainable target is a way to reach the goal.

(e) The objectives of the project taken by the World Bank were highly pertinent with objectives of the government which was
the main reason behind the success of the project. Projects should be taken by the donor agencies considering the vision and
objectives of the government.

7.       World Bank's Performance

GOB rates the World Bank’s performance during preparation and implementation of PSDTA as ‘Highly Satisfactory’. All
stakeholders including MOPEMR, BPDB, REB, PGCB, EGCB, DPDC, DESCO, WZPDC, BERC and Petrobangla
representatives were regularly consulted with World Bank's officers during implementation period. The project
implementation progress was reviewed by the WB mission at a regular basis.

The World Bank was responsive to request to change project scopes according to the demand of the Government of
Bangladesh and EA's. The extension of the Project period two times for additional four years ensured that funds were fully &
properly utilized. The Bank provided shared its experiences and provided valuable advice on the various new technologies
that were being introduced during implementation of reform and restructuring programs in the power & energy sectors.

The Bank was particularly involved in efforts to resolve problems relating to the implementation of Interface Metering
program, Supervision and Management consultant for Siddhirganj Peaking Power Plant (Owners Engineer), Appointment of
other consultants, arranging of foreign trainings, workshops and studies, procurement of goods and vehicles.

However, in some cases the World Bank took long time for their concurrence/approval regarding EOI evaluation, RFP
document, technical evaluation etc. for selection of consultants.

The country Director and the officials in the H/Q were supportive and accommodating to adjust scope of works and to extend
the project implementation period for a longer time according to the demand of the Government. They invited several time of
our policy makers and high officials to visit Washington DC to share knowledge and experience which was very helpful for
decision making during implementation of the critical activities. The task team leader and the concern officials of Bank's
local office were very co-operative and sincere for implementation of the project. They regularly consulted with the
executing agencies for smooth execution of the project.

8.       Conclusion

To materialize the vision of the government through reforms and improvement of the sector PSDTA project was essential.
After successful completion of the project transparency & accountability has been established this has improved the operating
efficiency of the utilities. Preparation of appropriate policies has created an environment to attract private investment in the
sectors; it has also increased the donor’s confidence to come forward for future investment programs. Preparation of Power
Sector Master Plan, Gas Master Plan, FRRP etc. have been playing very vital for systematic development of the sector.
Besides, quality of gas and electricity supply has been increased, as a result overall costumer services has been improved
considerably after implementation of the project.

Regulation of the energy sector entities has brought discipline, accountability and transparency resulting in efficiency
improvement and increased customers’ satisfaction. Energy tariff is being set by adopting specific methodologies with an aim
to reach cost plus progressively. The bulk supply electricity tariff during the span of PSDTA recorded 130% increase while
the retail electricity tariff accumulated 67% hike. Similarly, gas and CNG tariff increases were 11% and 79% respectively.

Reform is a continuous process. Though the objectives of the project were achieved and many reforms activities have been
done under the PSDTA but still some important activities are under implementation process. Extended support from IDA will
be needed to complete the unfinished tasks and sustain the achievement of the project.

In conclusion the Government of Bangladesh is of the opinion that the Power Sector Development Technical Assistance
(PSDTA) project achieved its objectives and played a crucial role in the development of power & energy sectors in
Bangladesh.
