PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT _EPORT
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THlE CONGO
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1228-COB)
(CREDIT 1047-COB)
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for the
Second Railway Project, involving a Bank loan of US$38 million approved
on March 23, 1976, supplemented, because of considerable cost overruns,
by an IDA credit of US$30 million approved on June 19, 1980.   The
objective of the project was to double the capacity of ATC (Agence
Transcongolaise des Communications) in line with freight traffic
forecasts essentially through realignment of an 88 km railway section.
The loan was fully disbursed and closed on June 30, 1981, one year behind
schedule.   The Credit was closed on December 31, 1985, two and a half
years behind schedule, and US$.55 million was cancelled.
2.       The  PPAR  is based on  the  Project  Completion  Report  (PCR)
prepared by the Africa Regional Office and issued in 19891 , the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR), the President's Reports, the loan, credit and
guarantee    documents,  the  transcripts  of  the  Executive  Directors'
meetings at which the project was considered, a study of the Bank's
files, and diAcussious with Bank stafif. An OED mission visited the Congo
in November 1989, and discussed the effectiveness of the Bank's
assistance with the Ministry of Planning, Finance and Economics, the
Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, and ATC. On its way back to
'Washington, the mission discussed the project with the European Economic
Community (Brussels), the Ministry of Cooperation and the Caisse Centrale
(Paris), cofinanciers of the project.
3.       The PCR provides a good and detailed account of -the project
experience and the reader is strongly encouraged to consult it for a full
appreciation of what took place. The Evaluation Summary of the PCR is
reproduced as Annex 1 to this report.   This audit supplements the PCR.
It  .onsiders  the principal  reasons why the project oat-ome was so
disappointing and offers recommendations for consideration and possible
follow-up by Bank management. These recommendations are intended to help
ensure that some of the disappointing features and experiences of the
Congo Second Railway Project will not recur in future Bank financed
projects, in the Congo or elsewhere.
4.       Following standard OED procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were
sent  to  the  Government,  the  project  executing  agency  and  the
cofinanciers.   Comments were received from the OPEC Fund and they are
attached to this report.                                             v

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1228-COB)
(CREDIT 1047-COB)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proiec: Objectives
1.       The  project  covered  the  ATC   (Agence  Transcongolaise  de
Communication) investment plan for 1974-78 with an estimated total cost of
US$234 million (Table 1). The main and critical component of the plan was
the realignment of an 88 km sor-tion, including a 4.6 km tunnel, of the 510
km rail link between Brazaville and Pointe Noire (see Map), at an estimated
cost of US$149 million (paras 1 to 5). The objectives of the realignment
were to (i) avoid major traffic interruptions threatened by possible
collapse of the Bamba tunnel  (see Map, inset),  Iii) double the line
capacity to enable the railway to handle the anticipated doubling rf the
traffic, and (iii) reduce rail operating costs (para 6). The realignment
component was to be financed from ten sources (Table 2) and is the subject
of this audit (para 7).
Proiect   glementat ion
2.    - During  implementation  costs  went  up  by  168£  (para  8)  and
completion was delayed by five and a half years resulting in a time overrun
of 157% (para 9).
3.       Three main  factors  contributed to this  disappointing result.
First, the detailed engineering was unsound as it was based on inadequate
soil investigation, topographic work and geological study (para 11 and 13).
Also, the Bank's  financing of the detailed engineering was insufficient
(para 12).
4.       Second, the physical contingency included in the cost estimated at
appraisal was insufficient (paras 14 and 15). Third, ATC's management of
the project's implementation was not fully competent (pars 16).
5.       In addition to the considerable cost and time overruns,  the
expected doubling of the traffic between 1975 and 1985 did not take place.
Traffic remained flat.   The appraisal overestimation of the traffic for
1989 is about 140% and for 1995 probably some 2002. The principal reasons
for this disappointing development were that the anticipated growth of the
Congolese economy that would have generated additional traffic and the
anticipated increase in demand for African timber, did not materialize
(paras 18 to 20).
Notes The PCR provides a good and detailed account of the project
experience and the reader is strongly encouraged to consult it for a
full appreciation of what took place.  The Evaluation Summary of the
PCR is reproduced as Annex 1 to this report.



-vii _
6.       The disappointing development of project cost, completion delay
and traffic suggest that the sensitivity analysis in the appraisal report
was  clearly unrealistic  (paras 21 to 26).   Conversely,  the presumed
imminent collapse of the Bamba tunnel (pars 1 above) has not taken place
thus far, two decades later (pura 27).
Results and Sustainabilitv
7.       Given the cost and time overruns and the traffic shortfall the
economic rate of return of the project is zero or negative and the project
is not considered sustainable (para 28).
Follow-up by OD
8.       The  #Sdit  touches  on  a  number  of  issues  related  to  the
disappointing outcome of the project. They include, inter alias
-    insufficient financing of the detailed engineering (para 12);
-    inadequate assessment of the detailed engineering (para 13);
-    insufficient physical contingency allowance (para 14);
-    unrealistic sensitivity (risk) analysis (paras 21-26);
inadequate assessment of the possible failure of an existing
structure (pars 27);
°    insufficient initial project financing and necessity. to secure
additional financing later on to complete the project (para 8).,
9.       The audit feels that these are important issues which warrant a
further review by OED based on a broader sample of projects (PCRs and
PPARs). The purpose of this review would be to formulate recommendations
intended to help ensure that these issues will not recur in future Ban*. 
financed projects.

1969. ATC, a Congo national agency under the Ministry of Transport and
Civil Aviation (MTCA) owns and operates: (a) the Atlantic Ocean Port of
Pointe Noire; (b) a railway Chemin de Fer Congo-Ocean (CFCO), from Pointe
Noire to Brazzaville (510 km); and (c) the river ports and services on the
Congo-Oubangui-Sangha rivers (see Map).
2.       The  CFCO  line  was  built  between  1921  and  1934  with  an
infrastructure and track standards designed for light traffic. Since 1955
traffic had increased considerably (manganese ore in particular), over the
200 km between the Junction of the Compagnie Miniere de l'Ogooue (COMILOG)
railway at Mont Bello and Pointe Noire, and further traffic increases were
foreseen. This increased traffic was much beyond that envisaged when the
line was constructed.
Proliect Preparation
3.       Against this background the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), in the early seventies, financed the services of consultants to
ptepare a feasibility study which found that a staged improvement of the
existing rail alignment was impractical and proposed the realignment of a
section.   The Bank Group subsequently, under the First Railway Project,
financed the detailed engineering of this realignment by the             same
consultants.
4.       Project appraisal took place  in November  1974.   The project
consisted of the 1974-78 Investment Plan of ATC. The Bank's financing was
considered for the realignment of the CFCO railway section between Holle
and Loubomo (88 km) Six months after appraisal in May 1975, the bids for
the realignment works came in. The lowest bid turned out to be about 50%
higher than the appraisal mission's cost estimate and required additional
financing.
5.       Negotiations with the Government took place the following month,
in June  1975.   They were  followed,  in July and December,  by donor
eonferences which, inter alia, addressed and resolved the financing plan.
Subsequently, a Bank loan of US$38 million to ATC was approved in March
1976 and signed the next month. The loan did not become effectiye until
November  1976 because  of the  time  required to coordinate  legal and
disbursement aspects caused by the involvement of a large number of co-
donors.

Proiect Obiectives and Scope
6.       The project covered the ATC investment plan for 1974-78 with an
estimated total cost of US$234 million (Table 1).  The main and critical
component of the plan was the CFCO realignment - accounting for US$149
million - with the objectives to (i) avoid major traffic interruptions-
threatened by possible failure of the Bamba tunnel (see Map, inset), (ii)
double the line capacity to enable the railwaT to handle the anticipated
doubling of the traffic,  and (iii) reduce rail operating costs.   The
realignment component was to be financed from ten sources (Table 2).
7.       The audit  - as the PCR - focusses on the CFCO realignment
component.   The Bank did not participate in the financing of the Pointe
Noire Port and the river ports, did not supervise these components, and has
no record of their execution. For some other and relatively minor items to
be financed by the Bank, see text of Table 2. In the following, references
to the project are references to the CFCO realignment component.
II. PRINCIPAL ISSUES AND RESULTS
Project Costs Overruns
8.       The 88 km CFCO realignment, in addition to rails and sleepers,
signalling and telecommunications equipment, consisted mainly of civil
engineering works which ultimately included 17 million n3 earth works, 19
bridges, three tunnels - one of which the so-called" long tunnel" (4.6 km)
- and some 90 km of track. The total costs, originally (in 1976) estimated
at US$149 million, turned out to be US$399 million at completion, implying
a cost overrun of US$250 million or 168%. Additional financing, including
additional Bank financing (a US$30 million IDA Credit approved in mid-
1980), was arranged to cover the increase in costs (Table 2).
Implementation Delays
9.       At the time of appraisal the completion of the realignment had
been expected by the end of 1979. Actual completion was in mid-1985, five
and a half years later, implying a time overrun of 1571.
10.      A  number  of  factors  contributed  to  the  cost  increase  and
implementation delay of the project.   The most important and relevant
causes are identified and discussed in the following paragraphs.
Causes of Cost and Time Overruns.
11.      Unsound Detailed Enatneerina.   The first contributing factor to
the considerable cost and time overrun was the detailed engineering -
accepted by the Bank (PCR, para 9.04) - which was 'based on inadequate
soils investigation, topographic work and geological study' (PCR, paras
3.01  and 5.02).    As  a result,  the volume of work to be done was
considerably underestimated while many of the soil and tunnel problems were
not foreseen adding further to increased costs and delays.   Appropriate
field data could have resulted iz a soundly based detailed engineering and
hence more accurate cost estimates and a more realistic implementation
schedule.



-3-
12.      The PCR, in this context, observes athat the funds allocated by
the Bank for detailed engineering under the First Railway Project were
woefully underestimated" and suggests that a ten times larger allocation
would not have been unreasonable (PCR, para 5.05).
13.      The audit agrees that insufficient Bank funding of the detailed
engineering contributed directly to the inadequate quality.   But more
pertinently, however, is that the Bank, in its preparation and appraisal of
the project, accepted the detailed engineering as adequate. This suggests
that the Bank's relevant review procedure may need to be changed to reduce
the possibility of a recurrence of the problem in future projects.
14.      Insufficient  Physical Cont'ngency.    A  second  factor was  the
allowance of insufficient physical contingencies at appraisal:   101 for
earth works and 15% for tunnels (PCR, para 5.03 and SAR, Table 9B).
15.      As to the tunnel contingency, the audit may add here that at the
time of appraisal of the project the Bank had specific guidelinesl/which
suggested a considerably larger contingency allowance. One may speculate
a to why these guidelines were not applied in this case. One explanation
may be that because of the Bank's compartmentalisation relevant guidelines
prepared and applied by one department (Public Utilities) are not
necessarily known or applied by another (Transportation).
16.      Not Fully Competent Management of Proiect Implementation. A third
factor was that "ATC, supported by its expatriate technical assistants and
advisors, was not fully competent to manage civil works of the scope and
complexity of the realignment' (PCR, para 6.07).
17.      In addition, the audit feels that operating a railway and at the
same time implementing a large project such as the realignment put too
heavy a burden on ATC's managerial capacity.
Traffic Shortfall
18.      At appraisal (1975) traffic was expected to double, within ten
years, to 7.5 million ton.  Thereafter - after the loss of the 2.6 million
ton COMILOG (manganese) traffic to the Transgabonese Railway (SAR, para
5.05) - traffic was expected to reach a level of 5.5 million ton by 1990
and 6.2 million ton by 1995. This scenario proved to be too optimistic:

Estimatine Costs of Tunnel Construction, January 17, 1974, para 6.

c/    Present (1990) estimate by the audit; see next paragraph
19.      By 1985 the appraisal overestimation reached about 1002 and by
1989 about 1402. The prospects for 1995 do not look better. Given that
the actual traffle of 2.3 million ton in 1989 included one million ton of
CONILOG traffic and the audit's feeling that by 1995 all COMILOG traffic
will probably have been transferred from the CFCO to the Transgabonese
Railway, leads the audit to expect a total railway traffic on the CFCO by
1995 of at maost two minlion ton.   And this would imply an appraisal
overestimation of about 200X. Also, this traffic volume of two million ton
in 1995 would be about half the actual volume reachad twenty years earlier
when the project set out to double the railway's capacity.
20.      Looking back at the traffic experience over the last 15 years, the
principal conclusions are that the anticipated growth of the Congolese
economy, which would have generated additional traffic, and the anticipated
Increase in demand for African timber, did not materialize. Annex 2, taken
from the PCR, provides a more detailed discussion of the project's traffic
aspects.  Tho audit's judgment as tq the appraisal's traffic forecast is
that the forecast at the time of afuraisal was no doubt optimistic and
uncertain but not entirely unreasonable.
Unrealistic Sensitivity (Risk) Analysis
21.      Given the considerable cost and time overruns, and the substantial
traffic forecast overestimation, it Is of Interest to see how ex ante -
these aspects were treated in the sensitivity analysis of the Appraisal
Report.
22.      Cost Overrun.  In the Staff Appraisal Report of the project "a
sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of potential
changes in assumptions for critical benefit items." However, 'changes in
investment costs were not analyzed, as bids for the main civil works
contract have already been received and evaluated. n/
2I Staff Appraisal Report, page 20, para 5.13.



-5-
23.      The audit is puzzled by this conclusion.   First,  receipt and
evaluation of bids do not ensure the absence of future cost overruns,
especially when  (as in this case) bids are based on unit costs and
estimated quantities, as for example, for earthworks.  Second, the lowest
bid was 502 over the appraisal mission's original cost estimate (para 4)
thus providing clear evidence of a substantial element of uncertainty in
the cost estimate of the project.  The audit feels that leaving the cost
element out of the sensitivity analysis was an Important shortcoming of the
SAR.
24.      Time   Overrun.      Similarly,   the   possibility   of   project
implementation delays was not considered in the SAR's sensitivity analysis.
25.      Traffic Forecasts.   The sensitivity analysis did consider this
aspect.   It assumed timber traffic to be somewhat lower reducing the
overall traffic forecast by 0.8 million ton. But this lower forecast still
overestimated the actual traffic development by 75Z in 1985, 1002 in 1989,
and probably some 170S (see para 19) by 1995.
26.      In sum, the sensitivity analysis did not take into account two of
the principal factors (cost and time overruns) contributing to the
project's disappointing outcome and underestimated the possible variance of
the third (traffic forecasts) by a wide margin. Had the project's risks
been identified, the project might have been deferred, or alternative lower
cost solutions explored.
27.      Conversely, the presumed possible failure of the Bamba tunnel, a
major argument in the late sixties and early seventies to buttress the case
for realignment (para 6), has not taken place thus far, two decades later.
The audit did not find any evidence in the SAR, the project files, or
elsewhere, that a thorough assessment of the Bamba tunnel was undertaken
during project preparation. Nor do the files contain information on the
probability of the presumed tunnel failure in quantitative terms or the
likely cost involved to prevent it.
Results
28.      The physical objective of the project, to double the railway's
line capacity, was achieved.   But at what cost and to what purpose.
Project costs increased by 1682 and project implementation time by 1572. In
addition, traffic expected to double in a decade, remained the same.
Present traffic is at about 60% of the 1975 level and likely to decline
within the next five years to about half the 1975 level, implying a line
capacity utilization of 25Z.  As a result of these factors the economic
rate of return of the project is zero or negative and the project is not
considered sustainable.



III. FOLLOW-UP BY OED
29.      The  audit  touches  on  a  number  of  issues  related  to  the
disappointing outcome of the project. They include, inter aliat
-    insufficient financing of the detailed engineering (para 12);
-    inadequate assessment of the detailed engineering (para 13);
-    insufficient physical contingency allowance (para 14);
-    unrealistic sensitivity (risk) analysis (paras 21-26);
-    inadequate assessment of the possible failure of an existing
structure (para 27);
-    insufficient initial project financing and necessity to secure
additional financing later on to complete the project (para 8).
30.      The audit feels that these are important issues which warrant a
further review by OED based on a broader sample of projects (PCRs and
PPARs). The purpose of this review would be to formulate recommendations
intended to help ensure that these issues will not recur in future Bank-
financed projects.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
FROM THE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Objective
1.        The objective of the project was to safeguard the continuing func-
tioning of the existing ATC (Agence Transcongolaise des Communicattons) system
by Improving its operations and providing Increased capacity. The project, as
appraised, consisted of ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan, the principal item of
which was the realignment of the most critical 88-km-long railway section over
a difficult mountain range. The Bank lent US$35 M, and most of the remainder
was financed by several other co-donors. The civil works contract was awarded
In 1975 to a European consortium after International Competitive Bidding
(paras 1.05, 2.04, 2.06, 3.01, and-3.02).
Implementation Experience
2.       Implementation of the project ran into numerous and serious diffi-
culties. Shortly after the contractor had mobilized, an armed commando group
attacked the site camp in January 1977, kidnapped the contractor's local
manager and two other staff, killed a number of workers, took hostages, and
destroyed most of the construction equipment.   Cost of the renegotiated
contract jumped substantially, and considerable time was lost before the
contractor resumed work (paras 3.03 and 3.04). -
3.        The project continually suffered from inadequate funding, and the
Government repeatedly requested the co-donors and the Bank for additional
financeing. Furthermore, payments to the consortium were so slow that, on one
occasion, it faced bankruptcy.  The Bank made two supplementary credits
available, totalling US$35 M, but not before seriously considering withdrawing
from the project.  Berause of many problems encountered in building the
realignment, Including poor soil conditions; affecting the stability-of cuts,-
and enormous difficulties in piercing the Long Tunnel, delays mounted and
costs soared (paras 3.12 and 3.23-3.27).
4.        The total cost of the civil works needed for the realignment was
estimated at appraisal at CFAP 27.6 billion or US$123 M.  The final cost of
the civil works contract was CFP 85.4 billion or US$315 M, an overrun of 156Z
in dollr terms. The total cost of the CFCO realignment, including track,
signalling, telecommunications, stations and supervision, was estimated at
appraisal  at  CFAF 33.5 billion  or  US$148.8 M;  the  final  cost  was
CYA" 108.1 billion  or  US$399 M,  an  overrun  of  1682  in  dollar  terms
(para 3.31).

Page 2
5.        Meanwhile, ATC faced a critical financial situation.  Despite this,
however, the Government insisted on committing it to large contracts for
purchase of rolling stock and equipment which ATC neither needed nor wanted.
In addition, the Government held up approval of tariff increases which would
have eased ATC's financial crisis.  Finally, after the Bank suspended the
supplementary credit, the Government revoked the equipment order and put
through tariff increases (paras 3.44-3.47).
6.        ATC's profitability and financial situation are expected to progres-
sively improve over the next several years because of various measures that
have been taken under the Structural Adjustment Program started since end 1986
(para 4.26).
7.        With hindsight, it appears that the project suffered from inadequate
preparation and planning, cumbersome and inefficient coordination among the
numerous co-donors (14 international agencies and a number of local banks),
and incompetent management and supervision. Given the mountainous and diffi-
cult terrain, and the length of tunnels and depth of cuts, the topographic and
geological surveys, and soils investigations were far short of that needed as
a basis for detailed engineering. Better field data would have resulted in
more soundly based detailed engineering, more accurate cost estimates, and a
more realistic time schedule (paras 5.01-5.03).
8.        The Government frequently interfered in ATC's day-to-day affairs and
failed to meet its financial obligations to ATC, although the Congo's economic
woes sometimes made it difficult for the Government to comply fully (pa-
ra 6.02). Furthermore, while the Government made strenuous efforts to seek
financing for the realignment, it seemed reluctant to take action on matters
which would have enabled ATC to remain financially viable. It should have
expedited the award of timber concessions to develop traffic for the CFCO
system and approved badly needed tariff increases, but it only did so after
considerable pressure from the Bank (para 6.11).
9.        The Bank's performance varied widely.  It did not ensure adequate
project preparation under the First Railway Project, which compromised the
appraisal of the Second Railway Project. A higher, and more realistic project
cost estimate, and the corresponding reduction in the economic rate of return
for the realignment might well have led the Bank to abstain from financing the
project. The decision to allow ATC to retain responsibility for day-to-day
management of the work was ill-advised. While the Bank performed its coordin-
ating role as well as it could under the circumstances, this role was
apparently not accepted by all co-donors. The Bank's supervision of the
project was frequent and thorough (paras 8.01-8.06).
Results
10.       Because of the unanticipated high cost of the project and the
failure of freight traffic to expand much beyond that previously carried on
the old alignment, the rate of return of the project is, at best, zero
(para 7.01').



Annex 1
4 11-,.
Sutinabiiitz
11.       Given the zero rate of return and the ongoing and expected diversion
of a substantial -volume of manganese traffic from the ATC system to the
Transgabonaise Railway (a possibility already fQreseen at the time of apprais-
al, as mentioned in paras 2.01 and 2.05), the project is not sustalnable.
Lessons Learned
12.      A number of Important lessons must be learned from the Second
Railway Project: (a) only experienced owners should be placed in charge of a
major civil engineering job Involving high risk civil works; (b) feasibility
studies, design and supervision should be entrusted to experienced consultants
who are also given the full responsibility for the day-to-day direction of the
work; (c) final design should be based on thorough topographic and geological
studies and soils investigations; (d) if co-financing is involved, funds
should be pooled, tied procurement should be avoided, and the role of the
agency (in this case, the Bank) responsible for overall donor coordination
should be clearly defined and agreed upon by all co-donors; and (e) on any
project involving major and complex civil engineering works in which many
co-donors are participating, the Bank should insist on the appointment of a
project coordinator, and if the Bank is selected, it should place a senior
technical representative on site for the duration of the works (para 9.07).
13.      'Because project implementation spanned a decade, several of the
above lessons, such as the importance of avoiding tied procuremets have
already been applied in many other similar projects (para 9.08).

TRAFFIC DISCUSSION
FROM THE
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Traffic
4.01      The major coumodities handled by ATC are timber, most of which is
handled successively by each of ATC's modal departments; manganese ore trazs-
ported'over 200 kilometers of the CFCO line for export shipment at Pointe
Noixe; and general cargo.
Freight
4.02      The following table shows appraisal projections and actuals of ATC's
freight traffic broken down by department and major commodities for the key
years 1976 (project start), 1979 (appraisal-assumed compl*tion date). and 1985
(actual completion date). Details are in Table 4-1(a).

During appraisal of Credit 1047-COB, timber traffic projections were revised
downwards to 360,000 tons for the river transport link, 548,000 tons at the
port of Brazzaville, and 858,000 tons on the CFCO and the Port of Pointe Noire
in 1985.
4.03      The most striking fact disclosed by the above table is that actual
traffic on each of the four departments of ATC remained stagnant or even
decreased dyiring project Implementation while traffic projections anticipated
that (a) river transport traffic would Increase threefold over the period
1976-79 and double again over the next five years, 1980-85; (b) river ports
traffic would double during each of these two periods; CFCO transports would
increase by 301 over 1976-7-9- nd by an additional 401 over 1980-85; and
(c) Pointe Noire Port cargo handling would increase 371 and 252 during each of
the two periods.
General Cargo
4.04      General cargo consists mainly of goods imported at Pointe Noire for
domestic consumption, petroleum products, and food. General cargo traffic
represents about 30% of riyer transport and ports traffic and about 251 of the
combined railway and ports freight handling over 1976-85.
Man1ese
4.05      Manganese ore traffic handled by t4e CFCO and the Port of Pointe
Noire has been consistently about 151 below the .2,600 million tons anticipated
at appraisal. Also, as anticipated at appraisal, this traffic, which is
carried will, within the next few years, be transferred to the recently
completed Gabonese Railway.  About 501 will be transferred in 1989.

Timber
4.06      Appraisal forecasts for timber traffic on the CFCO were based on the
following data and assumptions:   (a) during the period 1962-73 world wide
imports of tropical hardwood had grown at about 12% per annum; (b) African
timber exports had not kept pace with the growing European demand; (c) the
European import demand for African timber was expected to grow from 15.3 mil-
lion as in 1973 to about 25 million as by 1985, while African export capacity
was only about 10 million i9 in 1972; (d) the estimated combined export
capacity of the four countries in the ATC service area could reach 5.2 to
6.1 million tons; and (e) the ATC share of the anticipated export capacity was
estimated at 2 million tons of which 1.2 million would originate from Congo
and 0.4 million each from Cameroon and CAR.
4.07      An important assumption of these ambitious traffic projections was
that the Government would take legal and administrative action to raise Congo
timber production to the required level. To this effect, it was agreed at
negotiations of Loan 1228-COB that the Government would (a) grant operating
rights in the South Congo forestry zone not later than December 31, 1977;
(b) undertake an inventory and prepare an exploitation plan for forestry
zone II in Northern Congo; (c) upgrade the forestry related lease system, laws
and regulation; and (d) report annually .o the Bank on action taken, starting
in 1976. The Bank cooperated with the Government in implementing the forestry
inventory and legal action and prepared a forestry study on the northern Congo
forestry potential. The conclusions of this study provided the basis for
appraising the River Transport Project (Credit 1179-COB, 1981), designed to
meet the needs of ATC's river transport operations, and the Ouesso Wood
Processing Project (Loan 2298-COB, 1983) which includes a substantial forestry
exploitation component.
4.08      Despite these measures, even the revised projections proved far too
optimistic as shown by the following data:

Total CFCO and Pointe Noire  484     498
4.09      ATC's inadequate operational performance is one of the reasons for
the disappointing results with respect to timber originating from the CAR,
Cameroon and Northern Congo. However, the evolution of the timber market in
Europe, the Government's slow action in awarding timber exploitation conces-
sions in Northern Congo and inefficient commercial policies were also contrib-
uting factors. The following table compares appraisal projections and actuals
for 1987 of timber exports of the four countries in the ATC service area.

CAR               0.4 - 0.6         0.1
Appraisal projections were based on the assumption that demand emanating from
France and the Federal Republic of Germany, the two main importers of timber
produced in the four countries, would increase. These expectations did not
materialize as shown in the following table of sawlogs and sawtimber imports
over 1977/85 in France and the Federal Republic of Germany:

198S     1138     1969      866    3954
4.10      The deelining demand did not encourage the Government to make good
on earlier commitments to grant forestry exploitation concessions, at least as
long as the market for hardwood timber did not recover from its present
weakness. Despite its commitments under the project, the Government has acted
such slower than anticipated in awarding forestry exploitation permits in
Northern Congo.  Reasons for this have not been clearly defined.  It is,
however, likely that foreign tiiuber companies were reluctant to invest in the
Congo because of unfavorable legislation and/or difficult access to operating
areas. Local timber companies were most likely short of funds to exploit
large areas for which they had obtained concessions. Considering the decline
in demand, it is difficult to be critical of this performance over the project
period.
Passengers
4.11      Contrary to freight, passenger traffic on the CFCO, the sole ATC
department handling a substantial passenger traffic, has substantially exceed-
ed appraisal projections (Table 4-1(b)), mainly because rail is the only
affordable means for travelling between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire.  As
could be expected, passenger traffic peaked over 1980-85 in parallel with the
growth of GDP during the oil boom period. However, this traffic generates
heavy losses because tariffs have been kept low by the Government.
Conclusion
4.12      Overall, ATC was far from achieving appraisal traffic projections,
mainly because the anticipated economic growth rate, which would have generat-
ed additional traffic and the anticipated increase in demand for African
timber, did not materialize.  In addition, ATC will loose in,1989 at lUast 50;
of COMILOG's manganese traffic which will be carried over the Trans-Gabonese
Railway. Prospects for full utilization of the addition4 capacity resulting
from the CFCO realignment are'thus not good.
