PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Railway
Project for which the following three consecutive lending operations were
made: Loan 1228-COB in the amount of US$38 million dated April 12, 1976,
Special Action Credit 45-COB for US$5 million date. April 11, 1980, and IDA
Credit 1047-COB for US$30 million dated July 15, 1980. the two credits
provided supplementary financing to enable The Congo to complete the
project in the face of rapidly rising costs and long delays in the
completion of the civil works. The Loan and the Special Action Credit were
fully disbursed.    Approximately  US$0.5  million  of  the  IDA Credit was
cancelled on March 19, 1987.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division,
Occidental and Central Africa Department, Africa Regional Office, and is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Credit, and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda; and a detailed completion report
on the execution and financing of the project prepared by the Borrower.
The PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent  to  the  Borrower and cofinanciers for comments and
they are attached to the Report (Annex).

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1228-COB,
SPECIAL ACTION CREDIT 45-COB, AND CREDIT 1047-COB
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objective
1.        The objective of the project was to safeguard the continuing func-
tioning of the existing ATC (Agence Transcongolaise des Communications) system
by improving its operations and providing increased capacity. The project, as
appraised, consisted of ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan, the principal item of
which was the realignment of the most critical 88-km-long railway section over
a difficult mountain range. The Bank lent US$35 M, and most of the remainder
was financed by several other co-donors. The civil works contract was awarded
in 1975 to a European consortium after International Competitive Bidding
(paras 1.05, 2.04, 2.06, 3.01, and 3.02).
Implementation Experience
2.        Implementation of the project ran into numerous and serious diffi-
culties. Shortly after the contractor had mobilized, an armed commando group
attacked the site camp in January 1977, kidnapped the contractor's local
manager and two other staff, killed a number of workers, took hostages, and
destroyed most  of the construction  equipment.   Cost of the renegotiated
contract jumped substantially, and considerable time was lost before the
contractor resumed work (paras 3.03 and 3.04).
3.        The project continually suffered from inadequate funding, and the
Government repeatedly requesteca the co-donors and the Bank for additional
financing. Furthermore, payments to the consortium were so slow that, on one
occasion,  it  faced bankruptcy.   The  Bank made two supplementary credits
available, totalling US$35 M, but not before seriously considering withdrawing
from the project.   Because of many problems  en-ountered in building the
realignment, including poor soil conditions affecting the stability of cuts,
and enormous difficulties in piercing the Long Tunnel, delays mounted and
costs soared (paras 3.12 and 3.23-3.27).
4.        The total cost of the civil works needed for the realignment was
estimated at appraisal at CFAF 27.6 billion or US$123 M. The final cost of
the civil works contract was CFAF 85.4 billion or US$315 M, an overrun of 156%
in dollar terms. The total cost of the CFCO realignment, including track,
signalling, telecommunications, stations and supervision, was estimated at
appraisal  at  CFAF 33.5 billion   or  US$148.8 M;   the   final  cost  was
CPAP 108.1 billion or US$399 M, an overrun of 168% in dollar terms
(para 3.31).

5.        Meanwhile, ATC faced a critical financial situation.  Despite this.
however, the Government insisted on committing it to large contracts for
purchase of rolling stock and equipment which ATC neither needed nor wanted.
In addition, the Government held up approval of tariff increases which would
have eased ATC's financial crisis.  Finally, aftei the Bank suspended the
supplementary credit, the Government revoked the equipment order and put
through tariff increases (paras 3.44-3.47).
6.        ATC's profitability and financial situation are expected to progres-
sively improve over the next several years because of various measures that
have been taken under the Structural Adjustment Program started since end 1986
(para 4.26).
7.        With hindsight, it appears that the project suffered from inadequate
preparation and planning, cumbersome and inefficient coordination among the
numerous co-donors (14 international agencies and a number of local banks),
and incompetent management and supervision. Given the mountainous and diffi-
cult terrain, and the length of tunnels and depth of cuts, the topographic and
geological surveys, and soils investigations were far short of that needed as
a basis for detailed engineering.  Better field data would have resulted in
more soundly based detailed engineering, more accurate cost estimates, and a
more realistic time schedule (paras 5.01-5.03).
8.        The Government frequently interfered in ATC's day-to-day affairs and
failed to meet its financial obligations to ATC, although the Congo's economic
woes sometimes made it difficult for the Government to comply fully (pa-
ra 6.02). Furthermore, while the Government made strenuous efforts to seek
financing for the realignment, it seemed reluctant to take action on matters
which would have enabled ATC to remain financially viable.  It should have
expedited the award of timber concessions to develop traffic for the CFCO
system and approved badly needed tariff increases, but it only did so after
considerable pressure from the Bank (para 6.11).
9.        The Bank's performance varied widely.  It did not ensure adequate
project preparation under the First Railway Project, which compromised the
appratsal of the Second Railway Project. A higher, and more realistic project
cost estimate, and the corresponding reduction in the economic rate of return
for the realignment might well have led the Bank to abstain from financing the
project. The decision to allow ATC to retain responsibility for day-to-day
management of the work was ill-advised. While the Bank performed its coordin-
ating role as well as it co-iuld under the circumstances, this role was
apparently not accepted by all co-donors.  The Bank's supervision of the
project was frequent and thorough (paras 8.01-8.06).
Results
10.       Because of the unanticipated high cost of the project and the
failure of freight traffic to expand much beyond that previously carried on
the old alignment, the rate of return of the project is, at best, zero
(para 7.01).



-Ix -
Sustainability
11.       Given the zero rate of return and the ongoing and expected diversion
of a substantisl volume of manganese traffic from the ATC system to the
Transgabonaise Railway (a possibility already foreseen at the time of apprais-
al, as mentioned in paras 2.01 and 2.05), the project is not sustainable.
Lessons Learned
12.       A number of important  lessons must be learned from the Second
Railway Project: (a) only experienced owners should be placed in charge of a
major civil engineering job involving high risk civil works; (b) feasibility
studies, design and supervision should be entrusted to experienced consultants
who are also given the full responsibility for the day-to-day direction of the
work; (c) final design should be based on thorough topographic and geological
studies and soils investigations; (d) if co-financing is involved, funds
should be pooled, tied procurement should be avoided, and the role of the
agency (in this case, the Bank) responsible for overall donor coordination
should be clearly defined and agreed upon by all co-donors; and (e) on any
project involving major and complex civil engineering works in which many
co-donors are participating, the Bank should insist on the appointment of a
project coordinator, and if the Bank is selected, it should place a senior
technical representative on site for the duration of the works (para 9.07).
13.       Because project implementation spanned a decade,  several of the
above lessons, such as the importance of avoiding tied procurement, have
already been applied in many other similar projects (para 9.08).

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1228-COB,
SPECIAL ACTION CREDIT 45-COB, AND CREDIT 1047-COB
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Agence Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC) was formed in
1969 as the successor to a multinational agency, the Agence Transequatoriale
des Communications (ATEC).  ATEC was created in 1958 by the Congo, Gabon,
Central African Republic (CAR), and Chad to aanage the 2,900 km multi-modal
transport route from N'Djamena (Chad) through Bangui (CAR) to the ocean port
of Pointe Noire (see map). At the time of appraisal, ATC, a Congo national
agency under the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MTCA), still
performed many functions of the former ATEC. ATC owned and operated: (a) the
Atlantic Ocean port of Pointe Noire; (b) a railway, Chemin de Fer Congo-Ocean
(CFCO), from Pointe Noire to Brazzaville (510 km); and (c) the river ports and
services on the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha rivers.
1.02      In the early 1970s, the principal traffic carried on the CFCO was
manganese ore from Gabon, potash, timber and general cargo. Some years later,
the potash mine operations were closed because of flooding. Increasing timber
and general traffic had been carried partly by expanding the fleet of locomo-
tives and cars, and partly by increasing their size. However, because track
and infrastructure problems between Holle and Loubomo limited the number of
trains possible, CFCO traffic had remained constant since 1971.  On completion
of certain improvements in 1976, longer trains were possible.  This capacity
increase, however, would meet forecasted traffic to 1979 only, and would not
provide a long-term solution to the need to increase capacity or improve
difficult operating conditions.
1.03      The CFCO line was built at minimum cost between 1921 and 1934 with
an infrastructure and track standards designed for light traffic.  The line
had a narrow roadbed, steep gradients and sharp curves, particularly across
two mountain ranges, one near the coast and the other towards Brazzaville.
Traffic had increased considerably between 1955 and 1975, particularly manga-
nese ore, over the 200 km between the junction of the Compagnie Miniere de
l'Ogooue (COMILOG) railway 1/ at Mont Bello and Pointe Noire, and further
traffic increases were foreseen. This increased traffic was much beyond that
envisaged when the line was constructed. Traffic was carried on long trains
and heavy axle loads, which led to failure of the track structure, high rate
of rail wear, breakage of welded rail joints, and damage to the superstructure
of numerous concrete arch viaducts.   These failures in turn caused major
problems with the track and equipment, resulting in frequent accidents,
considerable train delays, and consequent restrictions on the traffic carried.

The SAR noted that the general condition of the viaducts was also poor, while
the Bamba tunnel (1.7 km) was in dangerous condition and needed rehabilita-
tion.
1.04      In 1971/72, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) financed
a feasibility study which was carried out by a firm of consultants. The study
found that staged improvement of the existing rail alignment was impractical,
and proposed the realignment of about 106 km.  The Bank Group subsequently
financed detailed engineering of this realignment by the same consultant as
part of the First Railway Project (Credit 297-COB, US$6.3 M, April 1972,
increased to US$6.9 M in July 1973).   According to the PCR dated Decem-
ber 30, 1977, the project was reasonably well implemented although completed
about two years later than originally planned.  This conclusion should be
reassessed in the light of the findings of this report regarding the quality
of the detailed engineering (paras 5.01-5.05).
1.05      The Second Railway Project was based on ATC's five year investment
plan for 1974-78 which included, as the largest single component, the realign-
ment of the CFCO. In addition, the plan provided for general investments in
the CFCO, completion of ongoing works and new berths at Pointe Noire, minor
improvements or extensions of the river ports and services, and needed im-
provements to ATC's training methods and facilities.
1.06      According to the SAR, ATC enjoyed sufficient autonomy in its opera-
tions to permit effective management. The quality of top management was noted
as generally satisfactory, although it relied heavily on expatriate technical
assistance. There was a need, however, to increase the participation of local
staff in decision-making, and to provide more training in view of progressing
Africanization. Although ATC provided good basic training for apprentices and
recruits, some reorganization and expansion of facilities was needed to make
this training more effective. The project provided for this, as well as for
about 40 man-years of technical assistance.
1.07      ATC was made responsible for execution of the project.  The consul-
tant who had carried out the detailed engineering of the realignment was re-
tained in an advisory capacity under ATC to supervise the civil works compo-
nent. 2/
1.08      This report is based on information in Bank correspondence files
(38 volumes), a project completion report by ATC, a review of project docu-
ments, interviews with Bank staff and ATC officials, and a project completion
mission to the Congo in April 1988.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification
2.01      The railway realignment component was identified in the late 1960s,
and was prepared under the First Railway Project (para 1.04). By early 1973,
the broad outlines of the railway part of the project had emerged and the
2/   Hereafter referred to as the supervisory consultant.



-3-
interested co-financing agencies had indicated the amounts of their contribu-
tions. The main concerns appeared to be (a) whether Gabon would eventually
transfer its manganese traffic from the CFCO railway to the Trans-Gabonese
railway on which work was about to start; and (b) the scope of the realignment
works.
Preparation
2.02      In May 1973, a preparation mission found that as a result of the
supervisory consultant's field work, the estimated cost of the CFCO realign-
ment had about doubled the feasibility study estimate. The mission found that
ATC was preparing a revised investment plan for 1974-78 which would update the
existing plan for 1971-75. The revised plan would cover proposed investments
for the ATC Administration, the CFCO, the port of Pointe Noire, and river
navigation, ports and transport. The plan, which would be ready in November,
was expected to cost about US$220 M. Full appraisal of the Second Railway
Project would only be considered by the Bank if a desk appraisal, to be
carried out on receipt of the engineering and economic reports, indicated a
financially viable project.
2.03      By the end of August 1974, the Bank had completed its desk appraisal
which indicated that (a) the cash position of ATC would be very difficult
between 1974-76; and (b) the ERR would be in the range of 12-15%. Concerns
were expressed over the then inflationary price situation and a possible large
cost overrun in the light of recent bidding on the Trans-Gabonese Railway. In
the meantime, a Bank mission had reached agreement with ATC on the 1974-78
Investment Plan at an estimated cost of US$169 M. Prequalification procedures
were to start immediately so that bidders could be selected in November 1974,
with tenders called in January 1975 for receipt and evaluation by mid 1975.
Appraisal
2.04      The project was appraised in November 1974 by a seven-man mission.
The project consisted of the 1974-78 Investment Plan of ATC, and its total
cost was finally estimated at US$183 M. The Bank's participation was consid-
ered for the financing of the realignment of the most critical section of the
CFCO railway over the Mayombe mountain range between Holle and Loubomo
(88 km). The cost of the realignment, including contingencies, was estimated
at about US$100 M. It was decided that bidding should be restricted to firms
or groups of firms which had the expertise to take on a single contract for
the civil works, rather than bidding on separate components, since it was
deemed preferable to have the responsibility for the works lie with a single
contractor.
2.05      In March 1975, when the Yellow Cover SAR was distributed, a major
problem arose as regards the financing plan.  Application of recent Bank
guidelines on price contingencies had increased the total cost of the project
by US$29.4 M to US$212.4 M, and the cost of the alignment to US$112.7 M. The
tentative financing plan agreed upon in June 1974 was now insufficient, and it
would be necessary to raise the problem at a co-donors' meeting in July 1975.
It was pointed out that ATC intended to start realignment works in September,
before Board Presentation which was tentatively scheduled for November 1975.
At the Yellow Cover Review it was questioned whether the 2.0 million tons of
manganese traffic from Gabon should be counted upon, and whether the revenues
from it would be sufficiently attractive to justify the realignment. It was
pointed out that the carriage of the manganese traffic would be attractive if
CFCO had surplus capacity, but not so if it was required to carry Gabonese



traffic in addition to national traffic, thus requiring the costly realignment
works.  It was also pointed out that the economic return was sensitive to
investment cost increases, especially if the results of the tendering underway
indicated a greater increase than the +30% indicated in the sensitivity
analysis. If costs were higher, it was not only a question of a larger loan
but also the question of economic viability. The memorandum concluded that if
the cost increase was high, the whole situation should be reassessed.
Negotiations
2.06      In June 1975, the Bank invited the Government to negotiations.  The
Bank pointed out that in view of problems with the economic justification and
the financing plan, it would not be able to conclude negotiations until a
mutually satisfactory solution was found; this was expected to occur only
after a July 17 donors' meeting at Pointe Noire.  The Congolese delegation
requested an increase in the loan to cover higher technical assistance costs,
the dollar devaluation since the preparatory stages of the project, and a
contribution toward the financing gap of US$65-75 M which appeared mostly as a
result of the higher-than-anticipated bids. Bids for the realignment works
had been opened on May 27, 1975, and the lowest price amounted to CFAF 41 bil-
lion or about US$160 M. The Government proposed that this might be reduced to
US$148 M by granting the bidders additional tax exemptions.   Concern was
expressed in the Bank over future inflation in the Congo and uncertainties as
to the cost of the tunnels, both of which would adversely affect the justi-
fication of the project which was now recognized as marginal.
2.07      The Bank mission to the July 1975 co-donors' conference concluded
that it was a successful meeting since (a) a preliminary award was made to the
consortium which was the lowest evaluated bidder; (b) the Bank's insistence on
establishing an economic justification and a firm financing plan before
starting the works was widely supported; and (c) a more realistic timetable
for the realignment component was accepted by all concerned.  It was also
agreed that the Bank would supervise all items in the Investment Plan. The
conference ended, however, without completing the financing plan.
2.08      As the validity of the lowest bid was due to expire in Novem-
ber 1975, efforts were made to have the contractor extend its validity by four
months to enable the Board to approve the loan before an award was made. In
the meantime, Bank staff conferred with the donors in an effort to confirm
their participation. The Bank's contribution was tentatively set at US$35 M.
The fluctuating rate of the US dollar to the CFAF, generally downward, raised
concern as to the amount of the Bank's participation in CFAF in the financing
plan. The shortfall in the plan as of early December was about US$42 M.
2.09      The co-donors' conference in December 1975, was overshadowed by a
sudden change in the Government of the Congo in the preceding week.  The
meeting was further surprised by the pledging of US$43 M by three Arab funds
which enabled it to agree on a realistic financing plan. As regards timing,
the Bank again had to persuade the Government not to award a contract until
after Board presentation, despite the highly critical reaction of most donors
to the Bank's delaying proposal.  It was finally agreed to ask the lowest
bidder to extend the validity of his bid (already once extended from Novem-
ber 23 to January 31) to February 29, 1976.



Board Presentation and Effectiveness
2.10      In February 1976, a Bank mission agreed with the Government on final
changes in the legal documents. The Government voted a tariff increase and
financial support for ATC which the mission concluded would put ATC on a sound
financial footing. The project was noted as remaining fully justified with a
return of 23% for the entire project. A loan of US$38 M to ATC was approved
by the Bank's board on March 23, 1976 and signed on April 12, 1976. The loan
did not become effective until November 22, 1976 because of the time required
to coordinate the legal documentation and disbursem2nt arrangements necessi-
tated by the involvement of a large number of other co-donors (Table 2-0).
Project Objectives and Scope
2.11      The objective of the project was to safeguard the continuing func-
tioning of the existing ATC system by improving its operations and providing
increased capacity. The main and critical focus of the ATC 1974-78 Investment
Plan was on the CFCO railway where immediate action was required to avoid
major interruptions threatened by failure of the main tunnel or viaducts, or
by landslides. The project comprised:
(a) CFCO Railway: improvement of 18 km and realignment of 88 km of the
Holle-Loubomo section, procurement and renewal of locomotives and
rolling stock, track renewal, installation of signalling systems,
and expansion of workshops;
(b)  River  Services:   procurement  of  mechanical  handling  equipment,
purchase of additional floating craft, expansion of Brazzaville
workshops, and deepening of river channels;
(c)  Pointe Noire Port:  completion of ongoing work for an additional
stacking area for timber, construction of new berths for manganese
and general cargo, and dredging; and
(d) ATC Headquarters: improvement of training facilities and programs
throughout the ATC system.
The project was to be completed by December 15, 1979.
2.12      The project also included the purchase of railcar bogies and radio
equipment for improving marshalling yard facilities. However, the Port of
Pointe Moire and the river ports and services components were not financed by
the Bank, nor were they supervised by the Bank. Furthermore, neither final
cost estimates of these components nor any record of their execution are
available in the files. Thus, the project, as referred to hereafter, consist-
ed mostly of the CFCO realignment, some general investments in the CFCO and
technical assistance to ATC. The SAR calculated the economic return on both a
national and regional basis, noting the benefits of the project to neighboring
countries, including Cameroon, CAR and Chad.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A. Project Start-up
3.01      The 88 km CFCO realignment, at an estimated cost at appraisal of
US$148.8 M, was by far the largest single item in the project. The realign-
ment works were divided into 11 lots by ATC for purposes of procurement and
execution  (Table 3-1).   Lot 6 comprised the civil engineering works which
ultimately included over 16,700,000 m9 of earthworks, 19 bridges, 3 tunnels
and 91 km of track. At the request of the Arab banks, which wanted to finance
a separate project item, the tunnels were assigned to them.  Rails, ties,
spare parts, telecommunications, signalling, and buildings were supplied under
other lots.   Supervision of the realignment works was provided for under
Lot 10 which was financed by the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA). Later, Lot 12 was added to finani'e additional consultants. As might
be expected, the execution of Lot 6 turned out to be the most difficult part
of the project; however, no one foresaw the enormous technical problems which
were encountered before the realignment was completed in 1985, over
5 1/2 years behind schedule, and at a cost of over two-and-a-half times the
appraisal estimate. Table 3-1 also shows the increases in ATC's cost estim-
ates during project execution.
3.02      A European consortium of contractors was low bidder on Lot 6 at
CFAF 19.8 billion or US$88 M.   The consortium at first delayed signing a
contract until certain conditions were met, including compensation for the
delays as a result of the two bid validity extensions, and a change in payment
currencies. Solutions were found and the contract was signed on May 27, 1976.
Commando Attack and Resulting Contract Amendment
3.03      On January 15,  1977 an armed commando group reportedly from the
Liberation Front of the Cabinda Enclave attacked the camp site of the main
railway realignment  tunnel.   Twelve workers  were killed  and  three  staff
members of the contractor, including the local manager, were held hostage for
two weeks. Equipment worth about US$1.0 million was destroyed. As a result,
all works on the realignment came to a halt, and the contractor requested
cancellation of its contract on March 7, 1977 invoking force majeure.   In
order to find a solution to this impasse, the Congolese Government convened a.
co-donois'  meeting on March 8-10,  1977.   At  the meeting,  the contractor
underlined that the request for cancellation was intended to set a deadline of
four months for renegotiation of its contract (before arbitration) in accor-
dance with the general conditions which ruled this contract. They neverthe-
less emphasized that they were willing to re-mobilize and undertake limited
resumption of works if adequate security arrangements, including military
protection, were provided, and if they would be compensated for such limited
works program on the basis of a cost-plus formula to be approved by the
co-donors. The co-donors' representatives agreed in principle to such limited
resumption of works during the four months' interim period.
3.04      At a subsequent co-donors' conference in June 1977, the Bank learned
that the contractor had resumed limited work while at the same time negoti-
ating a revised contract  for the full resumption of works.   Preliminary
estimates indicated a substantial cost overrun over the contracted amounts.
Furthermore, it was learned that the Government was behind in payments to the
contractor and owed about CFAF 200 million to the project account.   The
contractor's estimate for the realignment was US$200 M while the ATC estimate



was US$167 M, as compared to the appraisal estimate of US$148.8 M. The Bank
recognized for the first time the possibility of having to make supplementary
financing available if the project was to continue.
3.05      The Bank made an independent reassessment of the economic evaluation
of the realignment, which Indicated a likely rate of return in the 10X range.
On the assl'mption that costs were likely to be higher, and the lack of devel-
opment of timber traffic and other assumptions, the Bank's reassessment
concluded that "in all likelihood ... the economic return could be below 2%."
This reaseessment was, however, deemed to be too conservative, particularly
since the contractor was proposing lower cost estimates than those given
earlier (para 3.04).
3.06      The Bank decided to press ATC and the contractor to reach a settle-
ment to enable a final project cost estimate and a firm financing plan to be
established. Most of the co-donors agreed to increase their contributions
while the Bank offered to consider a forestry project to boost traffic.
Agreement was eventually reached, and an amendment to the contract was signed
along the lines proposed, at a total cost for the realignment of
CFAF 41.3 billion or US$169 M. The Bank approved the full resumption of works
on the basis of the amended contract and resumed disbursements. Meanwhile,
since traffic over the ATC network was less than forecast at appraisal, ATC's
financial position had seriously deteriorated.   The Bank,  therefore, held
discussions with ATC to reduce the impact of servicing additlonal loans for
the realignment overrun by increasing tariffs, exercising strict control over
ATC's operating costs, and rescheduling loan repayments.
3.07      In March 1978, the Bank concluded that the economic rate of return
of the project would be about 13%. Therefore, the project was still economi-
cally justified, but traffic development, particularly timber, although based
on realistic assessments of resources and market, was highly uncertain.  If
Congolese timber production should stagnate and project costs increase, the
project would no longer be justified, which is exactly what occurred. Four
measures  were  recommended  to  stimulate  traffic  development:   (a) a Bank
forestry project (already in preparation stage), including changes in forestry
policy; (b) decision to speed up timber production in Southern Congo; (c) Bank
financing of some navigation equipment; and (d) a decision to increase produc-
tion in state-owned, severely underutilized, industrial outfits through
rehabilitation of equipment and management.
ATC's Technical and Financial Problems
3.08      An April 1978 supervision mission found that ATC was not meeting its
financial obligations, even for such critical expenditures as locomotives,
spare parts, and rails. The mission concluded that a 10% tariff increase was
essential to ensure profitable operation of the railway.
3.09      A September 1978 supervision mission noted a marked deterioration in
ATC's financial situation and the consequent need for a short- and mid-term
rescue action. It also expressed fears that the Government would not be able
to fully pay its share of the cost of the realignment. The mission urged that
a new co-donors' conference be held as soon as possible. On the Long Tunnel
(No. 4), which was 4.5 km in length, the contractor had entered an unexpected
zone of poor rock where excavation was only about 1.5m per day instead of the
expected 4 to 6m, while work on Tunnel No. 1 (425m) had stopped for the same
reason. The latter tunnel needed to be completed without delay as a nearby
plant would soon start prefabricating the 30m-long bridge beams which had to



- 8 -
be transported through the tunnel to the various bridge sites. Tunnel No. 2
had been replaced by a cut while work on Tunnel No. 3 was proceeding well. A
Bank railway engineer sent out in October 1978 confirmed the serious problems
being encountered in building tunnels Nos. 1 and 4. ATC was on the verge of
declaring the contractor in default if it did not remedy the situation. The
latter had responded with a new program with an acceptable rate of progress
which entailed bringing in additional staff, equipment and reinforcing materi-
al. The Bank engineer reported that the situation had developed from a lack
of supervision and poor communications between the contractor's site and
headquarters.
3.10      At the Bank's urging, a co-donors' conference was scheduled for
November 1978 in Paris, followed by another one in Pointe Noire where the cost
estimates were reviewed in more detail.  At the conference, the co-donors,
including the Bank, were astounded by the documents prepared by ATC with a new
total cost of the realignment of between CFAF 49.5 billion and CFAF 51.8 bil-
lion.  Despite the co-donors' insistence, neither ATC nor its consultant was
able to give comprehensive and satisfactory reasons for the large increase in
estimates since the June 1978 estimate of CFAF 41.3 billion.   Bank staff
indicated that it was not possible, in view of the magnitude of the latest
cost estimates, to find savings to contain the realignment's costs within the
previous estimate.
3.11      By April 1979, the financial situation of ATC had worsened.  Rail
traffic for the first quarter had fallen 23% less than forecast.  With low
productivity and poor locomotive availability persisting, ATC's financial
survival was in jeopardy. It was also evident that (a) an experienced soils
expert was needed to review the instability problems of the earthworks; (b) an
independent and highly experienced engineer was needed to settle the problems
and claims with the contractor; and (c) a review of the role of the technical
assistance to ATC was urgently needed. The above recommendations stemmed from
the Bank's dissatisfaction with the inability of ATC and its supervisory
consultant to properly supervise the project due to insufficient experience in
dealing with a project of the size and complexity of the realignment works.
ATC's role under the conditions of the contract vade it responsible for
supervision, rather than the consultant, who basi'oally provided ATC with
staff. ATC also had bilateral technical assistants, but a lack of qualified
counterparts to the technical assistants hampered their activities. Moreover,
a change in the basic attitude of ATC towards training was deemed indispens-
able. As a result, a consultant was selected to carry out the improvement of
training facilities throughout the ATC syptem.
B. Supplementary Financing
3.12      At the end of Nay 1979, the realignment was about 50% completed.
The Bank had disbursed US$26.5 M or 852 of the US$31.0 M allocated to the
realignment, and US$30.9 M or 80% of the loan amount of US$38.0 M. An econom-
ic reassessment of the project indicated that the regional rates of return on
the basis of its full cost would be 7% assuming the Bank's most optimistic
forecast, and -8% assuming long-term stagnation of the economy. On a sunk
cost basis, the rates of return were 16% and -4%, respectively.  The Bank
decided that completion of the project was worthy of its support. Supplemen-
tary financing would be contingent on (a) payment by the Government of its
total arrears to the project of CFAF 2.2 billion, and a commitment to meet the
balance of the original CFAF 5 billion assessment, plus interest and arrears;
(b) Government and ATC commitment to a financial recovery plan for ATC;
(c) Government support for operational improvements in ATC including



- 9 -
restructuring  of  technical  assistance,  and  other  measures  to  ralse
productivity; and (d) appointment of an overall project coordinator to ensure
the completion of the realignment under strict financial and technical
controls.
3.13      At a co-donors' conference in June 1979, agreement was reached on a
financing plan to which each of the co-lenders contributed, raising the total
cost estimate to CFAF 60.0 billion, allowing CFAF 4 billion in contingencies.
The Government announced a plan to inject CFAF 4.0 billion towards ATC's
working capital. The conditions attached to the Bank's supplementary financ-
ing were backed by most of the co-donors and no objections were voiced. To
bridge the gap between the present and the supplementary financing, discus-
sions were also held to seek concurrence from the Arab co-donors to temporari-
ly transfer their funds to the earthworks. They still had considerable funds
unused due to the late start of the tunnel works which they were financing,
while the funds for earthworks would soon be fully disbursed. Later, when the
cost overrun on the tunnels became so large, this arrangement had to be
modified again. During the conference, the Bank learned that the preliminary
findings of a geological expert engaged by ATC to study the tunnels indicated
that he anticipated considerable earthworks problems which could result in an
overrun of several billions of CFAF.
3.14      One of the co-donors requested an independent assessment of project
costs and technical features, and the Bank agreed to finance the independent
consultant at a cost of US$150,000 out of loan proceeds and amended its loan
documents accordingly.  In September 1979, a consultant 3/ was selected to
carry out the reevaluation of the CFCO realignment, and the supplementary
credits were appraised.
Supplementary Credits
3.15      The  project  description  remained  essentially  the  same  as  for
Loan 1228-COB except for (a) the procurement of heavy earthwo ks equipment to
enable the railway to clear slides; (b) the provision of additional consulting
services to design and supervise the earthworks and tunnels; (c) the continua-
tion and completion of the management, operations and training improvement
programs already underway; and (d) the procurement of additional locomotives
spare parts and track material needed through 1980-82. The total cost of the
work was now estimated  at  CFAF 72.8 billion or US$331 M.   The  estimated
justification ranged from 16% under a growth scenario assuming successful
implementation of a Bank forestry project, to -4% under a long-term economic
stagnation scenario and no forestry development.
3.16      In the course of preparation and appraisal of the supplementary
credits, the Bank identified several reasons for ATC's inability to cope with
the earthworks problems: (a) the insufficiencies of the detailed design which
provided for very deep cuts in unknown terrain; (b) the slowness and inadequa-
cy of the decision-making process within ATC; (c) poor design characteristics
for drainage works, absence of protective plant covering on the slopes in the
cuts and lack of earth-retaining walls; and (d) the lack of sufficient experi-
ence, capability, authority and leadership of both the chief of ATC's techni-
cal studies division and the supervisory consultant's resident engineer to
3/   Referred to hereafter as the independent consultant.



- 10 -
cope with the problems and supervise properly a project of this size and
complexity. Lastly, the Bank examined the problems raised by the Government's
failure to pay its contribution.
3.1-      In October 1979, the Bank sent a staff Soils Engineer to review the
slope problems, the progress in tunnel construction and the preliminary cost
estimate with ATC.  Agreement was reached on a number of changes In the
alignment to avoid the influence area of possible rock falls or minor slides.
The Soils Engineer also reported that a major problem was to estimate the
location and dimension of fault zones between the two working fronts of the
Long Tunnel. The dimension of the fault zone had an important impact on the
cost of the tunnel because tunneling in fault zones could cost five times more
than in sound rock. He concluded that it was important to reduce this uncer-
tainty to obtain a better cost estimate. This required the clearing of access
tracks on the surface of the mouiitain to survey the terrain and evaluate the
dimension of fault zones.  The contractor at this point indicated that it
would have to stop work in March 1980 and subsequently declare bankruptcy
because of arrears in payments.
Special Action Credit
3.18      In November 1979, the Bank decided to proceed with negotiating a
Special Action Credit with funds contributed by the European Economic Communi-
ty (EEC) for US$5.0 M. The EEC Credit was negotiated in December 1979 in the
Congo. A condition of effectiveness was the implementation of an immediate
tariff increase on domestic traffic and strengthening the staff of CFCO's
Mechanical Engineering Department.  Credit No. 45-COB was approved on Janu-
ary 17, 1980 and signed on April 11, 1980, but did not become effective until
November 18, 1980 because of delays on the part of the Government in taking
the appropriate action.  The project consisted of:  (a) continuation of the
management, operations and training improvement program, and technical assis-
tance to ATC's Mechanical Engineering Department (workshops), through the
provision of about 170 man-months of consultants' services; (b) financing of
equipment related to such program and assistance; and (c) provision of locomo-
tive spare parts. Final disbursement under the Special Action Credit was made
in August 1983.
IDA Credit
3.19      In December 1979, the independent consultant delivered his final
report, which stressed that "to master the difficulties still ahead it was
essential that ATC provide a project management which should foremost (i) be
able to take a strong stand towards the contractors and still have good
relations with them; (ii) identify problems quickly and have a flexible
approach to their solution; (iii) take the necessary measures or suggest the
solutions quickly; and (iv) review and, if necessary, revise the work program
and the cost estimates periodically at short intervals." Since the contract
for Lot 6 had been signed several years ago, intervening events had partly
eroded the contractual basis and presented a number of problems. The Bank,
aware that neither ATC nor its supervisory consultant had sufficient experi-
ence and qualifications to negotiate a large and complex contract of the type,
recommended, and ATC agreed, to hire competent and experienced advisors for
both technical and legal matters, to assist it in thoroughly preparing and
negotiating necessary contract amendments. ATC indicated that it proposed to
use the independent consultant as its technical advisor, and would engage a
vampetent legal advisor. The appraisal mission also noted that, while the
economic rate of return for the overall project was clearly below normally



- 11 -
acceptable levels, it was appropriate for deciding on possible supplementary
financing to evaluate the project on a sunk cost basis. The ERR, calculated
on this basis, was expected to be in the range of 10%.
3.20      Although during the project review it was noted that "the proposed
investment to complete the realignment (ignoring sunk costs) is likely to have
at best a marginal ERR on the regional basis and a low return on the national
basis," it was accepted that the realignment was now 70% complete and that,
therefore, it was difficult to do anything else but complete the project. It
was also noted that, at the time, the economic prospects of the Congo had
improved dramatically and additional traffic was more likelv to materialize.
The project's ERR were estimated at 12% on a regional basis and 8% on a
national basis.
3.21      At a co-donors' conference in April 1980, agreement was substantial-
ly reached on a revised financing plan for the project.   The Bank's new
contribution was US$30 M, the contributions of other co-donors were generally
proportional to their earlier contributions, and a few new co-donors indicated
an interest in helping to cover the remaining financial gap. Total supplemen-
tary financing amounted to US$167.6 M.  The total cost of the realignment
component was estimated at US$357.2 M as compared to US$148.8 M at the time of
the original appraisal, an increase of 140%. Credit 1047-COB was negotiated
on April 23-28, presented to the Board on June 19 and signed on July 15, 1980.
In a supplementary letter to the Credit, the Government agreed to implement an
action plan to take various measures to strengthen ATC. Delays on the part of
the Government in approving satisfactory tariff increases, held up Credit
effectiveness for nine months.
3.22      The project was defined as:  (a) the completion of the CFCO realign-
ment; (b) the procurement of equipment for maintaining and repairing the
realigned section; and (c) consulting services for supervision and assistance
to ATC in preparing and negotiating amendments to the civil works contract.
The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1982.
C. Project Completion.i and Costs
Problems in the Long Tunnel
3.23      In a third visit to the Congo in mid-April 1980, the Bank's Soils
Engineer found that the previous arrangements to identify critical slopes and
cuts were proceeding satisfactorily.   As regards the Long Tunnel, further
difficulties had been encountered with flooding and mud flow from faults
encountered at the working faces. Some of the crews were inexperienced and
there was the possibility of serious accidents. There were strong differences
of opinion on the part of the contractor and ATC as to how best to proceed.
The real problem, according to the engineer's report, was not to determine
which method was best, but "to select and immediately appoint an experienced,
high caliber engineer to represent ATC at the site. This engineer should have
the authority and responsibility to determine the right tunneling tech-
niques...." Action on these recommendations was a key issue during the
negotiations of the Supplementary Credit, and necessitated a special Bank
mission to the Congo in May to resolve Government objections and agree on the
role of the independent consultant in the supervision of the Long Tunnel. The
terms of reference stipulated "that the consultant would be the sole represen-
tative of the owner on the tunnel site supervising and coordinating the
different parties involved and authorized to take, on the owner's behalf, all



- 12 -
emergency decisions." A ccntract between the independent consultant and ATC
was signed on June 13, 1980 and its engineer was on the job early in August.
3,24      Towards the end of 1980, work on the Long Tunnel was still progress-
ing slowly. The tunnel was on the critical path as it was not expected to be
completed until July 1982 at the earliest, while the remaining civil works,
including track laying and ballasting, were expected to be completed by
November 1981. Work had slowed to about two meters a day at the km 67 end,
and almost stopped at the km 72 end due to difficult soils and water inflows.
ATC had brought in a third consultant, 4/ and a dispute arose among the
consultants and the contractor as to the best technical solution for support-
ing the tunnel in difficult zones.  Disagreement also existed between the
contractor's head office and its tunnel engineer on site. At a meeting in
Paris in January 1981, agreement as to how to proceed was reached by all
parties.
3.25      By mid-1981, civil works on the realignment were progressing satis-
factorily except in the Long Tunnel. In addition to poor soil characteristics
encountered at both faces, progress continued to be hampered by disagreements
between ATC and the contractor, deficient organization on the job site and
weak supervision by the consultants. The matter had been discussed with ATC
and the independent consultant in recent meetings, and it was expected that
staff changes on the part of the latter would improve the situation. By late
1981, all major civil works outside the Tunnel were nearing completion and had
been satisfactorily executed. Progress on the Long Tunnel was still unsatis-
factory. At the km 67 end, progress was only 1.65 m per working date despite
new construction techniques and equipment introduced since early September.
The low rate was attributed by the Bank to inefficient work organization,
inadequate staffing and equipment breakdown, rather than to adverse ground
conditions. ATC did not accept the contractor's proposal for a cement injec-
tion program at km 72, and took over the responsibility of managing directly
the tunnelling team. This led to collapses of the tunnel walls, water and mud
Inflows, and major damage to the supporting material.  Excavation was now "in
a state of retreat" in the face of the most adverse ground and water condi-
tions yet encountered. In July 1981, ATC handed back the responsibility for
execution of the tunnel works to the contractor who accepted it on the condi-
tion that the full injection program it had recommended earlier be imple-
mented. A concrete shield was thus built and a grouting-drainage program was
carried out successfully.
3.26      The Bank expressed concern over the supervision arrangements, as ATC
had engaged additional experts from the supervisory consultant to assist it in
the technical supervision of tunnel construction. They were also to carry out
various studies for the completion of the tunnel, and to prepare proposals for
the settlement of possible claims from the contractor for the additional works
required to repair damages to the tunnel at the km 72 end. These changes had
not been brought to the attention of the Association, and the terms of refer-
ence of the various consultants needed clarification to avoid overlapping and
confusion in their respective responsibilities. In December 1981, the head of
the independent consultant visited the site and noted that to speed up pro-
gress on the tunnel, the contractor needed to (a) substantially improve his
4/   Hereafter referred to as the tunnel consultant.



- 13 -
work organization; (b) provide more experienced supervising staff; and (c) im-
prove the availability of tunnel excavation equipment.
3.27      By mid-1982, all major civil works outside the Long Tunnel were
completed, and progress had improved in the Tunnel. Massive grouting was
underway at the km 72 end, and the work organization and rate of progress had
improved at the km 67 end with better soil conditions being encountered.
Progress continued for the next four months at a satisfactory rate of about
100 m per month.
Amendments to the Realignment Contract
3.28      In 1981, ATC selected, after Bank advice, legal council to assist it
in negotiations with the contractor on contractual amendments and new unit
prices for tunnel works which, due to unexpected rock conditions, had not been
provided for in the original contract.  ATC was advised that the Bank's
agreement was necessary prior to the effectiveness of such amendments. A Bank
mission in 1982 found that ATC, assisted by its consultants and its legal
council, was under considerable pressure to conclude the negotiations with the
contractor before a deadline set by the Congo's Minister of Transport and
Civil Aviation (April 30, 1982). The mission found that ATC's dossier w7 8 ill
prepared due to pressure on its advisors to come up with rough estimates, or
to review hastily prepared proposals, and noted that very little attention was
being given by ATC to its advisors' recommendations. The mission felt that
there was a tendency to give up considerable amounts after bargaining, and the
contractor's figures were not supported by hard Justification. Nevertheless,
the Government reached agreement with the contractor in April 1982. The Bank
was given two reports:   the first on the justification of the agreements
reached with the contractor on settlement of outstanding claims, and the
second on a revised cost estimate and forecast schedule of completion of the
main tunnel works remaining under the project.  ATC also submitted to the
Association formal statements from its consultants and legal council approving
the acceptability of the proposed agreements.  These statements were subse-
quently found to be satisfactory, and the Association cabled its no objection
in August 1982.
3.29      Nevertheless, in July 1982, it became apparent that, once again,
additional financing of the works would be required, and, in April 1983, a
co-donors meeting was convened to mobilize the additional financing. It also
served to clarify technical issues related to the Long Tunnel, to update the
project's cost flow situation, to air concerns about ATC's financial and
operating problems, and to develop an informal consensus among the co-donors
as to how the remaining financing gap shovld be met.  It was agreed that
another meeting should be held in late 1983, following daylighting of the
Tunnel, when cost overruns should be more precisely known.
3.30      The Bank's Soils Engineer visited the Long Tunnel in April 1983 and
found that ATC, the consultants and the contractor had finally achieved
sufficient mastery of the technical solutions to overcome any problems they
might encounter in the remaining tunnel works. The managemer.t of the works
was satisfactory and the cooperation among the parties involved was reasonably
good. The Long Tunnel was finally broken through in the upper half section in
July 1983. Excavation of the remaining 1,425 meters of the lower half section
was not completed until April 1984. Tunnel lining in weak zones and track
laying took almost another year. Installation of the ventilation system was
completed in April 1985 and the signalling and communications systems shortly
thereafter. Operations on the new line started in July 1985, more than five



- 14 -
and a half years beyond the original completion date. Moreover, the old line
was never closed despite the original intention to do so, because the Govern-
ment and ATC feared problems on the realignment and because there were no
alternatives for serving the villages along the old line. The road to these
villages was never improved due to low traffic volumes which did not justify
their rehabilitation.
3.31      The total cost of the realignment construction contract for civil
works was estimated at appraisal at CFAF 27.6 billion or US$123 M. The final
cost of the contract was CFAF 85.4 billion or US$315 M, an overrun of 156%.
The total cost of the CFCO realignment including track, signalling, telecommu-
nications,  stations  and  supervisiou,  was  estimated  at  appraisal  at
CWAF 33.5 billion or US$148.8 M;  the final cost was CFAF 108.1 billion or
US$399 M, an overrun of 168% (Table 3-2).  Table 3-4 shows the rise in the
cost estimate for the realignment since the project was first conceived until
completion, while Table 3-5 shows the relationship of the CFAF to the US dol-
lar over approximately the same period.
Technical Assistance to ATC
3.32      At the end of 1980, progress under the technical assistance program
was noted as satisfactory. Some changes had been made within ATC regarding
training responsibilities.   Further technical assistance was needed in the
workshops and supply department which would be provided under a program
financed by the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). Training in
the maintenance of machine tools was to be resumed, as well as on-the-job
training in the fields of operations, transport planning and permanent way.
Work was continuing on establishing an accounting system, an automated order
processing and billing system, and the development of a new personnel statute
as well as setting up a personnel data base.
3.33      By mid-1981, on-the-job training in the Operations Department of ATC
had started. A program for the maintenance of rolling equipment had been
prepared which included the training of supervisory staff, locomotive drivers,
maintenance staff and the construction of classrooms. The implementation of a
transport plan had been delayed while the financial experts completed the
design of a new cost accounting system. Further work was required to install
the system. The new personnel statute had been approved by the Government,
and work on the preparation of ATC's manpower plan had started.
3.34      All but two of the team of experts on personnel management and
training in the Operations Department had completed their work by the end of
November 1982. A mission at the time noted that while on-the-job training was
carried out satisfactorily, the quality of the work on transport planning and
manpower planning appeared below average, mostly because of lack of commitment
of ATC's management. About 97% of the spare parts had been delivered and the
rest was expected early in 1983.
D. ATC's Liquidity Problems
3.35      By mid 1980, the operational efficiency of CFCO appeared to have
improved and all transport demand was being satisfied. The backlog of timber
at Brazzaville had been shipped to Pointe Noire. At the end of 1980, the Bank
considered that further improvement in CFCO's operations was necessary for
traffic planning and rolling stock management. It was expected that the CFCO
would meet the operational targets set forth in the Project Agreement.  In
1980, CFCO's freight traffic had reached the maximum attained in the past



- 15 -
(1971), and passenger traffic had resumed a growing trend.  Comilog traffic
was stable and timber traffic was ahead of forecasts by 45%. Project finances
remained satisfactory to date due to advances provided by ADB, Government and
FED. The overall financing plan was almost fully firmed up, and ATC's finan-
cial situation was considered healthy due to improved 1980 budget performance.
An increase in tariffs was necessary, according to -he Bank, in order to
improve the difficult financial situation of CFCO, and this was made a condi-
tion of effectiveness of the new Bank lending operation.  CFCO tariffs were
raised in January 1981 and Credit 1047-COB became effective on April 24, 1981.
3.36      ATC had selected a French organization to act as its procurement
agent for purchasing spare parts for locomotives, etc. By mid-1981, procure-
ment of spare parts was progressing satisfactorily, the Bank was satisfied
that the procurement agent was complying with its guidelines, and CFCO's
operating performance was improving. Overall turnaround time of freight cars
had been reduced. The annual build up of the backlog in timber from Brazza-
ville was seen as a seasonal phenomenon, and the situation would be back to
normal by the beginning of the next season. Total timber traffic had reached
668,700 tons against 483,400 tons in 1979, a 38% increase.
3.37      By October 1982, additional financing amounting to CFAF 14.5 billion
was ieeded to complete the works. One co-donor had suspended disbursements
becaise of ATC's failure to communicate adequately with the co-donor, and
other co-donors were disbursing very slowly. As a result, payment arrears to
the contractor had reached CFAF 7 billion, and its lenders were threatening
foreclosure unless rapid steps were taken to reduce the debt. ATC's financial
situation had deteriorated considerably in 1982 because of an eight months'
delay imposed by the Government on the introduction of the previously approved
tariff increases, and a promised subsidy to ATC to compensate it for the delay
was still outstanding.
3.38      Despite this serious financial situation, ATC was proposing an
expenditure of several hundred million US dollars for various works outside
the project despite a total lack of feasibility studies to justify such major
investments. The Association approved the purchase of some urgently needed
railway equipment, but urged ATC to send details of its 1983-86 investment
needs together with TOR for feasibility studies of new major infrastructure
works. The receipt of the information was a minimum condition for the release
of US$2.0 M by the Association for the realignment works. Moreover, although
ATC was supposed to enjoy autonomy in developing its data processing activi-
ties, requirements set by the Congolese Office for Computer Activities (OCI),
on the selection of computer software, were hampering ATC's development of
adequate accounting systems and improvement of management controls.
3.39      At the end of 1982, the personnel statutes approved in principle by
ATC's management aud the Government in March 1981 were still under discussion
with the unions and party representatives. There was little hope that the
position of ATC and the unions could be reconciled in view of the unacceptable
claims put forward by labor, not only regarding wages and benefits, but also
in terms of union and party officials interfering in day-to-day management of
ATC. ATC's management at all levels, suffered from interference. The situa-
tion was worsening to the extent that it was jeopardizing ATC's viability. It
was clear that ATC was not managed within normal comercial guidelines.



- 16 -
Further Setbacks
3.40      A mission in February 1983 noted that ATC's operations and finances
had deteriorated. ATC was still experiencing severe liquidity problems as a
result of the non payment of the 1982 tariff subsidy of CFAF 2 billion which
had been promised for early 1983. As a consequence, ATC was in default of the
Credit Agreement. ATC's 1983 budget had not been finalized, and no steps had
been taken to ensure the early introduction of the 14.4% tariff increase
provided for in the budget. This constituted a second default. The mission
report recommended that strong pressure should be put on the 'overment to
take corrective action.
E. Unapproved Procurement for ATC
3.41      In April 1983, a supervision mission found that the Government had
authorized several major commitments mostly without the concurrence of ATC's
management, or prior consultation with IDA. This included (a) an order for
expensive rolling stock with quantitative standards, far exceeding needs, at a
cost of US$30 M; (b) a contract to a subsidiary of the contractor, without
competition, for track rehabilitation costing US$12 H; and (c) direct purchase
of locomotives in numbers in excess of ATC's needs. The Government indicated
that it did not intend to consult IDA on such investment decisions. The Bank
promptly telexed its objections to the Government.
3.42      Regarding the rolling stock purchase, ATC said that the Ministry of
Transport and Civil Aviation (MTCA), which had placed the order, had no such
authorization from ATC, nor did ATC's statutes allow it to unilaterally take
such steps. Furthermore, ATC indicated that the order was not part of any
investment plan since its needs had already been filled by two limited inter-
national tenders. The Central Government acknowledged that ICB procedures had
not been used nor the required consultations been held with the Bank, and that
the order had been placed with the authorization of the Prime Minister. In
response to the Bank's views, the Government had decided to reduce the order
by about 25%.  The Bank felt that this was not enough as ATC's financial
situation was sufficiently precarious and its further debt carrying capacity
ambiguous enough so as to warrant further analysis and discussion. Further-
more, a reasonable consensus among ATC, the Government and the Bank on ATC's
need for rolling stock did not yet exist, largely due to the absence of an
up-to-date inventory of its equipment and to disparate views about further
traffic demands.
3.43      The Bank telexed the Government on May 24, 1983 conveying its grave
concern with regard to ATC finances. It noted that the Government intended to
reduce the order for rolling stock but that this step was still not satisfac-
tory. By the end of June, the Government had not taken any action on raising
tariffs in 1983, or changed its decision regarding the acquisition of rolling
stock. ATC's financing situation was noted by the recent supervislon mission
as critical. As a result, ATC was unable to respect most of its financial
covenants. The Government replied on June 30 that it would make a consider-
able effort to meet its financial obligations to the project and to ATC, and
that a possible tariff increase was under study.   However,  there was no
indication as to the size or timing of the increases, nor any compensation for
its late introduction. The Government confirmed its earlier reduction of the
rolling stock order, but did not offer to further reduce or defer the order.
The Bank believed that the reduction of the order was insufficient, prices
were still too high, and the order still included material ill adapted to
ATC's needs.



- 17 -
Credit Suspension
3.44      On August 19, 1983, the Bank informed the Government and all other
co-donors that it would suspend disbursements unless the Government agreed to
a substantial tariff increase and deferred a substantial portion of the
rolling stock order, until an independent reassessment of ATC's investment
requirements could be made. The Government replied that it was taking action
on the matter of the tariff increase, but requested a month's deferment of the
deadline set by the Bank. As regards the rolling stock, it agreed to again
reduce the order and put the remainder on option. On November 30, the Govern-
ment informed the Bank that it had submitted a proposal for a 15 to 18%
increase in tariffs to take effect January 1, 1984 to its Political Bureau for
approval. On December 2, the Bank informed the Government (a) that it had no
objection to its proposal for the rolling stock order provided that the
optional status of the remainder of the order involved no financial commit-
ment; and (b) that the level of tariff increase proposed was insufficient and
thus an increase of at least 30% was necessary, half by January 1984 and the
remainder by July 1, 1984. The Bank again extended the deadline for suspen-
sion to January 3, 1984.  Following further negotiations during which some
progress was made, the deadline was extended twice to February 10, 1984.
3.45      In March 1984, the Government confirmed it's intention to approve an
increase in ATC's tariffs by an overall 18%, and compensate ATC for an amount
equivalent to the increase until the decision became effective. There was no
indication in the Government's latest response that it was prepared to again
increase ATC tariffs later in 1984.  The Bank concluded that in view of a
Party Congress in July (the first in five years) it was unlikely that the
Government could be persuaded to do so. It therefore decided to modify the
term of the conditionality,  or renewal/suspension of disbursements.   The
Government was informed on April 6, that:
(a) in recognition of its actions to modify ATC's rolling stock order
and to significantly increase tariffs, the Association would dis-
burse against outstanding withdrawal applications currently held by
it since last October amounting to US$3 M on confirmation that:
(i) the tariff increase had been published; (ii) the subsidy due to
ATC for January and February 1984 had been paid to ATC; (iii) the
optional status of the remainder of the rolling stock order involved
no financial commitment; and (iv) the Government and ATC agreed to
prepare and implement a recovery plan for ATC;
(b) with an exception of disbursements required for consulting services,
the Association formally suspended withdrawal rights on the remain-
ing balance of approximately US$3 M; and
(c) the Association would resume normal disbursements of the remaining
funds once (i) the Government had agreed to the 1984 tariff; and
(ii) a recovery plan had been adopted.
3.46      The Prime Minister replied on April 26, 1984 that the Government had
decided on (a) a tariff increase of 33.6% excep. for passengers and eEsantial
goods; (b) the payment of all Government arrears to ATC before e'.d 1984;
(c) the reduction of ATC's operating cost and import budget; and (d) the
establishment of a CFAF 1 billion ceiling on ATC's deficit. Accordingly, the
Bank proceeded to disburse against outstanding applications, but decided to
maintain the suspension until it was able to assess the extent to which the



- 18 -
proposed measures were sufficient to restore ATC's financial viability. Full
disbursements were resumed on July 17, 1984.
3.47      According to a supervision report in early 1985, 1984 was another
bad year financially for ATC with expected operating losses of around CFAF 4
billion. These were caused by: a) the late authorization of tariff increases;
b) poor operating performance by the CFCO; and c) inadequate financial manage-
ment to curb the continuing escalation of operating costs. ATC's liquidity
situation, already severely afflicted by the lack of profitability, was being
rendered precarious by continuing delays in Government payments of commitments
to ATC in response to commercial debt compensation and its financing share of
the realignment project. ATC's weak financial management and poor budgeting
was largely the result of a policy of excessive centralization of management
and controls, and insufficient delegatior. of responsibility to departmental
managers.
IV. TRAFFIC, OPERATIONS AND FINANCES
A. Traffic
4.01      The major commodities handled by ATC are timber, most of which is
handled successively by each of ATC's modal departments; manganese ore trans-
ported over 200 kilometers of the CFCO line for export shipment at Pointe
Noire; and general cargo.
Freight
4.02      The following table shows appraisal projections and actuals of ATC's
freight traffic broken down by department and major commodities for the key
years 1976 (project start), 1979 (appraisal-assumed completion date), and 1985
(actual completion date). Details are in Table 4-1(a).

During appraisal of Credit 1047-COB, timber traffic projections were revised
downwards to 360,000 tons for the river transport link, 548,000 tons at the
port of Brazzaville, and 858,000 tons on the CFCO and the Port of Pointe Noire
in 1985.
4.03       The most striking fact disclosed by the above table is that actual
traffic on each of the four departments of ATC remained stagnant or even
decreased during project implementation while traffic projections anticipated
that (a) river transport traffic would increase threefold over the period
1976-79 and double again over the next five years, 1980-85; (b) river ports
traffic would double during each of these two periods; CFCO transports would
increase by 30% over 1976-79 and by an additional 40% over 1980-85; and
(c) Pointe Noire Port cargo handling would increase 37% and 25% during each of
the two periods.
General Cargo
4.04       General cargo consists mainly of goods imported at Pointe Noire for
domestic consumption, petroleum products,  and food.   General cargo traffic
represents about 30% of river transport and ports traffic and about 25% of the
combined railway and ports freight handling over 1976-85.
Manganese
4.05      Manganese ore traffic handled by the CFCO and the Port of Pointe
Noire has been consistently about 15% below the 2,600 million tons anticipated
at appraisal.   Also,  as anticipated  at appraisal,  this  traffic, which is
carried will, within the next few years, be transferred to the recently
completed Gabonese Railway. About 50% will be transferred in 1989.



- 20 -
Timber
4.06      Appraisal forecasts for timber traffic on the CFCO were based on the
following data and assumptions:   (a) during the period 1962-73 world wide
imports of tropical hardwood had grown at about 12% per annum; (b) African
timber exports had not kept pace with the growing European demand; (c) the
European import demand for African timber was expected to grow from 15.3 mil-
lion ms in 1973 to about 25 million ms by 1985, while African export capacity
was only about 10 million m3 in 1972; (d) the estimated combined export
capacity of the four countries in the ATC service area could reach 5.2 to
6.1 million tons; and (e) the ATC share of the anticipated export capacity was
estimated at 2 million tons of which 1.2 million would originate from Congo
and 0.4 million each from Cameroon and CAR.
4.07      An important assumption of these ambitious traffic projections was
that the Government would take legal and administrative action to raise Congo
timber production to the required level.  To this effect, it was agreed at
negotiations of Loan 1228-COB that the Government would (a) grant operating
rights in the South Congo forestry zone not later than December 31, 1977;
(b) undertake an inventory and prepare an exploitation plan for forestry
zone II in Northern Congo; (c) upgrade the forestry related lease system, laws
and regulation; and (d) report annually to the Bank on action taken, starting
in 1976. The Bank cooperated with the Government in implementing the forestry
inventory and legal action and prepared a forestry study on the northern Congo
forestry potential.   The conclusions of this study provided the basis for
appraising the River Transport Project (Credit 1179-COB, 1981), designed to
meet the needs of ATC's river transport operations, and the Ouesso Wood
Processing Project (Loan 2298-COB, 1983) which includes a substantial forestry
exploitation component.
4.08      Despite these measures, even the revised projections proved far too
optimistic as shown by the following data:

Total CFCO and Pointe Noire  484      498
4.09      ATC's inadequate operational performance is one of the reasons for
the disappointing results with respect to timber originating from the CAR,
Cameroon and Northern Congo. However, the evolution of the timber market in
Europe, the Government's slow action in awarding timber exploitation conces-
sions in Northern Congo and inefficient commercial policies were also contrib-
uting factors. The following table compares appraisal projections and actuals
for 1987 of timber exports of the four countries in the ATC service area.

CAR                0.4 - 0.6          0.1
Appraisal proiections were based on the assumption that demand emanating from
France and the Federal Republic of Germany, the two main importers of timber
produced in the four countries, would increase.  These expectations did not
materialize as shown in the follow_ng table of sawlogs and sawtimber imports
over 1977/85 in France and the Federal Republic of Germany:
Mi llion Tons

1985     1138     1969       866    3954
4.10      The declining demand did not encourage the Government to make good
on earlier commitments to grant forestry exploitation concessions, at least as
long as the market for hardwood timber did not recover from its present
weakness. Despite its commitments under the project, the Government has acted
much slower than anticipated in awarding forestry exploitation permits in
Northern Congo.   Reasons for this have not been clearly defined.   It is,
however, likely that foreign timber companies were reluctant to invest in the
Congo because of unfavorable legislation and/or difficult access to operating
areas. Local timber companies were most likely short of funds to exploit
large areas for which they had obtained concessions. Considering the decline
in demand, it is difficult to be critical of this performance over the project
period.
Passengers
4.11      Contrary to freight, passenger traffic on the CFCO, the sole ATC
department handling a substantial passenger traffic, has substantially exceed-
ed appraisal projections (Table 4-1(b)), mainly because rail is the only
affordable means for travelling between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire.   As
could be expected, passenger traffic peaked over 1980-85 in parallel with the
growth of GDP during the oil boom period. However, this traffic generates
heavy losses because tariffs have been kept low by the Government.
Conclusion
4.12      Overall, ATC was far from achieving appraisal traffic projections,
mainly because the anticipated economic growth rate, which would have generat-
ed additional traffic and the anticipated increase in demand for African
timber, did not materialize. In addition, ATC will loose in 1989 at least 50%
of COMILOG's manganese traffic which will be carried over the Trans-Gabonese
Railway. Prospects for full utilization of the additional capacity resulting
from the CFCO realignment are thus not good.

B. Operations
1976-78
4.13      To measure ATC's progress towards better operating efficiency needed
for anticipated traffic demand at the lowest possible cost, the Government,
ATC, and the Bank agreed on a set of operating targets for 1978 for each of
ATC's departments. However, precise information on the degree of achievement
of the operating targets of the River Transport and Ports departments is not
available. The operating targets, however, could Lot have been met since the
1978 river traffic was only 40% of appraisal forecasts, and actual 1978 port
traffic was 35% below estimates.
4.14      CFCO also failed to reach some of its operating targets.  Average
1978 freight cars turnaround time averaged 11 days while targets were 5.5 days
for lumber cars and eight days for general cargo cars, mainly because of
inadequate maintenance of rolling stock as a result of a chronic shortage in
spare parts and inadequate utilization of technical assistance.  Locomotive
availability was better than anticipated at 76% against a 61% target. With
hindsight, the targets set were too high. These targets were set to allow ATC
to meet anticipated traffic demand rather than based on realistic criteria.
Overly optimistic projections, mainly with reference to timber, were revised
downward during negotiations of Credit Agreement 1047-COB.
1979-85
4.15      The revised Plan of Action defined for the Supplementary Credits
(para 3.15) recognized the lack of realism of the previous plan and lowered
targets except for the CFCO:   on river transports the average turnaround
targets on the Brazzaville-Bangui line was increased from 26 days in the
earlier plan to 30 days over 1980-84; no performance target was set for the
Port of Brazzaville; annual tonnage of cargo per berth objectives for the Fort
of Pointe Noire were reduced from 170,000 tons for general cargo berths and
250,000 tons for timber berths, in 1978, under the earlier plan, to 90,000 and
100,000 in 1980, and 115,000 and 130,000 tons in 1984. For the CFCO, the 1978
76% average locomotive availability target under the 1976 plan was revised to
70% in 1980, and 60% in 1984, while freight cars turnaround times were kept at
the same level under the two plans.

/a Results not comparable with targeted performance due to exceptionally low water levels on the
Congo-Sangha and Oubangui Rivers.
The table shows that (a) river transport was far behind appraisal targets;
(b) the Port of Pointe Noire exceeded targets in 1984; and (c) the CFCO
Mi) met locomotive availability objectives over 1980-84; (ii) exceeded the
target for timber car rotation in 1980 and 1982 but could not repeat this
performance in 1984; and (iii) was not able to meet turnaround target for
general cargo cars (in fact, the rotation time increased from 9 in 1980 to 14
in 1984). The contradiction between the CFCO satisfactory motive power avail-
ability ratio and the inadequate car rotation over 1982-84 is mainly explained
by the loss of several locomotives as a result of landslides caused by two
successive heavier-than-usual rainy seasons, in addition to slow car load-
ing/unloading by customers.
C. Finances
4.17      The following analysis comprises three sections:   (a) the overall
effect of project implementation on ATC's financial performance and situation;
(b) the financial results of ATC as a whole and each of its four departments
over 1976-86; and (c) ATC's financial results and situation over 1987-90. The
analysis is supported by Tables 4-2 -- Income statement, 4-3 -- Breakdown of
working expenses, 4-4 -- Sources and application of funds, 4-5 -- Balance
sheet, and 4-6 -- Selected financial ratio. Although ATC was short of meeting
appraisal financial targets (Table 4-6), its overall financial performance was
much  less  disappointing  than  indicated  earlier.   The  crises  referred  to
earlier reflected generally ATC's shortage of funds to pay for its share in
the financing of the realignment and/or the related debt service.  Given the
size of the realignment's cost overrun, ATC would not have been able to
finance its share in the latter's cost even if it had fully met appraisal

objectives. The 1.1% average annual rate of return on fixed assets in use it
achieved over 1976-86 is better than most African railways.

ATC's (a) income statement cumulated over 1976-86, the project implementation

4.19       Analysis  of  the  tables  leads  to the  following conclusions  on  the
impact of project implementation on ATC's financial performance and situation:



- 25 -
(a)  ATC suffered an accumulated net loss of CFAP 16 billion instead of
the anticipated 52 billion profit estimated at appraisal. This Is
mainly due to lower-than-expected sales revenues (-25%) because of
low traffic levels, insufficient productivity and Government reluc-
tance to authorize timely tariff increases, and interest charges 52%
above appraisal estimates.   These charges were a result of addi-
tional borrowing to meet project cost overruns, and additional,
sometimes unwarranted, investments.
(b) The reduced cash income and high investment cost obliged ATC to
deplete  its  working  capital  and  resort  to  heavy  borrowing
(CFAF 160.5 billion) to meet its funding needs, which, in turn, led
to increased debt service despite the provision by the Government
of subsidies more than 15 times higher than the CFAF 2.7 billion
anticipated at appraisal. The analysis of the source and applica-
tion of funds shows that the CFAF 4.9 billion increase in working
capital over the project period, represents the unused part of the
CFAF 8.3 billion subsidy and the CFAF 10.4 billion borrowing by ATC
to make up for the shortage in working capital. Had it not been for
these two sources, ATC's working capital would have been a negative
CFAF 13.8 billion.
(c)  ATC's net worth increased fourfold from CFAF 32.6 to CFAF 132.3 bil-
lion.  The 33/67 debt to equity ratio is an acceptable long-term
situation. However, the CFAF 4 billion in working capital barely
amounts to one half of ATC's monthly 1986 working expenses since it
includes a negative cash position and receivables amounting to about
50% of  1986 sales revenue.   Appraisal projections provided  for
CFAF 17.9 billion in working capital which represented about six
months of working expenses.
ArC's Consolidated and Departmental Profitability, 1976-86
4.20      Timewise, ATC's financial performance during project implementation
may be divided into two periods, 1976-81 and 1982-86. During the first of
these, ATC's consolidated net operating revenue improved gradually from
CFAF 1.8 billion in 1976 to CFAF 3.7 hillio- in 1981. In 1976, ATC achieved a
net CFAF 0.9 billion profit mainly because interest charges were low since the
mobilization of project loans started slowly. This situation deteriorated to
CFAF -0.4 billion in 1977 in parallel with loan mobilization, and then pro-
gressively improved to CFAF + 600 million in 1980 and 1981. ATC's profitabil-
ity rapidly deteriorated over 1982-86 with net operating revenue falling from
CFAF 3.4 billion in 1982 to CFAF -1 billion in 1986, and net profit dropping
from CFAF +0.3 billion in 1982 to CFAF -4.7 billion in 1986.  In addition to
the inadequacy of tariff increases, the main reason for this decline in ATC's
profitability was the severe drop in traffic, mainly on the CFCO, which was
not matched by a decline in operating costs, because of the high proportion of
ATC's fixed costs, mainly staff and overheads. ATC suffered a net operating
loss of CFAF 0.1 billion and a net loss of CFAF 18.3 billion accumulated over
1982-86 versus profits of CFAF 14.1 and 2.1 billion, respectively, over
1976-81.
Breakdown of Profits (Losses) by Department
4.21      Tl- following table shows a breakdown of sales revenues, net operat-
ing revenues and net profits (losses) for each department of ATC over each of
the above-mentioned two periods.

4.22      Since project appraisal, sales revenues earned by these departments
which merged in 1985, have been barely sufficient to cover working costs,
i.e., did not provide any contribution to renewals, investments and/or the
related  debt  service.   Reasons  for  tlis  unsatisfactory  performance were
identified as structural, organizational, and operational.
4.23      While falling short of reaching appraisal projections for operating
ratio (averaging 78% over 1976-81), CFCO sales revenues were sufficient to
cover working cost, and 90% of depreciation over 1976-81, a performance seldom
reached on African Railways.   Over 1984-86,  freight traffic substantially
decreased due to (a) the country's economic problems; (b) the erratic evolu-
tion of the timber market; and (c) a decrease in transport capacity consecu-
tive to the loss of several locomotives in derailments. Because of ATC's high
proportion of fired cost, the decrease in traffic was not paralleled with a
decrease in operating cost. In addition, the Government was unduly slow in
implementing  necessary  tariff  increases.   CFCO,  consequently,  suffered  a
CFAF 6.7 billion net operating deficit, i.e., it covered only 70% of deprecia-
tion over the five-year period and could not contribute to the coverage of the
CFAF 16.8 billion in interest charges facing it.
4.24      Most of these interest charges were caused by the additional borrow-
ing required to finance the cost overrun of the realignment and unplanned
investments. To assist ATC to fulfill its obligations, the Government decided
on annual subsidies equivalent to the debt service contracted to finance the
basic infrastructure of the realignment. To this effect, the Government gave
ATC CFAF 5.1 billion in 1985 to cover CFCO's 1982 and 1983 interest charges,
but has not made any payment since.
4.25      The Port of Pointe Noire has increasingly generated substantial net
operating and net profits totalling CFAF 16 billion in net operating revenue
and CFAF 15 billion in net profits on sales of CFAF 42 billion over 1976-86.
Thanks to these profits, ATC was able to generate CFAF 2 billion net profit
cumulated over 1976-81 and to balance its income statement at the net operat-
ing level over 1982-86.   However, this occurrence was not repeated during
1982-86 mainly because of the high interest charges incurred by ATC's other
departments.
D. ATC's Financial Projections for 1987-90
4.26      Thanks  to  (a) traffic  demand  resulting  from  an  improvement  in
Congo's economy; (b) the additional capacity provided by the realignment and
other investments under the project; and (c) implementation of structural and



- 27 -
cost saving measures, ATC's profitability and financial situation is expected
to progressively improve over the next years as shown by the following consol-
idated data and ratios (1986 data are given for comparison purposes).
Item                    1986      1987      1988      1989      1990

Net Operating Revenue (CFAF billion)  - 0.9      2.8       3.6       2.3       2.8
Operating Ratio %                     102        93        90         94        92
Net Profit (CFAF billion)            - 4.7     - 8.8     - 0.2     - 1.8     - 1.4
Current Ratio                         1.1        1.1       1.0       0.9       0.9

Consequently, project implementation will have a beneficial effect on ATC's
finances.
V. ROLE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSULTANTS
The Realignment Component
5.01      The role played by the consultants in the execution of the realign-
ment works should be examined in the light of the quality of the detailed
engineering actually carried out. As noted in para 1.04, the First Railway
Project financed the detailed engineering of the realignment. The draft terms
of reference for the final engineering survey included in the staff appraisal
report confirm that detailed e4gineering based on adequate soils investigation
was specifically called for. However, an examination of the drawings indi-
cates that, while detailed engineering was in fact carried out, the borings
and test pits on'which the detailed engineering was based were infrequent and
not always to an adequate depth. For example, only two borings were carried
out for the Long Tunnel, one at each end. The Bank's Soils Engineer, who
participated in the supervision of the project, concluded that the resulting
detailed engineering was based on inadequate soils investigation, topographic
work and geological study.   Furthermore,  the mission which appraised  the
supplementary financing of the project (Credit 1047-COB) commented on the
inefficiencies of the original design. The fact that the quantity of earth-
works turned out to be double the consultant's estimate and that none of the
soils or tunnel problems was foreseen, confirms the above views of the design.
5.02      The inadequate field work and the resulting deficient design led, in
turn, to further difficulties. The alignment had to be revised by the con-
tractor once the site was cleared. This did not pose a particular problem for
the contractor for, in accordance with French practice, it is customary for
the contractor to do the detailed design in the field. However, it did delay
progress of the work as many local variants to the alignment had to be exam-
ined  and  approved.   Furthermore,  the  substantial underestimation  of  the
earthwork quantities led to greatly increased cost.
5.03      Another serious shortcoming in the engineering was the allowance of
insufficient contingencies. The consultant's contingency allowance was 10%
for the earthworks and  15% for the tunnels.  Given the inadequate soils
investigations, the contingency allowances for earthworks were far too low,
while the allowance for tunnels was grossly underestimated. For tunnel work,
contingency allowances of  100 to 200%  are not uncommon.   Thus,  original
contingency allowances estimated by the consultant were too low, and continued
to be so every time the estimated costs were recalculated for the co-donors'



- 28 -
conferences. Moreover, the time allowed by the consultant and confirmed by
the Bank staff to complete the work was substantially underestimated, even
when allowing for such unforeseeable factors as the armed raid on the site,
and the delays in drilling the Long Tunnel.
5.04      The selection of the same consultant who designed the project to
supervise the work is normal practice. However, the supervisory consultant
was not given executive authority to supervise the project but was engaged in
an advisory role by ATC as noted in para 1.07.  Given the complexity and
magnitude of the work, this was a major flaw in the management of the project,
as pointed out in para 8.03.
5.05      While this report is critical of the quality of the detailed engi-
neering, it should be pointed out that the funds allocated by the Bank for
detailed engineering under the First Railway Project were woefully underesti-
mated. Only US$1.6 M was allocated under that project for detailed engineer-
ing, or less than 0.5% of the final cost of the realignment. Given the scope,
complexity and remoteness of the project, an allocation of roughly 5% or more
would not have been unreasonable.
5.06      The  independent  consultant's  performance  is more  difficult  to
evaluate. Although it was assigned a leadership role on the Long Tunnel, ATC
never gave the consultant full authority to act on its behalf. Besides, it
would appear from the correspondence that the consultant's earlier personnel
on site did not fully meet the challenge of the Long Tunnel. It was not until
the appointment of the tunnel consultant that appropriate techniques were
finally devised to cope with the rapid changes in soil conditions that materi-
alized as the work proceeded. The independent consultant's performance, as
well as that of the legal council, in negotiating the amendments to the ASHFO
contract, was satisfactory. However, the consultant was handicapped in this
work by the poor site records kept by ATC and its advisors.  The tunnel
consultant is credited with presenting acceptable technical solutions to the
tunnel problems which finally led to agreement on the part of all concerned as
to how to proceed.
Technical Assistance
5.07      The performance of the technical assistance consultant appears to
have been uneven.  It took considerable effort on the part of the Bank to
persuade this firm that it wanted a well managed and coordinated team on site
rather than a loose group of individuals. The consultant finally did field a
satisfactory team, but ATC did not benefit as much as it might have, because
of its failure to provide counterparts, and by its poor attitude to training.
The procurement  firm,  on the other hand,  performed  satisfactorily.   The
consultant engaged by FED kept the co-donors well informed, and was helpful in
providing assistance to ATC management and to Bank supervision missions.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK
ATC
Structure and Organization
6.01      In 1974, the Bank appraisal team found that (a) ATC's administration
by its Board was carried out in a satisfactory manner; (b) the General Manager
had adequate freedom to deal with ATC's normal business; and (c) the manage-
ment and development planning of ATC was competent.
6.02      After five years of supervising the project, and ATC's management
and operations, the Bank's appraisal team for the supplementary credits
arrived at a less positive appreciation of ATC's structure and management than
was made by the original appraisal team (para 1.06).  It noted that ATC's
efficiency in dealing with day-to-day operations was hampered by (a) in-
consistent application of its statutes and frequent interferences from outside
authorities; (b) frequent changes of Congolese management staff; (c) lack of
adequate rules in the relationship between ATC's management, the unions and
local political leaders as regards labor policies; and (d) inadequate person-
nel management and administration based on an out-of-date personnel statute.
6.03      To make up for the above mentioned inadequacies and restore opera-
tional and managerial efficiency the Government, ATC and the Bank agreed on a
plan of action providing, in addition to the operating targets, for a reorgan-
ization of ATC's financial management and accounting, decentralized decision
making, measures for improving ATC's commercial organization and for improving
the technical organization  in each operating  section.   In addition,  the
Government agreed to prepare a manpower plan for 1982-86 and to adopt a
revised personnel statute by mid 1981.
6.04      During preparation of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAL Loan
2866-COB) and the Pilot Public Enterprise Institutional Development Project
(DIEP Loan 2886-COB), the Government and the Bank reached the conclusion that
the measures included in the plan of action could only be efficiently imple-
mented if they were included in a full restructuring program for ATC. This
program became a component of the SAL agreement started in 1987. Its major
objective is to improve the efficiency of ATC's operations and its financial
performance by increasing sales revenues and improving control over operating
cost. To this effect the quality of ATC's management should be enhanced by a
reorganization of ATC.
6.05      To prepare for ATC's reorganization, the Government, ATC, and the
Bank started in 1986 to implement a plan comprising (a) a reorganlzational
study of ATC, including a review of relations between the Government and ATC;
(b) a study for the decentralization of ATC's managerial and accounting
responsibilities; (c) measures for reducing staff costs; (d) a technical
assistance and training program for improving financial management, accounting
and data processing in computer centers in Pointe Noire and Brazzaville,
partly financed from Bank loans; and (e) a tariff study. The full reorganiza-
tion of ATC is expected to be effective by the end of 1989.
6.06      The main results expected from implementation of this plan are (a) a
more decentralized organization of ATC in a close to privatized-like environ-
ment; (b) focussing ATC's activity on the transport function; (c) improved
manager's and staff morale and professional conscientiousness, by increased



- 30 -
delegation of responsibilities; and (d) a better and faster information system
including financial information. The quality and efficiency of ATC's opera-
tions would be enhanced as a result of improved organization, increased
awareness of technical improvements, and staff will to increase ATC's produc-
tivity.
Supervision of Realignment Construction
6.07      ATC, supported by its expatriate technical assistants and advisors,
was not fully competent to manage civil works of the scope and complexity of
the realignment. With hindsight, an experienced and independent entity should
have been placed in charge of the works from the beginning. The need for this
was recognized by Bank supervision missions in 1979 and 1980, but the original
supervision arrangements would have been difficult to change as they were
established in the contract documents of both ASHFO and the supervisory
consultant.   Furthermore,  it appeared that ATC was reluctant  to delegate
authority to its consultants. The result was that there was no one in charge
of the works on site who could speak or act authoritatively on behalf of ATC.
6.08      An experienced supervisory consultant with the authority to act for
ATC on technical matters, would have promptly negotiated the cost of works for
which no unit prices existed in the ASHFO contract at the time the new items
arose. The consultant would have kept accurate site records and would not
have waited for months or years until the contractor's negotiating position
was strengthened because the work in question had already been started or even
completed.  Furthermore, while no engineer can fully predict what will be
encountered in a civil engineering job involving large earth works and tunnel
work, it would not be unreasonable to expect that an experienced consultant
would have anticipated some of the soils and terrain conditions encountered
and would have included prices or other provision for such works in the bid
documents. All this put ATC and its technical and legal advisors at a great
disadvantage in negotiating ASHFO's new prices and claims.
6.09      Moreover, concerning training, ATC did not take full advantage of
the presence of the technical assistance consultant, and thus its staff did
not obtain the full benefits of the training offered. However, progress was
made in the areas of the workshops, right-of-way maintenance, procurement and
accounting.
The Government
6.10      As shown in Table 6-0, the Government's record in complying with the
covenants for Credit 1047-COB, which was essentially a continuation of
Loan 1228-COB, was poor indeed. This was especially so during the later years
of the project when cost overruns escalated, and ATC's operating performance
deteriorated.
6.11      While the Government made strenuous efforts to seek financing for
the realignment, it seemed reluctant to take action on matters which would
have enabled ATC to remain financially viable. It should have expedited the
award of timber concessions to develop traffic for the CFCO system and ap-
proved badly needed tariff increases, but it only did so after considerable
pressure from the Bank.  The Government also frequently failed to meet its
financial obligations to ATC. In all these matters, the Government provided
little support to ATC.



- 31-
6.12      Furthermore, the Government frequently interfered in ATC's manage-
ment of its day-to-day affairs, particularly during 1982-84. The placing of
large purchase orders for railway equipment without ATC's knowledge or approv-
al is the most glaring example of this practice. It took a suspension of the
credit to persuade the Government to observe the credit conditions to which it
had agreed.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.01      Because of the unanticipated high cost of the project and the
failure of freight traffic to expand much beyond that previously carried on
the old align&ent, the rate of return of the project is at best zero. While
at appraisal, the rate of return was considered adequate (para 2.05), by the
time of negotiations, the ERR had become marginal (para 2.06) because of
higher than expected cost of the construction contract.  There were widely
different views at regards traffic growth (para 3.07).  As it turned out,
traffic remained stagnant or even decreased during project implementation in
sharp contrast to the optimistic growth forecasted at appraisal (paras 4.03
and 4.14).
7.02      The Bank made repeated efforts to encourage the Government to open
up new forestry areas to exploitation in order to increase freight traffic,
but it was unsuccessful in this regard. Similarly, the Bank was relatively
unsuccessful in persuading the Government to increase railway tariffs on a
regular basis.  It only did so belatedly and reluctantly.   Thus, revenues
rarely caught up with ever mounting costs.
7.03      Perhaps the key economic issue is whether the existing line should
have been improved rather than building the new line. This issue was consid-
ered by the co-donors, some of whom favored the former, while the Bank sup-
ported the latter alternative. The Bank's position was based on the assump-
tion that the bridges and the Bamba Tunnel were not safe and that a collapse
of this tunnel would close the line and block imports and exports to the Congo
and neighboring countries. The concern over the condition of th, existing
line (para 1.03) was obviously overstated in the SAR, as neither the bridges
nor the tunnel have failed, as was originally feared. While, undoubtedly, the
existing bridges and the tunnel could have been repaired, it is very doubtful
whether the existing sharp curves and steep grades could have been improved
throughout, as any changes in these standards would necessitate the building
of a new alignment under conditions that would presumably have been just as
difficult as the realignment works. In hindsight, given the tremendous cost
overrun of the realignment, and the eventual loss of the Gabon manganese
traffic which was not fully anticipated at the time of appraisal, improvement
of the existing bridges and track with acceptance of higher operating cost
would probably have been the better solution.
7.04      Consideration might have been given to building a road between
Pointe Noire and Brazzaville in place of the railway. However, at that time,
in the light of heavy mineral traffic and the almost complete reliance in the
Congo on rail and river modes of transport, it is understandable that such a
proposal would not have been well received either by the Government or its
financial backers abroad.
7.05      There is no evidence as to whether an assessment was ever made of
the enormous cost of the long delays in building the realignment. One very



- 32 -
rough estimate is that the realignment might have cost 20X less if it were not
for the delays and price increases beyond the time which the project might
raasonably have been expected to be completed.  This estimate does not take
into consideration the cost to ATC of having to prolong its use of the exist-
ing line, and the return foregone in not being able to use the new line much
earlier.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01      The Bank's performance in preparing, seeking financing, and super-
vising the project varied widely as discussed below.
Preparation
8.02      As pointed out in para 5.01, the detailed engineering was not based
on adequate field data. This, in turn, led to the preparation of cost esti-
mates which were not well founded. A higher, and more realistic, project cost
estimate and the corresponding reduction in the economic rate ci return for
the realignment might well have led the Bank to abstain from financing the
project. As noted in paras 2.05 and 2.06, the cost, and thus, the justifica-
tion, of the project were key issues at the time of appraisal and
negotiations.
8.03      As regards the execution of the work, certain Bank decisions exacer-
bated the difficulties which arose on the execution of the work. The decision
to allow ATC to retain responsibility for the day-to-day management of work of
this magnitude was ill-advised, and was to have the gravest consequences on
its efficient execution. This arrangement resulted in the consultants being
placed in an advisory role in a situation which called for a strong and
independent engineer on site.  Failure to ensure proper supervision of the
work led ATC to the brink of financial collapse.
Financing
8.04      For over a decade, the Bank took the lead in seeking financing for
the project, keeping co-donors informed of developments, and in cajoling an
intransigent Government to meet its obligations under the various lending
agreements. This was a demanding and arduous task which must have heavily
taxed the staff assigned to the project. Not only were there frequent mis-
sions to be made to the Congo, but also to co-donor conferences and to the
headquarters of most of the co-donors, to keep them informed and coordinate
their financing to ensure a steady flow of funds to the project.  Finally,
there was an unusual amount of reporting and documentation to be done to keep
not only the Bank management informed, but the co-donors as well. The files
indicate that these tasks were well done. Timely and repeated intervention by
the Bank in the face of many obstacles is credited in good part for the
project's successful conclusion.
8.05      The Bank's role of "Chef de File" of the co-donors (para 2.07) was
not made easier by the fact that each co-donor was an independent institution
with its own rules and regulations.   The Bank's leadership role was not
necessarily accepted by some co-donors who had been involved in the project at
an earlier stage than the Bank. At least one co-donor placed a representative
on the project who, the contractor assumed, was the project coordinator. The
sheer number of co-donors greatly increased the Bank's task of coordinating



- 33 -
the financing of the work. This problem was also exacerbated by the desire of
some co-donors to finance specific lots, and to tied procurement. Thus, when
severe cost overruns arose, an imbalance in the availability of funds occurred
resulting in a shortage of funds for some lots, while funds for other lots
were still available.   If possible, these types of financing arrangements
should be avoided in future, and the funds pooled rather than allocated to
specific works.
Supervision
8.06      The Bank's supervision of the project was frequent and thorough.
Thirty-five missions were sent out, including four visits by a soils special-
ist.  The problems were correctly identified.  Despite the frequent staff
recommendations that an experienced and independent engineer be placed on
site, the Bank did not appear to have insisted forcefully enoueh on the
contract amendments to bring this change about.  Admittedly,  such changes
would have been difficult to accomplish when works were underway and organiza-
tions were in place. The Bank, on the other hand, took appropriate action in
suspending the credit when every effort to persuade the Government to meet its
obligations had failed.
8.07      It is not clear from the files why, after the appointment of the
independent consultant, the Bank considered engaging the services of yet
another firm to review the prices which had been negotiated with ASHFO. It is
known that site records were not adequate, which may have raised questions as
to the reasonableness of the new prices. Towards the end of the project, KDF
engaged an additional firm to check on costs. It would appear that, in the
case of consultants, the Bank and the co-donors did not always act in unison.
8.08      The Bank took an active role in persuading the Government to approve
increases in CFCO's tariffs and to minimize its interference in ATC's
day-to-day affairs, and displayed unremitting determination in forcing the
Government to act on these matters. This was done at a time when the Bank's
leverage appeared small, but with the support of co-donors, the Bank's will
prevailed.
8.09      From the beginning of the project, the Bank made sustained efforts
to encourage the Government to develop and expand traffic of the CFCO. The
Bank worked for years to encourage the development of the forestry industry
and increase its output in order to bolster CFCO's revenues. This effort was
continued under the River Transport Project (Credit 1179-COB).
IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMIENDATIONS
9.01      The detailed engineering of the realignment was not soundly based.
As a result, the cost estimates were far too low, contingencies were inade-
quate, and the time allowed to execute the work was badly underestimated.
9.02      The decision to allow ATC to be fully responsible for the execution
of the realignment component was a mistake which contributed much to the long
delay in completing the project and the enormous cost overruns. An indepen-
dent entity assisted by experienced consultants should have been placed in
charge of the day-to-day site operations with full authority to direct the
works. They should have been directly responsible under ATC for cost control
and any negotiations with the contractor involving technical matters.



- 34 -
9.03      Because of the unanticipated high cost of the project and little
growth in freight traffic, the rate of return of the project is at best zero.
9.04      The Bank's performance was mixed.  It accepted detailed engineering
which was not soundly based, and the resulting cost estimates were far too
low. More realistic cost estimates, including appropriate physical contingen-
cy estimates, might have led the Bank to abstain from financing the project.
On the other hand, the Bank performed well in seeking and obtaining
co-financing, in coordinating the financing of the large number of co-donors
involved, and in keeping all concerned well informed of developments.  The
Bank's timely and repeated intervention in the face of many obstacles, includ-
ing large and generally well staffed and focussed supervision missions, must
be credited for the project's successful conclusion. Supervision missions and
specialists sent out by the Bank repeatedly identified technical and manage-
ment problems, but the contractual arrangements made with the consortium and
the consultants were difficult, if not impossible, to amend.
9.05      The Government generally did not comply with the loan and credit
covenants requiring it to provide full financial support to ATC. Only after
considerable persuasion, did it take some steps to raise tariffs and develop
timber traffic to help ATC. The result was that throughout most of the period
when works were under execution, ATC was far behind in paying for the work,
which consequently weakened its negotiating position with the contractor, and
ran up costs.
9.06      The CFCO is a reasonably well run railway with relatively high
design standards and with a much improved line between Pointe Noire and
Brazzaville. These characteristics should enable it to compete on a cost and
service basis with railways in neighboring countries for regional traffic.
The Government should make every effort to persuade these countries to give
the CFCO an opportunity to demonstrate that it can move regional traffic at a
fair price, thus bolstering its revenues and financial viability.
9.07      The important lessons to be learned from the Second Railway Project
are: (a) only experienced owners should be placed in charge of a major civil
engineering job involving high risk work; (b) feasibility studies, design and
supervision should be entrusted to experienced consultants who are also given
the full responsibility for the day-to-day direction of the work; (c) final
design should be based on thorough topographic and geological studies and
soils investigations; (d) if co-financing is involved, funds should be pooled
and tied procurement should be avoided, and the role of the agency (in this
case, the Bank) responsible for overall donor coordination should be clearly
defined and agreed upon by all co-donors; and (e) on any project involving
major and complex civil engineering works in which many co-donors are partici-
pating, the Bank should insist on the appointment of a project coordinator,
and if the Bank is selected, it should place a senior technical representative
on site for the duration of the works.
9.08      Because project implementation spanned over a decade, several of the
above lessons, including the importance of avoiding tied procurement, have
already been applied in many similar projects.

Dear Sir:
I thank you for the copy of the draft project completion report on
^ I ^ S      the railroad project in Congo.
- ' *               It was a very complex  program undertaken in a difficult political
{       and technical context, and it is  good  to  have a synthesis of the various
d    ,. *  aspects of this project.
viewsaof It is regretable that the report was written without obtaining the
views of the other aid agencies  and  the Consultant.  This leaves in doubt
the objectivity of the statements  or  conclusions contained in the report.
I have therefore transmitted your  report  to  the Consultant and you will
find his Coamments attached to this letter.
.~ * ' I.It is true, as stated in the report that the major problem was8 the
0  4e S J    overwhelming  responsibility  assigned  to   ATC   which  had  neither  the
h g -        experience nor the personnel to manage  a project of this size, and which
IC,  "      furthermore often ignored the  recomnendations  of  its advisors.  This did
I 6 Q    not facilitate the task of  the  Consultant who was therefore in a awkward
position.  But this does not take  away from the efficiency of the company,
'e ,   e     and its so-called lack of experience is, in the view of the Agency experts,
3 S a .~ s2    without grounds.
'While pondering on the report which could have had a less emphatic
* .2   -   tone, it  is  certain  that  the  Bank  played  a  coordination  role in an
e 1.r "        efficient manner, which contributed to  the completion of this project, and
i     @  for which we are grateful.

Dear Mr. Donaldson:
Re : Congo - 8econd Railways Project
3 -i                  Project Completion Report
We would like to thank you for your letter dated 17
3 U   March, 1989 and the accompanying Project Completion Report.  Our
*45 staff have reviewed the said report and found it to be most
M5 o    interesting.  However, they have informed me that they wish it
has given a more detailed analysis of the inadequate handling of
o      project studies, design, technical supervision and contracting
I t which they consider to be the primary cause of most of the
a     problems that beset the project.  They have also informed me
_  o  that the record of the famous Brussels co-financiers meeting
would show that the Kuwait Fund requested the appointment of the
 r    independent consultant (para 3.14), an action that led to the
N 0 discovery and resolution of most of the technical problems
A      facing the project at the time.   It also led to the final
recognition of the enormus cost of completing the project.
X  i              We hope that the above brief points are helpful.
