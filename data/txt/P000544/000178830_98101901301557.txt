1/ The taxes quoted for Cameroon are those applied in mid-1974.
The figures quoted represent export taxes for logs; in the case
of processed timber, they are the sum of an export tax and a fee for
log entry to the sawmill.
2/ Available information on CAR forestry taxes is sketchy and outdated,
and has therefore been classified as n.a. Regardless of their actual
level, these taxes have in the past been sufficiently low to allow
the export of timber.
3/ The sign (C) in front of the figures indicates the expectation that the
forestry taxes for Camieroon will be adjusted to take account of the
f.o.b. prices.
4/ Refer to Table a.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project covering the 1974-78 Investment
Plan of the Agence Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC) with the objec-
tives of improving ATC's operations, reducing costs, and enabling ATC to
satisfy traffic demands which originate in a large area of Equatorial Africa.
On the national level, the proposed project will contribute greatly to the
country's real growth and export earnings by ensuring the transport capacity
necessary for development of the almost unexploited rich forest reserves in
the Sangha and Oubangui river basins. Furthermore, the additional labor
involved in the expansion of logging operations could be an important factor
in slowing down migration to urban centers.
ii.       ATC, formed in 1969, is a Congo national agency which owns and
operates an integrated system comprising: (a) the Atlantic Ocean port of
Pointe Noire; (b) a railway, Chemin de Per Congo Ocean (CFCO), from Pointe
Noire to Brazzaville (510 km); and (c) the river ports (including Brazzaville)
and services on the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha rivers. The ATC system is the back-
bone of Congo's transport infrastructure and carries about 90% of all land
traffic. A major transport link connected to the CFCO is the 285 km railway
owned and operated by the Gabonese Compagnie Miniere de l'Ogooue (COMILOG)
for evacuation of manganese ore. ATC also provides a transport service for
parts of neighboring Chad, CAR, Cameroon, and Gabon.
iii.      The Congo road network totals about 10,800 km, of which only 3,000 km
provide all-weather service. Bank Group lending for highway development
comprises three Credits in 1969, 1970 and 1971 for a total of US$6.1 million.
Although transport coordination, which is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), has not been an issue in the past due
to the monopoly situation of the ATC system, it will become more important
once the Pointe Noire-Brazzaville-Ouesso road axis parallel to much of the
ATC system, is fully developed. Following the Government's instructions to
all Ministries in 1975 to set up individual planning units, MPWT has already
designated a director for its unit which will be responsible for ensuring
a proper role for road and rail services.
iv.       The present ATC system was developed during the 1920's and 1930's
to cover the relatively simple transport requirements of the slowly emerging
economies of Central Africa. Over the last two decades, the pace of develop-
ment has quickened with a consequent growth in traffic demand. This demand
has heavily taxed ATC's capacity, and brought about a serious deterioration of
some parts of its physical assets. The proposed project, covering ATC's 1974-
78 Investment Plan, together with ATC's investment program to 1985, is designed
to ensure the continued functioning of the ATC system, render operations more
efficient, and provide for capacity expansion. A large part of the investment



- ii -
plan is allocated to the CFCO where immediate action is needed to avoid major
line interruptions threatened by failure of the track and structures over the
mountainous Holle-Loubomo section.
v.        Consultants recommended in a UNDP-financed feasibility study of
1971/72 that about 106 km of the CFCO line between Holle and Loubomo be re-
aligned, as the alternative of staged improvement of the existing alignment
was found to be impractical and uneconomical. The Bank Group subsequently
financed detailed engineering of the proposed realignment under its First
Railway Project (Credit 297-COB, US$6.3 million, April 1972, increased to
US$6.9 million, July 1973) which also provided for a traffic forecasting and
costing study, and for the purchase of 247 freight cars.
vi.       ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan is expected to cost (net of taxes) about
US$233.8 million equivalent including physical and price contingencies, with
foreign exchange costs estimated at US$147.5 million. The Plan comprises the
following main items: (a) ATC Headquarters: improvement of training
facilities and programs (US$5.5 million); (b) Pointe Noire Port: provision of
an additional stacking area for timber handling, construction of new manganese
and general cargo berths, and dredging (US$12.8 million); (c) River Services:
procurement of mechanical handling equipment and additional floating craft,
expansion of Brazzaville workshops, and deepening of river channels
(US$21.1 million); and (d) CFCO Railway: procurement and renewal of locomo-
tives and rolling stock, track renewal, installation of signalling systems,
and expansion of workshops (US$45.6 million), and realignment of 88 km and
improvement of 18 km of the Holle-Loubomo section (US$148.8 million).
vii.      The largest item in the Investment Plan is the CFCO realignment.
The costs of the proposed works are covered under financing arrangements and
in amounts converted into US$ equivalent at current exchange rates as follows:
(i) by joint financing from the Bank (US$31.0 million), FED (US$17.3 million),
FAC (US$11.1 million), CCCE (US$3.3 million), and the Government (US$9.1 mil-
lion); and (ii) by tied or parallel financing from KDF/SFD/BADEA (US$43.6
million), ADB (US$12.4 million), CIDA (US$12.7 million), and CCCE (US$1.1 mil-
lion), together with contributions from the Government (US$8.7 million). 1/
The co-donors have reached agreement on terms assuring financing of the
realignment. Finalization of these agreements, or assurances that funding will
otherwise be forthcoming, will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Loan.

viii.     Individual items in the investment plan outside the realignment
have been or will be financed by CCCE/COFACE (US$33.4 million), ATC (US$21.6
million), ADB (US$9.9 million), FED/EIB (US$4.7 million), FAC (US$4.6 million),
Bank (US$3.8 million), Congo banks (US$2.7 million), COMILOG (US$0.8 million)
and the Government (US$3.5 million). Although much of the financing of these
items has been secured, a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan
will be the receipt by the Bank of satisfactory assurances for financing not
yet secured.
ix.       The proposed Loan of US$38.0 million will consist of US$31.0 million
towards the CFCO realignment, US$3.8 million for ATC training facilities and
technical assistance, US$0.2 million for retroactive financing of railcar
bogies and radio equipment for the CFCO, and US$3.0 million for capitaliza-
tion of interest on the proposed Loan. The Government had originally requested
financing of the railcar bogies and radio equipment under Credit 297-COB
for the First Railway Project, but agreed to the Bank's proposal of retroactive
financing of these items under the proposed Loan.
x.        ATC will be responsible for execution of the project.  Consultants
Tecsult (Canada) who carried out the detailed engineering for the realign-
ment, have been retained to supervise the civil works for this item. Bids
from prequalified contractors for these works have been evaluated in accord-
ance with Bank guidelines. A?C intends to procure imported equipment and
materials for the realignment and training facilities by international compe-
titive bidding or alternative procedure acceptable to the Bank. Consultants
providing technical assistance will be selected on terms and conditions accept-
able to the Bank. The Bank will have the principal 'role in overall project
supervision.
xi.       ATC enjoys sufficient autonomy in its operations to permit effec-
tive management. The quality of top management is generally satisfactory
although it relies heavily on expatriate technical assistance. There is a
need, however, to increase the participation of local staff in decision-making,
and to provide training in view of progressing Africanization. Although ATC
provides good basic training for apprentices and recruits, some reorganization
and expansion of facilities is needed to make this training more effective.
The proposed project provides for the required additional facilities, and for
about 40 man-years of technical assistance for on-the-job training and for
training of instructors.
xii.      ATC's physical assets are reasonably well maintained.  At Pointe
Noire port, additional timber storage facilities and quays for handling
increased general cargo traffic and large manganese ore ships are being
extended. The Government has recently agreed with three private cargo-
handling firms to establish separate joint enterprises, one for timber
traffic which started operations in 1975, and two for general cargo due to



-iv-
commence operations during 1976. With these enterprises and the new facili-
ties, the port should be able to improve its operations and meet traffic
forecast for 1980. Efforts are being made to keep the CFCO track in good
repair, although maintenance costs on the Holle-Loubomo section are high due
to the age and low technical standards of the line, and the condition of the
structures. Completion of ongoing extensions to crossings and stations and
of signalling improvements will permit longer and heavier trains to operate
on this section starting in 1976, and enable the CFCO to meet traffic forecast
to 1979 when the realignment will be completed.  At Brazzaville port, extensions
are being carried out to the general cargo and log wharves, and the marine
workshops are to be enlarged. The river transport fleet is being expanded
and the river channels improved to allow longer annual navigable periods.
Operating targets to be achieved by 1978 are proposed for all sections of ATC.
xiii.     ATC's future transport role is expected to remain that of a regional
carrier for the Congo, CAR, southeastern Cameroon, southern Gabon, and to a
lesser extent, southern Chad. The principal freight traffic using the ATC
system will continue to be manganese from Gabon during the coming years, and
timber in the longer term. Next in importance are general cargo, bulk oil,
and CFCO passenger traffic. Traffic in manganese is expected to increase to
2.6 million ton p.a. by 1981, and to remain at this level until 1985; some
manganese might then be diverted to the new Transgabon railway that would
start operating in 1986, although the CFCO, once realigned, could handle the
2 million tons allocated to it under an inter-governmental agreement between
Gabon and Congo. Although it is assumed that the present world market slump
in timber will continue through 1976, Pointe Noire port is expected to handle
about 900,000 tons in 1978 and about 2.0 million tons in 1985, mainly as a
result of opening up forest reserves in northern Congo.
xiv.      The economic analysis of the ATC investment program focussed on the
CFCO realignment which is the most critical and costly element of the project.
The benefits from the realignment were assessed in terms of operating cost
savings and the avoidance of traffic frustration due to increased capacity.
The realignment was evaluated against various investment alternatives, in-
cluding a minimal rehabilitation program, a major improvement of the existing
line, and a combination of the minimal program and construction of a road be-
tween Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Alternative cases were considered
regarding operating efficiency and assignment of traffic priorities. Under
the most probable case, the economic return of the realignment project com-
pared with the minimal program is estimated at 18%; higher returns are obtained
when the realignment is compared to the other investment alternatives. The
economic return for the whole ATC investment plan is estimated at 23%. These
returns would apply to the entire region served by the ATC, with about half
accruing to the Congo.
xv.       ATC's poor traffic performance and inadequate tariff policies over
1970-74 resulted in a deteriorating financial position, and short-term lia-
bilities exceeded current assets at the end of the period. Despite tariff
increases totalling about 50% during 1973/74, ATC's 1975 financial performance



v -
worsened because of reduced demand for timber traffic and unforeseen Government-
ordered wage increases. The financial situation is expected to remain diffi-
cult in 1976-79 mainly due to the anticipated slow recovery of the depressed
world timber market. In view of the above, the Government and ATC agreed to
take all measures necessary, including tariff increases and a stringent con-
trol of ATC's operating expenses, to achieve a minimum annual rate of return
on fixed assets of 6% in 1977,and 8% from 1978 through 1980. In addition,
the Government will alleviate ATC's financial situation by waiving taxes
(mainly sales taxes) amounting to CFAF 4 billion in 1975-80. Furthermore,
in order to ease ATC's debt service burden, the proposed Loan will include
US$3 million to capitalize interest during project implementation. As a
result of the above measures, ATC's operating sections should all be finan-
cially viable by 1980. However, to allow for a review of its annual finan-
cial performance, ATC will forward its draft annual budgets to the Bank for
comment prior to submitting them for approval by ATC's board, so that remedial
measures if required, can be undertaken promptly in consultation with the Bank.
An annual rate of return on net fixed assets of 8% during 1980-86 would
enable ATC to build up substantial cash revenues by the end of the period,
while fully restoring its working capital to planned levels, financing renewals
and investments without external assistance, and servicing its debts. A
sensitivity analysis was conducted under the assumptions that gross operating
revenues decrease by 20%, working expenses increase by 10%, and the cost of
capital investments, excluding the CFCO realignment, increase by 10%. Assuming
the combined effect of the above assumptions, ATC's financial position would
rPmain acceptable provided that tariffs are raised in line with projected
inflation levels, and that ATC can borrow up to about US$35 million in 1976-
79 and up to about 40% of its 1980-86 planned investments.
xvi.      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$38 million
to ATC with the guarantee of the Government of the People's Republic of the
Congo. The Loan term will be 25 years including five years of grace, at an
interest rate of 8-1/2%.






CONGO
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Agence Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC), formed in 1969,
is the-successor to a multinational agency, the Agence Transequatoriale des
Communications (ATEC), created in 1958 by the Congo, Gabon, Central African
Republic (CAR), and Chad to manage the 2,900 km route from N'Djamena (Chad),
through Bangui (CAR) to Pointe Noire (Congo) (Map 2254R7). Now a Congo national
agency, ATC still performs many functions of the former ATEC. ATC owns and
operates: (a) the Atlantic Ocean port of Pointe Noire; (b) a railway, Chemin
de Fer Congo-Ocean (CFCO) from Pointe Noire to Brazzaville; and (c) the river
ports and services (transport, navigation, maintenance of navigable channels)
on the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha rivers.
1.02      Traffic on the ATC system grew rapidly until 1972 when capacity
became insufficient to meet the demand. ATC is carrying out improvements on
all its sections, but the existing CFCO alignment winding through a mountain
range presents a major restriction. Realignment of about 106 km was proposed
in a feasibility study financed by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and carried out in 1971/72 by consultants Tecsult (Canada); the alterna-
tive of staged improvement of the existing alignment was found to be imprac-
tical. The Bank Group consequently financed final engineering of the realign-
ment proposed by Tecsult under its First Railway Project (Credit 297-COB,
US$6.3 million, April 1972, increased to US$6.9 million in July 1973), which
also provided for a traffic forecasting and costing study for ATC carried out
by consultants BCEOM/Sofrerail (France), and for the purchase of freight-cars
for general traffic. The project has been implemented reasonably well,
although its expected completion date is about two years later than originally
planned, due to delays in financing, finalizing contracts, and execution of
non-IDA financed items; a new Closing Date of March 31, 1976 has been agreed
with the Government.
1.03      ATC has prepared a five-year investment plan for 1974-78 which is
expected to cost approximately US$233.8 million equivalent (net of taxes),
including physical and price contingencies. The proposed project covers this
investment plan which includes the following principal items:
(i)  ATC Headquarters:  improvement of training facilities and
programs (US$5.5 million);
(ii)  Pointe Noire Port:  provision of an additional stacking area
for timber-handling, construction of new berths for manganese
and general cargo, and dredging (US$12.8 million);
(iii)  River Services:  procurement of mechanical handling equipment,
purchase of additional floating craft, expansion of Brazzaville
workshops, and deepening of river channels (US$21.1 million);
and



- 2 -
(iv)  CFCO Railway:  procurement and renewal of locomotives and rolling
stock, and general investments including track renewal, installation
of a signalling system, and expansion of the main equipment workshops
(US$45.6 million); and realignment of 88 km between Fourastie and
Loubomo (ex-Dolisie) and track improvements for the 18 km between
Holle and Fourastie (US$148.8 million).
ATC has been able to arrange financing to cover the items in the investment
plan (paras 4.10-4.12). The CFCO realignment, which is the largest compo-
nent of the plan, will be financed by a consortium in the following amounts
(converted into US$ equivalent at present exchange rates):
US$ million
equivalent
Bank                                                    31.0
Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)                        20.0
Congo Government                                         17.8
Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED)                    17.3
Kuwait Fund for Economic Development (KDF)               13.6
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)        12.7
African Development Bank (ADB)                           12.4
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC)                     11.1
Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA)   10.0
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)          4.4
The foreign costs for the other items of the investment plan will be covered
by additional contributions from ADB, CCCE, FAC, FED, Government, and the Bank,
augmented by the participation of Compagnie Francaise de Credit pour l'Expor-
tation, (COFACE), Compagnie Miniere de l'Ogooue (COMILOG), European Investment
Bank (EIB), Congo banks and ATC. The Bank's contribution of US$3.8 million
to the additional items in the plan will help provide technical assistance and
training facilities.
1.04      In addition to the First Railway Project, Bank Group lending for
transportation in the Congo has consisted of three Credits totalling US$6.1
million for highway development. The first project (Credit 56-COB, US$0.63
million, May 1969) for engineering and feasibility studies was completed in
June 1971. The second project (Credit 189-COB, US$1.5 million, May 1970) for
improvement of the Pointe Noire-Makola Road (34 km) was completed in October
1973. Although the third project (Credit 274-COB, US$4.0 million, December
1971) providing for reorganization and improvement of highway maintenance
had to be scaled down due to cost increases and lack of Government funds, it
was completed on schedule at end-1975.

1.05      The appraisal of the proposed Second Railway Project is based on
information supplied by the Government, ATC, and consultants Tecsult and
BCEOM/Sofrerail, and on the findings of a Bank mission in November 1974
comprising Messrs. D. Johnson (Engineer), E. Chittleburgh (Technical Educator),
H. Georg (Engineer), J. Kesson (Engineer - Consultant), P. Levy (Financial
Analyst), T. Nkodo (Economist), and A. Weckerle (Economist).
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The People's Republic of the Congo covers an area of about 342,000
km2, with a total population estimated in 1974 at about 1.3 million. About
40% of the population live in urban agglomerations located mostly along the
Pointe Noire-Brazzaville railroad and in the economically active southern
regions of the country.
2.02      Until recently, Congo's development potential was based mainly on
the exploitation of its extensive forest reserves which cover about 60% of the
territory.  The resource base has since been broadened with the expansion of
crude oil production to about 2.4 million m tons in 1974, together with the
boost in oil prices.  Preliminary estimates indicate that per capita Gross
National Product (GNP) in 1974 was about US$385 at average 1972-74 prices.
In 1975, however, oil production fell by 25 percent, the non-oil sector of the
economy stagnated in large part owing to the drop in international demand for
raw materials, and import prices and public expenditures suffered the full
impact of inflation. Since Government expenditure plans had assumed increased
revenues from oil and other sources, the abrupt reversal left little time to
stabilize a deteriorating public finance situation. In view of this negative
trend and the current expectation of more modest growth prospects for oil and
for development generally, the new Government which came to power at end-1975
has undertaken an austerity program to restrain expenditure and to improve
financial management. The proposed project will contribute greatly to the
country's real growth and to increased export earnings by ensuring the trans-
port capacity necessary for development of the rich forest reserves in the
Sangha and Oubangui river basins which are now almost unexploited. Further,
the additional labor income that would be generated by the establishment and
expansion of logging and timber processing operatlos in these regions could
become an important factor in slowing down the present level of migration to
urban centers.
B.   The Transport System
2.03       Congo's situation on the Atlantic coast with a favorably located
seaport and the existence of navigable rivers has resulted in development
of an extensive transport infrastructure to serve Congo's own trade flows
as well as transit traffic for neighboring landlocked Chad, CAR, and the
southern regions of Cameroon and Gabon. This transit traffic accounted in
1975 for about 65% of total freight movements on the CFCO railway; the transit



-4-
share is however expected to decline over the long term to less than 50%,
mainly due to Congo's own traffic, in particular timber, expanding faster
than that of the other countries served by ATC.
2.04      The transport system is made up of two separate networks.  The
backbone of the infrastructure is the Transequatorial Route comprising the
CFCO railway line (510 km) between the two major ports at Pointe Noire and
Brazzaville, and the navigable sections of the Congo and Oubangui rivers
(about 1,120 km). The other major links in this primary transport network
are a 285 km railway owned and operated by COMILOG (Gabon) for the transport
of manganese ore, the Loubomo-Gabon road (about 250 km), and the Sangha river
which is navigable over about 480 km.
2.05      Congo also has a large road network totalling about 10,800 km, but
only about 3,000 km (including 300 km of paved roads) provide all-weather
service. The major road axis connects Brazzaville and Ouesso in the north
(about 900 km); the rest of the system consists of secondary and forestry
roads located mostly in the area west of Brazzaville, which contains about
two-thirds of the population and the important centers of economic activity.
Only a small proportion of freight traffic is carried by road, and about 70%
of this is timber traffic in the south. The Bank is planning to appraise a
further highway project in June 1976 which will include road maintenance as
well as engineering studies of the Zanaga-Sibiti-Loudima road (about 225 km).
When completed, this road will help assure the evacuation of timber from the
Zabaga region to the railhead at Loudima.
2.06      There are eight airports and about thirty minor airfields.  Only
three (Brazzaville, Pointe Noire, and Loubomo) have paved runways, and only
Brazzaville is equipped to handle long-range jet aircraft serving interna-
tional traffic. A Government-owned company, Lina Congo, provides scheduled
domestic services.
C.   Transport Policy and Planning
2.07      The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible
for devising and enforcing transport policy. Transport coordination and
planning outside the ATC has not been an issue in the past because of the
dominant role of the ATC system which carries about 90% of land transport
traffic. However, the Government's planned development and upgrading of
the Pointe Noire-Brazzaville-Ouesso road axis which runs parallel to the
ATC system now makes the planning and coordination of transport services an
important issue. A geographically large country such as the Congo with a
considerable resource potential requires a transport system which is sufficient-
ly versatile to permit the development of this potential, and long-range plan-
ning geared to developing a network that can adequately meet this need. How-
ever, there would still remain substantial questions of matching transport
investments to actual requirements in the axis, and of establishing the
pricing policies necessary to ensure a proper role for road and rail services.
The administrative machinery necessary to carry out these tasks will be pro-
vided by the planning unit recently established in MPWT following the
Government's instruction during 1975 that such units be set up in all



-5-
Ministries. MPWT has already designated a Director for its unit for which
terms of reference are being discussed with the Bank. The main tasks of the
unit will be to: (a) analyze the costs and benefits of proposed investments
in the various modes to achieve an optimum distribution and timing of
these investments; (b) review and keep up-to-date the transport pricing
policy; and (c) ensure that investment proposals for transport take into con-
sideration the requirements of other sectors of the economy. Further, as the
proposed project constitutes the major investment in the transport sector
for the near future, the Government has agreed to consult with the Bank prior
to undertaking any major investments in the sector outside the ATC investment
program.
3. AGENCE TRANSCONGOLAISE DES COMMUNICATIONS (ATC)
A.   Organization, Management, and Staffing
3.01      Administration of ATC is by a Board with the Minister of Public
Works and Transport as Chairman, and 13 members consisting of other Ministers
and representatives from the staff and the ruling political party. The
Board can make all decisions or delegate its powers to the Chairman except
in the case of: (i) tariffs, budgets, and investment programs, which require
the approval of the Minister of Public Works and Transport; and (ii) loan
conditions, which must be approved by the Council of Ministers (see Organiza-
tion Chart). The Board operates in a satisfactory manner.
3.02      ATC has a General Manager and an Assistant General Manager who are
appointed by the Council of State on the recommendation of the Board. A
Financial Controller is nominated by the Minister of Finance. The General
Manager has adequate freedom to deal with ATC's normal business. His head-
quarters section provides budget and investment planning and administration
for the three operational sections (ports, river services, and CFCO), each
of which is self-contained operationally and financially under the direction
of separate managers. Officials and staff of ATC are mostly Congolese assisted
by 25 foreign contract employees and about 70 technical experts provided by
France.
3.03      The management and development planning of ATC and its sections is
competent, but relies considerably on the expatriate technical assistants,
some of whom fill key management positions.  Operations of the sections
(particularly the CFCO) have also been largely guided by technical assistants,
but in mid-1972 many were replaced by Congolese, and the role of technical
assistance has since then been essentially confined to training (Table 1). At
the same time, the number of Congolese permanent staff has been increasing
steadily, and at end-1974 totalled over 6,000, representing more than a 25%
increase above the 1970 level (Table 2). Partly as a result of all the above,
the overall operating performance of ATC, and particularly of the CFCO, has
been declining. To deal with this situation, proposals are made under the
present project for improved training, increased technical assistance, and



- 6 -
the achievement of specified operational targets (paras. 3.04-3.06). To
ensure the effectiveness of the additional technical assistance, the Govern-
ment has provided assurances that the present level of such assistance
available to ATC and the responsibilities of technical assistants in line
positions will not be reduced without prior approval of the Bank.
3.04      ATC provides good basic training for apprentices in the mechanical
equipment workshops and for new recruits in other departments, but some re-
organization and expansion of facilities is needed to make the training more
effective. In addition, in-service training for upgrading the skills of
existing staff is inadequate and poorly organized. Under the proposed pro-
ject,the direction of all training will be centralized under a personnel
officer attached to the General Manager's staff, who will also be responsible
for recruitment, personnel records, and staff development for all sections
of ATC. In addition, the personnel officer will be responsible for the pre-
paration of a manpower plan for ATC, to be completed by 1977.
3.05      In association with the training schemes, increased technical
assistance will be provided for on-the-job training in selected areas includ-
ing workshop organization, track and building maintenance, traffic and com-
mercial operations, communications and signalling, accounting, and training
of instructors for the schools and for the development of middle-management
personnel.
3.06      Training and technical assistance requirements are reviewed in
detail in Annex 1; draft terms of reference and conditions for all the pro-
posed services, as well as arrangements for their implementation, have been
discussed and agreed with ATC (para. 4.03).
B.   Budgeting, Accounting, Auditing, and Insurance
3.07      ATC was formed in 1969, and its controlling statute (Decree No.
70/738 of February 11, 1970) provides for the agency to have financial
autonomy and to operate on a commercial basis. The three ATC operating
sections have individual budgets and investment plans, and have to cover
expenses through their own revenues. However, the statute provides for
financial solidarity of all the ATC sections, specifying that surpluses in
one section would be used to cover deficits in another. The arrangements
appear reasonable in view of the interdependence of the whole ATC transport
system.
3.08      Accounting is done on a commercial basis under the direct responsi-
bility of the Chief Accountant and the overall supervision of the Financial
Controller. The accounting system is generally satisfactory. Assets have
been revalued, and the method of entering depreciation provisions and finan-
cial charges modified, as agreed with the Bank under the First Railway Project.
A new accounting plan ("Plan comptable OCAM" 1/) is now being introduced in
1/ Organisation Commune Africaine et Malgache.



francophone West Africa, including the Congo. As ATC's accounting system
needs some improvement, consulting services are included in the proposed
project to: (a) adopt the OCAM accounting plan to ATC's requirements;
(b) improve financial and statistical information required by management;
(c) set up a comprehensive costing system; and (d) establish a cost-related
tariffing system.
3.09      Following agreement reached under Credit 297-COB, a firm of inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Bank Group was appointed to audit ATC's
accounts. As their report dealing with the 1974 accounts complied with the
Bank Group's auditing requirements, the same firm will now continue to audit
the accounts for 1975 onwards. Accordingly, the Government and ATC have
agreed that this independent audit will continue, and that the audited
accounts will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year.
3.10      ATC has insurance coverage for:  road vehicles (as legally required);
equipment or buildings rented or hired out (and for which the hirer or tenant
pays); staff, against accidents at work; harbor floating craft; river floating
craft; river port buildings (including equipment) against fire; river port
goods while in ATC storage, against fire; and goods on river craft under ATC
responsibility, against third party risks. All other normal risks are met
from ATC's own funds, which is an acceptable practice.
C. Property
3.11      ATC Headquarters, as well as the railway and the seaport administra-
tion, are located at Pointe Noire. The facilities at the port of Pointe Noire
comprise five berths for general cargo and two for timber, as well as spe-
cialized berths for bulk oil, manganese ore, and fishing vessels. Additional
storage facilities for timber have recently been completed, and quays for
handling increased volumes of general cargo and larger manganese ore ships
are being extended. The CFCO railway is reasonably well-equipped with loco-
motives and rolling stock, but large sections of the track and infrastructure
are inadequate for present and forecast volumes of freight traffic (see para.
3.12). The principal river transport route to Bangui (CAR) is about 1,120 km
long, and the subsidiary river network serving northeast Congo and southeast
Cameroon totals about 3,800 km. The river navigation and clearance of most
of the waterway channels are provided by the Service Commun des Voies Navigables,
an ATC/ACCF 1/ enterprise which works satisfactorily. At Brazzaville, there
are wharves for general cargo and timber traffic, and also facilities for bulk
oil and passenger traffic. A new wharf area for handling timber logs has re-
cently been completed. Extensions are being carried out to the general cargo
and log wharves, and the marine workshops are to be enlarged. The river
transport fleets of ATC and ACCF are being expanded, and the river channels
are gradually being improved. Property details for each section of ATC are
given in Annexes 2 and 3.

CFCO Railway
3.12      The CFCO line was built at minimum cost between 1921 and 1934 with
an infrastructure and track standards designed for light traffic. The line
has a narrow roadbed, steep gradients and sharp curves, particularly over two
mountain ranges, one near the coast and the other towards Brazzaville. Traffic
has increased considerably over the past 20 years, particularly over the 200 km
between the junction of the COMILOG railway at Mont Bello and Pointe Noire,
and further traffic increases are foreseen (Table 3). This increased traffic
is much beyond that envisaged when the line was constructed, and carried on
long trains and heavy axle loads, has led to failure of the track structure,
high rate of rail wear, breakage of welded joints, and collapse of the
superstructure of the numerous concrete arch viaducts. These failures in
turn cause major maintenance problems with the track and equipment, frequent
accidents, considerable train delays, and consequent restrictions on the
traffic carried. The general condition of the viaducts is also poor, while
the Bamba tunnel (1.7 km) is in dangerous condition and needs rehabilitation.
The facilities for controlling train movements and for crossing trains at
stations have also been poor, and while ATC has made some improvements com-
pleted at end-1974, the possibilities for future development are restricted
by physical limitations. The existing alignment and track from Pointe Noire
to Holle were improved to an adequate standard in 1968-70, but the Bank con-
cluded in 1968 that very substantial betterment of the existing conditions
would be necessary for the mountainous Holle-Loubomo section. A subsequent
feasibility study recommended construction of about 106 km of completely new
route (Map 11276 R). While the recommendation has been modified to include
88 km of new construction and about 18 km of line improvement, this invest-
ment represents a large part of the ATC investment plan, since immediate
action is needed to avoid major line interruptions threatened by failure of
the track and structures over the Holle-Loubomo section. Needed improve-
ments on the remaining section between Loubomo and Brazzaville are not so
extensive or critical, and can follow in subsequent investment plans.
D.   Operations
3.13      Details of operations of each section of ATC are given in Annex 4,
and summaries of operational statistics are in Tables 4-6. The various
operating targets for Pointe Noire Port, CFCO, and river transport services,
discussed in the following paragraphs and detailed in Annex 5, have been
agreed with ATC.
Pointe Noire Port
3.14      Ship movements are the responsibility of the port organization, but
all cargo-handling (on ship and on shore) is done by three private firms which
provide their own equipment. The plant and labor normally operate on a single
shift, with an occasional second shift. These arrangements have allowed a
reasonable throughput of cargo, but increased volumes would need more equip-
ment and a regular second shift operation, as required. The Government and
ATC have recently agreed with the cargo-handling companies to establish three
joint enterprises. The first and largest of these, dealing with all timber
traffic, started operations in 1975; the two others for general cargo are



-9-
scheduled to commence operations in 1976. The new enterprises will be
expected to obtain essential equipment with CCCE financing. It is intended
that they will also: (i) operate regular second shifts as and when required;
(ii) remove long-term timber log storage from the port to areas near the CFCO
marshalling yard at Pointe Noire; and (iii) provide improved statistical data
on cargo operations. With these improvements, as well as the facilities under
constructon and increased output targets, it should be possible for the port
to meet forecast traffic requirements until about 1980 (Table 7). The Govern-
ment has provided assurances that it will ensure that the three joint enter-
prises make required investments and take other measures as necessary to
assure the orderly flow of traffic at Pointe Noire.
CFCO Railway
3.15      The principal traffic carried is COMILOG manganese ore, potash from
the Compagnie des Potasses du Congo (CPC), timber, and general cargo. COMILOG
provides its own locomotives, rolling stock and train staff for operations over
the sections Mbinda-Mont Bello-Pointe Noire. Three train paths each way per
day are at COMILOG's disposal. The operating arrangements for COMILOG trains
and for CFCO trains on the COMILOG railway are covered by agreements between
ATC and COMILOG. Potash is carried 47 km from Makola to CPC's own sea-loading
installation at Pointe Noire. CPC provides the bulk freight cars, while CFCO
supplies the motive power and operates the trains. Although the traffic now
only requires one train each way per day, capacity exists for up to three
trains per day (possibly required by 1985). Timber traffic reaches the CFCO
railway mainly at Mont Bello and Brazzaville.
3.16      The increasing timber and general traffic has been carried partly
by expanding the fleet of locomotives and cars, and partly by increasing the
size of individual units. However, because track and infrastructure problems
between Holle and Loubomo limit the number of trains possible, CFCO traffic
has remained constant since 1971 (Table 3). On completion of the extensions
of crossings and stations and the signalling improvements now underway, longer
trains will be able to operate starting in 1976. The capacity increases thus
provided will meet forecast needs only to 1979, however, and will not provide
a long-term solution to the problems of increasing capacity or improving pre-
sent difficult operating conditions. Even on completion of the proposed new
Holle-Loubomo section (which will improve operating and maintenance conditions
over approximately 106 km out of the total line of 510 km), actual railway
capacity will continue to depend on higher staff efficiency to be developed
under the expanded training and technical assistance proposed under the pro-
posed project. To improve CFCO operations, targets for achievement by 1978
have been agreed (Annex 5).
3.17      Equipment availability is poor (averaging 57% for locomotives and
64% for railcars in 1974) due to unsatisfactory operating conditions, poor
maintenance, and the acquisition of some locomotives which were initially
unsuitable for local conditions. As ATC is expanding the main workshop facil-
ities and intends also to reorganize its maintenance operations, it should be
possible to increase average locomotive availability by 1978 to about 76%,
which is an agreed operational target.



- 10 -
River Transport
3.18      ATC is responsible for the transshipment at Brazzaville of all cargo
between river and railway. The division between the ATC and ACCF river fleets
of the freight volume, as well as the nature of the cargo, is based on an
agreement between the Governments of Congo and CAR. The fleets are being
increased to meet requirements in accordance with this agreement (Table 8).
ATC operations in river transport are reasonably efficient, but depend on
the vagaries of river flows and levels. Programs for improving river navi-
gation have been in progress for several years, and operating conditions
are gradually improving on the upper reaches of the rivers. Due to some dec-
line in overall river port and transport operations since 1971, targets to
be achieved by 1978 have been agreed under the proposed project.
E.  ATC Investment Program
3.19      ATC prepared a five-year investment plan for the period 1971-75 as
part of the First Railway Project. This plan has been reviewed and updated
periodically by ATC, and most recently in association with BCEOM/Sofrerail.
The resulting plan for 1974-78, with some agreed modifications, is set out in
Tables 9a and b, with details of the proposed financing in Annex 8. The
total cost for the plan including physical and price contingencies is about
CFAF 52.6 billion net of taxes, comprising CFAF 43.74 billion for CFCO, CFAF
4.74 billion for river ports and services, CFAF 2.89 billion for Pointe Noire
port, and CFAF 1.23 billion for miscellaneous services. ATC has agreed that
it will make no change in the investment plan for 1974-78 (eccept for minor
items totalling not more than CFAF 200 million annually) unless in agreement
with the Bank.
3.20      ATC and BCEOM/Sofrerail have also assessed the investment program
needed for the period 1979-85; the proposed program totals, at 1974 prices,
CFAF 35.0 billion. (Table 10). ATC has agreed to review this program with
the Bank by December 31, 1977 to ascertain any modifications required by
conditions pertaining at that time. An assessment of traffic capacities on
each section of ATC required according to the traffic forecasts, and to be
provided according to the investment program, is shown in Table 11.

4.02      The 1974 and 1975 items in the investment plan amounting to about
US$18.4 million equivalent have been or are being implemented. Estimates
for the Pointe Noire port, river ports and services, and general items for
the CFCO railway, are based on 1974 costs, existing contracts, and recent
quotations. The estimate for the realignment (in 1975 prices) is based on
bids received for the main civil works contract (about 80% of the total
estimate for the realignment) and on recent contracts and quotations. Physi-
cal contingencies for the various sections, excluding the realignment, have
been provided at 10% on the costs of works, and about 5% on the costs of
equipment. For the realignment, physical contingencies of 15% have been
provided on local and foreign costs of the tunnelling in view of the uncertain-
ties involved in such work, 5% on the local and foreign costs of structures,
3.5% on the foreign costs of rails and fastenings, and 10% on local and
foreign costs for the other items. Price contingencies have been calculated
at 16% on civil works and 12% on equipment for 1975, and at decreasing rates
thereafter. Overall, the price contingency element allows for cost increases
for the project averaging 22% on sections excluding the realignment, and 28%
on the realignment. The Government has agreed that all materials and equip-
ment used for the realignment will be exempt from all taxes and duties;
further, the contractor selected for the main civil works contract will be
exempted from local turnover taxes. 1/
ATC Headquarters
4.03      Needed improvements to the training methods and facilities for all
sections of ATC will be met by the provision of additional classrooms and
equipment, and some reorganization of the operations and training programs.
Technical assistance services will be required to make recommendations and
carry out the programs in training and in operations, particularly on the
CFCO railway. The proposed project provides for a total of 40 man-years of
technical assistance services by about 17 experts (see Annex 1).
Pointe Noire Port
4.04      The proposed investments are mainly to complete ongoing work in-
cluding additional timber log-handling facilities, new berths for manganese
ore and general cargo, improved elipway facilities, and dredging. No other
major Investment should be required before 1978 if output and staff performance
are improved as expected, and if the planned use of additional equipment and
of a regular second shift is realized.
River Ports and Services
4.05      To meet future traffic requirements, the river ports require some
minor improvements or extensions, additional mechanical handling equipment,
and renewal of existing equipment. The proposed project provides for all of
the above, and also for expansion of the main workshops at Brazzaville to
1/   Decree No. 75/17 of January 7, 1975, Decree No. 75/82 of February 24,
1975 and Decree No. 75/211 of May 28, 1975.



- 13 -
handle the increasing river fleet. Proposed expenditure on river navigation
is to continue the deepening of river channels and improvement of navigational
aids to allow longer annual navigable periods.
4.06      ATC and ACCF are planning to purchase additional river transport
units in accordance with their agreed traffic allocation. The purchase of
tugs and barges in 1974/75 will suffice for traffic forecast to 1978 (Table 8).
ATC will however require further units for use in 1978-80, and in view of the
long delivery periods of up to two years plus local assembly time, the pro-
posed project includes financing for additional tugs and lighters in 1977.
CFCO Railway
4.07      The general investments include:  (i) continuation of required
track renewal, mainly on the section Holle-Loubomo until the new line is
in service; (ii) completion of work on lengthening crossing loops and in-
stallation of signalling at selected stations to allow operation of longer
and heavier trains; (iii) improvement of marshalling yard facilities at
Pointe Noire and Brazzaville to allow operation of larger freight trains;
and (iv) completion of extensions to mechanical equipment workshops at Pointe
Noire to assure improved maintenance. Additional investments are planned
for purchase of motive power and rolling stock as follows: 10 main-line
diesel locomotives (5 as additions and 5 as replacements); and 10 passenger
cars (some as replacements, and some to handle increasing traffic). In the
case of the locomotives, allowance has been made for the foreseen improvement
in availability.
4.08      The investment plan proposes realignment of the Holle-Loubomo sec-
tion comprising improvements adjacent to the existing route over 18 km, and
complete re-routing of 88 km. Compared with the existing section, the new
alignment will have better grades and curvature, a wider roadbed, improved
drainage, and stronger bridges, tunnels, and other structures. Construction
will involve a considerable amount of earthworks, tunnelling and bridging,
as the terrain is very rugged with steep valleys. After the new route is
completed, ATC will retain the existing railway line for about a year as an
operational safeguard. The realignment will result in significantly reduced
operating costs, and will also allow an increase in freight traffic capacity
on the Pointe Noire-Holle-Loubomo section to cover the requirements forecast
for 1995 and beyond. The basic technical characteristics for realignment and
improvement of the railway are shown in Annex 7.
B.   Execution
4.09      ATC will be responsible for execution of the project.  It has
employed consultants to assist in the assessment and design of certain pro-
ject items, in particular the CFCO realignment. ATC will continue to employ
Tecsult under CIDA financing to supervise the civil works of the realignment,
and other consultants as needed for the project. In order to assure efficient
planning and control of the realignment works, ATC has formed under its
General Manager a small unit comprising seven technical assistants and one



- 14 -
Congolese engineer to handle coordination and contact with co-donors, payment
of construction certificates, and ATC's ordering and delivery of items such
as track and signalling material. The Government, ATC, and the co-donors
have no objection to the Bank supervising both those project items in whose
financing it is participating, and also all other items, to ensure the coordina-
tion and quality of the whole investment plan.
C.   Financing and Procurement
4.10      Details of the financing of ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan are given
in Annex 8 and summarized in the following paragraphs. The co-donors have
reached agreement on terms assuring financing of the realignment. Finalization
of these agreements, or assurances satisfactory to the Bank that funding will
otherwise be forthcoming, will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Loan. Much of the financing of the investment plan, excluding the realignment,
has already been secured; an additional condition of effectiveness of the
proposed Loan will be the receipt of assurances satisfactory to the Bank from
donors whose contributions have been agreed upon in principle but not yet
secured.
4.11      The realignment works have been divided into several components
partly to meet the requirements of some donors who insisted on parallel financ-
ing.  The breakdown of the realignment and its financing is summarized
on the following page:

/1   Joint financing by Bank, FED, FAC, CCCE and Government.
Construction of the civil works for the realignment will be executed by con-
tract following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. Bids from prequalified contractors have been evaluated, and the firm
selected is expected to start the works in about June 1976 for completion by
early 1979. The fastenings for the track to be jointly financed by the Bank
will be procured following international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. The items in the realignment financed by ADB will be subject
to international competitive bidding. The items being undertaken with bila-
teral aid from CIDA are not expected to cost significantly more than if pro-
cured as a result of international competitive bidding; furthermore, CIDA aid
is being Provided on very generous financing terms. The items to be procured
with the small amount of tied aid provided by CCCE will be obtained from
previously engaged French suppliers, for reasons of standardization.

The Bank's contribution of US$3.8 million (CFAF 0.85 billion equivalent) will
be applied to financing the technical assistance and training requirements of
ATC given in Annex 1. Building extensions for the training schools estimated
at about US$400,000 equivalent will be let by ATC as local contracts following
local bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.  Imported materials required
and equipment to be installed will be obtained by international competitive
bidding, except for small items purchased under local procedures satisfactory
to the Bank. The consultants providing technical assitance will be selected
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. All other items in the in-
vestment plan, excluding the realignment, will be procured in accordance with
the individual procedures of the donors involved.
4.13      An amount of US$200,000 is included in the proposed Loan to cover
the foreign exchange costs of new bogies for CFCO railcars and for radio
equipment. The railcars purchased in 1965 are of light construction, and
replacement of their bogies will extend their useful service life. The radio
equipment will be used for the control of shunting movements in the marshalling
yards at Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, and to help the CFCO attain operational
improvements foreseen under the proposed project. The Government had requested
that funds remaining under the First Railway Project (Credit 297-COB) be used
for procurement of these two items; however, as the Bank had decided that only
items originally included in that first project could be financed from the
Credit, the Government agreed with the Bank's proposal that the bogies and
radio equipment be financed retroactively under the next Loan now proposed.
These items have been ordered under procedures satisfactory to the Bank, and
delivery has started.

D.   Disbursements
4.14      The total Loan under the proposed Second Railway Project would
be in the amount of US$38.0 million, comprising US$31.0 million towards the
CFCO realignment, US$3.8 million for training and technical assistance,
US$0.2 million for retroactive financing of railcar bogies and radio equip-
ment, and US$3.0 million towards capitalization of interest on the proposed
Loan.
4.15      Disbursements from the Loan Account will be made directly to ATC
for the foreign exchange costs of training facilities and for technical
assistance. Concerning the CFCO realignment, the Bank will participate
with the Government, FED, FAC, and CCCE in the joint financing of the
earthworks, structures and rail fastenings, with disbursements proportionate
to individual contributions. The schedule of estimated disbursements from
the Loan Account is given in Table 14. As the proposed Loan is to finance
specific objectives, any savings in the Loan Account on completion of the
project will be cancelled.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Investment Objectives
5.01      The ATC system was developed several decades ago to meet the simple
tranaport requirements of the slowly emerging economies of Central Africa.
The growth of traffic demand resulting from a quickened pace of development
has now heavily taxed ATC's capacity and brought about a serious deterioration
of some of its physical assets. The proposed project, ATC's 1974-78 Invest-
ment Plan, and the long-range program to 1985, have therefore been devised
to safeguard the continued functioning of the transport route, improve oper-
ations, and provide increased capacity. The main and initial focus of the
planned investments is on the CFCO railway where immediate action is required
to avoid major line interruptions threatened by failure of the main tunnel
or viaducts, or by landslides.
B.   Traffic Projections and Assignment
5.02      ATC's present transport role is that of a carrier for the Congo,
CAR, southeastern Cameroon, southern Gabon, and to a lesser extent, also for
southern Chad. The principal freight traffic carried is timber from Congo
and neighboring countries, together with manganese from the COMILOG mining
operation in Gabon transported over 200 km of the CFCO railway to the port
of Pointe Noire. Next in importance are general cargo and bulk oil, mostly
from or to Congo and CAR. In addition, ATC operates the main line for
railway passenger traffic in Congo.



- 18 -
5.03      The traffic projections discussed below are subject to underlying
uncertainties concerning: (a) the timing of the recovery from the present
slump in the world timber market; (b) the rate of future timber exploitation
in Congo; (c) the effect of alternative evacuation routes being constructed
in Gabon (in particular, the Transgabonese railway) and considered for
Cameroon and CAR; and (d) the assumption that no major investments or sub-
stantial improvements will be made on the road from Brazzaville to Pointe
Noire at least within the next decade. The projections used in the analysis
represent traffic estimates based on information presently available. Table
3 shows the best traffic estimates by commodity for ATC, and Table 15 the
distribution of this traffic between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire by country
of origin and destination. The impact of potential changes in critical
traffic assumptions is incorporated in the economic evaluation through a
sensitivity analysis (para. 5.12).
5.04      The timber traffic projections detailed in Annex 9 are based on an
evaluation of future world timber markets taking into account growth of local
processing, a timber resource analysis of the Central African region poten-
tially to be evacuated by ATC, and an assessment of existing and future alter-
native evacuation routes. The projections assume that the present slump in
the world timber market will end in 1977, with timber traffic fully recovering
in 1978. Although no firm plans are in hand, it is conceivable that by 1980
or thereabouts, Cameroon and CAR could develop a transport route to provide
access to a Cameroon port for their forestry areas which presently depend on
ATC. Even then, however, ATC should continue to play its regional role on
the grounds of comparative transport cost advantages. Timber traffic pro-
jections over the CFCO railway assume that timber originating in southern
Gabon would, by 1985, be transferred to the Transgabon railway. A discussion
of alternatives to ATC timber evacuation routes is in Annex 10. Concerning
the exploitation of Congo's timber resources, the Government has agreed that
it will take all necessary measures (a) to ensure that concessions of
operating rights be granted in certain forestry areas in agreement with the
Bank, and (b) to promptly implement its policies relating to the inventory
and exploitation of other areas.
5.05      Traffic in manganese ore, presently about 2.3 million tons p.a., is
expected to increase to about 2.6 million tons p.a. by 1976, and then level
off until about 1985. The ceiling is determined, inter alia, by the capacity
of the cableway system linking the mine at Moanda (Gabon) with the railhead
at Mbinda (Congo), from where the ('OMILOG railway feeds the ore into the ATC
system. From 1985 on, it has been assumed for evaluation purposes only that
all the manganese would be carried by the Tranagabonese railway. The CFCO
railway would have available capacity to handle the manganese after 1985,
however, if required under the 1974 agreement between Congo and Gabon which
obligates the CFCO to carry a minimum of 2 million tons of manganese beyond
the year 2000.
5.06      Potash exports are forecast to increase from the current 400,000
tons to about 1.2 million tons by 1985. This tentative forecast reflects



- 19 -
the expectation that carmelite (a complex potassium compound) will be mined
when the existing potash deposits run out. Due to the short distance (about
43 ki) this traffic is carried by the CFCO to Pointe Noire, uncertainty about
the increased future volumes is not significant for the project.
5.07      No alternative Congo transport system exists as a substitute for
ATC's river services, railway, and ports. Pointe Noire is not yet linked to
Brazzaville by road (construction of only about 200 km of the 550 km distance
between these points is completed or planned), nor Brazzaville with areas to
the north beyond Ouesso. However, as the justification for the project end
the future viability of the CFCO depend in large measure on the CFCO carrying
all forecast traffic between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, any major road
investment in this corridor could constitute an over-investment and create
transport coordination problems. Under the First Railway Project, the Gov-
ernment agreed that any major road construction between the two cities would
be subject to feasibility studies to be reviewed by the Association. The
Government has now agreed to consult with the Bank before undertaking any
major investments in the transport sector outside the ATC investment program
(para. 2.07).
C. Investment Alternatives
5.08      While a complete investment package for all ATC sections is required
to meet the objectives mentioned above, the choice of economic/technical
options to the proposed investments are essentially limited to the Pointe
Noire-Brazzaville railway, and particularly the proposed Fourastie-Louboio
realignment. Potential infrastructure solutions considered as alternatives
to the proposed realignment were: (i) realignment of the Rolle-Loubomo
section on a northern route; (ii) rehabilitation and improvement of the
existing Fourastie-Loubomo track; and (iii) complementing CFCO railway
capacity by a road.
5.09      The rail realignment on an alternative northern route was rejected,
as the capital and operating costs would be higher than for the southern
solution proposed under the project, while only yielding the same benefits.
Major improvements to the existing line would be inferior in terms of capacity,
operating characteristics, and economics as demonstrated in Annex 11, Part I.
Complete substitution of the CFCO railway by a road is also not an attractive
alternative, because for the traffic volumes and distances involved, the
resulting increases in transport costs would be far higher than the apparent
savings in capital expenditures. Partial substitution in the form of combining
a road with the existing railway (adequately maintained, but not improved)
would offer no better solution than the major improvements case when compared
to the proposed realignment.
D.  Economic Returns
5.10      Table 13 shows the economic rates of return of the realignment
compared with the investment alternatives given below, and of the total ATC
investments during 1974-78, together with the results of the sensitivity
analysis. The proposed realignment was evaluated against:



- 20 -
(a)  a reference case consisting of the minimum investment that
could be made to avoid further deterioration of the
Fourastie-Loubomo section of the railway. The rate of
return for the realignment is estimated at 18%;
(b)  a major improvement of the Fourastie-Dolisie section,
yielding a rate of return for the realignment of 20%; and
(c)  a combination of the reference case and a complementary road,
for alternative openings of the realignment and the road
in 1979 and 1983, yielding a rate of return of 22% in the first
case, and 15% in the second case.
The major benefit of the realignment in cases (a) and (b) above is the avoidance
of frustrated traffic of the Congo, Cameroon, and landlocked CAR and Chad.
Benefits from frustrated traffic are therefore estimated as the value added
foregone by the regional economy of these four countries. On a purely national
basis for the Congo, this project would have a lower but still acceptable rate
of return, as it is to be financed on concessionary terms by grants and soft
loans that will be available because of the regional importance of the proj-
ect, but which would not be available for other projects in the CoUgo.
5.11      The project and its implementation will, in addition, because of
its size in relation to the country's economy, have a significant effect on
the overall rate of growth of Congo. Moreover, the increased exports and
transit traffic allowed by the expanded transport capacity will be an important
source of foreign exchange.
5.12      The whole proposed ATC investment program for the period 1974-78,
including the realignment and complementary investments in the CFCO, ports
and river services, was evaluated similarly considering incremental costs and
benefits with regard to a reference case which assumes sufficient capital
expenditure to maintain the ATC transport system in operation under present
efficient levels without, however, any capacity-increasing investment. This
evaluation yielded a rate of return of 23%.
E.   Sensitivity Analysis
5.13      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of
potential changes in assumptions for critical benefit items. Changes in in-
vestment costs were not analyzed, as bids for the main civil works contract
(representing 80% of the total realignment costs) have already been received
and evaluated. The sensitivity analysis was applied to: (a) variations in
traffic under the reference case due to changes either in line capacity or
assignments in traffic priorities; and (b) changes in traffic demand on the
railway regarding Cameroon and Central African Republic timber. The economic
returns obtained from this exercise varied from 7% to 34% in the comparison
of the realignment with the reference case, from 8% to very large when the
realignment was compared to the combination of road and rail, and from 14%
to 39% for the total proposed ATC investments compared to the pertinent
reference case (Table 13). In the context of a sensitivity analysis, these
rates of return are satisfactory.

6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.  Background
6.01      The proposed project is designed to reduce unit operating costs on
the ATC system through technical and operational improvements, and to in-
crease capacity to meet the anticipated growth in traffic demand. The object
of the financial analysis is to determine whether and how the project can be
financed without severely affecting ATC's future financial position, and to,
establish whether and under what conditions it will provide an acceptable
financial rate of return.
6.02      The financial tables (14 through 21) have been prepared in current
CFAF francs under inflation assumptions shown in Table 14 in order to allow
a realistic assessment of ATC's cash position during and after implementation
of the Project. Tables showing breakdowns of operating revenues and working
expenses have been prepared for the years following 1974 both in constant
and current CFA francs. All proposed targets are based on current prices.
B.   Past Finances, 1970-75
6.03      ATC produced its first income accounts and balance sheets as of
December 31, 1970. The 1970 consolidated operations resulted in a net
surplus of about CFAF 400 million, with each operating section showing
profits. However, ATC's consolidated finances deteriorated steadily
through 1973, in spite of an average 50% tariff increase implemented in three
stages between February 1973 and November 1974. ATC's income account from
1970 to 1975 is summarized below; details are in Table 15 (operating revenue),
Table 16 (working expenditure), and consolidated in Table 17.

6.04      Except for the Port of Pointe Notre, and in 1974 the CFCO Railway,
all sections of ATC suffered increasing operating losses between 1971 and 1974,
because of poor traffic performance and inadequate tariff policies. The above-
mentioned tariff increase and the implementation of the first phase of the
1974-1978 investment plan were expected to improve ATC's 1975 financial per-
formance. Unfortunately, the slump in the timber market reduced timber traffic



- 22 -
from an anticipated 520,000 tons to about 360,000 tons in 1975, causing a
shortfall of budgeted revenues of about CFAF 1 billion. Also, operating costs
exceeded forecasts by about 8.5% in 1975, mainly because of a Government-
ordered salary increase. The significant shortfalls in ATC's net revenue
between 1970 and 1975 resulted in steadily deteriorating working capital
levels, culminating in assets/current liabilities and liquid assets/current
liabilities ratio of 0.7 and 0.4 respectively. Details are presented in
Tables 18 (balance sheet) and 19 (selected financial ratios).
C.   Financial Position 1976-1979
6.05      While it appears fully justified to assume that the world timber
market will recover from its present slump and that traffic will establish new
high levels by the end of the 1970's, there is a risk that the rate of
recovery over the next three years will not be sufficient to provide ATC with
needed revenues, with the result that ATC's financial position will continue
to be difficult. To alleviate this situation, the Government, in consulta-
tion with the Bank, decided on February 8, 1976 to:
(a) waive repayment of the sales tax collected by ATC for
repayment to the Treasury. This measure includes taxes
collected by ATC since January 1, 1975, and will be
maintained as long as required to rehabilitate ATC's
financial position;
(b) exempt ATC from the payment of custom duties on imported
materials starting January 1, 1976; and
(c) allow ATC to increase its tariffs by about 17% by March 1,
1976 on domestic traffic and by May 1, 1976 on transit
traffic (after consultation with other countries affected).
ATC's finances should also improve in the near future as a result of measures
recently taken by the Government to raise the productivity of public enter-
prises and limit increases in their expenditures, mainly by restricting staff
appointments and wage increases. The forecast income statements of ATC from
1976 to 1979 and relevant financial ratios, taking into account implementa-
tion of the above measures, are given in Tables 15-17 and Table 19, and
summarized below:

6.04      Except for the Port of Pointe Notre, and in 1974 the CFCO Railway,
all sections of ATC suffered increasing operating losses between 1971 and 1974,
because of poor traffic performance and inadequate tariff policies. The above-
mentioned tariff increase and the implementation of the first phase of the
1974-1978 investment plan were expected to improve ATC's 1975 financial per-
formance. Unfortunately, the slump in the timber market reduced timber traffic



- 22 -
from an anticipated 520,000 tons to about 360,000 tons in 1975, causing a
shortfall of budgeted revenues of about CFAF 1 billion. Also, operating costs
exceeded forecasts by about 8.5% in 1975, mainly because of a Government-
ordered salary increase. The significant shortfalls in ATC's net revenue
between 1970 and 1975 resulted in steadily deteriorating working capital
levels, culminating in assets/current liabilities and liquid assets/current
liabilities ratio of 0.7 and 0.4 respectively. Details are presented in
Tables 18 (balance sheet) and 19 (selected financial ratios).
C.   Financial Position 1976-1979
6.05      While it appears fully justified to assume that the world timber
market will recover from its present slump and that traffic will establish new
high levels by the end of the 1970's, there is a risk that the rate of
recovery over the next three years will not be sufficient to provide ATC with
needed revenues, with the result that ATC's financial position will continue
to be difficult. To alleviate this situation, the Government, in consulta-
tion with the Bank, decided on February 8, 1976 to:
(a) waive repayment of the sales tax collected by ATC for
repayment to the Treasury. This measure includes taxes
collected by ATC since January 1, 1975, and will be
maintained as long as required to rehabilitate ATC's
financial position;
(b) exempt ATC from the payment of custom duties on imported
materials starting January 1, 1976; and
(c) allow ATC to increase its tariffs by about 17% by March 1,
1976 on domestic traffic and by May 1, 1976 on transit
traffic (after consultation with other countries affected).
ATC's finances should also improve in the near future as a result of measures
recently taken by the Government to raise the productivity of public enter-
prises and limit increases in their expenditures, mainly by restricting staff
appointments and wage increases. The forecast income statements of ATC from
1976 to 1979 and relevant financial ratios, taking into account implementa-
tion of the above measures, are given in Tables 15-17 and Table 19, and
summarized below:

NOTE: Figures may not add due to rounding.
The largest item in the working expenditures shown above is for staff
expenses which been calculated assuming: (a) staff numbers remaining fairly
constant; (b) wage increases being limited to inflation levels except for 5%
annual promotion increases; and (c) Improvements in staff productivity being
as forecast in Annex 5. Interest charges assume that the proposed Bank Loan
includes capitalization of interest up to US$3 million equivalent during proj-
ect implementation to help ease ATC's debt service burden.
6.06      A further 10% increase in tariffs beyond the 17% scheduled for the
current year, will be necessary in 1978 to allow ATC to achieve annual rates
of return on average net fixed assets in use shown in the table in para 6.05
above. These returns together with the recent Government measures, will
allow ATC to: (a) cover its vorking expenses; (b) progressively restore
working capital; (c) finance its share of the investment plan- and (d) service
its debt.   ATC has agreed to take necessary measures to achieve
an overall rate of return on net fixed assets in use of at least 6Z in 1977
and 8% in the years 1978 to 1980. These rates of return We to be calculated
without taking into account the Government's financial assistance to ATC in
the form of a tax waiver (para. 6.05).
6.07      All previous increases in ATC's tariffs have resulted from finan-
cial pressures rather than from a deliberate policy based on the cost of
transport. In contrast, and in recognition of the fact that a positive
policy is now required, agreement has been reached between the Government,
ATC, and the Bank that ATC will: (a) implement a cost-based tariff system
by December 31, 1978; and (b) increase tariffs as required to meet the above
mentioned financial criteria and offset inflationary pressures.
6.08      As shown in Table 15, all sections of ATC (except for the River
Transport Department which is especially sensitive to timber traffic), are



- 24 -
expected to generate net operating profits by 1977 under present traffic
assumptions, and to be financially viable by 1978. However, specific finan-
cial criteria for individual sections cannot be established until after im-
plementation of the new comprehensive costing system to be introduced under
the proposed project (paras. 3.08 and 6.07). ATC has therefore agreed that
financial criteria for its sections will be established for the years 1981
and thereafter in agreement with the Bank.
6.09      Following recommendations made by BCEOM/Sofrerail and discussions
with ATC's management, it was established in 1971 that ATC's working capital,
excluding cash, should cover the following:
-    Stores:         14 months of working expenses for materials
-    Receivables:   25% of annual operating revenue
-    Creditors:      25% of annual working expenditure, excluding
staff and head office costs
-    Debt service:  30% of debt service due in the following
financial year.                                   -
Since that time, ATC has been unable to generate enough funds to pay for its
investments; it therefore drew funds from its working capital which conse-
quently dropped far below the desired level. The Government and ATC have
now agreed that ATC's working capital will be progressively improved to meet
the above requirements by 1981.
6.10      The forecast sources and application of funds during 1976-79 is
given in Table 20 and summarized as follows:

The above summary includes the cost of the proposed CFCO realignment and the
grants and loans required to finance it. The table shows that ATC's overall
financial position will improve only slightly in 1976-79, in spite of the
significant Government assistance.   It also shows that bank overdrafts up to
CFAF 1.7 billion will be necessary in 1976/77. The Government has agreed
under the proposed project to provide overdraft facilities to ATC as
necessary.
6.11      The Government is aware of the fragility of ATC's cash position in
the near future. Therefore, in order to prevent any shortage of funds which
would jeopardize implementation of the entire 1974-78 investment plan, it
has provided assurances that: (a) ATC will not have to provide any funds
for the CFCO realignment during its construction; and (b) in case of any
shortfall, the Government will provide any funds necessary to assure imple-
mentation of the entire investment plan and to service all the debts of ATC
until December 31, 1980. In Addition, ATC has agreed to set up a separate
accounting system for the CFCO realignment along lines to be agreed with the
Bank.
6.12      ATC's fixed assets as of December 31, 1972 have been revalued by
consultants BCEOM/Sofrerail and incorporated into the 1974 accounts. ATC
has agreed that it will: (a) carry out a further revaluation of its fixed
assets in 1978; (b) thereafter, review the situation of its fixed assets in
consultation with the Bank at five-year intervals or less, and if necessary,
undertake revaluations from time to time in agreement with the Bank. ATC has
also agreed to the stipulation that income and revenue targets required to
control its finances after 1980 will be fixed periodically following discus-
sions with the Bank. The rates of return specified in the table in para. 6.05
above assume the revaluation of assets in 1978, and that assets acquired during
a given year will be entered in the accounts at current value of that year.

6.13      ATC's consolidated balance sheets for 1972-86 are given in Table 18
and summarized below for selected years:
(in current CFAF billion)

1/   Fixed assets revalued in 1978
2/   Including CFCO realignment cost and relevant long-term borrowing and grants
3/   Including grants for the CFCO realigment.
The above table shows that:
(a) ATC's cash and current assets' positions are expected to
gradually improve between 1975 and 1979, but the working
capital, excluding cash, will only reach 60% of the desired
level described in para. 6.09 by 1979; and
(b) ATC's long-term debt position as of December 31, 1979 is
acceptable, since all the presently forecast long-term
borrowing will be mobilized by the end of 1979. A list
of long-term loans and their conditions is given in
Table 21.
6.14      Due to the foreseen difficult financial situation of ATC, it has
been agreed between ATC, the Government and the Bank that during each year of
the project, ATC will provide the Bank by November 15 at the latest with
estimated financial results for the current year and the draft budget for the
following year, to enable the Bank to offer comments before its presentation
for approval by ATC's Board and the Government. It was further agreed that,
should the necessity arise, ATC and the Government would promptly agree with
the Bank on remedial action. Such action could consist of;(a) changes in ATC
tariffs or tariff policies; (b) reduction of current expenditures; (c) measures
aimed at restoring or improving productivity; and (d) action toward obtaining
Governmental financial assistance.

D.   Financial Position 1980-86
6.15      ATC's financial position can be expected to continue improving
following the implementation of planned investments over 1974-80 provided
that: (a) operational targets are achieved; (b) traffic projections, mainly
for timber, materialize; and (c) a cost-based and commercially competitive
tariff system is implemented. These factors are reflected in the following
table which summarizes ATC's income accounts and balance sheets for selected
years:

1/   Manganese traffic assumed to be diverted to the Gabon Railway by 1986.
2/   Fixed assets revalued in 1985.
Underlying assumptions used in preparing the income account were the follow-
ing: (a) tariffs increased by 10% every two years starting in 1980;
(b) number of staff remaining fairly constant; (c) wage increases limited to
inflation except for annual promotions; (d) inflation assumptions on wages,
materials, and services listed in Column 1 of Table 14; (e) improvement
in productivity as forecasted in Annex 5. Table 16b shows the breakdown in
percentage of the working expenses of ATC and its four operating sections
as a result of the above assumptions. ATC should be able to finance its
investments until 1986 from its own funds, provided conditions listed in para.
6.15 materialize.



- 28 -
6.16      The most noticeable effect of implementing the proposed Investments
during 1974-85 will be the accumulation of uncommitted cash, requiring a
decision by the Government and ATC as to whether ATC should: (a) finance or
participate in financing further substantial investments; (b) reduce tariffs;
or (c) pay substantial dividends to the Government. Agreements have been
reached that the use of any excess funds generated by ATC will be determined
after consultation between ATC, the Government, and the Bank.
E.   Sensitivity Analysis
6.17      Details of the sensitivity analysis of financial forecasts are
given in Annex 12. This analysis was conducted to test the impact on ATC's
financial position of a possible decrease in ATC's cash generation and/or
a possible increase in the cost of capital investments. The following
assumptions are used; (a) 20% decrease in gross operating revenue generated
by the timber traffic; (b) 10% increase in working expenditure; and (c) 10%
increase in the cost of capital investments, except for the realignment. The
analysis showed that using the above assumptions would result in a cumulated
shortage of cash of about CFAF 46 billion which could be overcome by the
cumulative effect of tariff increases roughly in line with inflation assump-
tions used in the main analysis (Table 14) ,and of additional borrowing of
about CFAF 8 billion in 1978/79 and up to about 40% of ATC's 1980-86 invest-
ments. The main result of the most pessimistic sensitivity assumption would
be: (a) a substantial increase in ATC's long-term debt service; and (b) a
delay in the accumulation of uncommitted cash. In order to prevent its
present and future borrowing expanding beyond a safe level, ATC has agreed
that its net revenue of each year will be more than 1.25 times its maximum
debt service of the following year, unless otherwise agreed with the Bank.
7.   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations on the proposed Loan, the following principal
items were discussed and agreed with the Government and ATC:
(i) the Government will consult with the Bank before undertaking
any major investments in the transport sector outside the ATC
investment program (para. 2.07);
(ii) the present level of technical assistance available to ATC, and
the responsibilities of technical assistants in line positions,
will not be reduced without prior approval of the Bank (para. 3.03);
(iii) the level of specified operating targets to be achieved for Pointe
Noire port, the CFCO railway, and river transport services (paras.
3.13 - 3.18);



- 29 -
(iv) the Government will make no change in the investment plan
for 1974-78 (except for minor items totalling not more than
CFAF 200 million annually) unless in agreement with the Bank
(para. 3.19); also, ATC has agreed to review with the Bank by
December 31, 1977, its investment program for 1979-85 to ascer-
tain any modifications required by conditions pertaining at
that time (para. 3.20);
(v) all arrangements for financing and procurement of goods and
services included in the ATC 1974-78 investment plan (paras. 4.10 -
4.13);
(vi) ATC will take necessary measures to achieve an overall rate of
return on net fixed assets in use of at least 6% in 1977 and 8%
in the years 1978 to 1980 (para. 6.06);
(vii) a cost-based tariff system will be implemented by December 31, 1978,
and tariffs will be increased as required to meet specified finan-
cial criteria and offs&t inflationary pressures (para. 6.07);
(viii) measures will be taken to progressively improve ATC's working
capital to meet agreed requirements by 1981 (paras. 6.09 and
6.14);
(ix) the Government has agreed that ATC will not have to provide any
funds for the CFCO realignment during its construction; also,
in case of any shortfall in funds, the Government will provide
the amounts necessary to assure implementation of the entire
investment plan and to service all ATC's debts until December 31,
1980 (para. 6.11); and
(x) ATC's net revenue of each year will be more than 1.25 times its
maximum debt service of the following year, unless otherwise
agreed with the Bank (para. 6.17).
7.02      During Loan negotiations, details of the supervisory arrangements
for the project were reviewed, and the Government, ATC, and the co-donors
have no objection to the Bank supervising both those project items in whose
financing it is participating, and also all other items, to ensure the
coordination and quality of the whole investment plan (para. 4.09).
7.03      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan will be the
finalization of agreements on terms assuring financing of the CFCO realignment,
or assurances satisfactory to the Bank that funding for the works will other-
wise be forthcoming. An additional condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Loan will be the receipt of assurances satisfactory to the Bank from donors
whose contributions to the financing of the remaining items in the investment
plan have been agreed in principle but not yet secured. (para. 4.110).

7.04      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$38 million
to ATC with the guarantee of the Government of the People's Republic of the
Congo. The Loan term will be 25 years including five years of grace, at an
interest rate of 8-1/2% p.a.
March 9, 1976.

ATC proposes as next tranche, after 2nd ADB loan, to order,
4 tugs 150 HP for floating timber             )  capacity  =  25,000 tons
2 port tugs for transfer floating timber   )
3 tugs 400 HP         )  for heavy timber, capacity   =  40,000 tons
14 barges 250 tons   )
Total     =      65,000 tons
Delivery period for mall tugs is 1 - 1~2 years, and for large tugs and barges
2 years, plus erection time; it should be adequate to order in 1977 for use in
1979/80. Position should be reexamined in 1977 and possibly additional funds
provided to meet requirements to 1980.

1/ Technical assistance assumed to produce a gradual increase in operating efficiency;
two passenger trains run as at present.
2/ Technical assistance assumed to produce immediate increase in operating efficiency;
timber traffic displacing one passenger train.
3/ Current level of operating efficiency; timber traffic displacing one passenger train.
4/ Current level of operating efficiency; two passenger trains run as at present.
5/ Frustrated traffic valued as net revenue loss on manganese and CAR/Cameroon timber,
and as value added loss for Congo timber.
6/ Same as above, but discounting grant component of available financing.
7/ Assuming that an alternative Cameroon outlet could be in service in 1986.
8/ Project opening refers to both the proposed realignment and the road.
9/ Benefits of frustrated traffic during the investment period are greater than the
net investment cost (realignment-road), causing an infinite rate of return.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
ATC - Training and Technical Assistance
A. Training
1.        ATC provides technical training in the following categories:
(i) for apprentices and other newly recruited staff at schools
in Pointe Noire, Loubomo, and Brazzaville;
(ii) in-service training for personnel who have completed
apprenticeships;
(iii) upgrading training for older staff to develop greater compe-
tence in their specialties; and
(iv) for administrative and middle-management personnel.
2.        In addition to the training provided under (i) and (ii) above, the
best apprentices from the mechanical workshop training school at Pointe Noire
are sent to the regional training school in Douala (Cameroon) for three years
of further study; in 1973, 11 ATC staff were enrolled. As a next step, the
most successful graduates of the Douala school, as well as other specialists,
go to France to attend training ccurses for higher technicians organized
through the Office Central des Chemins de Fer d'Outre-Mer (OFEROM) and con-
ducted by the French National Railways (SNCF). An additional source of
training is that provided by the manufacturers of new equipment items such
as locomotives, river craft, etc., as they often have to provide the required
after-sales service and training locally for about two years.
3.        ATC's long-term needs for efficient skilled manpower can be met
adequately if training provided in the Centre de Formation Professionnelle
Generale (CFPG) at Pointe Noire is supplemented by on-the-job and skill-
upgrading courses. However, the Director of CFPG is not authorized to
organ;ize such courses or to designate staff to attend them. Moreover,
the CFCO management set-up does not include a Personnel Officer who could
be responsible for recruitment, maintaining personnel records, staff develop-
ment, and organizing part-time courses for junior- and middle-level personnel.
These problems have resulted in the now virtual non-existence of in-service
and upgrading training in the maintenance of mechanical equipment. In-service
training-and refresher courses are carried out in traffic operations, track
and works, and telecommunications, but they are not well organized or co-
ordinated; this results in low staff morale, as the possibilities for career
advancement are not clearly defined. It is therefore essential that all
training activities be reorganized under a central authority.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        Additional training needs include the following;
(i) some increase in the facilities for all the training categories
mentioned in para. 1 above;
(ii)  relocation of the track and works training school from Iouboimo
to Pointe Noire which has better administrative and practical
facilities;
(iii) extension of the Brazzaville school to train staff for the
marine workshops and river craft;
(iv) technical assistance for setting up instructor training courses
and to train local counterparts; and
(v) technical assistance to arrange in-service staff development
courses (to eventually replace part-time courses for middle-
management personnel now provided to Government organizations
by a French training institution).
B.   Technical Assistance
5.        Expatriate technical assistance is provided for all ATC operations,
for on-the-job training, and for teaching at the various schools. The level
of this technical assistance is shown in Table 1. Until mid-1972, the greater
proportion of the experts were employed on operations, particularly on the
CFCO. Since then, however, some of the technical assistants were replaced
by local personnel, and others were moved to training positions. The con-
sequence of this has been a decline in ATC's overall operating efficiency,
particularly on the CFCO, and it is therefore vital that increased technical
on-the-job training be provided in certain of the railway departments (mechan-
ical workshops, track maintenance, traffic operations, telecommunications
and signalling, and accounting) until a sufficient number of adequately train-
ed local personnel are available.
C.   Manpower and Equipment Requirements
6.        Details of the technical assistance and training equipment require-
ments to cover the needs identified above are given in Attachment 1 to this
Annex; an outline of terms of reference for the technical assistance services
is in Attachment 2.  The total costs are estimated at about US$4.6 million,
comprising US$3.8 million for technical assistance, and US$0.8 million for
training equipment.

function, the expert will prepare one or more local staff to carry on his
instructor-training function on completion of his contract.
Expert as Assistant to the Operating Manager (CFCO)
6.        The expert will assist in improving train operations and freight-
car control, and in improving and expanding CFCO's commercial activities.
He will organize and assist in implementing an improved system for controlling
receipts, and will also help in training office staff.
Experts for Field Work and On-line Training (CFCO)
7.        The two experts will concentrate on the supervision of operating
and commercial staff in stations, and will carry out on-the-job training in
stations along the line. They will also promote traffic and foster good
relationships with customers.
Experts for Rolling Stock Maintenance (CFCO)
8.        The two experts will organize and assist in the implementation
and methodical maintenance methods for railway rolling stock, and will
develop programs to ensure better supply of spare parts. They will work
in close cooperation with the expert for workshop organization, and in
collaboration with the CCCE-financed SOFRERAIL consultant team involved in
locomotive maintenance. The experts will also participate in staff train-
ing.
Expert for Workshop Organization (CFCO)
9.        The expert will be expected to:  (i) organize and assist in
implementation of better workshop methods and planning; (ii) determine
work force requirements and supplies of spares and materials; and (iii)
establish a system for controlling workshop costs. The expert will also
participate in workshop training for ATC staff.

tenance, renewals, and improvement works. He will also train office staff
in permanent way maintenance procedures.
Permanent Way Experts (CFCO)
11.       The two experts will work in the field to assist local Congolese
supervisors, and to be responsible for the practical implementation of
methodical maintenance programs for the railway's track and on-the-job
training.
Signalling and Telecommunications Expert (CFCO)
12.       The expert will organize and assist in improving maintenance on
existing equipment, and in introducing new equipment. He will determine
work force requirements and assist In on-the-job training along the line
as well as in giving courses.
Vocational Training Experts (River Transport)
13.       The three experts will plan and assist in establishing a training
school for technicians, mechanics, and workmen involved in maintaining
ATC's river transport and river navigation fleet. One expert will be
responsible for organizing and giving the theoretical courses, developing
curricula for the different trades, and assisting the management of the
port and river transport sections of ATC in formulating staff development
plans. Two mechanics (one for diesel engine maintenance and one for other
workshop activities) will carry out on-the-job training in the proposed new
workshops at Brazzaville.

ATC - Property Details
A. Headquarters
1.        ATC has a new multi-story office block at Pointe Noire for use
by all Headquarters' sections.
B. Port of Pointe Noire
2.        The port is an artificial one on a sandy bay, and protected from
the Atlantic surf by stone boulder moles; the area enclosed is about 84
ha. The entrance channel has a depth of 12 m at low tide, and the harbor
area 11 m; the range of tide is about 1.8 m. There is a littoral drift
from south to north, and occasional dredging has to be carried out to
maintain the required depths.
3.        There are five general cargo berths (alongside depth varying
from 7.3 to 9.15 m), two berths for timber and one for bulk oil (all depths
8.45 m), a berth for manganese export (depth 10.2 m), and a shallow draft
wharf for fishing vessels. Transit and storage sheds are provided for
general cargo2and timber (both sawn and plywood), with a total area of
some 80,000 m . Also in the port area are privately operated bulk instal-
lations for petrol and oils, export molasses, and fish freezing. There are
large areas (totalling some 14 ha) for timber stacking, sorting, and prep-
aration. At the manganese berth, COMILOG has its own stock area adequate
for about 250,000 tons of ore, and a bulk-handling installation for un-
loading railway cars and loading ships. The port area is adequately served
by both roads and railway.
4.        There are no wharf cranes, and all cargo is worked by ships'
derricks and mobile cranes. All shore-handling equipment, including that
for timber, is provided by private handling agencies. The port has a
cutter suction dredger and related equipment for dredging, one ocean-going
tug, two tugs for harbor use, a pilot cutter, VHF telephone equipment, and
a slipway and two derrick cranes. The fixed assets and equipment are
reasonably maintained.
5.        Construction of a new 9 ha area for timber-log stacking and han-
dling was completed in 1974 with financing from FAC/CCCE. The area is pro-
vided with a shallow draft wharf and cranes for loading heavy logs onto
pontoons, and with ramps for launching floating logs into the sea. A second
phase of reclamation, planned for 1976/77, will add a further 6 ha to the
stacking area.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
6.        A new berth being constructed with FED financing will provide
greater depth for bulk manganese carriers (11.6 m for 43,000-ton ships,
and later 13.2 m for 65,000-ton ships). Completion of this berth is ex-
pected by early 1976, and the existing manganese berth will be converted for
general cargo use.
7.        Outside the port area on the main sea coast, CPC has a railway
car offloading plant, bulk storage shed, and long qea jetty for the ship-
ment of bulk potash, with a capacity of some 1.5 million tons of potash
per year. However, the output of potash so far is only about 400-500,000
tons per year, so the installation is now under-utilized. The possibility
has been examined of using it for other bulk traffic, particularly for the
local oil development, but the exploration enterprise ELF decided to locate
all its sea installations near the offshore field, about 20 km south of
Pointe Noire.
C.   CFCO Railway
8.        The CFCO is about 510 km long with a gauge of 1.067 m.  The rail-
way was constructed between 1921 and 1934 at minimum cost, with a narrow
roadbed, steep gradients (2.2% uncompensated), and sharp curves (100 m
nominal radiusl but many actually 75-80 m over two mountain ranges, one
(the Mayombe) near the coast, and the other towards Brazzaville.   The
foreseen traffic capacity was probably some 500,000 net tons per year,
a level reached in 1955. The COMILOG manganese traffic which started in
1962, travels about 285 km on its own railway from the Gabon-Congo border,
then joins the CFCO at Mont Bello to travel a further 200 km to Pointe
Noire; manganese traffic has built up to over 2 million net tons p.a. at
present. Other traffic, particularly timber for export, has increased on
the CFCO as well, while the potash mine developed by CPC at about 45 km
from Pointe Noire, started production in 1970. Total volume carried in
1975 was about 3.8 million tons.
9.        The increased traffic, carried on heavier trains with heavier
axle loads, has led to considerable problems between Pointe Noire and
Dolisie, particularly over the Mayombe mountain section. These problems
include failure of the track foundation, high rate of rail wear, breakage
of rail joints, and collapse of the superstructure of concrete arch via-
ducts; they have in turn caused major and continuing maintenance problems
with the track and equipment, numerous accidents, considerable train de-
lays, and in recent years, restrictions on the amount of traffic carried.
Over 1960-66, heavier track material was laid on the sections from Pointe
Noire to Loubomo and Mont Bello, and in 1968-70, the alignment and track
on Pointe Noire-Holle (57 km) were improved to an adequate standard. For
the main and difficult mountain section Holle- IoUbomo, however, the then
ATEC and the Bank Group concluded in 1968 that very substantial improve-
ment of the existing conditions would be necessary. As a result, the
UNDP agreed to finance a feasibility study which was carried out by con-
sultants Tecsult.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
10.       This study was completed in 1972, and was followed by final
engineering (financed by IDA Credit 297-COB) of the recommended solution,
namely the improvement of about 18 km of the existing alignment, and the
construction of about 88 km. of completely new route. The new construc-
tion involves heavy earthworks through difficult and densely forested
country, with lengthy tunnelling and bridging, and all at considerable
cost; but no reasonable alternative is feasible while continuing to main-
tain the traffic flow under local operating conditions.
11.       The sections Loubomo-Mont Bello-Brazzaville also need track improve-
ments, but these are not so critical and can follow in subsequent investment
plan periods.
12.       The locomotive fleet is all diesel; availability at about 60 per
cent is poor but is partly due to the arduous operating conditions, and part-
ly to design problems with two of the more recent types of locomotives. The
locomotive and rolling stock fleets are being increased, and the older units
replaced as required with financing mainly by CCCE and IDA Credit 297-COB.
Further replacements and some additional main-line locomotives and passenger
cars are propossed to carry the forecast traffic to 1978. Maintenance of
motive _power and rolling stock needs to be improved, and better workshop
facilities and provision of spare parts are also required.  With the help of
CCCE financing, ATC is at present expanding the main shops at Pointe Noire,
and reorganization of the maintenance operations which will include the pro-
vision of maintenance manuals and staff training started in 1975. The exist-
ing depots at Loubomo and Brazzaville will be reorganized.
13.       Station signalling, as well as train control and telecommunications
equipment, have been inadequate; also, loops at stations for crossing trains
have been too short. ATC is taking steps to improve these facilities (com-
pletion of longer sidings in 1974, of station signalling in 1976) with partial
financing provided by ADB and CCCE, and further improvement is proposed in
conjunction with execution of the major track realignment on Fourastie-Loubomo.
14.       Existing important concrete arch bridges and the 1.5 km long summit
tunnel on the Mayombe mountain section are in poor condition, and would re-
quire major reconstruction if they are not replaced by the proposed new align-
ment. Bridges and culverts on other sections are adequate. Buildings at the
main centers are satisfactory; at wayside stations improved facilities are
needed, and are being introduced as new stations are built or existing sta-
tions reconstructed.
D. River Navigation, Ports and Transport
15.       The principal river route from Brazzaville to Bangui (CAR) extends
about 1,200 km along the Congo and Oubangui Rivers. Subsidiary routes serving
northeastern Congo and southeastern Cameroon are about 3,800 km., making a
total of about 5,000 km of river routes operated by ATC.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
16.       Prior to 1969, the then ATEC maintained the navigation facilities
on the system, and also the principal river ports of Brazzaville and Bangui;
transport on the rivers was handled by private enterprise. After the estab-
lishment of ATC in 1969, CAR became responsible for Bangui port, and the
Congo and CAR jointly took over the principal private river operator; ATC
assumed responsibility for the Congo portion of the fleet, and a CAR state
enterprise, ACCF (Agence Centraficaine des Communications Fluviales) for the
other portion. Some small private shippers remain who deal wholly with tim-
ber.
17.       Maintenance and navigational aids on the Congo river are dealt
with by neighboring Zaire, while on the Oubangui, Sangha, and connected
rivers, the work is shared between ATC and ACCF. On the Congo and Oubangui
rivers, the limiting depths at normal annual minimum levels, between February
and May are approximately 1.80 m and 1.00 m respectively; on the Sangha river,
the limiting depth is about 0.85 m as far as Ouesso, and lower upstream. At
periods of abnormal low river levels, such as occurred on the Oubangui in
February to April 1974, there can be complete interruptions to all river
transport. Programs for improvements in the river channels, prepared with
advice from the Laboratoire National d'Hydraulique (France), are intended
to eventually increase the normal ruling depth in the upper rivers to 1.20 m.
ATC has three dredgers and some rock-breaking work barges; additional survey,
dredging, and rock-breaking equipment for this work and for maintenance and
channel-working generally, is now being supplied to ATC and ACCF, with finan-
cing by FED.
18.       Brazzaville has two main port areas which are served by both road
and rail; one is for general cargo and heavy logs and sawn timber carried
on barges, and the other for handling floating logs. The former has a main
wharf wall 520 m long equipped with 11 portal cranes, three transit sheds,
mobile equipment, and with a large open stacking area for sawn timber and
logs; there are adjacent facilities for handling heavy lifts, bulk oil,
and passengers. The main wharf is being extended a further 250 m under FED
financing. The second port area has a wharf 250 m long with four portal
cranes, mobile equipment, and an extensive stacking ground for transferring
logs from river to railway. There is a small port at Ouesso with a 60 m
wharf, two fixed cranes, two transit sheds, and a stacking area; there are
minor installations at Makona, Bourdji, Fort Rousset and Mossaka.
19.       The ATC river transport fleet consists of 1 passenger ship, 48
tugs of various sizes, and 73 barges for general cargo, timber, bulk oil,
and passengers. An additional 17 tugs (mainly small horsepower), and 12
barges financed by ADB, are in course of supply; ADB is also examining the
provision of a further 7 tugs and 19 barges under a second loan.
20.       The ATC fleet is well maintained, and new units are adequately
designed and constructed. There are reasonable marine workshops at Brazza-
ville which have been adequate until now, but reorganization of operations



ANNEX 2
Page 5
and expansion of facilities are proposed to cater for the enlarging fleet.
Adjoining the floating timber port is another marine workshop originally
built by the Republic of China for the construction of vessels with timber
hulls; this workshop has been administered as a separate state enterprise
with ATC being obliged to take over and operate the units produced, although
not in favor of timber hulls because of the maintenance problems involved.
The facility was transferred by the Government in 1975 for minor industrial
use, instead of for ships.
E.   General
21.       Further details about the equipment in use on all the sections of
ATC are given in Annex 3.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
ATC - Operational Details
A.  Port of Pointe Noire
1.        The port orgainzation has the normal sections for administration,
pilotage, shore operations, and maintenance of equipment and fixed assets;
the accounting services is provided by ATC headquarters. All stevedore and
shore handling of cargo was carried out by private enterprise, including in
particular all the stacking, sorting, and shipment of timber. These opera-
tions will now be carried out by new jointly-owned enterprises (see para. 4).
2.        Data on port shipping, cargoes, and output for 1968-1974 are given
in Table 4. The number of ships using the port has remained static, but
the volume of cargo per ship has increased over the period.  The total cargo
handled also increased until 1971 (mainly manganese, timber, and bulk oils),
but has remained static since then. Non-floatable timber logs, sawn timber,
and plywood are loaded on ship at either the five general cargo berths or
at the two timber berths; floatable timber logs are put in the sea and loaded
over the seaward side of ships at berths, or overside on ships moored in
the harbor area.  The new timber log facilities completed at end - 1974, will
enable almost all log loading to be done over the ships' side and at the two
timber berths, and this in turn will provide greater capacity for general
cargo at the other berths.
3.        The port normally works a single shift of eight hours six days
a week, with a half shift on Sundays; an occasional second shift is worked
if required, at an extra charge to the ship. The resulting annual tonnage
of dry cargo (excluding manganese ore) handled per berth and per meter of
wharf is reasonable, but could be greater in view of the preponderance of
bulk timber traffic.
4.        There are two main problems at the port; one is that the private
cargo-handling agencies have been reluctant, due to political circumstances,
to invest in additional equipment; and the other is that port labor and
customs have not been in favor of operating a regular second shift. The
Government, ATC and the agencies have recently negotiated the formation of
new jointly-owned handling enterprises with technical direction remaining
with the agencies, to deal initially with timber in 1975 but to be extended
later to cover all cargo-handling in 1976. These joint enterprises would
then be responsible for provision of the necessary equipment, again particularly
for timber-handling, and intended to be financed by CCCE. ATC expects that
the new port enterprises will be able to obtain the cooperation of the labor
syndicate and customs on improving cargo-handling operations, including the



ANNEX 4
Page 2
working of a regular second shift, particularly for timber-handling, as and when
required. Other aims are: (i) to remove long-term timber log storage
from the port to new storage areas adjacent to the new Pointe Noire rail-
way marshalling yard; and (ii) to maintain much fuller statistical data
on cargo operations than has been available to the port management to date.
The port facilities should then be adequate to meet forecast traffic re-
quirements until about 1980.
5.        The port is also used as a base for tuna fishing, and recently,
also as the base for offshore oil exploration and development some 20 km
to the south of Pointe Noire.
B.   CFCO Railway
6.     _  The principal traffic operations on the CFCO are COMILOG manganese
ore, CPO potash, and general traffic, principally timber.
7.        COMILOG operates its own trains over the CFCO from Mont Bello
to Pointe Noire; it has the use of up to three train paths each way per
day, and has been able to meet the increasing export tonnage by increasing
the motive power and bulk ore wagons per train. The present avera e net
train load is about 2,500 tons, and the gross load about 3,200 tons. The
limit of COMILOG capacity for ore, estimated at 2.6 million tons per year,
is controlled by the capacity of the 56 km ropeway linking the mine to the
railhead. The operating arrangements for COMILOG traffic on the CFCO and
also, conversely for CFCO traffic on the COMILOG railway, are covered by
agreements between ATC and COMILOG.
8.   The potash traffic is carried 47 km to Pointe Noire, and has required
about one train path per day so far. The bulk wagons are provided by CPC,
while the CFCO supplies the motive power. This section of the CFCO track
and stations has been improved, and the traffic does not cause any parti-
cular problem to the CFCO.
9.        Timber traffic reaches the CFCO as follows:  from southern Congo
and Gabon at Mont Bello and Iouboao, and from northern Congo, southern
Cameroon and CAR at Brazzaville.
10.       The increasing traffic (mainly timber) on the CFCO has been
carried partly by enlarging the fleet of diesel locomotives and freight
cars, and partly by increasing the size of the units. The increasing
weight of axle loads and of gross train loads, both with the COMILOG and
the CFCO traffic, have led to problems on the track between Holle and
Loubomo. These in turn have imposed limitations in operations because of
the loss of time involved with track maintenance, locomotive failures,
accidents, and derailments. Moreover, the problems are compounded by:
(i) lack of space at stations for train movements and to cross longer,
heavier trains; (ii) inadequate signalling, telecommunications, and train
control facilities; and (iii) low operating staff efficiency. ATC under-
took measures to improve items (i) and (ii) above, and after long delays



ANNEX 4
Page 3
in financing and execution, the work on (i) was finally completed at end-19749
and on (ii) will be completed in 1976. The question of improving staff effi-
ciency is part of the general need of ATC to expand and improve the teaching
programs, and to provide additional technical assistance for on-the-job
training.
11.       The CFCO capacity control lies in the Down or export direction
over the section Loubomo to Holle; the figure has been 0.9 million net tons
per year of CFCO traffic (i.e. excluding manganese ore traffic) since 1971,
as fixed by the number of daily train paths available for through CFCO
freight trains and the average load per train. The extension of crossing
stations and the improvement to signalling will enable longer heavier trains
to operate, but will not increase the number of train paths. The train
load improvement may increase the Down traffic figure to about 1.6 million
tons per year to 1978. Thereafter, continuing deterioration of the in-
frastructure without remedial works, would cause additional and increasing
restrictions on traffic capacity.
12.       The locomotive fleet is all diesel-powered.  Its availability is
poor and averaged 57% for locomotives, and 64% for railcars in 1974, due to
the arduous operating conditions, poor maintenance facilities and organization,
and the acquisition of some locomotives which require modifications to make
them suitable for heavy duty work in the Congo. ATC is at present expanding
the main workshop facilities and reorganizing the maintenance operations for
which technical assistance is required. With these measures, it should be
possible to increase by 1978 the average availability of locomotives and rail-
cars to about 76% (making allowance for the inherent design problems in two
of the recent locomotive types).
13.       Although increased technical assistance and training programs will
help improve operations, they will not have much impact on the CFCO capacity
problem. Accordingly, a new improved alignment is essential to produce
easier operating conditons and thereby improve traffic capacity on the
critical sections.
C.   River Ports and Transport
14.       The division of traffic to be carried by ATC and ACCF is con-
trolled by Agreements between Congo and CAR. The latest such Agreement of
May 1972 provides for transport as follows:
(a)  general and timber traffic via CAR, 80% by ACCF and 20%
by ATC;
(b)  bulk oil traffic via CAR, 100% by ACCF; and
(c)  all other traffic (Cameroon principally), 50% by ATC,
but traffic to and from the Ngoko River (the border between
Cameroon and Congo), 100% by ATC.

15.       At Brazzaville, ATC is responsible for the trans-shipment of
cargo between river and rail wagons. ATC provides the wharves, transit
sheds, stacking grounds, cranes, and other handling equipment.
16.       ATC operations are reasonably efficient, but are dependent to
some extent on the vagaries of the river flows and levels; low river
flows are normal from January to June, but low levels can persist for
another two months. In 1970, about 45% of that year's traffic was carried
in January to June; but in 1971, only about 34% was carried over the same
period, due to the late rise in river levels. In 1974, there was complete
interruption of traffic on the Oubangui between February and May due to
abnormally low river levels.
17.       Transport of timber from the forest to collection points on the
rivers is undertaken by the logging companies, who also construct the
rafts of floating timber and load barges with timber that is too valuable
or heavy to float; the logging companies also load barges with timber sawn
into planks at the r sawmills. The rafts on the upper rivers are made up
of about 400-500 m  of logs, and are brought downstream by small tugs 3
(90-150 HP) to collecting points; there, larger rafts of up to 1,400 m
are formed for movement to Brazzaville. Barges are mostly about 250-ton
capacity, and are formed into convoys of about 1,500 tons propelled by
large pusher tugs (240 HP on the upper river, and 400 HP on the main
river). ATC has made the following assessment of requirements for timber
transport by river: (i) for each 65,000 tons (79,600 cu m) annually of
floating logs, an average of eleven small tugs (90-150 HP) are required
for the trip to Brazzaville; and (ii) for each 40,000 tons annually of
logs and sawn timber carried by barge, one tug of 240 HP, two tugs of
400 HP, and 14 barges of 250 ton capacity, are needed.
18.       According to the Conventions and Decrees under which logging
agreements are made, increasing proportions of certain types of timber
are required to be processed in the country of origin. As a result,
there are increasing quantities of sawn timber being transported by barge.
19.       Details of river traffic at Brazzaville and smaller ports over
1968-73 are given in Table 6. Overall, the total general traffic (ex-
cluding timber) increased to 1971, but has declined since then, althbough
the ATC portion has remained stable. The increase in traffic has been
entirely with timber, about 500% in five years. ATC's operational per-
formance both at Brazzaville port and on the river services have shown
some decline since 1971, and a reversal of this tendency is expected as a
result of the proposed project.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Main Items in the Proposed Project
A. ATC Headquarters
Training
1.        Training facilities and methods for all sections of ATC need to
be improved, and this would require provision of additional classrooms and
equipment, as well as some reorganization. Technical assistance is also
needed, both for training and for op_rations,_particularly on the CFCO. A
total of about 40 man-years of technical assistance, requiring about 17
experts, is proposed for financing under the present project.
B.  Port of Pointe Noire
2.        Investments are mainly to complete ongoing items such as new timber
log handling facilities, new manganese berth and conversion of the existing
berth to general cargo operations, improved slipway facilities, and iredging
of the harbor area.
3.        The port development plan up to 1978 also originally envisaged the
start of consturction on: (i) a mole and facilities for fishing vessels, and
(ii) two additional deepwater berths for timber handling. Both these items
have been reported on and designed in outline by consultants BCEOM. The first
is an independent item, separate from the general through-traffic capacity
requirement of ATC. The case for it seemed doubtful in view of the unpredic-
table location of the fishing grounds, and the number of other fishing ports
on the West African coast. The case for the additional two deepwater berths
was also doubtful because it is considered possible to increase output with
additional equipment and more regular second shift working (Annex 4, paras.
3-4). In view of the above, the two items have been eliminated from the 1974-
78 Investment Plan.
C.   River Services
4.        At Brazzaville port, the only major item is the renewal of some
old portal cranes at the general cargo wharf which are required for the more
efficient handling of cargo, heavy timber logs, and packaged sawn timber.
Provision is also made for additional miscellaneous items of mobile handling
equipment, such as fork lift trucks, which are required to meet the increase
in timber traffic.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        Expenditure on river navigation is to continue the work of
deepening the upper river channels and improving the navigational aids so
as to extend the annual seasons for traffic movements. The equipment re-
quired has already been provided under FED financing.
6.        The increase in the river transport fleet is planned by ATC in
conjunction with that of ACCF, having regard to the division of traffic
between the two agencies as agreed by the Governmedts of Congo and CAR. The
total timber traffic forecast through Brazzaville is also controlled by the
total capacity of the CFCO to 1978 to carry timber, and the balance of
capacity available after the CFCO caters for timber coming from south Congo
and Gabon. Table 8 sets out the total annual timber traffic, the amount
transported through Brazzaville, the division between ATC and ACCF and the
additional capacity being provided or proposed. Loans are now being nego-
tiated by ATC with the ADB, and by ACCF with KFW (Germany); if these are
implemented, there will be sufficient capacity through 1978, but a shortage
may arise by 1980. As it takes two years or more to obtain delivery of and
to erect the larger tugs and barges, orders for some additional equipment
may need to be placed by 1977. ATC proposes the purchase of 6 small tugs
150 HP, 3 Tugs 400 HP, 14 barges 250-ton capacity each; this would provide
a combined additional capacity of about 65,000 tons against a total additional
requirement at 1980 of about 265,000 tons. The position should be reviewed
about 1977.
7.        Expansion of the ATC fleet requires improvement of the marine
workshops to cater for the increased erection and maintenance work involved.
ATC has prepared a scheme for extending the slipway facilities, constructing
a wharf for work on units in the river, and reconstructing the present con-
gested workshop and spare parts facilities. The work is planned for execu-
tion in two phases over 1975-78, with ATC and Congo banks financing local
construction costs, and CCCE financing the costs of foreign equipment aind-
materials.
D.   CFCO Railway - General
8.        For track works, the proposed investments provide for the con-
tinuing rail renewals required, principally on the heavily curved section
Holle-Loubomo; completion of work on lengthening crossing loops and instal-
lation of signalling at selected stations to accommodate longer and heavier
trains; and provision of improved marshalling yard facilities at Pointe Noire
and Brazzaville, again to allow operation of larger freight trains. Local
costs are to be met by ATC, and foreign costs by CCCE.
9.        The main mechanical workshops are at present being enlarged and
reconstructed; provision is made for completion of this work, all at local
cost to be met by ATC and a loan from local banks. Another item for comple-
tion is the provision of improved vacuum brakes on existing freight cars,
again required for operation of the heavier trains proposed. Local costs
are to be met by ATC, and foreign costs by CCCE.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
10.       New locomotive and car purchases include 10 main line 1,800 HP
locomotives, and 10 passenger coaches, plus appropriate spare parts. Of the
10 main line locomotives, five are intended to replace seven 1,350 HP units
which are now 23 years old and in process of being scrapped as spare parts can
cannot be obtained; the other five are partly to cater for increase traffic
over 1974-78 (about 600,000 tons excluding manganese ore), and partly to
enable some of the older (18 years) 1,100 HP BB locomotives to be relegated
to shunting and local working duties, thus avoiding purchase of new larger
shunting units to serve the increasing traffic and heavier trains. Allowance
has also been made for improvement in availability of the existing fleet of
main-line locomotives from the average of 57 per cent achieved in 1974 to an
expected 76 per cent average in 1978 following improvement of workshop facili-
ties and re-organization of maintenance operations. Financing for the locomo-
tives and coaches has been agreed with CCCE.
E.   Realignment
11.       This major item is intended to replace and improve the existing sec-
tion of railway through the Mayombe mountain range between Holle and Loubomo
which is badly graded and aligned, and where the track material and infrastruc-
ture are in poor condition. Between Holle and Fourastie (about 18 km), minor
improvements will be carried out adjacent ot the existing route, but from
Fourastie to Loubomo (about 88 km), a complete new alignment will be construct-
ed. Due to the steep terrain and the narrow valleys towards the mountain
summit ridge, it is not possible to develop a completely surface line, and a
4.5 km summit tunnel is necessary. The new line will provide:
(i) a maximum grade of 1.5% (compensated for curvature) in the
import or Up direction, and 1 per cent in the export or Down
direction, against 2.2% and 1.6% (uncompensated) respectively
on the existing line;
(ii) 300 m radius minimum curvature, with transition curves, against
100 m nominal and 75-80 m actual;
(iii)  a stronger track, 46 kg/m rail instead of 36 kg/m., better
sleepers, and a full width ballast section of well graded and
good quality stone, against a narrow and inadequate section of
poor quality material; and
(iv) a roadbed 5.5 m wide plus side drains, against 3-4 m without
adequate side drainage.
Five new crossing stations will provide improved facilities to cross long
trains (main loop lengths of 900 m extendable to 1,400 m, against 500-800 m.)
The summit and other minor tunnels will be adequately lined, lit, drained,
and ventilated; the new bridges will be built to modern load and design
standards (the existing structures are in poor condition, and would require



ANNEX 6
Page 4
reconstruction if retained). Overall, train loads for large locomotives in
the export or Down direction could be increased from 1,000 net tons to 1,500
net tons, while the annual freight traffic capacity will become about 12
million tons (with possibility of further expansion) against about 5 million
tons for the existing line. The final engineering and detailed estimates
have been prepared by consultants Tecsult.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Project Financing
1.        The project comprises the ATC Investment Plan for 1974-78.  A break-
down of the various items included in the plan and their costs are given in
Table 9A (investment plan excluding the CFCO realignment) and Table 9B (the
CFCO realignment). The total cost of the project net of taxes is CFAF 52.59
billion (including physical and price contingencies), of which the CFCO
realignment accounts for CFAF 33.48 billion.
CFCO Realignment
2.        The financing plan for the CFCO realignment was accepted at a meeting
of co-donors held in Brussels on December 17-18, 1975. Details of this finan-
cing plan are given in Table 1 to this Annex. The co-donors have reached
agreement on terms assuring financing of the realignment. Finalization of
these agreements, or assurances satisfactory to the Bank that financing will
otherwise be forthcoming, will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Loan. Cost estimates are reasonably reliable, as bids have been received and
evaluated for the main civil works contract which represents about 80% of
the total costs of the realignment. The contract is expected to be awarded
to the low bidder in April 1976; civil works will start by about June 1976,
and are scheduled to be completed in about 31 months. Because some co-donors
have been unable to agree to unqualified joint financing, the main civil works
contract, as well as some of the other items included in the realignment, are
subject to parallel financing as discussed below.
3.        The main civil works have been divided into three parts to accoumo-
date the wishes of those donors wanting parallel financing. The first and
main part includes earthworks, structures, and laboratory testing which
will be financed jointly by the Bank, FED, FAC, CCCE and the Government.
Since the Government's contribution represents about 13% of the total cost
of this contract and since the contractor is requesting that 35% of the pay-
ments be made in local currency, the donors have agreed to finance the remain-
ing local costs. Disbursements under this contract will be in proportion to
the contributions of individual donors as follows: Bank 43%, FED 24%, FAC 15%,
CCCE 5%, Government 13%. The second component of the civil works comprising
the construction of tunnels and the supply and installation of tunnel ventilation,
will be financed entirely by a group comprising KDF, SFD and BADEA. The third
component consists of the supply and placing of ballast together with the track
laying, and will be financed by ADB (56%) and the Government (44%).



ANNEX 8
Page 2
4.        Other works and contracts included in the realignment will be
financed as follows:
(a) Supply and treatment of timber ties: Started in 1975, this
item is being financed by CIDA and the Government.
(b) Supply of rails: Bids for the rails will be called in 1976
as a single order for both sections Holl4-Fourastig-Loubomo,
on the basis of a loan from ADB.
(c)  Supply of rail fastenings:  This item will be jointly finan-
ced by the Bank, FED, FAC, CCCE and the Government in the same
proportions as for the earthworks, structures, and laboratory
testing (para. 3 above).
(d) Supply of turnouts: As the turnouts will be procured from a
French supplier for standardization reasons, CCCE will finance
this item.
(e) Signalling: Procurement for this item will be included in a
larger order already partly financed by CCCE.
(f) Telecommmunications: The Government and ADB will jointly fi-
nance the supply and installation of this equipment.
(g) Station buildings and housing: The KDF/SFD/BADEA group will
finance the foreign cost component, and the Government the
local cost component.
(h) Access roads: The roads were built in 1975 using CIDA and
Government funds.
(i) Technical supervision: As the consultants (Tecsult, Canada)
who carried out the feasibility study and detailed engineering
of the realignment have been retained to supervise the con-
struction works, this item is being financed by CIDA and the
Government
Cost estimates for the items listed above are based on recent contracts and
quotations.
5.        As the contract for the main civil works calls for advances to the
contractor for mobilization (20% of the contract amount) and materials and
equipment (up to 20% of the contract amount), and as some of the funds of the
donors (including the Bank) might not be available at the time these advances
are to be paid, BEAC has agreed to arrange for a loan to ATC of up to CFAF 2.0
billion for the first six months of the contract to meet any temporary finan-
cing shortfall.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
Investment Plan Excluding CFCO Realignment
6.        The cost of the items in the investment plan (excluding the CFCO
realignment) is estimated at CFAF 19.11 billion including price and physical
contingencies. The items shown for 1974 have already been carried out, and
those for 1975 have been or are being implemented. Much of the financing
has already been secured. The receipt of assurances satisfactory to the Bank
from donors whose contributions have been agreed upon in principle but not yet
secured, will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan. Exclu-
ding the contributions of the Government, ATC and the Bank, these assurances
would be required for about 25% of the total estimated cost of all items ex-
cluding the realignment. The financing plan for these items is shown in Table 2
of this Annex.
7.        An amount of US$ 3.8 million from the proposed Bank Loan will be
applied to financing ATC's technical assistance and training requirements.
Although some of the technical assistants will be working in ATC's operating
divisions, the complete amount is shown under the main heading of ATC Head-
quarters. All the other items in the investment plan, excluding the realign-
ment, will be procured in accordance with the individual procedures of the
co-donors involved. The donors have no objection to Bank supervision missions
checking on the implementation of these items to ensure the coordination and
quality of the entire investment plan.

ATC Traffic Projections
A.   Timber Traffic
1.        The ATC timber traffic forecast must be seen in the context of the
overall market for tropical timber, the position of West Africa in this market,
and finally, the position of the Northern Congo and Southwestern Cameroon
regions and the CAR in the West African scene.
2.        Production of tropical hardwood decreased in 1974  and in 1975; how-
ever, this phenomenon reflected the world-wide economic recession, and is not
representative of the long-term trend. During the period 1962-73, imports of
tropical hardwoods grew world-wide at about 12% per annum. In Europe, the
major market for African timber, the growth rate was lower, averaging about 6%
per annum. However, there is considerable evidence that the European demand
was increasing rapidly throughout the period as shown by the average annual
growth rates of 3.5% in 1962-68, and 8% in 1968-73.
3.        West African timber exports did not keep pace with this growing
European demand. The annual increase in shipments averaged only 4% through-
out the 1962-73 period, and lagged well behind the rapid expansion in con-
sumption noted in the second half of the period. The main reason was a
restricted supply of accessible timber in certain countries in the region
as follows:
(a) Nigerian exports have been progressively diverted to growing
local demands.
(b) Ghana's output of timber has been controlled by the Govern-
ment on a relatively low-yielding cutting cycle in order
to conserve long-term timber supplies.
(c) Congo's timber exports grew rapidly during the early 1960's,
reflecting the exploitation of accessible coastal areas.
As these sources became depleted and timber development
depended on a limited road infrastructure further inland,
exports stagnated during the period 1964-68. In 1968,
Congo stopped allocating forest concessions in the South,
and held up allocations in the North pending the completion
of forest inventories. Log output declined significantly
as a consequence of this action.
(d) Gabon's accessible coastal forests have been largely al-
located and logged in recent years, and interior resources
lacked the transport infrastructure to permit large-scale
operations.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
However, those countries which chose to take advantage of the growing demand
and had an appropriate transport infrastructure did very well, indicating
that West African hardwoods were competitive in the European market. For
example, between 1962-73 Ivory Coast exports increased about 10% annually
from 1.3 to 4.1 million tons, exports from Cameroon increased even faster
from 0.2 to 0.9 million tons, and Liberian traffic flourished similarly.
4.        Over the next 5 to 10 years, world demand for tropical hardwoods
is expected to grow because of the continued severe shortage of quality
hardwood in the temperate zones. Projections for the major European market
for West African timber call for a 3.5-4.5% per annum increase between the
mid-1970's and 1985, as compared with 6% in the previous decade. Demand in
the United States, of less importance as a West Africa market, is expected
to increase at 6.5% per annum as compared with 10-15% in the past.
5.        Africa's high value timber is traditionally preferred in the
European market to that of other producers, and is demonstrably competitive
in price since the associate members of the EEC can benefit from preferential
trading conditions there. However, production in the Ivory Coast has peaked,
and for reasons outlined in para. 3 above, little additional capacity can
be expected from Ghana and Nigeria. The largest forest reserves are therefore
in the central areas of Zaire, northern Congo, eastern Gabon, southeastern
Cameroon, and southwestern CAR. Among these countries, Congo is the first in
West Africa to pass legislation and establish conditions for introducing large-
scale efficient processing industries. Measures to re-open timber allocation
procedures were started in 1974 with the issuance of invitations for bids from
concessionaires covering an area of one million ha in the north 1/. While
planning in Cameroon and CAR has not been undertaken in such detail, forestry
concessions are in the process of being let. Further, because of their liberal
forest policies and substantial reserves, these two countries have recently
-been attracting the attention of logging companies that are running out of
resources in the Ivory Coast and Nigeria, and if an adequate tranpsort infra-
structure could be assured, output could be increased substantially and rela-
tively quickly. It is therefore likely that timber traffic growth in Cameroon
and CAR will be more rapid than in the Congo. Although Zaire has substantial
forestry potential, its forest areas are rather inaccessible, and development
is hampered by lack of policy planning and of adequate transport facilities.
Hence, while the available resources are certainly sufficient to generate a
rapid growth in output, there is considerable doubt that the full potential
will be reached.
6.        In absolute terms, the major European market for West African
hardwoods shoild offer a total import potential for hardwoods of about 3
25 million m (roundwood equivalent) by 1985, as against 15.3 million m
1/   Although the results of these invitaions were disappointing, they are
expected to improve (a) once the prospective logging companies know that
the realignment project is underway and that ATC will have sufficient
capacity to carry the increased production, and (b) as the world timber
market starts to recover from the slump period.

0.6 - 3.0                       0.1
14.4 -18.5                       9.8
7.        The production constraints noted in the preceding paragraphs are
expected to limit exports from the Western group of African countries as a
whole to current levels, representing less than 30% of the anticipated
European demand. Even under the most optimistic production estimates, the
Central African group will produce only the equivalent of 60% of the balance
of the European requirements, and more likely, only 50% (assuming the lower
production range level for Zaire). Thus, in the context of the European
market where African timber enjoys the advantages of proximity and prefer-
ence, the major constraint would appear to be production capacity rather
than sales potential, and the above export projections appear reasonable.
8.        For those countries in the ATC service area (Cameroon, CAR, Gabon,
and Congo), the projected increases in exports over 1972-85 range from 60% -
70% in the case of Gabon, to 200% - 300% for CAR. The approximate annual
rate of increase for each country may be summarized as follows:
Gabon                       3.5% - 4.25%
Congo                          5% - 6.5%
Cameroon                    7.5% - 9.4%
CAR                            9% - 11%
The highest growth patterns apply to the Cameroon and CAR, which provide a
combination of liberal forest policies and substantial reserves. These
growth levels approximate that applying to the Ivory Coast over the past
decade. Congo's somewhat lower rate of growth recognizes the stricter
controls over the forest reserves and the consequent slower rate of granting
concessions. Gabon's potential is somewhat lower pending the development of
transport arteries into the less accessible inland areas.
91        The estimated exports of the four countries in 1985, converted from
m of roundwood equivalents to tons, may be summarized as follows:



ANNEX 9
Page 4
(in million export tons)
Gabon                          2.4 - 2.6
Cameroon                       1.3 - 1.6
Congo                          1.1 - 1.3
CAR                           0.4 - 0.6
TOTAL:                   5.2 - 6.1
The range in each country reflects possible variations in the essential
elements of access (transport availability) and in prices, as a function
of market conditions and the predominant types of hardwood in the regions
developed.
10.       The ATC timber traffic estimates for 1985 assume that all Congo
and most CAR traffic will move via the ATC system. In the case of the Congo,
about 80% (950,000 tons) of the traffic will originate in the north (served
by the Congo, Oubangui, and Sangha rivers), and about 20% (250,000 tons) from
the southeren interior as a result of Government policy and the extent of
timber reserves. Cameroon traffic for the ATC (400,000 tons) has been esti-
mated as that which could most cheaply be moved from the producing areas over
the ATC system even if roads (currently non-existent) were constructed in the
region to provide access to the Cameroon transport infrastructure (see "eco-
nomic watershed" in Annex 10). Gabonese timber traffic in 1985 has been
completely discounted, on the grounds that al such traffic would be diverted
to the Transgabonese railway upon its completion at that time. Thus, the
1985 ATC timber traffic would be as follows:
(in million of tons)
Cameroon                            0.4
CAR                                 0.4
Congo                               1.2
Gabon                               0.0
Total:                         2.0
The projections assume that the present slump in the world timber traffic will
end in 1977, with timber traffic fully recovering in 1978. Timber traffic from
Gabon and southeastern Congo is then assumed to stabilize, with Gabonese timber
being diverted to the Transgabon Railway upon its estimated completion in 1985.
Timber traffic from CAR is assumed to continue growing through 1985 at an aver-
age of 12% per annum (from 182,000 tons in 1978 to 400,000 tons in 1985), and
traffic from southeastern Cameroon at 15% per annum (from 146,000 to 400,000
tons). Given the possible development of alternative evacuation routes and the
uncertainties of projecting market conditions that far in the future, no further
growth is assumed for CAR and Cameroon beyond 1985. The growth of timber traffic
from northern Congo is projected to be rapid until 1985 (from 182,000 tons in
1978 to 950,000 tons in 1985), and then to slow to about 2.5% per annum through
1995.



ANNEX 9

General Cargo
11.       General cargo traffic on the CFCO railway declined over 1969-74
from 634,000 tons to 516,000 tons (see Table 3 of the main report). This
was partly due to a gradual reduction in Chad and CAR traffic over the ATC
system in this period, stemming from a stagnation of economic development
and, in the case of Chad, from some diversion of traffic to trans-Cameroon
routes.
12.       The assessment of Congo's present economic position and growth
prospects leads to a GDP projected growth rate of over 5.0 percent per annum
in constant terms, with related growth rates of 6.0 percent for exports and
7.0% for imports. These projections, and the structure of exports and imports,
in turn suggest, under the assumption of no transport constraint, an overall
growth rate of 5.0% for general cargo going down the line to Brazzaville, and
of 7.0% for general cargo going up the line to Pointe Noire. While traffic
might be expected to grow at a slightly faster rate than GDP, a more conser-
vative approach has been taken to compensate for the decline or stagnation in
that proportion of traffic originating or terminating in CAR and Chad.
Bulk Oil Products
13.       The growth of bulk oil traffic over recent years is shown in Table 3
of the main report. From 1975 on, POL traffic is assumed to increase at 7.5%
per year, based on estimates of overall national growth, past trends, and the
present level of activity in the oil sector.
Manganese Ore
14.       Manganese ore traffic from the Moanda mine in Gabon is predictable
to a considerable extent on the basis of planned production. From the 2.0
million ton level in 1974, production will increase to 2.3 million tons in
1975 and 2.6 million tons by 1976, and is expected to maintain this volume
until 1980. Far less certain is the ability of the Transgabon railway now
being built from Libreville to handle, among other goods, that portion of the
planned output of the Moanda mine which is expected during the 1980's to
exceed the capacity of the cableway linking the mine with the Congo railhead
at Mbinda. The latest available information indicates that the Transgabon
railway will not be fully operational until 1985 at the earliest. It has
therefore been assumed that the CFCO system will continue to handle annually
about 2.6 million tons of ore up to and including 1985. After 1985, the CFCO
would still be able to handle the 2 million tons of ore which it is committed
to carry under an inter-governmental agreement between Gabon and Congo concern-
ing the flow of ore traffic beyond the year 2000. However, the new Transgabon
line would be capable of handling the entire production of Moanda ore at a cost
at least equal to and possibly lower than that of the CFCO. Since one of the
objectives of the economic analysis of the project is to ensure that the pro-
posed realignment would not duplicate other investments in the Central African
region, it has been assumed for analytical purposes, that all Moanda ore would
be evacuated over the Transgabon railway commencing in 1986.



ANNEX 9

Consolidated Traffic Forecast over the )Fourastie-Loubomo Section and Regional
Country Participation
15.       The consolidated forecast of traffic relevant to the realignment
project (Fourastie-Loubomo section of the CFCO) is presented in Table 1 of
this Annex, and of traffic over the various sections of the ATC system in
Table 3 of the main report. It should be noted that an important part of this
traffic is to serve transport needs of neighboring countries. Thus, in 1978
Congo traffic will account for only 23% of the total tonnage carried by the,
CFCO over the Fourastie-Loubomo section, while Gabon will account for 62%,
CAR for 10%, Cameroon for 3%, and Chad for 2%. In 1985, because of substan-
tial increase in its timber production, Congo's participation in the traffic
will increase to 40%, and the percentages for Gabon, CAR, Cameroon and Chad
will be 42%, 10%, 6% and 1% respectively. In 1995, Congo participation in
the traffic would jump to 72% as a result of the continued increase in timber
production and the assumed diversion of manganese to Gabon railway; during
that year, Gabon would account for only 1% of the CFCO traffic, while CAR,
Cameroon and Chad would increase their share to 16%, 9% and 2% respectively.

ANNEX 10

CONGO
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Alternatives to ATC Timber Evacuation Routes
A.  General
1.        ATC presently has an almost total monopoly for transport of timber
from the areas which it serves. The Congo itself, as well as southern Gabon
and forestry blocs 5, 6, and 11 in southeastern Cameroon (see Maps 1 and 2
attached to this Annex), depends entirely on ATC because there is no competing
infrastructure; only CAR has a limited option to evacuate through Cameroon,
but then at costs that are generally prohibitive. This pattern of evacuation
is expected to continue at least until 1985, at which time Cameroon and CAR
may open up the areas presently under ATC's exclusive influence, and Gabon is
expected to have the railway extended to Franceville. Also by 1985, capacity
of the Cameroon railway (Regifercam) and of the port of Douala will probably
be increased, and existing bottlenecks therefore removed.
B. Evacuation from Cameroon
2.        Provided the above-mentioned investments in Cameroon are made,
timber from Moloundou could move on two possible routes: (a) by road through
Yokadouma or Lomie to the Belabo railhead (about 630 km), and from there on
Regifercam to Douala (600 km); or (b) by road via Sangmelia to Mbalmayo (650 km),
and then by rail to Douala (300 km) (see details in Table 1 of this Annex). In
terms of shipping costs, however, either of these routes would be less accep-
table than ATC for the entire bloc 6, which constitutes the bulk of the timber
to be carried by ATC; similarly, most of the timber in blocs 5 and 11, and in
the southeastern corner of the Yokadouina reserve (blocs 1, 2, and 3) could be
evacuated at considerable cost advantage through Pointe Noire. Furthermore,
floated timber (which contributes more than half the production of southeastern
Cameroon) could be best exploited if sent through the Congo (Tables 2 and 3).
On account of these considerations, all timber from southern Cameroon has been
retained for ATC.
C. Evacuation from CAR
3.        As an alternative to ATC transport, CAR timber could potentially be
evacuated from the Oubangui/Lobaye or Upper Sangha areas through an improved
road system leading to Berberati, and from there to Belabo for loading on the
railway to Douala (Table 4). (Relevant distances are: Bangui-Belabo, about
800 km; Salo-Belabo, about 590 km.) Small volumes of timber (sawn wood) presently
use this route. However, as in the case of timber from southeastern Cameroon,
ATC will remain highly competitive after execution of Uts 1974-78 investment plan
and long-term program, even on completion of possible infrastructure improvements
in Cameroon.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
4.        The cost advantages of tran8port on ATC are greatest for CAR's
forestry blocs 1-5 and most of 7, and only the northern part of 7, plus 6 and 8,
are approaching the future isocost evacuation line. Floated timber from all the
blocs, representing about half the projected CAR export tonnage, cannot be
economically exploited unless shipped through Pointe Noire. Also, the only
products that could be shipped through Cameroon are logs unsuited for floating
and processed timber, but this would result in considerably reduced profits
(Tables 2 and 3). In view of these considerations, all timber from forestry
blocs 1-5, 9-13, and two-thirds of 7, has been assigned to ATC; forestry blocs
6,8, and one-third of 7, are counted as using the Cameroon route.
D. Evacuation through Zaire
5.        It is considered highly improbable that significant volumes of timber
originating in ATC's zone of influence could be evacuated through Zaire. Two
principal factors lead to this conclusion:
(a) Cameroon, CAR, Gabon and Congo are economically associated in the
West African Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC), while Zaire lies out-
side this group. Consequently, administrative and physical delays in
movement of traffic by the integrated ATC system would probably be less
than if transfers had to be effected between ATC and the Zaire transport
system.
(b) The Bank-financed Kinshasa-Matadi railway improvement has a short
economic horizon to 1980, and there is not likely to be spare capacity
at the port of Matadi much beyond that date. Consequently, to handle
any additional traffic from the Congo in the period beyond 1980 when
the main benefits from the ATC investment program are expected to materi-
alize, would require either expansion of Matadi or evacuation via the
proposed new port at Banana. The latter, however, is not expected to be-
come operational for inland traffic until the late 1980's at the ear-
liest, as the initial port development will consist of facilities to
serve the needs of industrial development in the Banana area only.
Thus, for the intervening period, investments at Matadi would be re-
quired to avoid severe constraints on evacuation of Congo timber; however,
such facilities at Matadi would not remain in operation once the Banana
facilities become available. The economic benefits would, therefore, be
obtained for only a very short period, and it is a priori highly un-
likely that combined Matadi-Banana port and Kinshasa-Natadi-Banana rail-
way investments required to handle Congo traffic would be as cost-
beneficial as the proposed ATC program.
E. Evacuation through Gabon
6.        Assuming that the railway will be extended to Franceville by 1981,
Gabonese timber which presently relies on ATC will probably be diverted to a
Gabonese port. By contrast, timber from southern Congo would be retained for
Pointe Noire because of the advantages in transport costs.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
Organization of Analysis
1.        The proposed project covers the ATC investment plan for the period
1974-78, which includes investments in the CFCO railways, the port of Pointe
Noire, and river ports and services. The critical component of the project,
accounting for 62% of the ATC program, is the CFCO railway section between
Fourastie and Loubomo, where the line has reached capacity and is in very poor
and dangerous condition. The economic analysis therefore focussed on eva-
luating various investment alternatives to improve the condition of this sec-
tion. Once the optimal solution was found (realignment of the section), the
analysis was broadened to include the whole ATC program, including the realign-
ment and the complementary investments in the railway, ports and river services.
2.        The economic analysis required preparation of a forecast of trans-
port demand through the critical railway section and through the rest of the
ATC system. This forecast is presented separately in Annex 9 and in Table 3
of the main report.
3.        The effect of potential changes in critical variables with respect
to estimated values was tested through a sensitivity analysis applied to traf-
fic forecasts, railway capacity, and criteria for evaluation of benefits.
Changes in investment costs were not analyzed, however, because bids for the
main civil works contract (representing 82% of the total realignment costs)
have already been received and evaluated. Original cost estimates for the
rest of the ATC program were reviewed in the light of bidding costs for the
realignment.
4.        All cost and benefit streams are in 1974 constant prices, net of
taxes. The analysis assumes start of investments in 1976, and considers the
stream of costs and benefits up to year 2000.
PART I: ANALYSIS OF FOURASTIE-LOUBOMO ALTERNATIVES
Investment Alternatives
5.        Four alternatives were considered to approach the current critical
problem on the Fourastie-Loubomo section:
(a)  the "Proposed Solution", consisting of replacing the
existing section by construction of new realigned
section, thereby reducing maintenance and operating
costs and increasing line capacity;



ANNEX 11
Page 2
(b)  the "Reference Case", consisting of making the minimum
investments necessary to avoid further deterioration of the
section, and of accepting frustration of future traffic due
to limited line capacity;
(c)  the "Line Improvement Solution", involving repairs and
improvement of the existing section to maintain services
and relieve congestion to a limited extent; and
(d)  the "Reference Case plus Road", consisting of the above
Reference Case plus the construction of a road between
Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, to which potentially
frustrated railway traffic could be diverted.
The Proposed Solution (realignment) was tested against the three other
alternatives.
Proposed Solution vs. Reference Case
6.   This case is the closest equivalent to comparing the Proposed Solution
with the "do nothing" solution.  However, since failure of the Fourastie-
Loubomo section would be imminent if no action is taken,and the result of
the closure would be intolerable, a Reference Case consisting of the minimum
investment necessary to retain the present condition was devised as a proxy
to the "do nothing" solution. Investments under the Reference Case comprise
repairs to the Bamba tunnel and bridges (CFAF 1.60 billion), and upgrading
of the signalling and telecommunications systems (CFAF 0.30 billion).
7.        The economic evaluation of this case considers as costs the net
economicinvestment costs of the Proposed Solution minus those of the Refer-
ence Case, amounting to CFAF 19.76 billion (CFAF 21.66 billion - CFAF 1.90
billion). The annual costs would be as follows:
in CFAF billion at 1974 prices
1976                           5.88
1977                           6.41
1978                           5.26
1979                           2.21
8.        The benefits to be derived from the Proposed Solution are two-fold:
(a) savings in railway operating costs due to improved line characteristics



ANNEX 11
Page 3
and operating conditions (see Table 1) 1/, and (b) avoidance of traffic frus-
tration which would have occurred in the Reference Case.
9.        The quantification of benefits from frustrated traffic uses the
traffic forecast given in Annex 9. Traffic demand exceeding the capacity
of the railway will be frustrated because there is no alternative means of
transport. Because of the normally high value of general cargo, and the
obligation of CFCO to give priority to manganese traffic, it has been assumed
that all frustrated traffic will be timber (the largest traffic growth assumed
in the forecast) emanating from south and north Congo, the Central African
Republic (CAR), and southeastern Cameroon. For the sake of adopting a conser-
vative assumption regarding feasibility of the Proposed Solution, two other
large traffic components -- Gabonese manganese ore, as well as timber -- are
assumed to be diverted from the CFCO to the Transgabon Railway upon completion
of the latter, expected in 1985(see Annex 9, para. 14). The benefits to
COMILOG from the Proposed Solution compared to the Reference Case (that is,
savings in fuel, personnel, rolling stock and locomotives, and maintenance)
are relatively small -- estimated at a maximum of CFAF 44 million for a traf-
fic of 2.6 million tons 2/ -- and are not considered in the economic analysis.
Frustrated timber is evaluated as the value-added loss to the regional economy,
and is quantified as 50% of the profit (net of tax) derived from the timber
produced plus taxes levied by the countries involved. Attachment I to this
Annex presents basic data about production and transport costs, f.o.b. prices,
the relative importance of various types of wood, and tax rates applied in
Cameroon, CAR and Congo; this shows that the average value added for timber is

10.       The amount of frustrated traffic, given the forecast traffic demand,
depends on the capacity of the line and on train requirements resulting from
technical characteristics and from a decision on traffic priorities. A capa-
city of 13.55 train paths per day per direction 1/ has been estimated for the
Reference Case from mid-1979 onwards, on the basis of an efficiency factor of
0.65, a peak traffic factor of 0.9, and an average speed of 30 km/h (plus the
necessary time for crossing and signalling) for the critical segment of the
Fourastie-Loubomo section (Les Bandas-Moukonda). This capacity implies an
improvement over the present daily capacity of 11.75 train paths per direction,
and would be difficult to reach, even with increased technical assistance.
Assuming that the improvement is gradual, capacity in 1978 (once work under
the Reference Case would have been completed) would be only 12.00 train paths
per day per direction. However, during execution of the repairs to the existing
line under the Reference Case, the line capacity would be 10.75 train paths/
day/direction in 1976, and is assumed to increase to 11.00 in 1977.
I1.       The capacity of the line in the Proposed Solution is estimated at
15.95 train paths per day per direction based on an average speed of 40 km/h
for the critical section on the new alignment, and an efficiency factor of
0.77. The efficiency is assumed to increase following the realignment because
of improved performance resulting from intensive training, better train control
by dispatchers, safer train operations due to signalling improvements, and
reduced requirements of track maintenance.
12.       The number of freight trains required to carry the forecast traffic
is calculated as follows: (a) converting annual traffic forecast to train
requirements by dividing by the average net load of the appropriate train
type; (b) assuming timber, manganese,and POL trains return empty, and adjust-
ing the number of empty trains for the irregular flow of traffic up and down
the line; and (c) assuming that one service train and one local train per day/
direction are required, and that the two passenger trains currently in service
will be maintained as priority services.
13.       The comparison of line capacity with train requirements yields the
amount of traffic frustration shown in Table 2. The corresponding benefit
stream for the frustrated traffic, together with the operating costs savings
and the net investment costs are shown in Table 3. The rate of return obtained
for the Proposed Solution was 18%.
14.       Because the rate of return depends greatly on the magnitude of traffic
frustration, a sensitivity analysis was conducted adopting alternative assump-
tions regarding operating efficiency and train requirements. Three alternative
reference cases were thus derived. Under Alternative Reference Case A, it was
assumed that operating efficiency would improve immediately (11.00 train paths/
direction/day during 1976-1977, and 13.55 from 1978 onwards), and that only one
1/   The time required for one train path on any given section of the line
depends on: length of the section, train speed, time required for
stopping and acceleration, and time required for signalling procedures.

passenger train would be run per day. Timber traffic would substitute for the
eliminated passenger train, but some 25% of total passenger traffic would be
diverted to air transport at a higher cost. Under Alternative Reference Case
B, it was also assumed that only one passenger train would be run per day, but
the current level of operating efficiency was retained. In Alternative Refer-
ence Case C, current level of operating efficiency and current passenger ser-
vice priority (two trains daily) were adopted. The rates of return obtained
for the Proposed Solution compared with the above alternative reference cases
were 10% in Case A, 19% in Case B, and 34% in Case C.1/.
15.       As explained in para. 9, quantification of benefits from frustrated
traffic was done on a regional basis, that is, considering the value added
loss to the Congo, Cameroon, and CAR of frustrated timber traffic. The ana-
lysis assumed further that all available manganese traffic would be carried
by the CFCO. An alternative evaluation of frustrated traffic was conducted
to determine the "national" rather than the "regional" economic return of the
Proposed Solution. In the national analysis, it was assumed that the CFCO
would carry a minimum of 2.0 million tons of manganese through 1985 (according to
the agreement between Congo and Gabon), and would only carry more than this
tonnage if capacity were available on the railway after all timber traffic
demand had been met, because CFCO net revenues from Cameroon and CAR
timber are substantially higher than from manganese; then, benefits on frus-
trated traffic were computed as net revenue loss to the railway from manganese
and Cameroon and CAR timber, and as value added loss for Congo timber (see
Table 4). In the case of manganese, the revenue loss includes, in addition
to the normal tariff, the bonus of CFAF 300 per ton which COMILOG pays to
the CFCO for all manganese carried over and above 2.2 million tons per year.
The rates of return obtained were 9% for the Proposed Solution vs. the Refe-
rence Case, and 7%, 12%, and 15% for the Proposed Solution compared to Alter-
native Cases A, B and C, respectively.
16.       As the project is to be financed on concessionary terms by grants
and soft loans that will be available because of the regional importance of
the project but would not be available for other projects in the Congo, a
further variation of the economic analysis evaluated the "national" economic
return of shadow pricing the investment costs according to the grant component
of the available financing. Under this hypothesis, the rate of return for the
Proposed Solution vs. the Reference Case and Alternative Reference Cases A, B,
and C was 12%, 10%, 15% and 19%, respectively. The assumption that Cameroon/
CAR timber could be shipped using a route other than the CFCO from 1985 was
also tested in the "regional" evaluation, and yielded rates of return for the
1/   Insofar as the economic analysis is based on a comparison of the Proposed
Solution with the Reference Case, and the major benefit to the Proposed
Solution is the avoidance of traffic frustration resulting from railway
capacity constraints in the Reference Case, the comparison of the Proposed
Solution with Alternative Reference Cases (differing in the amount of
traffic carried) serves at the same time as a proxy to a sensitivity ana-
lysis to potential changes in the traffic forecast.

Proposed Solution compared to the Reference Case and Alternative Reference
Cases A, B and C, of 13%, 7%, 16% and 32%, respectively (Table 5); in this
analysis, very similar results would be obtained from the national viewpoint,
because frustrated foreign traffic would only exist for a few years. As the
rate of return falls to a marginal value only under Alternative Reference
Case A (which is considered a highly hypothetical case), the conclusion to
be derived from this analysis is that the Proposed Solution is a clearly
better economic option than the Reference Case, and that it would be a prefer-
able option even if it were considered from a narrow national viewpoint only.
Proposed Solution vs. Line Improvement Case
17.       A second alternative to the Proposed Solution (realignment), after
the "do nothing" or Reference Case, is to improve the existing section between
Fourastie and Loubomo. This option includes major civil works as detailed
below; construction is assumed to be spread over four years to minimize dis-
ruption of traffic.
(in CFAF billion)

Total                          3.30    4.49    4.64    4.64
18.       During construction of the above improvements, capacity of the line
is estimated to be 10 train paths per day per direction. Following completion
of the improvements, a line capacity of 14.6 would take place on the assumption
that the efficiency factor on the line could be increased to 0.7 from the cur-
rent 0.6. A further assumption adopted in the analysis is that passenger ser-
vice would be limited to one train per day each way in order to maximize timber
traffic. Incremental costs and benefits of the Proposed Solution versus the
Line Improvement Case are presented in Table 6. The rate of return of the
Proposed Solution versus the Line Improvement Case under these conditions is
estimated at 20%, showing that the small additional investment (CFAF 4.6 bil-
lion) required to go from this proposed solution to the improvement solution is
fully justified. In addition, it should be noted that with the line improve-
ment case, there will be very little room for subsequent increases in capacity,
as (a) the distances between stations are already small, and (b) the technical
characteristics of the line will still cause a difficult operating situation
and limitations in efficiency. Any shortfall in productivity increases or
traffic growth higher than those anticipated in this analysis would therefore
result in substantial traffic frustration, and would correspondingly increase
the advantage of the proposed alternative over the improvement alternative.



ANNEX 11
Page 7
Proposed Solution vs. Reference Case plus Road
19.       The third alternative project to the Proposed Solution (realign-
ment) was a combinaton of the Reference Case plus the construction of a
road from Brazzaville to Pointe Noire. Parts of this route already exist
to varying standards of construction, but improvements, reconstruction or
construction would be required over most of its length in order to meet
freight traffic requirements. A variant to this rail/road combination,
consisting of the construction of a road section between Fourastie and
Loubomo only, was discarded a priori as this would be the most expensive
section to build (over a mountainous area), and because of the high trans-
shipment costs that would be involved at both terminal points.
20.       The analysis with the road assumed that three types of traffic
would divert from the railway to the road: (a) passenger traffic -- 50%
of total passenger transport demand would shift to road transport; (b)
general cargo -- 25% of total general cargo would move voluntarily to the
road transport; (c) general cargo -- additional cargo would be forced to
shift to road transport whenever total traffic demand (after discounting
voluntary diversion) exceeded railway capacity. This distribution of
traffic between the modes is based on comparative costs and service charac-
teristics. A higher diversion rate is considered unlikely at present in
view of the long-haul nature of most of the general cargo (transit traffic
of CAR and Chad, and import/export traffic of Brazzaville), and the
social requirement to maintain a minimum passenger service on the railway.
Because of transport capacity provided by the road, no traffic frustration
would take place in this case once the road is open.
21.       In the economic evaluation of the Proposed Solution versus the rail/
road combination, costs considered were the net investment costs (Proposed
Solution minus Reference Case costs and road construction costs), and the
reduction in transport costs for passengers diverting from the railway to the
road. Benefits for the Proposed Solution were the road maintenance costs
attributable to diverted railway traffic, operating cost savings on diverted
general cargo, railway operating cost savings for the non-diverted traffic,
and frustrated timber traffic during construction of the railway improvements
in the Reference Case.  A summary of the methodology used to calculate costs
and benefits is presented in Table 7.
22.       Road construction costs were estimated for the normal Reference
Case and for Alternative Reference Cases A, B and C (see para. 14) according
to the traffic generated to each alternative. In Alternative Reference Case A
under which traffic of about 100 trucks and buses per day would develop, cons-
truction costs of the road were estimated at CFAF 14.0 billion, net of taxes.
In Alternative Reference Case C, with some 400 heavy vehicles per day, con-
struction costs were estimated at CFAF 19.3 billion. For the normal Reference
Case and Alternative Reference Case B having an intermediate traffic between
that of Cases A and C, construction costs of CFAF 16.7 billion were assumed.



ANNEX 11
Page 8
23.       The cost and benefit streams of the Proposed Solution compared to
the Reference Case plus the road are shown in Table 8. It can be appreciated
that the net investment costs are relatively small (because of the high con-
struction costs of the road), and that they are largely offset by the benefits
accruing to the Proposed Solution due to frustrated traffic during the period
when improvements are carried out in the railway reference case. If the proj-
ect opening date is assumed to be in mid-1979, the rate of return for the
Proposed Solution would be 43% or 22%, depending on whether 100% or 80% of
road costs are considered. An alternative opening date of both the road and
the railway realignment in 1983 1/ yields a 15% rate of return or the Proposed
Solution if 80% of road construction costs were allocated to diverted railway
traffic (thus allowing for additional traffic to generate on the road), and a
27% return if the full road costs are considered.
24.       Using the same alternative reference cases described in para. 14,
the rate of return for the Proposed Solution compared to the combination of
the road plus Alternative Reference Cases A, B, or C was 9%, 17%, and infinite
respectively when 80% of road costs were considered, and 12%, 24%, and infinite
respectively, when full road costs were assumed. The analysis showed, there-
fore, that realignment of the Fourastie-Loubomo railway section is a better eco-
nomic decision than the combination of modest improvements in the railway and
construction of a road, mainly due to the high cost of road construction. It
should be noted that because the analysis with the road assumes no traffic
frustration (except during the repairs to the railway line while the road
is under construction), the national rate of return would be very similar to
the regional one, and therefore this conclusion is fully valid under both
viewpoints.
PART II: ANALYSIS OF TOTAL ATC INVESTMENT PROGRAM
25.       The ATC Investment Program for the period 1974-78 consists, in
addition to the proposed realignment of the railway, of other CFCO invest-
ments, as well as investments in river ports and services and in the Port
of Pointe Noire. The economic investment costs of the total ATC investment
program (net of takes and including physical contingencies) were derived
from Table 9 of the main report.
26.       The analysis of the total ATC program followed the same methodology
adopted to study the Fourastie-Loubomo section, that is, to compare costs and
benefits of the proposed investments with those of a reference case, and to
compute incremental costs and benefits resulting therefrom. The incremental
economic investment costs of the whole ATC program, compared to the appro-
priate reference case for investments in the CFCO (excluding realignment),
ports and river services, amount to CFAF 2.14 billion. Investments in the
CFCO and the Port of Pointe Noire in the proposed investment program are the
1/   Year when traffic frustration would start under Alternative Reference
Case A, the most unfavorable situation to the Proposed Solution when
compared to the Road plus Reference Case alternative.



ANNEX 11
Page 9
same as in the reference case, because they are necessary even to accommodate
the reference case traffic (a major part of these investments in fact have
been implemented or are underway) which is essential to the Congo (see Table 9
of this Annex). Incremental investments occur therefore only in river ports
and services. Disbursement of the incremental investment costs was assumed to
be as follows:
(in CFAF billion)
1975                             .32
1976                             -
1977                           1.11
1978                            .71
27.       The incremental investments in the ATC (other than the CFCO realign-
ment) were analyzed (a) as individual investments independent of the realignment
project, and (b) together with the realignment to obtain an incremental rate
of return of the whole ATC investment program. The benefits to be derived
from incremental investments in river ports and river transport are the opera-
ting cost savings achieved in provision of the services. Unit operating costs
were estimated for 1975, 1985, and 1995, and extrapolated for the other years
(see Table 10). In both (a) and (b) above, a sensitivity analysis was carried
out considering the Alternative Reference Cases A, B, and C adopted for the
study of the realignment, in order to test the effect of different railway
traffic levels on the feasibility of investments in river ports and services.
28.       The results obtained for the two situations (a) and (b) above, shown
below, reflect in (a) the traffic limitation imposed by the railway without
the realignment project, and in (b) the economic return obtained for the
realignment and the incremental investments in river ports and services.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Sensitivity Analysis of Financial Forecasts
1.        A sensitivity analysis of the financial forecasts was conducted to test
the impact of a possible decrease in ATC's cash generation and/or an increase
in the cost of capital investments on ATC's ability to: (a) finance its opera-
ting costs; (b) progressively restore its working capital and then maintain it
at an adequate level; (c) service its debt; and (d) finance its capital in-
vestments and renewals. The analysis was carried out assuming the combined
effect of a 20% decrease in gross operating revenue generated by the timber
traffic, a 10% increase in working expenditures, and a 10% increase in the
cost of capital investments excluding the CFCO realignment (the cost of which
is based on firm bid prices increased by physical and price contingencies).
2.        The sensitivity analysis reviews the same two periods considered in
the main financial analysis, namely, 1976-79 covering the construction period
of the CFCO realignment, and 1980-86 assuming full utilization of the realign-
ment. Table 1 of this Annex shows the yearly impact of the sensitivity assump-
tion on ATC's cash position, assuming ATC is granted the same external financial
support as in the main analysis (para. 6.10). Since it was agreed that ATC
would not have to provide any funds for the CFCO realignment during its con-
struction (in view of its financial situation and its contributions to the re-
mainder of the 1974-78 investment plan), the table does not show the cost of the
realignment nor its external financing; however, since ATC is committed to
service loans contracted for constructing the realignment, the calculations used
include the relevant debt service. The table on Page 2 su-marizes the sources

ANNEX 12

3.        The above table shows that under the sensitivity assumption, ATC would
generate enough funds to finance its working expenses and restore and maintain
its working capital during both periods considered. However, ATC would be short
about CFAF 9 billion out of the CFAF 20 billion required to finance its share
of the Investment Plan and its debt service in 1976-79, and about CFAF 37 billion
out of the CFAF 96 billion required to finance its investments and debt ser-
vice during 1980-86.
4.        Although the Government has agreed to compensate for any shortage of
funds of ATC for implementing the Investment Plan and/or servicing its debts
during 1976-80, it has been assumed that the Government would not provide
further funds to ATC beyond its already heavy commitments in financing the
Investment Plan and providing financial support to ATC during 1976-80. ATC
would, therefore, have to compensate any partial or total materialization of
the sensitivity analysis assumptions by increasing its tariffs above those
ass=zed for the main analysis and, in case the ceiling of such increases would
be attained, to have recourse to additional borrowing. Calculations showed
that ATC could overcome the maximum shortage of funds mentioned in para. 3
above by implementing the following measures: (a) increase tariffs by 15%
instead of the 0l forecasted in the main analysis for 1978; (b) borrow up to
CFAF 8 billion (US$35 million equivalent) in addition to the borrowing pro-
gram used in the main analysis for the Investment Plan; (c) increase tariffs
by 12% instead of 10% every two years through 1980-86; and (d) borrow up to
40% of its investments planned for 1980-86. The tariff increases mentioned
under (a) and (c) above would bring ATC's tariffs roughly in line with fore-
cast inflation. These tariff increases cannot well be exceeded as ATC has
already increased its rates by 75% between February 1973 and March 1976, and
the future increases will be borne mostly by the timber traffic which will
generate about one-third and one-half of ATC's forecast revenue in 1978 and
1986 respectively. The additional borrowing would either have to be on very
soft terms or include capitalization of interest.
5.        The table on Page 4 summarizes the cumulated projected tables of
ATC's sources and applications of funds for 1976-79 and 1980-86 under the
assumptions described in para. 4 above.

6.        ATC's balance sheet as of December 31, 1986 resulting from application
of the sensitivity-hypothesis and assumptions described in paras. 3 and 4 of
this Annex can be summarized as follows:
(in CFAF billion)
Current assets                             19
Current liabilities                         8
New fixed assets                          219
Loan capital                               52
Equity equivalent                         178
The above reflects an acceptable financial position characterized by : (a) a
balanced cash position; (b) satisfactory working capital coverage (para. 6.09
of the main report); and (c) a satisfactory 29/71 debt to equity position which
shows that ATC could comfortably face by 1987 the annual CFAF 3.5 billion increase
in its debt service which would result from the additional borrowing assumed in
paras. 3 and 4 above.



ANNEX 12
Page 5
7.        It can be concluded from the above that ATC could withstand the
effects of the sensitivity assumptions materializing, provided that tariffs
are increased and soft-term borrowing is available as required. For ATC, it
would result in: (a) a substantial increase in the long-term debt; and (b)
a delay in paying dividends to the Government. Any alleviation of the indi-
vidual components of the sensitivity assumption would ease ATC's financial
position as presented in para. 2.
