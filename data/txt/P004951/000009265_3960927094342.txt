SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on ALGERIA -
Desert Locust Control Project (Loan 3017-AL)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on
ALGERIA - Desert Locust Control Project (Loan 3017-AL)" prepared by the Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The Bank responded promptly to the emergency needs of Algeria to (a) control
expected massive locust invasions following their uncontrolled breeding in the mid-1980s,
and (b) build up capacity for future monitoring and control operations. The expected
invasions did not occur because of unforeseeable weather changes. Consequently 62
percent of the loan was cancelled. Monitoring and control capability was strengthened as
planned.
The PCR satisfactorily describes this unusual experience. No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
DESERT LOCUST CONTROL PROJECT
(Loan 3017-AL)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Desert Locust
Control Project, for which Loan 3017-AL in the amount of US$58.0 million was
approved on January 31, 1989. The Loan became effective on April 19, 1989 and
was closed on schedule on December 31, 1991. A total of US$36 million was
cancelled from the Loan on February 6, 1991. The remaining Loan amount of
US$22 million has been disbursed.
This PCR (Parts I and III) was prepared by the Middle East and North
Africa Regional Office and is based inter alia on information provided to the
completion mission of May 1992, on status reports prepared by the Borrower,
the Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, supervision reports, as well as
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda.
Part II was prepared by the National Institute for Plant Protection (INPV).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
DESERT LOCUST CONTROL PROJECT
(Loan 3017-AL)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.          Together with other countries in the region, Algeria was affected
by a major locust plague during 1987 and 1988 which led to the treatment of
about 2.2 million hectares. A new cycle of locust invasions was expected to
start in the Maghreb (including Algeria) in the fall of 1988 and to last at
least over the next two years, and possibly over the next eight to ten years.
The objectives of the project were to provide urgent assistance in support of
Algeria's national locust control program and to support the reinforcement of
comprehensive surveillance and warning systems to better monitor and predict
locust activity in the country.
Implementation Experience
2.            In Algeria, about 3 million ha were expected to require
treatment between 1989 and 1990. However, locust activity during this period
was minimal and treatments were reduced to an area of about 6,000 ha. This was
due to ecological and meteorological factors and to the energetic and
successful locust control efforts undertaken by the countries affected
(including Algeria) and the international community. Moreover, the locusts
did not reappear in 1991 and minimal spraying (1,600 ha) was carried out
during that year.   This situation led to sharp reductions in expenditures
under the Loan for pesticides and aircraft services, two major components of
the Loan. As a result, US$36 million of the Loan was cancelled as of February
6, 1991. Although requirements for the locust control campaigns were reduced
and the small technical assistance component was not used, prevention and
surveillance efforts as well as training of concerned staff were pursued and
prospection vehicles and meteorological equipment were purchased as originally
foreseen.
Results
3.          The project was prepared to help Algeria strengthen its capacity
to control locust swarms which were expected to reinvade the country between
1988 and 1990. The economic rate of return of the Government's locust control
program for the period, assuming that its implementation resulted in
protection of only 1.5% of total economic value of production, was calculated



- iv -
at appraisal to be of the order of 50%. However, partly as a result of the
successful anti-locust campaigns mounted by Algeria and other countries
between 1987 and 1988, there was minimal locust activity during the project
period and consequently little damage was inflicted to agriculture. Thus,
although the benefits of the project cannot be quantified as had been done at
appraisal, the project achieved its main objective which was to ensure that
Algeria would have the institutional capacity and effective means at its
disposal to (a) control any impending locust invasions and (b) predict locust
activity and movement thereby facilitating planning and implementation of
future control programs, both in situations of plague and recession.
Sustainability
4.            With the pesticides still in stock and equipment purchased under
the Loan or otherwise, the country will be well equipped to monitor locust
activity and control any small-scale locust invasions which may occur in the
future. During recession periods, the vehicles and equipment purchased under
the project for ground control of locusts would be used by INPV for its normal
plant protection activities and the meteorological stations would be used by
the ONM for any emergency operations requiring the support of meteorological
services (forest fires, floods, seismic tremors). All of this equipment is
being satisfactorily maintained by INPV and the ONM.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.            During recessional periods, Algeria can keep the locust
situation under control with the means it currently has at its disposal. If,
on the other hand, Algeria were to be invaded by a serious locust plague in
the future, it would once again need to have recourse to external financing to
cover the high costs of aircraft services and pesticides.   The speed with
which the project became effective clearly demonstrates that if the plague is
repeated the additional support can be mobilized rapidly. However, it is
clear that to bring about a lasting and effective control of the locust
plague, the prevention and control capabilities in all affected countries in
the region would need to be reinforced. The FAO is preparing an interregional
project which would aim at establishing adequate prevention and control
systems in the countries of the Sahel.

RVP Unit        Middle East and North Africa Region
Country     :  Algeria
Sector      :  Agriculture
2. Proiect Background
2.01        The desert locust is a serious pest to agriculture throughout the
Maghreb and the Sahel. Outbreaks of the species, which are cyclical in
nature, occur periodically and cause substantial damage to pasture lands,
forests and crops in the region. Given suitable environmental conditions and
uncontrolled breeding, plagues can develop quickly and last up to 10 years.
2.02        In August 1988, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which
is responsible within the United Nations system for monitoring the desert
locust situation, reported that a major plague of unprecedented proportions
was developing in the Sahel zone of Africa and that immediate actions on the
part of all affected countries were therefore urgently needed to control the
situation.
2.03        Desert locust populations started to build up in the Sahel in 1985
with the return of normal rainfall, and since then had been growing constantly
due to suitable climatic conditions, while shifting from their breeding areas
in the Sahel to invasion regions, mainly in the northern African countries of
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Major swarm populations invaded Algeria in
October-December 1987 and between February and July 1988, necessitating large
scale control operations covering a total of around 2.2 million ha. A new
cycle of locust invasions was expected beginning late September 1988 and to
last at least over the next two years, and possibly over the next eight to ten
years. On September 14, 1988, the Government of Algeria requested urgent Bank
support to assist in its locust control effort.   The Bank responded quickly
to the Government's request for assistance in the financing of its national
locust control program.

3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01        Project Objectives.  The project, consistent with coordinated
regional plans agreed with Tunisia and Morocco, was to provide urgent
assistance in support of Algeria's national locust control program. It would,
in addition, support the reinforcement of comprehensive surveillance and
warning systems to better monitor and predict locust activity in the country.
3.02        Project Description.   The project included the following
components: (a) three locust control campaigns for which pesticides and
aircraft services were to be provided over the period October 1988 - January
1990 over an estimated area of 6.5 million hectares; (b) strengthening
national locust control capabilities by reinforcing the existing stock of
equipment and vehicles to be used for ground control; (c) reinforcing
comprehensive surveillance and warning systems by (i) improving the
telecommunications, meteorological and information dissemination networks, and
(ii) providing suitable vehicles for locust reconnaissance and prospection
purposes; and (d) provision of limited technical assistance aimed at improving
pesticide application and locust prospection methods.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01        Since the project was designed to prepare for an impending and not
an actual emergency, it was not processed with the briefer procedures allowed
for emergency reconstruction loans. However, given the urgency of the
response required to prevent the potential destruction of agriculture, it was
processed very quickly. It was appraised in September 1988, within a month
from the time the FAO notified the Bank of the impending locust invasion, and
approved by the Board four months later on January 31, 1989.   The Loan
Agreement was signed on February 2, 1989 and became effective on April 19,
1989.
4.02        In order to ensure that project implementation would take place
with the required urgency, the project design was kept simple and
straightforward and included a minimum number of loan conditions mainly
relating to the environment which would be the main risk posed by the project.
Exceptional procurement procedures for pesticides and aircraft services were
allowed for the first locust campaign. A period of about two and a half years
from the date of Loan effectiveness was established for disbursement of loan
proceeds.
4.03        The Ministry of Agriculture's Plant Protection Institute (INPV)
was responsible for project execution. The three campaigns covered by the
project were conducted in close collaboration with the Central Command Post
(PCC) created at the INPV in 1988 to manage locust operations in the wilayate
during plague situations, the National Meteorological services (ONM)
responsible for the meteorological network, and the National Agency for the
Protection of the Environment (ANPE) responsible for monitoring the impact of
pesticide use on the environment.



-3-
5. Project Implementation
5.01        Project Processing and Start-up.  Due to the need for immediate
response to the expected locust invasions, the Loan was processed and made
effective very quickly (para. 4.01).
5.02        Procurement.  Procurement procedures were in accordance with Bank
guidelines. However, the Bank allowed exceptional procurement procedures for
the first locust campaign. Thus, for pesticides which had been advance
contracted for use in the first campaign, the Bank accepted directly
negotiated contracts between INPV and ASMIDAL (the pesticide formulation
plant). A total amount of about US$9 million equivalent was procured through
this method. These pesticides had been formulated in Algeria from raw
materials procured through LIB, using procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
For future requirements, ICB was required. However, due to the calm locust
situation, no further pesticides were purchased under the project and funds no
longer needed under the category were cancelled (para. 5.06). Also for the
first campaign, aircraft services totalling about US$3 million were contracted
directly with DTA (the agricultural services division of Air Algerie). For
later campaigns, DTA selected foreign aircraft services suppliers through
international shopping (total of about US$600,000). The majority of other
contracts for vehicles and equipment (telecommunications and meteorological)
was procured through ICB. Some minor items such as manual pumps, camping,
radio and computer equipment were financed under other sources. In addition,
the small technical assistance component was not used.
5.03        Project Costs and Disbursements.  The total project cost was
originally estimated at around US$112 million. At completion, the project
cost was actually US$77.3 million with local costs converted at the exchange
rate of lUS$= 9Dinar. This difference is due to the cancellation of US$36
million from the World Bank Loan on February 6, 1991 (para 5.06). The reduced
loan amount of US$22 million was fully disbursed.
5.04        Special Account.  The special account was only used to cover four
letters of credit. Since the letters of credit had been opened by the Banque
de l'Agriculture et du Ddveloppement Rural (BADR), the Algerian Development
Bank (BAD) transferred the administration of the special account to BADR which
then dealt directly with the central bank for disbursement operations. This
arrangement made it difficult for the BAD to administer and monitor the
operations of the special account. Due to these complications, there were
delays in making payments through the special account and it therefore was not
useful to the project.
Locust control operations.
5.05        1987-88 campaign.  During the 1987/88 locust plague, the central
command post (PCC) managed locust control activities at the provincial level.
The wilaya command posts (PCW) implemented surveillance and control operations
and mobilized all the necessary resources from the wilayate. The country was
divided into four intervention zones to which control efforts were dispatched



- 4 -
and moved as necessary depending on the locust invasion paths. Between
February and July 1988, an area of about 2.2 million ha was treated in Algeria
(of which 72% by air) with about 2.5 million liters of pesticides. Despite
the suddenness and size of the invasion, the Algerians were able to mobilize
the necessary resources and to organize locust operations very quickly.   The
locust control strategy implemented was very successful given that more than
70% of areas treated were south of the Saharan Atlas, i.e., the locusts were
killed before they reached the most productive area in the country further
north, causing some important damage to pasture lands, notably in the Sahara,
but mostly sparing agricultural crops. The successful locust campaigns
mounted by the Algerians in 1987/88 in close collaboration with other
countries were to a large extent responsible for reduced locust activity in
succeeding years. The Algerians maintained close liaison with the Moroccan
campaign (1.8 million ha were treated between October and December 1988), with
other countries in the region, and FAO.   Emergency assistance (about 3% of
the total expenditures of the campaigns) was provided to Algeria by a number
of donors mainly in the form of pesticides, aircraft hire, spray equipment,
vehicles and other items.
5.06        1988-91 Campaigns.  Following the locust control operations led by
Algeria and other North West African countries in the winter and spring of
1987/88, in the summer of 1988, the FAO reported that major locust swarms had
invaded East and West African countries and infested an area of about 18
million ha. Assuming the lack of effective locust control operations in the
countries of the Sahel and that climatic conditions would be favorable, the
Maghreb countries were expected to be reinvaded by swarms of locusts starting
in the fall of 1988. In Algeria, about 3 million ha were expected to require
treatment between 1989-90. However, locust activity was well below
expectations with treatments during those years limited to an area of about
6,000 ha. This was due to ecological factors which did not encourage locust
survival and reproduction (torrential rains in the summer of 1988 in the
Sahelian and East African countries) and to meteorological factors (wind
currents shifted and took the locusts towards the Atlantic). This was also
due to the energetic and successful locust control efforts undertaken by the
countries concerned and the international community since 1987. Moreover, the
locust situation remained calm in Algeria in 1990 despite favorable ecological
conditions in the areas of winter/spring reproduction (Central Sahara), and
minimal spraying was carried out in 1991. This situation led to sharp
reductions in expenditures under the Loan for pesticides and aircraft
services, two major components of the Loan for which 70% of the Loan had been
allocated. As a result, US$36 million of the Loan was cancelled as of
February 6, 1991.   Although requirements for the locust control campaigns
were reduced and the small technical assistance component was not used,
prevention and surveillance efforts as well as training of concerned staff
were pursued, and prospection vehicles and meteorological equipment were
purchased as originally foreseen. The Loan closed on schedule on December 31,
1991.
5.07        Environmental Impact and Compliance with Loan Covenants:  Given
the use of pesticides for locust control, safeguard measures to minimize any
potential negative impact on humans and the environment were identified during



- 5 -
appraisal and covenants were included in the Loan Agreement to ensure that
these were being satisfactorily enforced. An environmental specialist was
included in the first supervision mission which took place in May 1989.   Due
to the absence of the locusts during that period, he was not able to observe
pesticide spraying operations. However, he was satisfied that during the
previous campaigns, the Algerians had taken the necessary precautionary
measures to protect the environment.  He was also impressed by the serious and
concerted approach taken by the authorities to minimize the impact of locust
operations on ecologically-sensitive zones and confirmed the satisfaction of
the conditions of the Loan Agreement related to the environment (the
definition of ecologically sensitive zones and the proper disposal of
pesticide wastes as described below).
5.08        Environmental Action Plan and Definition of ecologically sensitive
zones. The environmental specialist reported that a working group headed by
the INPV and composed of senior representatives of the six ministries involved
had prepared an action plan to permanently evaluate the impact of pesticides
on man and the environment. The plan which has been in effect since the
beginning of the fall 1988 campaign, sets out the criteria for the selection
of locust insecticides, which were all approved by FAO for locust control.
Insecticides chosen were characterized by rapid contact action, greater
specificity towards insects, low rates of use, and short persistence which
results in rapid degradation on sprayed areas.   Products deemed to have
greater environmental impact would be restricted to the desert zones of the
Sahelian plateau. The National Agency for the Protection of the Environment
(ANPE) had prepared for INPV national and regional maps showing all
ecologically sensitive areas and a program to ensure that spraying impacts to
those areas would be limited to the fullest extent possible. Copies of the
maps had been distributed to all operational headquarters (PCC and PCWs). As
part of the action plan, a national program was set up to monitor the health
and exposure levels of pesticide operators who participated in the locust
campaigns and to train and educate personnel involved in locust operations.
Three missions were organized in different test zones between December 1988
and May 1989 and revealed that the pesticides used during the 1987/88 campaign
had not had any lasting adverse impact on humans or the environment.
5.09        Disposal of Pesticide Wastes/Used Pesticide Drums: Under the
action plan, used pesticide containers are quickly returned to the regional
pesticide depots where they are kept under locked and guarded conditions.
Drums are either sent to a metal reclamation factory to be destroyed/used for
metal recovery in which case they are first washed and then stacked, or they
are returned to the pesticide formulation facility to be refilled with
pesticides. All of these uses were judged acceptable. The mission visited
pesticide stores and handling depots and was satisfied with the storage
conditions and handling of pesticides and with the procedures for disposal of
pesticide wastes.
5.10        Even though pesticide spraying was minimal following the 1987/88
campaign, the Algerians continued to comply with environmental safeguards
contained in the Action Plan and were able to use the respite to train
person.el (including pilots and aerial application staff) involved in locust



- 6 -
operations. The strategy adopted by the Algerians of permanently monitoring
areas susceptible of invasion even during the recession periods and of
treating areas infested immediately on hatching so that the newly hatched
locusts are easily killed, has also been effective in controlling the spread
of the locust plague thus reducing pesticide applications to limfiited areas.
5.11        Disposal of Surplus and out-of-date pesticides.   Pesticides have
a useful life of between 3 and 3.5 years. At the end of the locust
operations, a stock of about 1.6 million liters of pesticides remains which
Algeria plans to dispose of as follows: about 200,000 liters (treatment of
200,000 ha) would be a security stock in case of future locust invasions,
300,000 would be used by the agricultural sector against various parasites,
and 80,000 would be contributed to the Maghreb Task Force or to neighboring
countries (Mauritania). A contract has been signed with the pesticide
formulation plant to take the remaining stock of about 1 million liters.
These out-of-date pesticides should either be reformulated by re-exporting
them to foreign firms or should be destroyed. A decision on this matter needs
to be taken by the Algerian Government and communicated to the Bank. In
future, if pesticides are required, the Algerians intend to purchase them in
small quantities as needed on the basis of flexible contracts which would
stipulate that any pesticides remaining unused would be taken back by the
foreign firm. This would help avoid the problem of having to dispose of large
stocks of surplus and out-of-date pesticides.
6.    Main Project Results
6.01        The project was prepared to help Algeria strengthen-its capacity
to control locust swarms which were expected to reinvade the country between
1988 and 1990. The economic rate of return of the Government's locust control
program, assuming that its implementation resulted in protection of only 1.5%
of total economic value of production was calculated at appraisal to be of the
order of 50%. However, partly as a result of the successful anti-locust
campaigns mounted by Algeria and other countries between 1987 and 1988, there
was minimal locust activity during the project period and consequently little
damage was inflicted to agriculture. Thus, although the benefits of the
project cannot be quantified in terms of losses averted as had been done at
appraisal, the project achieved its main objective which was to ensure that
Algeria would have the institutional capacity and the effective means at its
disposal to control any impending locust invasions. Algeria was able to
strengthen (a) its locust control capabilities which would allow it to protect
productive agricultural lands from damage resulting from locust invasions and
(b) its surveillance and warning systems which would enable it to better
predict locust activity and movement thereby facilitating planning and
implementation of future control programs, both in situations of plague and
recession.   From July 1988 to the present, the Algerians organized permanent
surveillance and control activities throughout the country to cover all the
areas susceptible of invasion. They also monitored the situation in
neighboring countries. They used the respite during the period to refine the
control strategy and techniques used in the earlier campaigns and to
continuously train technicians in appropriate techniques (prospection and
treatment methods, safe and effective pesticide handling and application) and



- 7 -
to test the equipment. The reinforcement of the meteorological network in
Algeria is an important contribution of the project.   Establishment of
additional mobile stations in areas of the south which had not been
sufficiently covered during the 1987/88 campaigns will allow the Algerians to
better predict locust activity and movement without having to send prospection
teams long distances, thus leading to savings in terms of personnel, fuel and
maintenance of vehicles. Teams need be dispatched only if climatic conditions
are favorable to the development of the locusts or to maintain the mobile
equipment. In addition, Algeria has been very actively involved in the
Maghreb Task Force which was established in 1988 to coordinate action between
the countries of the region for locust control and has thus helped to provide
a concerted approach to the treatment of locusts in the region.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.01        With the pesticides still in stock and equipment purchased under
the Loan, the country will be well equipped to control any small-scale locust
invasions which may occur in the future. The project financed permanent
surveillance and warning systems. Thus, in periods of locust recession, a
permanent monitoring activity will take place, thus enabling preventive
control activities as and when required. Improvements in meteorological
services, also supported by the project, will provide important weather-
related information to surveillance teams. Reinforcement of Algeria's control
capabilities through the provision of suitably equipped vehicles and equipment
will similarly improve control activities aimed at prevention in the post-
plague situation.
7.02        During recession periods, the vehicles and equipment purchased
under the project for ground control of locusts would be used by INPV for its
normal plant protection activities and the meteorological stations would be
used by the ONM for any emergency operations requiring the support of
meteorological services (forest fires, floods, seismic tremors>. All of this
equipment is being satisfactorily maintained by INPV and the ONM.
8.    Bank Performance
8.01        The Bank's main strength resided in the speed with which it
prepared the project. The simple and straigthforward design and flexible
procurement arrangements of the project for the first locust campaign
permitted the Borrower to implement the project with the required urgency.
The Bank supervision missions also made an effort to help the Borrower in
procurement matters.
9.    Lessons Learned
9.01        During recessional periods, the country can keep the locust
situation under control with the means it currently has at its disposal. If,
on the other hand, the country is invaded by a serious locust plague in the
future, it will once again need to have recourse to external financing to
cover the costs of aircraft services and pesticides which, in the case of this
project, would have constituted 75% of the costs of the campaigns if the



locust invasions had occurred.   The project showed that this extra support
can be mobilized rapidly. However, it is clear that to bring about a lasting
and effective control of the locust plague, the prevention and control
capabilities in all affected countries in the region would need to be
reinforced. The FAO is preparing an interregional project which would aim at
establishing adequate prevention and control systems in the countries of the
Sahel.
10.   Borrower Performance
10.01       The main strength of the Borrower has been its strong commitment
to the objective of controlling the locust problem and preventing its
recurrence and propagation.   The INPV/PCC have shown from the experience in
1987/88 that they are able to mobilize resources quickly to handle the locust
threat and that they take the matter of permanent monitoring and surveillance
very seriously.  The Borrower is also keenly aware of the dangers which
pesticides may pose to humans and the environment and has taken serious steps
to minimize the risks of contamination and to train concerned staff in the
proper procedures for handling and application of pesticides and disposal of
pesticide wastes.
11.   Project Documentation and Data
11.01       INPV/PCC prepared very useful status reports at the end of each
campaign describing physical and financial implementation under the project
and providing forecasts of future locust activity and control requirements.
Satisfactory audit reports of the 1989-1991 project accounts were also done
and received at the Bank.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
I..   Locust Situation
A.    Algeria requested Loan n° 3017 from the World Bank following the locust
invasion of the country in 1987-1988 which led to the treatment of about 2.2
million ha.
B.    This locust invasion, generated by intensive breeding in 1985-1986 in
the areas of winter/spring reproduction (central sahara), and the expansion of
the infestations to the summer breeding areas of the Sahel (Chad-Niger-Mali-
Mauritania) during the first three quarters of 1987, was, according to locust
specialists, expected to continue during at least the next 3 to 4 years.
C.    In effect, following intensive treatments conducted in Algeria and other
North West African countries during the winter and spring of 1988, numerous
locust populations were located in the Sahel and East African countries during
the summer. At that time, the infested areas were estimated by the FAO to
more than 18.0 million ha.
D.    This situation led to the expectation that, in case climatic conditions
were suitable for locust reproduction, an uncontrollable situation would
develop in the countries of the Sahel and massive swarm populations would move
towards the North African countries.
E.    In Algeria, provisions were made for an intervention over at least
3.0 million ha between 1989-1990; which is why Algeria requested a loan from
the World Bank allowing for the mobilization of the necessary financial means
to acquire equipment, vehicles and pesticides for prospection and control
activities, the chartering of aircraft services for aerial spraying and the
implementation of a permanent surveillance system.
F.    The financing required and made available through IBRD Loan N° 3017-AL,
was estimated at US$58.0 million.
G.    However, contrary to expectations, some climatic phenomena along with
successful treatment efforts, considerably limited locust proliferation during
the summer season.
H.    In this context, it is worth mentioning:
the torrential rains registered in the countries of the Sahel and
East Africa during the summer of 1988 which favored the rotting of
the eggs in the soil and consequently reduced hatching;
the very strong winds (Harmattan), registered from East to West
during the fall of 1988, and which dragged most of the swarm
populations towards the Atlantic; actually, some groups even



- 10 -
reached the Caribbean in November 1988, an unprecedented incident
in locust invasion history.
I.    In addition to these natural events, it should be noted that, for the
first time in locust invasion history, control operations against swarm
populations were aggressively undertaken with appropriate means by the
countries concerned and the international community.
J.    The treatments conducted in Algeria from the beginning of the invasion
up to April 15, 1992, were as follows:
Years           Areas Treated
1987-1988                2,165,596 ha
1989                          5,818 ha
1990                            17 ha
1991                         1,620 ha
1992                           900 ha
Total              2,173,951 ha
K.    The equipment and pesticides acquired in the context of the IBRD loan
will be used to reinforce locust prevention and control activities
which Algeria has been engaged in for several decades.
L.    However, taking into account the complementary nature of the breeding
areas, it should be noted that Algeria might not succeed in its preventive
actions if concrete measures of this type are not undertaken by neighboring
and other countries sheltering gregarian populations.
M.    To this effect, it should be mentioned that the FAO is developing, in
collaboration with the western countries, an inter-regional project for
development of preventive control systems in countries affected by locust
invasions.
II.. Pesticides
A.    Surplus pesticides remaining from the last locust control campaign in
theory were out of date (useful life of about 3.5 years) by the time of the
IBRD project closing date.
B.    However, some of the pesticides are being reserved as a security stock
in case of future locust invasions and are very well maintained under the
control of INPV technicians. They are stocked for environmental reasons at
Biskra; 200,000 liters represent INPV's needs and 80,000 liters are intended
for the Maghreb Task Force.
C.    INPV has signed a contract with the national pesticide formulation
plant, ASMIDAL, for it to take the remaining stock of ULV pesticides, mainly



- 11 -
Deltamethrine and Malathion 95% ULV. Since the contract was signed, most of
the Deltamethrine and a large part of Malathion were transferred to ASMIDAL.
D.    The stock of conventional products, initially representing nearly
300,000 liters, is being dispatched rapidly as needed and is used up gradually
as treatment operations are undertaken. The effectiveness of these products
has not been the subject of any claims.
E.    Presently, the remaining stock of pesticides amounts to a total of about
1 million liters, including the different formulations, uses and types of
products.
F.    We are aware of the fact that some of these pesticides, being out of
date, have defective packaging and should be destroyed. For this, there are
no known solutions because it would require techniques with specialized means
not available in Algeria, and FAO's assistance, which was requested, did not
offer any solutions to help deal with this issue.
G.    To date, the National Agency for the Protection of the Environment has
not reported any accidents or any other major preoccupations.
