                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Level 2 restructuring of this project was completed in December 2012. The decision to restructure the project was made in order to: (i) narrow the scope of the Government’s activities
                         in the education sector following KfW’s decision to exit the pooled fund (KfW’s funds remain frozen since until parliamentary elections are held) and amend the targets of results
                         framework; (ii) ensure the Government has a realistic timeline for project implementation by extending the closing date from December 31, 2012 (initial closing date) to December 31,
                         2013 (current closing date); and to (iii) achieve the Project Development Objectives (PDO).

                         To date, the project has disbursed 84 percent of total project funding since the Project was made effective on October 11, 2011.

                         One last extension would be necessary to allow Government to complete the 6 middle schools. The request from Government is currently under consideration. Both the task team
                         and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) are favorable to this extension which would represent an actual implementation period of 3.3 years.
