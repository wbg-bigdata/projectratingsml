                                  RESTRUCTING PAPER


 B. SUMMARY

1.     The project is part of a pooled fund with Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW)
and Agence Francaise de Développement (AFD) following World Bank procedures. The
purpose of this restructuring is to: (i) allow the Government of Guinea to narrow the
scope of its education sector activities following the KfW’s decision to exit the pooled
fund (KfW’s funds remain frozen since they are tied to the holding of parliamentary
elections) and thus to reduce the scope of activities and amend the targets of results
framework); (ii) provide the government team with a realistic timeline to implement the
project; and (iii) achieve the Project Development Objectives (PDO).

 C. PROJECT STATUS

2.     Project performance is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory for implementation
(IP) and Moderately Satisfactory for making progress towards the PDO. Given the
substantial progress made since effectiveness, the IP will be upgraded to Satisfactory in
the next implementation status report (ISR). With the withdrawal of KfW from the
pooled fund, the targets will be adjusted. Project management, financial management,
monitoring and evaluation, procurement and financial management are rated
satisfactory. With the proposed restructuring, it is expected that the PDO objectives will
be met. It is also expected that the grant will be fully disbursed within the proposed life
time of the project.

3.     Although KfW’s withdrawal of US$27 million equivalent has an impact on the
quantity of activities within each component, it does not affect the overall component
goals or project objectives. Indeed, each activity was allocated a percentage according to
the funding stream. It is worth highlighting that for both AFD and EFA FTI, the focus is
on strengthening basic education; thus the reduction in the pooled fund allocation will
take these priorities into consideration.

4.     Construction: To date, the construction of all 1,660 classrooms has commenced
using three approaches (community based, NGOs, and through small and medium
enterprises). Textbooks: The procurement documents for the acquisition of primary
textbooks have been successfully completed and the contracts were signed on March 3,
2012 with savings of GNF 3 million from the estimated costs. Out of a total 6,600,000
textbooks, 2,895,400 have already been delivered. The Bank has assisted the
Government in developing a rigorous system of textbook delivery and holding the local
structures accountable for delivering the textbooks. Pre and In-service Teacher Training:
A total of 11,000 primary teachers have been assessed in French and in Mathematics,
comprising all teachers recruited after 2000. Of these, 3000 have been selected to benefit
from in-service teacher training.


                                            1
5.     The Government has modified the selection requirement for teacher recruitment,
which has resulted in a much lower but more qualified number of teachers for
2011/2012. To meet the growing need for more qualified teachers, a sensitization
campaign was organized by the Ministry of Education to boost the recruitment of
qualified candidates (minimum Baccalauréat) and ensuring continuous monitoring of
teacher trainees progress throughout the training. The Government agreed to provide
some stipends equivalent to university students to incentivize young high school
graduates to the teaching career. Upon completion of teacher training, and subject to
passing successfully the concours spearheaded by the Ministry of Civil Service, they
would be eligible to become civil servants. Girls’ education/Incentives to meet education
demand: To date, 125 schools have been identified to benefit from interventions based
on the FIERE approach (strategy to keep young girls in school) and 250 teachers were
already trained in French, reading and student-centered pedagogy. Approximately 3,750
Grade 6 female students benefitted from private tutoring in Mathematics and French to
increase their chances for a successful completion of primary school. Budgeting and
Planning: To strengthen budgeting and planning, the Ministries of Education have
recently developed a three year Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).

Outstanding activities critical for PDO achievement

6.     Although the Project has made significant progress since effectiveness, additional
time is needed to implement all activities to increase the likelihood for successful project
implementation. Some of the critical activities are:

7.    School construction: School construction is one of the major aspects of this
Project, and one that will require intensified supervision and quality control. Allowing
the Government sufficient time to strengthen its own capacity to supervise civil works
can only be beneficial in ensuring the pace and quality of classroom construction is
maintained.

8.     Strengthen planning and monitoring capacities at the regional and prefecture
levels: Activities under this sub-component have started. The prefectural education
development plans have been prepared and are of good quality. Training has taken place
to support schools in developing school development plans. The objective was to ensure
that grants could be distributed at the beginning of the school year.

9.    Other critical activities not yet started: The proposed extension would also help
ensure the completion of activities such as: (i) public expenditure review in higher
education; (ii) assessment of learning outcomes; and (iii) continuous training of 3,000
teachers based on evaluation results.

Results/indicators: Annex 1

Components

10.    As discussed earlier, KfW funds were funding many of the activities that the
pooled fund supports. Therefore, their withdrawal affects the overall targets and specific
sub-activities, but not the overall objectives, nor the overall component description. The
changes can be summarized as follows:

Component 1: Improving Equitable Access to Basic Education:
   Reduction of primary school construction by 240 classrooms from 1,900 to 1,660;
     Reduction of secondary school level construction from 200 to 72 lower secondary
     classrooms;
   Cancellation of partnership agreement with specialized organizations for inclusive
     education and 50 percent reduction in materials to be acquired;
   Validation of sectors of growth has been finalized, the partnership with
     international institutions and private sector remains, cancelation of construction
     and rehabilitation of professional integration centers, and a new strategy of
     vocational training linked to mining sector is being introduced (technical
     assistance and construction/rehabilitation of technical training centers). A detailed
     action plan will be developed with the recruitment of the new technical assistance;
     and,
   Sensitization campaign for the demand of schools for one year instead of two and
     an increase in the provision of private tutoring for girls to keep them in school.

Component 2: Improving Quality of Basic Education
   Cancellation of acquisition of storage space for the textbooks and cancellation of
     secondary level textbooks; due to the open and competitive process, the number
     of textbooks for primary have been increased;
   Reduction of in-service teachers trained from 5,000 to 3,000;
   Modification of pre-service teacher training activities through cancellation of
     supplemental extension civil works at the Teacher Training Institutions (ENIs and
     removal of performance contracts);
   The public expenditure review of higher education is the only study remaining in
     this sub-sector;
   Cancellation of provisional stipends for newly certified teachers. Blocks grants to
     primary schools and School Delegations for Elementary Education DSEE in
     support of their school improvement project remains unchanged;
   Nation-wide student learning assessment in 4th grade remains unchanged;
   Support to piloting of Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) remains
     unchanged with teacher training decreased to one year; and,
     cancellation of in-service teacher training for secondary teachers.



                                            3
Component 3: Strengthening Management of the Education Sector
    All activities remain unchanged except for those linked to human resource
      management, which will be supported under the International Development
      Association (IDA) Education for All project.

Closing date

12.      An extension of 11.5 months from January 15, 2013 to December 31, 2013 is
being requested. The Project was extended before as part of a Level 1 restructuring
approved on August 25, 2011 after a series of events: (i) Coup d’état on December 23,
2008, which triggered OP 7.30 “Dealings with De Facto Governments? and prevented the
Grant from becoming effective despite effectiveness conditions having been met; and
(ii)the country fell into arrears on September 30, 2009 thus suspending all disbursements.
On January 19, 2011, OP 7.30 was lifted and arrears cleared on April 21, 2011.
Subsequently, a waiver to OP 13.00 “Signing of Legal documents and effectiveness of
loans and credits? was approved by the Managing Director on June 6, 2011 to enable
IDA to re-instate the Grant to the beneficiary. The reinstated grant was signed on
September 22, 2011 and the restructured project became effective on October 20, 2011.

13.      The requirements of OP/BP13.30 (Closing Dates) have been met, specifically: (i)
the PDOs continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of the Borrower is satisfactory;
(iii) the team has received an action plan as well as an updated procurement plan from the
Government to complete the project within the revised closing date; and (iv) there are no
outstanding audits, or interim financial reports (IFRs) for the Grant.

14.    The project continues to comply with all legal covenants, and financial
management is satisfactory. The restructuring does not require any changes to the project
development objectives, the safeguards category, the design of the project, or the
financing mechanisms.

Implementation schedule

15.     The implementation schedule has been adjusted to reflect the proposed extension
of the closing date.

                         ANNEX 2: Extension of Closing Date


                                  Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for Guinea Education For All-Fast Track Initiative Program,
TF092364, P111470 will be extended from January 15, 2013 until December 31, 2013.

2.      Results achieved to date as related to the results framework: With regard to the
four PDO indicators, two are on track to be achieved by the proposed closing date. These
are the implementation of annual budgeted plans (all deconcentrated structures and
schools have developed their annual budgeted plans and have started to be implemented)
and the number of total project beneficiaries. To date, the construction of all 1600
classrooms has started. The total project beneficiaries stand currently at 767,550 but it is
expected that the objective will be fully met. The learning assessment has been conducted
but the results are not yet available to assess the achievement of the third PDO indicator
defined as students with a passing rate in French and Math in 4th grade. The last PDO
indicator, namely, the GER for 9 targeted prefectures, has not progressed as much as
expected and has reached 48% in 2011 versus a target of 51%. With the proposed
extension, it is expected that the end of project targets will be met. The proposed
extension will also ensure that the intermediate indicators, whose target values will be
reduced, will be met.

3. Reasons for Extension. The purpose of this extension is to: (i) allow the
Government of Guinea to narrow the scope of its education sector activities following the
KfW’s decision to exit the pooled fund by reducing the of activities and revising the
targets of the results framework; (ii) provide the Government with a realistic timeline to
implement the project; and (iii) achieve the Project Development Objectives. The two-
year political instability and long suspension period, during which the Bank’s team was
unable to support the government’s team to carry out the necessary activities, have
significantly delayed progress. School-related civil works (which make up 70 percent of
total grant funds) require more than one year of implementation although the design
comprising three modalities of construction (Non Governmental Organizations,
Memorandum of Understanding with the Community Driven Development project
supported by the World Bank (PACV), and Small and Medium Enterprises) remains fully
appropriate. Therefore, the Government decided to seek an additional extension of 11.5
months. As required by the Global Partnership for Education (formally known as
Education for All Fast Track Initiative) procedures, the local education group has
endorsed the proposed extension and reduction of project activities during the joint sector
review held in June 2012.

4.    This would be the second extension of the closing date.
