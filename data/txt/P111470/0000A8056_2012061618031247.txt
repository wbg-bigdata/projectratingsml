                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The first supervision mission was held in December 2011 post project restructuring. The restructured project became effective on October 2011 and has since disbursed close to 30
                         percent. Given that the majority of the grant amount (70%) is geared towards construction of schools, the Government will seek to request a one year extension of the closing date.
                         The Bank team is supportive of this request as implementation only started in October 2011 following the two year suspension, and level 1 restructuring.
