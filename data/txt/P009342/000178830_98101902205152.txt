INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomnendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the equivalent
of US$25.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Highway Project.
This credit would replace a US$22.5 million credit to the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan of June 11, 1964 for the East Pakistan Highway Project (Credit
No. 53-PAK) on the basis set out in paragraph 2 of my Report and Recommendation
to the Executive Directors dated September 15, 1972, on the Chandpur II
Irrigation Project (IDA R/72-77).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
(R72-230) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 13, 1972.
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I. Annex I also contains a brief
description of the economy as presented in paragraphs 3-22 of my Report and
Recommendation to the Executive Directors on an Education Project (IDA/R 73-60)
dated May 29, 1973, with minor updating modifications.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        Paragraphs 3-9 of the President's Report of the same date on a
proposed technical assistance credit to Bangladesh (Report No. P-1281-BD)
contain a description of Bank Group Operations in Bangladesh. Annex II
contains a summary statement of (i) IDA credits made to Bangladesh since
1972, (ii) the loan and credits to Pakistan for projects located wholly
in Bangladesh which have not been reactivated, and (iii) notes on the
status of execution of ongoing projects.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
4.        The geography of Bangladesh has given rise to a varied and complex
transport system. Numerous watercourses have traditionally provided the
main avenues of commerce but have also been the principal obstacles to the
development of other and faster means of surface transportation in the
country. These watercourses and the annual monsoon floods require railways
and roads to be built on high embankments. Few building materials are
available locally and in particular rock for road construction is not found
in the alluvial delta terrain. Consequently road and bridge construction



- 2 -
is expensive and the road network is developing only slowly. The movement
of persons and goods very often involves interchanges between two or more
modes of transport withl consequent high travel-time between paints and
resLraint on commerce between different parts of the country.
5.        While no estimate is available on the total movement of people
and goods in Bangladesh, in terms of passenger and tonr miles, it is
generally assumed that most traffic moves by water, primarily in the more
than 300,000 privately owned non-motorized vessels. Over short distances
bullock carts also are important carriers.    Traffic carried by motor vehicles,
mechanized vessels and the railway is concentrated along two north-south
corridors based on the ports of Chalna and Chittagong, respectively, and
consists primarily of foreign trade items (mostly exports of jute and
imports of fuel, foodgrains, some raw materials and industrial products).
6.        Due to previous Government policy, which had relegated the then
privately owned water transport sector to a role secondary to the Government-
owned railway, investments necessary to realize the full potential of water
transport have been neglected to some degree while the railway has been called
upon to provide services which could best be operated by water or road
transport.  At the same time, very considerable sums have been spent on an
eubryo arterial road system andl connecting feeder roads.   The potential for
the further expansion of road transport, with small investments in adequate
ferry services to connect the road network, coupled with improved utilization
of the water transport arteries, indicates that the railroad should be
expected to carry a decreasing percentsge of traffic in the future. In
recent years, the financial situation of the railway has become more difficult
due to problems of management, operational complications arising from the
fragmented nature of the system and increasing competition from road transport.
7.        This complex situation is now further complicated by war damage,
whicn has effectively crippled the railway and impeded some road movements
(while, at the same time, demonstrating the full potential of inland water
transport), and by the uncertainties arising from changed relationships with
India.  The latter may result irn an l-ncreased flow of traffic to and from
the port of Calcuctt, the traditional outlet for Bangladesh, and important
Indian cross-traffic to and from, Assam and other northeastern Indian states.
Both could have significant effects on the pattern of transport development
in Bangladesh, principally affecting the roles of the railway and of inland
water transport.
8.        Tnese facts suggest a cautious approach to major investments in
the transport sector until such time as an overall evaluation of current
and forthcoming transport needs has been completed. A study designed to
provide this evaluation is now underway with assistance from the United
Kingdom and is expected to be substantially completed in about 10 months.
It should produce a comprehensive plan for transport development in
Bangladesh, incorporating a detailed investment program for the period
to 1978/79 and a perspective program for the following ten years. Meanwhile,



-3-
however, there are a number of clear and urgent needs to be met in reconstruct-
ing and rehabilitating the transportation system. It is in this context
that the Association proposes to reactivate the Highways Project, which
will improve road transportation along the crucial Dacca-Chittagong corridor.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
9.        The proposed credit would help finance:   (i) the construction of
a bridge over the Sitalakhya River about five miles east of Dacca on the
Dacca-Chittagong Road, twenty miles of new highway southeast of Feni to
shorten the Dacca-Chittagong Road by about seven miles and improvements to
the war-damaged Surma River Bridge in Sylhet; (ii) a feasibility study of a
second bridge over the Surma River at Sylhet and pre-feasibility studies
of other high priority river crossings; (iii) the strengthening of the Roads
and Highways Department (RHD) by providing it with a headquarters building
to replace currently scattered and unsuitable facilities, spares and tools
for improving equipment maintenance, consulting services on ferry operations,
technical assistance and training. The credit would replace Credit No.
53-PAK which was signed on June 11, 1964, and provided US$22.5 million to
assist the financing of a project for the construction of 134 miles of
all-weather highway to complete the 150-mile link between the capital at
Dacca and the main port of Chittagong. Due to the various difficulties
described below, the project was modified twice, once in February 1968
(IDA/R68-8) and again in April 1970 (IDA/R70-18). Little construction was
completed prior to the 1971 disturbances that culminated in the emergence
of an independent Bangladesh. The Government has now requested a new credit
of US$25.0 million to reactivate this project. In June 1972 a mission
visited Bangladesh to reappraise the project, with follow-up missions in
October 1972, January-February 1973, and April 1973 to discuss and further
refine the project. A project summary and a technical note describing the
findings of these missions are attached as Annexes III and IV, respectively.
Project History
10.       The preparation of designs for the highway section to be financed
under the original credit was delayed by the Indo-Pakistan conflict of 1965,
problems in land acquisition, and various other difficulties. When revised
cost estimates were made in 1966 and 1967, the costs were found to have gone
up by 65 percent because of the need to allow for additional bridge, culvert
and road construction, increased quantities of materials, and price increases
since the original appraisal. Meanwhile RHD had improved certain sections
of the existing road to meet urgent traffic demands. Therefore, construction
to be financed under the Credit was reduced in February 1968 (IDA/R68-8) to
those sub-sections of the road where improvements would yield the highest
economic returns. The revised project covered some 70 miles of the Dacca-
Chittagong highway, instead of the original 134 miles, plus a five-mile exten-
sion from the highway to Narayanganj (a river port about seven miles southeast
of Dacca). The amount of the Credit remain unchanged.



11        The first round of bids for the modified road construction project
produced only three bids (all from foreign contractors) and these offers were
all substantially higher than the consultant engineers' revised estimates.
After consultation with the Association, the Goverrment rejected tIhem and
called for new bids.   Although several modifications were made to the bid
packages in an effort to reduce contractor risks and increase their interest,
the second bid inritation produced only two bids for the Sitalakhya and
the Feni bypass bridges and rLo bids for the road work.   Since the earthworks
required under the project exceeded the capacity of the local industry to
complete the job within an acceptable period of time, the scope of the
road construction was again reduced in April 1970 (IDA/R70-18) from 75
miles to 35 miles with the roads excluded from the project to be improved
by RHD force account.   The purpose and amount of the credit continued
basically unchanged. Special emphasis was given in the revised project to
improving the capability of 'ocal contractors by providing technical advisory
services and puttinig at the contractors' disposal Government construction
equipment on a hire or hire-purchase basis. With this assistance, it was
possible in September 1971 to award five contracts for the construction of
embarmkments and small structures to four local contractors and one foreign
contractor. The contracts for the bridges had been atwarded in 1970.
12.       When work stopped at the end of 1971, three out of seven piers
on the Sitalakhya Bridge had been partially completed, and progress on the
Feni Road was minimal.   Only US$3.6 million had been disbursed.   In retrospect
it is clear that the Association had seriously underestimated the difficulties
of building roads in Bangladesh, due to lack of suitable materials and the
need to design roads able to withstand annual monsoon floods, as well as
the reluctance of contractors to bid for work in Bangladesh.
The Reactivated Project
13.       The project to be financed with the proposed react4vated credit
is fundamentally the same as the 1970 revised project except that (i) the new
road to be construc.ed at Feni would be reduced from 24 to 20 miles;
(ii) the 11 mile Dacca-Demra-Narayanganj extension has been eliminated, due
to the need to review the design in the light of urban developments over
the last few years; (iii) the Surma River bridge at Sylhet which was
damaged during the recent hostilities would be repaired and improved and
a feasibility study and design of a second crossing over the Surma River
at Sylhet would be undertaken; (iv) assistance to improve the operations of
RHD would be expanded by including construction of a new, fully equipped
headquarters building, procurement of spares and tools for better maintenance
of RHD's existing equipment, and provision of expatriate experts and training;
and (v) provision of equipment and facilities to improve the ferry crossings
on the Dacca-Chittagong road. Although the modifications reduce the actual
length of new road to be constructed, the total cost of the project has
increased to US$40.4 million, due to price increases, the recent currency
changes and inclusion of new components in the project. The proposed credit
would finance (i) notional repayment of amounts previously disbursed under
Credit No. 53-PAK (about US$3.6 million), thus debiting Bangladesh with this



-5-
amount; (ii) project expenditures incurred prior to December 29, 1971 for
which IDA has not made disbursements (about US$80,000); and (iii) the
total foreign exchange cost and about 54 percent of the local cost of com-
pleting the project. The last item includes the reimbursement to Sweden for
such disbursements as may have been made under an interim credit which is
financing some project expenditures prior to effectiveness of the proposed
new credit (estimated to be about US$80,000 equivalent).
Organization and Management
14.       As part of the program to strengthen RHD, the Government has
established a Reorganization Committee to examine methods of improving RHD's
organization and administration. The proposed reorganization is intended
to place special emphasis on improvements in budgeting and accounting,
procurement procedures, maintenance and control of equipment, planning,
and personnel management and training. The reorganization requires for its
effectiveness the provision of a new headquarters building, which will allow
for consolidation of offices now scattered at several different locations in
Dacca. The Government has given assurance of its intention to proceed
with the reorganization at the earliest possible time and would keep the
Association informed of its progress.
Benefits and justification
15.       In 1969, prior to the 1970 revision of the project, an assessment
of the economic return on the Feni Road and the Sitalakhya Bridge indicated
a rate of 18 percent and 10 percent respectively. The Feni Road was justified
on expected savings in vehicle operating costs as a result of shorter journey
distance, faster transit time, improvement in the quality of the road, and
a reduction in speed changes by avoiding the busy town of Feni. The expected
benefits of the Sitalakhya Bridge were from savings in the vehicle and
passenger time costs absorbed in crossing the river by ferry and the avoidance
of higher cost ferry services needed to handle growing traffic volumes.    Since
then, the decline in traffic due to the economic disruption caused by the 1970
cyclone and the 1971 hostilities with the resultant loss and damage to the
vehicle fleet and the increases in costs appear to have reduced the previously
estimated returns to 9 percent and 4 percent respectively. However, given
the uncertainties attached to any re-evaluation estimates made at a time when
the economy is disrupted and the vehicle fleet substantially reduced, the
amount of work already performed on these facilities, the Government's public
commitment to complete them and the importance of IDA's continued association
to help ensure the effective strengthening of RHD, the project should be
completed.
16.       While construction at the Sitalakhya Bridge and the Feni Road would
benefit some of the same flow of traffic, the two improvements are essen-
tially independent of each other. For that reason a delay in the execution
of the Sitalakhya Bridge which might result from pending negotiations with
contractors (see paragraph 17 below) would not affect the appropriateness of



proceeding to complete the Feni Road works. The repair of the Surma River
Bridge would eliminate long delays now caused by queues waiting to cross its
narrow bailey bridge section, and would remove the safety hazard of mixing
pedestrians, bicycles and motor vehicles. The investments for the strengthen-
ing of RHD are intended to make the design and construction of the new roads
more efficient, and would improve the maintenance of the road network.
Procurement and Disbursement
17.       Contracts for the construction of the Feni Road have been re-nego-
tiated with firms which had won contracts for the work before suspension
of disbursement of the original credit. The contract for the construction
of the Sitalakhya Bridge is now in process of renegotiation with the original
Japanese contractor. Negotiations have also taken place with an American
firm which has equipment and staff in Bangladesh because it is carrying out
similar projects there; and discussions of a possible joint operation have
taken place between the Japanese and the American firns. It is still un-
certain whether a contract will be negotiated with the Japanese firm, the
American firm or a combination of the two. If the Government is not able
to negotiate a satisfactory contract with a firm with appropriate equipment
already in Bangladesh, the cost of building the bridge would increase
substantially and a new appraisal would be required. If, therefore, it
proves impossible to negotiate a satisfactory contract by December 31, 1973,
the US$4.7 million of the credit allocated to the bridge would be cancelled.
18.       The Indian firm which originally constructed the Surma River Bridge
would carry out the necessary repairs and modifications of the bridge subject
to review by the Association of the design and cost estimates.     Contracts
for the construction of the RHD headquarters building would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding among local firms. The remaining procurement,
including paving contracts for the Feni Road and Sitalakhya Bridge and
procurement of equipment and spare parts for the RHD will be by international
competitive bidding.
19.       The credit would finance about 62% of total project cost since its
inception in 1964, which would represent the equivalent of the foreign
exchange cost plus about US$5.8 million equivalent of local costs. Local
currency financing, which had been included in the previous credit for
this project, continues to be justified in the case of Bangladesh due to the
insufficiency of local resources to meet the pressing needs for both reconstruc-
tion and development. Disbursement for future expenditure would be made
against 100 percent of foreign currency expenditures for civil works,
consultant services, technical assistance, training and equipment for the
RHD building and repair and maintenance facilities and Dacca-Chittagong
Road ferry facilities, 50 percent of local currency expenditures for highway
civil works, 70 percent of local currency expenditures for Dacca-Chittagong
Road ferry facilities and 67 percent of total expenditures for constructing
the RMD building.  It is expected that all project works would be completed
by the end of 1976 and that the proposed credit will be fully disbursed by
the end of 1977.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
20.       The draft Development Credit Agreements between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreements conform substantially to the provisions of the prior
Development Credit Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and
incorporate the relevant provisions of the Project Agreement with the then
Province of East Pakistan. There would not be a separate Project Agreement.
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

B. TtiE ECONOMY---
Backgnround
1.        On December 16, 1971 the Government of Bangladesh assumed control
of ithe territory comprising the former East Wing of Pakistan. Even in the
best of circumstances Bangladesh would constitute a complex development
proilem.  rhe people are poor (per capita income of US$50 to US$70 per annum,
a figure which has not risen over the past 20 years), overcrowded (population
density is nearly 1,400 per square mile) and becoming more so (population
Ig growing at 3 percent per annum), short-lived (life expectancy at birth is
well under 50 years), in many cases unemployed (perhaps 25-30 percent), and
largely illiterate (under 20 percent literacy rate).
2.       'The physical problems of Bangladesh -- its precarious environment,
lack of natural resources, and alluvial terrain with resultant high cost of
infrastructure -- have been compounded by poorly chosen and implemented
investment programs in the past. Perhaps the most striking failure lies
in the increasing gap between foodgrain production and requirements.
Bangladesth, a predominantly agricultural country, must import about 15 per-
cent of its food requirements even in years of "normal" production such as
1969/70 when 1.5 million tons of foodgrains were imported.   Bangladesh today
is one of the most extreme examples of rural poverty in the world.
3.       '"he year and a half in which the Government of Bangladesh has been
In control of the country has been dominated by the need to tackle tile
urgent rehabilitation tasks arising out of the cyclone of November 1970 and
Ctc political struggles and war of 1971. First, law and order had to be re-
establlsised, political stability achieved and the administrative framework
reconstituted.  Second, refugees had to be resettled, relief provided and
the transport system reconstructed to permit the distribution of food. Third,
the economy had to be restored to pre-war levels of output and employment.
4.        'fwo of the principal achievements of the Government since irndepen-
uienlce have been the progress towards restoration of law and order to the
countryside and the formulation of a new constitution. The constitution
whii hi cntme into effect on December 16, 1972, provides for the establishment
o' :a parliamentary democracy in which the President is the constitutional
htead of State and executive authority is exercised by the Cabinet under
Lthe lrime Minister.  Ihe Cabinet collectively is responsible to Parliament,
wi icli consists of 300 members elected by the people from single territorial
constituencies by direct election. The first parliamentary elections were
held iri March 1973.
5.        MosL of thc refugees have been resettled, relief has been provided
and Che widely feared famine has not materialized, thanks in part to massive
ans istance initially from India and subsequently from a number of other
counitries, mostly under the auspices of UNROD (United Nations Reiief
Operation In Dacca).   Tlhe port of Clittagong was restored to 90 percent of
Its prowar capacity by the end of last June. 'rlhe roads were quickly repaired

Recommendation to the Executive Directors on an Education Project

Food andiu Othler Productioni
6.        Ilhe gravest problem confronting the Government since independence
Ilis been the food situation. The 1970/71 crops were poor and the aman crop
of December 1971 was disrupted by the war.   Record levels of food imports of
about 2.5 million tons in 1972 have prevented famine from occurring.   Never-
thelens, per capita foodgrain availabilities in 1972 were well below 1969/70
levels and this, combined witlh the internal transport difficulties, wide-
spread hoarding, and smuggling of foodgrains to India, led to a 50 percent
rise in prtces over tlhe year. By October 1972 it was apparent that the
monNooli had been exceptionally poor and that a critical situation was likely
to deveiop once again. According to preliminary assessments the main rice
crop was 20 ;ercent lower than the original estimates.   Even assuming that
the winter rice crop is satisfactory, there will still be a total foodgrain
Import requirement of at least 2.5 million tons in 1973.
7.        Non-a$ricultural sectors have also been slow to recover.    Indus-
trial aetivity came to a virtual standstill from November 1971 to January
1972. Since then, production in general seems to have returned to about
70 percent of pre-war levels, though there is considerable variation among
Industries. Many industries have experienced serious shortages of raw
materials (such as cotton, yarn, chemicals and cement), spare parts and
capital gootds. In large part this is due to the disruption of trade both
during the war and subsequently, with new Government licensing and importing
Institutions not operating effectively. In addition industrial production
tias been Affected by a variety of problems ranging from lack of demand
(especially for those industries formerly exporting to West Pakistan) to labor
problems. Low output, combined with the Government's inability to get a
suhstantial amount of imported consumer goods flowing into the country, has
been a major factor contributing to the rapid price increases.
'Trade
H.       )One of the first acts of the Government was to devalue the taka
by 53 percent at official rates, to establish it at par with the Indian
rupee. The bonus voucher system for exports was removed and this, combined
witlh thie devaluation, had the important effect of offering a higher
effective exchange rate for raw jute and a somewhat lower rate for locally
manufactured jute goods. Exports increased fairly rapidly after the
resumption of trade in February 1972. The recovery was made possible by the
existence of large inventories of jute and jute products at a time when the
prices fetched. on world markets still reflected the severe shortages of
1971. As 1972 wore on, there were reminders of the difficult world market
position of jute, with clear evidence of European raw jute importers switching
to synthetics and of declining demand.   As a result, jute exports are
prolected at US$325 million in 1972/73 as against US$350 million in 1969/70.



ANNEX I
Page 4
Total exports of the country over the year are prolected at about US$375
millon, which compares with about US$500 million exported to West Pakistan
anni tltrd counLtries in the pre-war period.  Most of this decline is on
account of itLems such as tea, matches, fish and paper products which were
formerly exported to West Pakistan.
Ilhc First Annual Plan
9.        In July 1972 the first budget and Annual Plan were presented.
lhe Plan proposed some US$430 million of public development expenditure
and a furtlher US$160 million for reconstruction.  About half of the develop-
ment expenditure was for agriculture, rural institutions, and water and
flood control. The Plan is a pragmatic document whlich aims at restoring
econiomic activity to the pre-war level. Even so, the projected amounts of
development expendliture represent a sizeable increase from the past and
there is likely to be a considerable shortfall. The level of imports (and
the consequent foreign aid disbursements) whichi is assumed in the Plan,
may niot he nchlieved in 1972/73, leading to shortfalls in revenues from
customs duties and counterpart funds. The budgetary situation is very
closely tied to indirect taxation and this in turn is dependent on foreign
Lrade levels.  Pressing budgetary needs have had to be met through an
expanslon In the money supply of 82 percent between January and December
1972.  Ihis has combined with commodity shortages to cause the serious price
problemis, whlich because of their political implications loom largest in
short-term economic concerns of the Government at present.
I'riorities for Growth
1o.       The elections of March 1973 and the publication of the Five-Year
plan expected for June signal the end of the "reconstruction" phase and
thie beginn[ng of the Government's attempt to come to grips with the long-
term development problems. The authorities will be faced with a host of
fundamental decisions concerning policies and programs. The Plan will
provide the basis for analysing the quantitative dimensions of the develop-
ment problem. The following is an attempt to delineate the issues in
general terms, drawn mainly from the Economic Report on Bangladesh.
11.       P'erlhaps the hlighest priority attaches to gearing up the economic
administration to prepare and implement development projects in a manner
quite different from the past.   Wlile the Planning Commission is now
techinically well prepared to devise economic plans, the need for effective
coordination and improved project preparation and implementation has not
yet been met.  Thie operating ministries and autonomous institutions, which
were already weak, were in many cases weakened still further as a result
of changes in key personnel during 1971 and the unsettled period in early
1972.  it will be necessary to face these problems squarely, identify the
Jg,aps in personnel and prepare for the combination of training and technical
assistance which wili be necesaary to close these gaps.
12.       The urgent need to engineer a rapid and visible improvement in
rurail living standards points to a rapid expansion of programs related to



ANIEX I
Page 5
rurnl development. 'Fhese programs are central to future development, and
development activities in all sectors should be designed to reflect the
crucial imporLance of rural development.   The programs evolved at the
Comilla Academy for Rural Development are especially promising and deserving
of support.
13.       In view of the great technical difficulties arising in the
construct ion of large-scale water control projects, Bangladesh's urgent need
to Increase food production requires emphasis to be placed initially on
lens ambitious projects with greater immediate impact in increasing yields.
1:mphinias should be placed upon:  improved distribution of inputs; appropriate
pricitng policies for both inputs and agricultural products; much more
resc:irch thnn hiltherto on developing new varieties, improved methods of
cultivation, input requirements and alternative cropping possibilities;
attenition to sucIh currently neglected areas as livestock production and
fisheries; encouragement to private investment in agriculture; and extension
of credit fncilities to smallholders.
14.       Products suchl as leather goods, fish and paper products are
minior export items at present, but represent possible growth opportunities
for the economy. A proper system of incentives for these and new export
Ltems needs to be considered. Marketing and promotion activities need to
be undertaken both to relirect the products formerly exported to West
IPnkintani and to increase and diversify exports.
15.      'I'here is no easy way to increase public savings in the short-run.
A pro)rnm of taxation needs to be drawn up which will be elastic to growth
in income.  An essential element in any such program will be the efficient
operaLtlon :and economic pricing of public utilities and enterprises. There
Shoul(d be flexibility and experimentation to provide financial incentives
to management and labor, and improved financial reporting to enable
aiuuLhori ties Lo make necessary changes.
16.       Progranms with a high employnent content should be emipliasized.
Tule rural, works program has thie potential for creating productive infra-
structure  In clc rural areas, through hiring seasonally unemployed workers;
smnll-sc.ale  nidustries can have an impact on both output and employment if
promotion, financing and incentives are adequate; and the high labor
content of Jute production increases the importance of efforts to keep jute
price competitive.
17.       I'lhe education system, based on traditional models, has over-
oniphasized theoretical formal education and has been excessively concentrated
In urhan areas.  1.ducation must be reoriented towards a better-educated
rural population and skilled manpower in the modern sector.   Proposals for
nins4s education have been put forward which, while far from being fully
worked ouit, represent a step in the right direction.  'the deterioration of
(liiilIlty In hligher education and the divorce of the universities from the
renil developmenit situation are problems requiring urgent attention.



ANNEX I
Page 6
18.       Tht popuiation will double by the year 2000 if present growth rates
Pre mnintained.  The population control program needs a completely new
approach witht proper political backing and a sense of real urgency. It must
b, not merely the particular program of one department, but a concern
permeating the entire administration.
External Aid and Growth
19.       Bangladesh will require large and continuing external assistance
to achieve an acceptable growth rate. Long-term projections suggest that,
even to maintain the existing per capita income level in the face of
continued population growth, net aid disbursements of between US$100 million
and US$200 million per annum would be required.    Aid disbursement levels of
About US$300 million would permit imports of only about US$700 million,
wiichl, given the higher foodgrain component, would allow for no more invest-
ment goods andl raw materials than were imported in 1969/70 into the area
thnt became Bangladesh. Average aid disbursements of US$500 million per
yenr over the five-year plan period would be required to permit imports to
be mnintained at a level of US$900 million and the rate of investment at
the 12-15 percent of GDP figure which is needed for a 5 percent per annum
growth of GDP. There is little prospect for substantial domestic financing
of investment in the short-term given the depressed levels of income. In
time, of course, the substitution of domestically grown foodgrains for
imports would release foreign exchange for expanded capital and raw materials
Imports .
20.       Aid disbursements this year and next are likely to be limited
by the capactty to import efficiently rather than by lnadequate commitment
levels.  Commitments, which were at about US$1.3 billion as of the end of
1972, have been extremely high, reflecting the sympathetic response from
donors to the needs of the critical food situation and reconstruction
program. While levels of aid commitments during the next few years will
certainly be lower, it is essential for disbursements to be maintained well
above pre-war levels if Bangladesh is to make any significant progress in
raising living standards.
21.       With an adequate aid flow and better economic management,
BnngladeshI should certainly improve on past growth rates. A sustained
growth rate of close to 5 percent should be possible, although it would
need good fortune as well as exceptionally good management to get above
thnt level given the unfavorable ratio of population to resources. The
keys to growth will probably be increased agriculture production on the
one hand, and good export performance on the other.    A sustained rate of
gr(olth of 5 percent would mean that by the end of the century the majority
of the popul;ition could be adequately, if simply, fed, housed, clothed and
edtucnted. Given the difficult circumstances of Bangladesh, even this would
be n major nchlievement.

$19.2 million IDA Credit No. 83 of 1966 and a 25 million Kronor credit from
the Kingdom of Sweden. The Kingdom of Sweden is again providing a 25
million Kronor Credit. The project is almost completed and 95 percent of
the new IDA and Swedish credits will go toward repaying the previous credits.
The remaining funds ($1.25 million from IDA and about $0.25 million equivalent
from Sweden) will be used to pay outstanding bills for work completed prior
to the war, completion of some supporting facilities for the grain storage
silos, replacement of spares and equipment damaged during the war, strengthening
of the infestation control system, and a feasibility study for a second grain
storage project.

BANGLADESH
TECHNICAL NOTE ON A HIGHWAY PROJECT
A. INTRODU CTION
1.        This technical note is based on findings of a mission 1/ which
visited Bangladesh from June 8 to 28, 1972, to reappraise the Dacca-
Chittagong highway project in the light of the emergency requirements in
the Dacca-Chittagong transport corridor and the transport sector generally,
and of the changed transport needs after the events of the past two years.
During 1971, execution of the project, underway with the assistance of an
IDA Credit to Pakistan (Credit 53-PAK), was disrupted by the outbreak of
hostilities. On December 29, 1971, the Association suspended disbursements
on the project. By June 1972, with conditions in the country returning to
normal, the Government of Bangladesh included this project among those on-
going development projects for which Sweden is providing interim financial
assistance. The Government has requested a new Credit from IDA for the
project. Some changes in the project, improving the Dacca-Chittagong Road
and strengthening the highway authority, are proposed in view of presently
changed conditions, particularly the damages caused by hostilities. However,
the basic objective of the project, improving the Dacca-Chittagong Road and
strengthening the highway authority, remains unchanged and an IDA Credit of
up to US$25 million equivalent to Bangladesh is proposed to replace the
US$22.5 million development credit (Credit 53-PAK) to Pakistan. The increase
in the amount of the Credit is to compensate for exchange rate changes.
B. BACKGROUND
2.        The present situation in the transport sector including roads and
road transport is discussed in detail in the last Economic Report on
Bangladesh (IDA/R72-230); summary statistics on the main road network and
the vehicle fleet of Bangladesh are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The main
conclusion is that despite the severe disruptions which were caused to
transport during the recent disturbances, most severed links have now been
reestablished at least on a temporary basis and transport services restored
to most points in the country. The reconstruction program is giving
greatest emphasis to projects with a short term investment impact and to
resumption of interrupted schemes which were underway in 1971.
1/ Mission headed by H. Kaden (engineer) and including T. Neuner (economist)
of IDA and A. Boros and C. Daniels, consultants. There were follow-up
missions by Mr. Neuner in November 1972, January-February 1973; and
Messrs Young, Neuner and Nathan in April 1973.



3.        The present proposal is essentially for the same project presented
to the Board in June 1964 (P-374, East Pakistan Highway Project, Credit 53-PAK)
and as modified twice since then, once in February 1968 (IDA/R68-8) and
again in April 1970 (IDA/R70-18). The project was based on a 1963 feasibility
study prepared by Anmann & Whitney (US) for improving the main road between
Dacca, the capital of what was then the province of East Pakistan, and
Chittagong, its second largest city and main port. The project originally
consisted of (a) the design and the construction of the Dacca-Chittagong
highway and (b) the strengthening of the Roads and Highways Directorate (RHD)
by providing advisory services and some testing and control equipment.
4.        Execution of the original project has been interrupted by two wars
and has been plagued by many problems, the most important of which was the
inadequate response by international contractors when the work was put to
tender.  Since there was also a scarcity of competent local contractors who
could undertake the work unaided, when revised in 1970 the project included
technical assistance to the local construction industry and other aids in
order to ena'ole it to participate in the work. 1Thile the two main objectives
of the original project (linking Dacca to Chittagong by an all-weather road
and increasing the effectiveness of the RHD) have remained throughout, the
length of the highway to be built from the Credit has been progressively
reduced as construction costs escalated and sections of the existing road
were improved by the Government to somewhat lower design standards which are
nevertheless adequate for traffic needs over the shorter economic life of
these improvements. As the remaining works to be financed under the Credit
will be new road works, they are built to higher standards appropriate to
their longer expected life.   The 1970 revision also added feasibility studies
for improved ferry services or bridges at about 20 river crossings on the
main network in recognition of the preeminent importance of resolving this
problem and improving road transport in the country.
5.        At the outbreak of hostilities in 1971, contracts had been let
and works were underway on the two major construction items then remaining
in the project: the Sitalakhya River Bridge near Dacca and a realigned
sectiorn of the highway near Feni (Feni Road) t/ which will shorten the
distance between Dacca and Chittagong by seven mi. A contract for the
construction of the Sitalakhya Bridge was signed with Mitsui-Ohbayashi J.V.A.
(Japan) in April 1970 and only some construction, mainly caissons for pier
foundations, was finished when work stopped at the end of 1971. Tne work
on the Feni Road was being carried out in two major groups: one contract
for the three major bridges including approach roads awarded to a local
contractor in May 1970, and five small contracts for construction of about
20 miles of embankments and small structures. The latter work was being
carried out by one Korean and four local contractors. The contracts were
let in September 1971. Very little construction had been completed on the
1/   As the first part of this improvement will also create a bypass around
the town of Feni, this section is sometimes called the Feni Bypass.



Feni Road at the end of 1971 when all work stopped, and nothing has been
done since then.
6.        The original project included provision for general advisory
consultants to RHD (De Leuw, Cather International (US)) who had only limited
success in reorganizing and strengthening the RHD. The consultants also
advised the RHD in the operations of its construction programs and assisted
in the preparation of manuals and other operational documents. Although
the Government recognizes the need for further improvement in the operation
of its MHD (particularly in such areas as soils and materials testing, in
bridge engineering and in cost control), it wishes to rely primarily on
bilateral aid for additional technical assistance and thus the contract with
De Leuw, Cather will not be renewed. However, the Government is still
planning to implement, in consultation with the Association, a reorganization
of the PHD which was formulated with the help of a management consultant made
available by the Association in late 1972 and which will utilize a number of
bilateral offers for technical assistance. The procurement of equipment for
the RHD laboratory has been completed. With the increased emphasis on
training and the provision of technical assistance, construction of a
headquarters building for RHD has now become the most important physical
prerequisite for improved functioning of the RHD (see para 21) and accordingly
is included in the project. The training component under the previous project
had not yet been implemented and is again included on the basis of the
current reorganization plan.
7.        Credit 53-PAK provided for construction of certain connecting
roads at the Dacca end of the Dacca-Chittagong road (the Dacca-Demra-
Narayanganj extension) and for studies of the access from the Dacca-Chittagong
trunk road into the main cities at each end and, after the 1970 revision, of
some 20 major river crossings. Work on the Dacca-Demra-Narayanganj extension
has been deferred to study the effect of rapid urban changes which have
taken place since its design. The design of access roads is virtually
complete and accordingly no future provision is made for it under the Credit.
The main river crossings study had not yet started when hostilities broke
out and will now be renewed on a broader basis. High priority crossings are
to be selected by a transport survey which is currently underway wih UK
financing and will first be reviewed with individual prefeasibility studies.
Ferry design and operations will be studied systematically in order to
formulate optimal designs and procedures based as much as possible on the
use of domestically produced ferries.
8.        At the present time about US$3.6 million equivalent of the total
lending of US$22.5 million has been disbursed under Credit 53-PAK. The
bulk of these disbursements was for consulting services. The Government of
Bangladesh has also drawn about Swedish Kroner 348,000 equivalent under its
interim credit from Sweden, primarily for consulting services and emergency
protection works for the Sitalakhya Bridge; this amount is to be refinanced
under the proposed Credit once it becomes effective.

C. THE PROJECT
9.        The project would remain fundamentally the same as provided for
under the revised Credit 53-PAK (IDA/R70-18 of April 1970). The principal
works include the continuation of bridge and road construction started prior
to the outbreak of hostilities. Provisions are also included for strengthen-
ing the RHD, training of highway personnel and for studying the river crossing
bottlenecks of the road network.
10.       The following modifications have been agreed with the Government:
(a) reduction of new road to be constructed at Feni from
about 24 to about 20 mi (para 11);
(b) elimination of about 11 mi of roadwork consisting of
the Dacca-Demra-Narayanganj extension of the Dacca-
Chittagong road (para 7);
(c) elimination of detailed engineering of access roads from
Dacca-Chittagong road to Dacca and to Chittagong (para 7);
(d) provision for repair and improvement of the Surma River
bridge at Sylhet which was damaged during hostilities and
for feasibility study and design of a new permanent crossing
over the Surma River in that vicinity (paras 16 and 17);
(e)  concentrating the river crossing study on high priority
points to be identified at the beginning of 1974 by the
transport survey which is currently being carried out under
U.K. auspices (para 18); and
(f) further assistance to improved operations of the RHD,
including construction of a new, fully equipped head-
quarters building, and of tools for maintenance depots
for RHD equipment, provision of expatriate experts (to
the extent not provided bilaterally) and of training of
highway personnel and procurement of equipment to improve
the ferry crossings on the Dacca-Chittagong road (paras 20,
21 and 22).
The components of the project as now constituted may be summarized as follows:
(a) construction, of Feni. Road, Sitalakhya Bridge, and
Surma River Bridge at Sylhet;
(b) consulting services for the supervision of the works
under (a) above; highway organization and operation;



-5-
feasibility study and design of new crossing over River
Surma at Sylhet; prefeasibility studies of high priority
road river crossings; and the design of standard ferries
and related matters.
(c)  facilities and services to improve RHD operations as
indicated under (f) above.
Construction of the Feni Road
11.       The Feni Road will avoid several communities and narrow bridges,
and shorten the existing road by about 7 mi. Building of the new road
section would also avoid the reconstruction of a large bridge which is
located on the old road at unstable river banks requiring high maintenance
cost. The Feni Road originally consisted of the construction of approximately
24 mi of new road but under the revised project the road works will be reduced
to approximately 20 mi by shortening the new construction at one end and
using more of the existing road which has since been improved. The shortened
new road will be built to a geometric design appropriate to the traffic
level which is projected during the economic life of the road; relevant
design standards are summarized in Table 3.
12.       Work on the Feni Road was to be broken into seven contracts,
one for the three major bridges, five for construction of embankments and
small structures, and one for the pavement works to start after the enbank-
ment was in place. Progress ma de when hostilities halted the works in
December 1971 on the six contracts awarded up until that time was minimal.
The original six contracts have now been combined into three units 1/ and
tentative unit price contracts negotiated with local firms originally selected
by tender under the old project. The contractors are expected to rely on
labor intensive methods as they had done previously thereby giving seasonal
employment to about 1,600 laborers. Some equipment will be needed, however,
which will be furnished partly by the contractors and partly by the RHD.
In the Credit Documents, the Association has received assurances that
appropriate and sufficient RHD equipment in sound condition will be
available for this work.
Construction of the Sitalakhya River Bridge
13.       The major river crossing on the Dacca-Chittagong Highway included
in the project is the 1,300 ft long bridge over the Sitalakhya River and
its approach embankments. The bridge will replace two ferry operations
across the Sitalakhya River: one at the bridge site and the other approxi-
mately two miles upstream at Demra.
1/   Of the original six contracts, two were with the same firm.    Of the
other four firms, one dropped out because of the death of the owner
and the other due to lack of interest by the contractor. The work
was thus reallocated among three of the original firms, in three con-
tracts.



14.       When work stopped at the end of 1971, out of seven piers, three
caissons for pier foundations were partially completed and coffer-dams
for two more caissons were also constructed. The contractor, who had
been selected after international competitive bidding, has a large quantity
of equipment and material on the site and in the port of Chittagong.
Construction therefore could be resumed promptly and the contractor has
stated his interest in continuing the work. The Government has indicated
that it regards completion of this work to be of high priority.
15.       Protracted negotiations have taken place between the Government and
the contractor to establish a new agreement. While a tentative price has been
determined which is the basis of the cost estimates in this technical note
the two parties have not come to terms completely. Alternatively, the
Government is investigating the possibility of having the work performed by
a joint venture of U.S. contractors who are building a group of bridges under
USAID financing to the West of Dacca or by an association between the
Japanese and U.S. firms. Any of the three alternatives would provide an
acceptable basis for executing the work and the cost of completing the work
would be about the same. It is expected that a contract with one or the
other contractor will be concluded shortly. However, if it is not possible
to negotiate a contract with a firm with appropriate equipment already in
Bangladesh, the cost of building the bridge would increase substantially
and a new appraisal would be required. Therefore the Credit Agreement
provides that if no contract has been concluded for completion of the bridge
by December 31, 1973, this element of the project will be dropped and the
credit reduced by US$4.7 million.
Repair and Improvement of War-Damaged Bridge over River Surma at Sylhet
16.       This bridge is on the main road from Bangladesh to Assam and also
links the commercial area of Sylhet with its neighboring villages. The total
length of the 20 span steel structure is 1,150 ft with a 240 ft truss span
over the main channel to provide for navigation. During hostilities one 100
ft span and three adjoining 40 ft spans were destroyed and one pier was
partly demolished. Traffic was resumed by the construction of a 220 ft
long Bailey bridge to replace the damaged spans. The bridge carries a large
volume of traffic. The existing structure is only 18 ft wide and this is
further restricted to 12 ft by the Bailey bridge; thus the bridge is very
congested. Estimated daily traffic at present is 500 motor vehicles and 5,000
other vehicles plus pedestrians and is expected to grow by about 3% per annum.
As the structure was already inadequate for traffic before it was damaged,
the addition of two footways is contemplated to separate pedestrians and
possibly bicycle rickshaws from motorized traffic.
Consulting Services
17.       The largest item under this category is the supervision of
construction of the works described above. The feasibility study and detailed
engineering for a new crossing over the River Surma at Sylhet is intended to
examine a more permanent solution to the congestion problems of the
existing bridge. While repairs and improvements to the existing structure



- 7 -
are justified as an interim measure, the traffic potential is sufficiently
large to contemplate a second crossing.
18.       The other consultancy items are concerned primarily with the
problem of road/river crossings. Similar work had been included in the
previous project but consultants had not yet been selected before the
outbreak of hostilities. The numerous water channels of Bangladesh put
frequent obstacles in the paths of its road system. The variable height
of the rivers between flood and low water, the navigation requirements for
the large inland water fleet, the scarcity of timber, rock and steel in
the country and the difficult soil conditions raise the cost for constructing
bridges substantially. Therefore, a study of a number of important road/
river crossings is vital to determine the most economic solution for the
relatively low volume of traffic. It will be coupled with a study of ferry
design and operations. Together, the two studies should lead to the formula-
tion of parameters to be used in future bridge and/or ferry design.
Facilities and Services to Improve RHD Operations
19.       When Credit 53-PAK was first made, the road system of Bangladesh
was growing rapidly, but at about 1,800 mi it still was relatively small and
highway administration had been vested in a separate organization only two
years earlier. Since then, the advisory consultants under the previous
project had made studies of the administration, have recommended changes
and assisted in their implementation. As a result, the RID has been somewhat
strengthened. However, further improvements are still needed.
20.       The Ministry of Communications of which the RIID is a part,
proposes to reorganize the RHD taking into account suggestions made by
the previous advisory consultants. The Association provided the services
of a management expert for about 8 weeks last year to assist the
Ministry in planning the reorganization; he may be recalled for a short
period to advise on implementation of the reorganization, and the project
includes a small amount for this purpose. The organizational pattern
envisages greater emphasis than previous organization studies on functional
specialization in planning and design, construction and maintenance, gives
special recognition to importance of ferries in the highway system, and
establishes the basis for improved cost accounting. While the reorganization
has not been put into effect, the Government plans to implement it in the
near future and the Government will keep the Association advised currently
on progress in implementation. The Credit Agreement provides that expanded
maintenance facilities will be established by October 31, 1973. The
reorganization will be facilitated by the provision of a new headquarters
building, which will allow for consolidation of offices now scattered at
several different locations in Dacca. The existing office arrangements are
particularly inadequate in view of the poor telephone connections and urban
transport facilities available in Dacca.
21.       Under the project, the RHD will be improved through the following
measures:



(a)  construction of a fully equipped headquarters building
for the RHD;
(b) acquisition of spare parts, tools and workshops equipment
to restore the present stock of RHD equipment to full
operability;
(c)  acquisition of tools for maintenance depots for RFD equipment;
(d) training of RHD staff under a comprehensive program to be
prepared by the RID in collaboration with the Association; and
(e) attachment of several foreign experts to the RHD for two or
more years in such specialties as soils and materials testing,
bridge engineering and cost accounting.
The Government expects to rely primarily on bilateral grants for item (e),
but in other respects these project elements are to be assisted with
financing under the proposed Credit. With the improvement included under
the project, the RHD should be in a position to maintain the expanded road
network now under its jurisdiction and to sustain a considerably enlarged
volume of road construction or improvement. In order to plan for a rational
implementation of these elements of the project, the Credit Agreement includes
an undertaking that the Borrower will furnish the Association for its approval
at the earliest practicable date and in any event not later than October
31, 1973: (a) requirements for the design of the new headquarters building;
(b) a list of repairable equipment owned by KHD together with a time phased
schedule for the restoration of equipment to operating condition, with
detailed lists of manpower, parts and tools, together with the estimated
costs of this restoration progra m and for keeping such equipment in operating
condition; (c) a list of tools, with estimated costs, required in maintenance
depots for RED equipment; (d) a detailed training program keyed to the
requirements of the reorganized RHD, with estimated costs; (e) the arrangements
RHD has made for technical assistance from bilateral sources and any addi-
tional technical assistance RHD desires to have financed under the proposed
credit, with estimated costs.
22.       A small amount has been included in the project to cover any necessary
expenses incident to adapting the existing ferry crossings on the Dacca-
Chittagong road (including the one at the Sitalakhya Bridge site) to loaded
truck traffic. At present, these ferry crossings are not open to loaded
trucks thereby creating a serious obstacle to the development of this traffic
which is required to use an inadequate, infrequently operated, circuitous
ferry service between Daudkandi and Narayanganj. The required alterations
can be made quickly and would yield great benefits to he economy, as they
only involve minor modifications of the ferries and installation of larger
pontoons. The Credit Agreement includes an undertaking by the Government
that it will make the alternations promptly and that all ferries will be
opened to loaded trucks not later than March 31, 1974. An undertaking to
provide adequate ferry services on the two largest of the river crossings
had already been included in Section 2.09 of the Project Agreement under
Credit 53-PAK.

23.       In accordance with previous requirements, execution of the major
construction included in the project will be supervised by consultants
acceptable to the Association; if the work is to resume promptly the Government
should appoint consultants as soon as possible. Supervision so far has been
satisfactorily carried out by Amman & Whitney (US) who are likely to continue
in this capacity. The Credit Agreement also includes a provision that
consultants, acceptable to the Association, will be employed promptly under
terms and conditions approved by the Association, for feasibility and design
study of a new crossing over the River Surma at Sylhet, for prefeasibility
studies of river crossings, for advisory services on ferries including
preparation of standard ferry designs and for design and construction at
the new RHD headquarters building.
24.       It is estimated that construction works under the project and
other project elements will be completed by the last quarter of 1976.
The schedule is based on the assumption that the shortened Feni Road and
the Sitalakhya Bridge are to be built basically in accordance with the
existing designs, and construction will begin at the start of the next dry
season in October 1973. Construction of the Feni Road will help to
develop the local construction industry as all the work is now to be carried
out by domestic firms. Pavement work on the Feni Road and the Sitalakhya
Bridge will be subject to international tender. The repair and improvement
of the Surma River bridge at Sylhet will be carried out by the Indian firm
which originally built that bridge but if satisfactory arrangements cannot be
made with that firm, a contractor will be selected by international tender.
The new RHD headquarters building will be constructed in accordance with the
Government's usual procedures for works of this type, relying primarily on local
resources for design and construction. Procurement of equipment and spares
will be by international tender except in the case of proprietary items which i
will be ordered from the respective manufacturer. Disbursement will be for
the full foreign exchange component of directly imported items and in the case
of construction contracts for a percentage of payments made under these
contracts, covering 100% of the foreign expenditures and, in most cases, 50%
of the local expenditures.
D. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Prolect Cost
25.       The estimated cost of the project, shown in detail in Table 4,
are summarized below:

*Includes costs accrued prior to June 30, 1973.
The contingency item is based on a 10% physical contingency for the road
works remaining to be performed which appears adequate in view of the fact
that the works are in the process of construction. A 15% contingency for
price escalation (based on 5% per annum increase on the value of the
unbuilt works over the construction period) was deemed necessary in view
of the fact that the contracts will most likely include clauses which
relieve the contractors of certain risks regarding prices. A contingency
of 30% for other elements of the project was deemed necessary because the
content of these elements remains to be defined in detail.
26.       Revised cost estimates for the Feni Road and the Sitalakhya Bridge
are based on the prices tentatively agreed in the negotiations between the
Government and the contractors. The cost of work on the existing bridge
over the River Surma at Sylhet is based on an estimate prepared by Ammann
and Whitney. Other items to be financed under the project, primarily
consultancy services, are costed on the basis of prevailing rates in the
world market.
Project Financing
27.       The total cost of the project excluding taxes and duties is
estimated at US$40.4 million equivalent, with a foreign component of
about US$19.3 million. It is proposed to finance about US$5.7 million
equivalent of local costs under the proposed credit. About US$8.8 million
equivalent of local costs has already been financed primarily by the
Government and the remaining amount of local costs of about US$6.7 million
equivalent will also be financed by the Government.
28.       The disbursement schedule is indicated in the following table and
is based on a project implementation as outlined above:



- 11 -
Fiscal Year
US$ Million Equivalent
1973/74  1974/75   1975/76  1976/77  1977/78  Total

The amount to be disbursed represents the estimated future costs of the project,
US$26.69 million, plus US$3.86 million of costs incurred prior to June 30,1973,
including US$3.62 million of disbursements under the previous credit plus re-
financing of the interim Swedish credit and unpaid obligations of foreign
suppliers to the project. The disbursement schedule reflects the pace of
construction expenditures as forecast by the consultant; the heavy outlays
in FY 1976/77 are due to the large paving costs which will be incurred at that
time.
E. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
The Feni Road and the qit:b8khva Bridge
29.       Considerable expenditures had already been incurred both in the
design and construction of these project elements prior to the suspension
of disbursements by IDA on December 29, 1971. The benefits anticipated from
completing the project include: (a) cost savings in the operation of existing
motor traffic (due to shorter jour rey distance, faster transit time, improve-
ment in the quality of the road and the elimination of speed changes);
(b) reduced expenditures for ferry operations (at the Sitalakhya bridge);
(c) secondary developmental effects achieved by bringing the nation's two
most important urban centers closer together in time and distance, thereby
facilitating the movement of essential goods and stimulating the trade
between them; (d) bringing the rural areas served by the road into closer
contact with urban markets, thereby facilitating the shift from subsistence
to market-oriented agriculture; and (e) enabling new urban and industrial
development near the outskirts of Dacca in the area served by the Sitalakhya
Bridge, taking advantage of the good river and rail transport facilities
there.
30.       In 1969, prior to the 1970 revision of the project, an assessment
of the economic return on the Feni Road and the Sitalakhya Bridge indicated
a rate of 18 percent and 10 percent respectively. The Feni Road was
justified on expected savings in vehicle operating costs as a result of
shorter journey distance, faster transit time, improvement in the quality
of the road, and a reduction in speed changes by avoiding the busy town



- 12 -
of Feni. The expected benefits of the Sitalakhya Bridge were from savings
in the vehicle and passenger time costs absorbed in crossing the river by
ferry and the avoidance of higher cost ferry services needed to handle
growing traffic volumes. Since then, the decline in traffic due to the
economic disruption caused by the 1970 cyclone and the 1971 hostilities
with the resultant loss and damage to the vehicle fleet and the increases
in costs appear to have reduced the previously estimated returns considerably
- to 9 percent and 4 percent respectively; however, given the increased
uncertainties attached to these re-evaluation estimates, the Government's
public commitment to complete these conspicuously unfinished works which had
been initiated with IDA finance, and the merit of IDA's continued association
to help ensure the effective strengthening of RHD, the project is recommended
for completion. While construction at the Sitalakhya Bridge and the Feni
Road would benefit some of the same flow of traffic, the two improvements
are essentially independent of each other. For that reason a delay in the
execution of the Sitalakhya Bridge which might result from problems with
contractors (see paragraph 15 above) would not affect the appropriateness
of proceeding to complete the Feni Road works.
Repair and Improvement of Bridge over Surma River at Sylhet
31.       Work on this bridge will not only eliminate long delays now caused
by queues waiting to cross its narrow Bailey bridge section, but, with the
addition of footways, will separate the slower moving from the faster traffic
with benefits to both. While in the present circumstances for the reasons
given above, a reliable quantification of costs and benefits is not possible,
the proposed reconstruction will improve the capacity of the structure.
Other Project Elements
32.       The other project elements, aimed at improving the organization and
management of the highway sector through provison of f-acilities and
equipment, training, technical assistance and selected sudies, would also
yield significant yet unquantifiable returns. The anticipated increase in
the efficiency of ferry operations will yield very high returns by making
possible both better utilization of the country's motor vehicle fleet and
also postponement of costly bridge construction.   The improvements of RHD
are intended both to make the design and construcion of new roads less costly
and less dependent on imported expertise and also to improve the upkeep of
roads.
F. RECONMENDATIONS
33.       During credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:



- 13 -
(a)  equipment required by the contractors on the Feni Road, to
the extent not furnished by them directly, will be available
from the RHD (para 12);
(b)  the Government will keep the Association currently informed
on implementation of reorganization of RIID (para 20);
(c)  the Government will furnish to the Association by October 31, 1973:
(i)  requirements for the design of the new RHD headquarters
building;
(ii)  a list of repairable equipment owned by RHD, together
with a time phased schedule for its restoration to
operating condition and with detailed lists of manpower,
parts and tools, togeher with esimated costs, required
for this purpose and for keeping such equipment in
operating condition;
(iii)  a list of tools, with estimated costs, required in
maintenance depots for RHD equipment;
(iv)  a detailed training program keyed to the requirements of
of the reorganized RHD, with estimated costs;
(v) the arrangements RHD has made for technical assistance
from bilateral sources and any additional technical
assistance RHD desires to have financed under the
proposed credit, with estimated costs (para 21);
(d)  The Government will open the ferry crossings on the Dacca-
Chittagong road to loaded truck traffic not later than
March 31, 1974 (para 22);
(e)  The Government will employ consultants satisfactory to the
Association:
(i) for supervision of construction of the Feni Road and the
Sitalakhya Bridge;
(ii)  for feasibility and design study of a new crossing over
the River Surma at Sylhet and the engineering or
supervision of construction required for repair of the
existing bridge;
(iii)  for prefeasibility studies of certain river crossings
selected by the transport survey currently underway;
(iv)  for advisory services on ferries including
preparation of standard ferry designs;



- 14 -
(v) for design and construction of the new RHD
headquarters building (para 23).
(f) Unless a contract for completion of the Sitalakhya
Bridge has been executed by December 31, 1973 this
element of the project is to be deleted and the credit
reduced by US$4.7 million.
Items (d) and (e) are similar to assurances provided in Sections 2.09 and
2.01 (b) of the Project Agreement under Credit 53-PAK.
34.       The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$25.0
million to Bangladesh.
