TUNISIA                      FOR OFFCIACL USE ONLY
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMET LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Tunisia
Amount:               US$150 million equivalent
Terms:                17 years, including five years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Description:          The proposed loan would support the medium-term
macroeconomic adjustment program of the Government and
the objectives of the VII Plan (1987-1991). The main
areas covered under the program are: i) measures to
continue the progress achieved to date-on liberalization
of trade and producer prices, and to start a gradual
liberalization of distribution margins; ii) improvements
in the system of direct and indirect taxation through
changes in the consumption taxes and introduction of a
Value Added Tax and of a new law on direct taxes;
iii) reforms in the financial system, including higher
interest rates on preferential credits and on treasury
bonds, a more effective treatment of the exchange risk on
foreign denominated debt and a review of the commercial
bank interest rate spread cap.
Program Benefits:    The objective of the program would be to implement policy
changes that would allow Tunisia to achieve sustained
growth in the framework of an internally and externally
balanced economy, that would provide the basis for
employment creation. The adjustment program is essential
in assisting in the transition from an economy largely
dependent on oil exports to an oil importing one. In
addition, the reforms supported by the loan would
reaffirm Tunisia's position as a creditworthy borrower
and facilitate external flows needed to finance the
country' s development.
Program Risks:        The program is a major part of the far-reaching shift
that has been taking place from a highly dirigiste system
to a fairly liberalized economy, and some of the measures
contemplated might face strong opposition and might be
difficult to implement. The expected reduction in
consumer subsidies, in particular, is a sensitive
political issue after the reductions in real wages in
recent years. The risks are considered to be justified
based on the progress in implementation to date, the
general quality of Tunisia's administrative system, the
political cohesion shown recently by the country, and the
commitment toward the program's objectives shown by the
new governement.

REPORT AND RECOMMENATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
[N AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$150 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
INTRODUCTION
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of $150 million to the Republic of Tunisia. The loan would
support the program of structural adjustment presented in the Government's
VIIth Development Plan (1987-91). The new Tunisian Government, established in
November 1987, is committed to continuing the program of macroeconomic and
sectoral reforms initiated in 1987 and supported by two Bank sector adjustment
operations. The proposed loan would assist the authorities in implementing
economic policies aiming at sustained growth and external and internal
economic equilibrium. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including five
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Ekbround.  Tunisia is a medium-sized, middle-income country, with
a population of 7.5 million and a per capita income of US$1,130. Much of the
country is arid or semi-arid. Only 3 percent of arable land is irrigated and
rain-fed agriculture is subject to severe year-to-year fluctuations in
rainfall. Nevertheless, agriculture still occupies nearly a third of the
labor force. Tunisia's most important raw materials are petroleum, natural
gas, and phosphates. Output of known exploitable teserves of oil and gas is
diminishing because of depletion, and the limited new reserves require costly
off-shore drilling.  Unless large new oil and gas reserves are discovered, the
rise in domestic energy demand is expected to turn Tunisia into a net oil
importer in 1990. The low quality of phosphate deposits constrains the
expansion of the Tunisian phosphate processing industry. The country also has
a considerable tourist industry with much further potential.
3.       Tunisia has undertaken a massive effort to develop its human
resources, paying special attention to family welfare, and education. As a
result, between the early 1960s and 1985, infant mortality declined from
almost 160 to 60 per thousand, life expectancy at birth rose from 48 to
62 years, adult literacy increased from 15 percent to 62 percent, and calorie
intake per capita increased from 95 percent to 121 percent of minimum standard
requirements. An active family planning policy led to a decrease in birth
rates by 27 percent between 1965 and 1985. But mortality declined by
45 percent, so that population growth continues at 2.5 percent p.a.. The
population has a young age structure, which, together with the increasing
entry of women into the labor force, has caused the labor force to grow faster



le$ss
-2-
than population.  The effect on unemployment, which reached 14 percent in 1987
and particularly affects young entrants into the labor force.-is a major
concern of the Government.
4.       During the 1970s the Tunisian economy performed strongly, aided by
oil exports. GDP growth averaged 7.4 percent a year over the decade and
non-oil exports grew at over 10 percent p.a. on the average. All sectors did
well, especially manufacturing, whose share in GDP and exports increased
substantially. Although the non-oil ICOR for the second half of the decrde
was 4.9, it was not high compared to the levels of similarly placed
countries. To a great extent the rapid growth of GDP was due to high levels
of investment, about 30 percent of GDP, which was compatible with a
respectable growth of per capita consumption and a modest level of external
financing, thanks to earnings from oil. The current account deficit averaged
'-6 percent of GDP, though there was a brief increase in 1976-78 to a peak of
11 percent of GDP, which the resurgence of oil prices reduced again without
necessitating cutting back investment or consumption. Since Tunisia attracted
considerable foreign investment, it had no difficulty in completing the
financing of the current account by foreign borrowing. The country emerged
from the decade with a modest increase in its external debt to 42 percent of
GDP in 1979, as compared to 38 percent in 1970, and a debt service ratio of
only 10 percent. Domestic inflation remained below world levels, averaging
6.1 percent a year. This overall performance of the economy, including the
rapid growth of exports, was helped by an almost uninterrupted depreciation of
the Tunisian Dinar in real effective terms. From 1970 to 1979 the
depreciation amounted to 17 percent.
5.       This performance had three flaws.  Firstly, unemployment remained
high, a situation that has persisted and is a major concern of the
authorities. Secondly, certain industries, both public and private, have
experienced difficulties. Some, such as the motor vehicle assembly plant,
which has recently been closed, were too ambitious and dependent on excessive
protection to be viable. Others, such as the phosphate mines and related
chemicals complex, have been the victims of depressed world prices for their
products. Thirdly, the authorities did not begin early enough to adjust the
economy to the decline in oil extraction they foresaw would begin around 1980
and were taken by surprise whet oil prices fell rapidly in 1986.
6.       1980-84: Deteriorating economic performance.  Difficulties began in
earnest in the 1980s: although oil production began to decline as expected
and, in addition, world oil prices fell, the necessary economic adjustments
were slow in coming. The VIth Plan (1982-86) did, in fact, envisage the
slowing down of greowth and, accordingly, proposed maintaining internal and
external stability by reducing the investment rate, increasing emphasis on
exports, and slowing the growth of recurrent budget expenditures. To promote
job creation it envisaged a shift to more labor-intensive investment. Butt in
fact, these objectives were not pursued. Instead, from 1980 to 1984,
investment remained high, around 32 percent of GDP. The greater part of
investment was in the public sector and included a number of large capital
intensive projects yielding few jobs and low economic returns. The five-year
non-oil ICOR for this period was 6.0. Wages increased substantially faster
than productivity, further reducing the demand for labor. Inflation rose to
an average of 10.0 percent p.a., and exports slowed. The current account



-3-
deficit grew to 10.9 percent of GDP in 1984. These expansionary policies kept
growth high; it averaged 4.5 percent for the period, despite a drought in
1982 that slightly reduced GDP. But they depended on heavy external
borrowing, which, though managed with care, raised Tunisia's external debt
(public and publicly guaranteed) to 47 percent of GDP and the debt service
ratio to 21 percent. The Government attempted to restrain its expenditures;
nonetheless, the overall budget deficit stayed close to 6.7 percent of GDP.
7.       1985-87: Stabilization and the stat of adjustment. By 1985 Tunisia had
begun to experience difficulties in obtaining external financing for its high
current account deficit and it became clear that a balance of payments crisis
was threatening. Accordingly, after responding with some initial restrictive
measures, the Government began a process of policy revision that has broadened
into a wide-ranging process of structural adjustment. Its first step was to
restrict imports. This succeeded in bringing the current account deficit down
to 7.1 percent of GDP, but, as usual with such controls, it led to shortages
of raw materials and spare parts, and to biases against exports. The
Government also reduced its investment, which had accounted for most of total
investment. By these measures and by mobilizing donor support, it avoided a
full crisis. But it recognized that it had a large external debt burden and,
as Tunisia's oil reserves ran out, the resources available to the public
sector would diminish and the importance of non-oil exports would grow.
Hence. the role of the public sector would need to contract in favor of the
private sector. The Government also recognized that economic incentives were
distorted and that the incentives structure would need to change for an
efficient and active private sector to develop. In particular, the Government
would need to make the economy more outward oriented, reduce administrative
controls, reform the tax system, and improve the efficiency of financial
intermediation. In August 1986 it announced a program prepared along these
lines in dialogue wish the Bank and IMF to lay the basis for sustained growth
and to stabilize the economy. A full description of Tunisia's adjustment
objectives is presented in the document of the VIIth Plan (1987-91).
8.       The commitment of the Government to economic adjustment and its
productive dialogue with the Bank have led to substantial support by the Bank
and other donors. The medium-term program of adjustment and stabilization was
outlined by the Government in its Letter of Development Policy requesting the
Bank's support for an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL, approved by
the Board on September 1986) and an Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan
(ITPAL, approved by the Board on February 1987), and the accomparying Letters
of Sector Adjustment Policy. A full and updated description of Tunisia's
adjustment objectives followed in the VIIth Plan document. The ASAL supported
Tunisia's adjustment in tLe agricultural sector with a loan of the equivalent
of $150 million. The focus, among a range of actions, was on the prices and
incentives framework and on public investment. The ITPAL, also for the
equivalent of $150 million, focused mainly on tariff adjustments, price
decontrol and fiscal reform. The Bank convened a Donors' Meeting in 1987, at
which Tunisia presented its adjustment program to donors and successfully
mobilized considerable support.
9.       The IMF has supported Tunisia with a Stand-by arrangement for the
period November 1986 to May 1988 for the equivalent of SDR 104 million



768S8
-4-
(75 percent of quota) and for purchases of the equivalent of SDR 115 million
under the compensatory financing facility.
10.      The Government's stabilization measures have reduced the imbalances
in the budget and the external current account and have established the
conditions for carrying on the liberalization program begun in 1986. The
Dinar was devalued 23 percent in nominal terms in 1986, yielding a 17 percent
depreciatiou in real terms over the year. Wage increases have been tightly
restrained, so that real wages in 1987 were below their level in 1984. Total
investment fell sharply in 1985 and 1986 to about 23.5 percent of GDP, since
when it has remained at 21-22 percent. The devaluation and demand restraint
caused the volume of imports to fall sharply, and by 1987 it was 19.3 percent
below its 1984 level. Non-oil exports responded strongly to the devaluation;
their 1987 volume exceeded that in 1984 by 32 percent. Remittances from
Tunisians abroad also picked up: in 1987 they were 38 percent above their 1984
level in dollar terms. As a consequence the current account deficit declined
to 1.5 percent of G.)P in 1987 and the Government deficit, net of amortization,
to 3.4 percent. Inflation over 1985-87 was reduced to about 7 percent p.a.
External debt (public nA pvMlicly guaranteed), nevertheless, continued to
increase. MLT debt rose from $3,757 million at the beginning of 1985 to
$5,450 million at the end of 1987, reaching 57 percent of GDP, while the debt
Pervice ratio rose to 25 percent.
L1.      Exogenous factors considerably affected the economy's performance and
were, on the whole, unfavorable. In 1985 difficulties with Libya led to the
repatriation of 30-35,000 Tunisian workers, thus ending their remittances and
most exports to that country. The process of settling the dispute began in
1987 and is continuing. Regional security problems also reduced the number of
tourists substantially, until the dissipation of the apprehensions of
potential tourists, aided by the cheaper Dinar, caused it to increase sharply
in 1987. The drop in oil prices caused a big loss of income for Tunisia and
accounted for nearly all of a 15 percent deterioration in the country's terms
of trade. Agriculture renged between extremes on account of fluctuations in
rainfall. 1985 was a record year, with a cereal harvest 58 percent above the
average of the previous five years, and 1987 was almost as good. But 1986 was
an exceptionally poor year and the prospects for 1988 are worse. The outcome
of these conflicting factors has been that GDP grew 5.7 percent in 1985 and
5.8 percent in 1987, but declined 1.6 percent in 1986. The average annual
growth for the three years was 3.2 percent.
12.      Prospects for 1988. 1988 will be a difficult year because of severe
drought followed by locust infestation and continuing low oil prices. GDP
growth is projected at 1.8 percent. Rural incomes will be seriously affected
and import requirements for additional food and animal feed will be
considerable. Even with a continuation of recent favorable trends in
remittances by Tunisians abroad, the current account deficit is expected to
rise to 4.6 percent of GDP. However, Tunisia has successfully mobilized
concessional external assistance to finance the increase in imports due to the
poor harvest, which will help the Government continue its program of import
liberalization without significantly increasing austerity.

PAR.T E - TMIE ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM: 1987-91
13.     The SAL wouid support the comprehensive medium term adjustment
program that the Government has presented in its VIIth Plan (1987-91).
Successful implementation would constitute the transition to an appropriate
economic structure and set of incentivea for more rapid and efficient growth
after 1991. The proposed policies would deepen and extend the adjustment that
has been taking place, notably under the Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment
Loan (ITPAL) and the first Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL I), and
are intended to help the economy face the challenge posed by Tunisia's debt
burden and the loss of oil revenues. They would do this by adjusting the
expenditures of the State to take account of the debt burden and the decline
in oil revenues; creating conditions for rapid growth of an economically
efficient private sector; and strengFhening the increasing export orientation
of the economy. The Plan places these objectives in a consistent
macroeconomic framework that balances growth targets against a prudent
assessment of economic constraints.
14.      The SAL would, in particular, support the establishment of an
economically efficient structure of incentives through action in three
domains. Firstly, it would support liberalization of external trade, notably
the reduction of import restrictions, and the decontrol of prices. Secondly,
it would help improve the efficiency of financial intermediation by bringing
interest rates closer to market levels, improving the treatment of foreign
exchange risk, and increasing competition among financial institutions.
Thirdly, it would support ref sm of direct and indirect taxation. The
framework of these reforms wouiu be a medium term macroeconomic program
reflected in a set of projections based on recent developments and a
monitorable set of indicators to determine any additional measures that might
be needed in case of shortfall from the program's targets.
15.     Complementing the SAL, loans are-under preparation for public
enterprises restructuring, (PERL), a second agricultural adjustment program
(ASAL II), and an education sector loan. The PERL would seek to improve
management and competitiveness of publtc enterprises, support the
privatization effort, and support the financial/technical rehabilitation of
certain enterprises where it is warranted. ASAL II would continue the reforms
in the agricultural sector begun under ASAL I (see paragraph 81 below) and
would, among other things, continue the alignment of producer prices with
international prices, reduce consumer subsidies and reduce the subsidies on
lending to t2  sector.  The education sector loan would address issues of
resource all ..ation and financing for human capital formation and could be
extended to deal with aspects of social policy beyond education itself.
The Macroeconomic Program
16.     The challenge before the macroeconomic program is considerable and
obliges the Government to tread a narrow path between austerity and growth.
Population is growing at 2.5 percent p.a. and the labor force is increasing
slightly faster as more women seek employment. Consequently, growth sustained
by productivity increases must be as high as external and internal
macroeconomic constraints allow. The external constraint is tight, since



76S 5
-6-
external medium and long term publicly guaranteed debt is at present about
58 percent of GDP, with a debt service ratio of around 24.7 percent, while oil
extraction is expecte_ to decline at close to 5 percent annually, making
Tunisia a net oil importer by 1990. The budgetary constraint is tight as
well; servicing of debt on government account is projected to reach
9.1 percent of GDP by 1991, when budgetary revenues from oil will have
declined to 3 parcent of GDP, from a peak of 8.2 percent in 1982
17.      Plan scenarios.  The Government has revised its original projections
for the Plan period to take into account the unexpectedly strong economic
performance of 1987, while retaining its growth strategy (See Table 1). Its
overall growth target has been slightly raised, though agricultural growth is
marginally lower. External MLT debt, which was originally to be reduced by
7 percentage points of GDP, would under the revised target be reduced by
10 points. This implies a reduction of the current account deficit from
2.8 percent of GDP in the original projections to 2.4 percent. Under the new
projections, exports would increase 6.4 percent p.a. in volume terms,
entailing a 8.7 percent annual increase in non-oil exports. Imports would
increase at an annual average of 2.1 perce-nt. The resource gap would be kept
at its sharply reduced level of 1987 by keeping a fairly constant investment
rate, since the domestic saving rate is expected to remain close to 20 percent
of GDP.
18.      Given the very unfavorable weather conditions in 1988, some of the
targets will be hard to achieve. It would, in any case, be prudent to lower
the assumed agricultural growth rate since, though it is not out of line with
the performance of recent years, it presupposes a run of relatively good
years. In fact the drought and locust infestation of 1988 will affect the
crop in 1989 as well. Another respect in which the Plan projections seem
optimistic is the extent to which the current account deficit in the balance
of payments can be reduced by slowing growth of imports, especially in view of
the economic liberalization that is taking place. In order to take these
considerations into account, the Bank staff have prepared a revised set of
projections.
19.      Revised Scenario.  A somewhat lower growth of agriculture and less
stringent balance of payments targets are the main differences between the
Baak staff and revised Plan projections. Agricultural growth is projected to
increase at 4.1 percent p.a. on average, a rate that is realistic and
respectable, though well below the revised Plan rate of 5.1 percent. The
balance of payments targets are eased by reducing the MLT debt reduction
target to 3.8 percentage points, rather than the revised Plan target of
10 points (See Table 1). This permits an average real growth of imports of
2.8 percent p.a. Exports are adjusted down slightly to an average real growth
of a little less than 6 percent a year. This still implies a fairly high
annual rate for non-oil exports of a little above 8 percent, though the
performance of recent years indicates that this growth is reasonable. The
resulting resource gap would remain in the range of 3-4 percent of GDP,
somewhat above the revised Plan projection. This and a marginally lower share
of investment in GDP are reflected in a saving rate that is about one
percentage point below that assumed in the revised Plan projections.
Consumption would increase at 3.2 percent p.a., or 0.7 percent p.a. per
capita. This is the scenario that has been agreed with the Tunisian
authorities as the basis for the macroeconomic monitoring and review under the
proposed loan.

20.      External debt.  The transitional character of the adjustment program
over the VIIth Plan period is illustrated by the fact that Tunisia's external
debt situation will not improve decisively during the period. This is part of
the cost of economic adjustment, while conditions are established for a
considerable improvement beginning at the end of the period. This should
enable Tunisia to obtain foreign private financing more easily in the later
years of the Plan period. Apart from the time it takes for Tunisia to reduce
its resource gap, the two main obstacles in the way of a more rapid decline in
the debt to GDP ratio are the 1iminution of oil extraction and the necessary
increase in international reserves. If oil extraction remained at its 1986
level at the same prices, the cumulative gain over 1987-91 would be
$555 million dollars, i.e. 4.6 percent of GDP, and the reduction in external
debt that much greater, without even allowing for the saving in interest
costs. Reserves have to be increased from the low level in 1986, equivalent
to 1.3 months' imports of goods and non-factor services, to 2.2 months'
imports, resulting in a foregone debt reduction of $346 million, or
2.9 percent of GDP. Two other factors will add to a smaller degree to
external debt. One is the additional borrowing necessary because of the
exceptionally bad agricultural year in 1988. The other is the hardening of
borrowing terms from 1990 on. The average spread over LIBOR is expected to
increase from zero or less to 2 percent and the average maturity to drop from
15 years to 13 (see Annex II, Table II).

-8-
21.     The period from 1991 to 1995 will give greater scope for reduction of
external debt. By then the resource gap will have narrowed sufficiently to
permit imports to grow almost as fast as exports. Although oil production is
expected to continue to decline, its weight in the economy will have
decreased. Reserves would continue to grow faster than imports, but more
slowly than in the previous period since they would be closer to desirable
levels. Barring more years as bad as 1988 and a further hardening of
borrowing terms, Tunisia should be able to reduce its debt to GDP ratio to
52 percent and reduce its debt service ratio to 23 percent by 1995.
22.     Public expenditures.  A heavy debt service and diminishing oil
revenues, combined with the Government's objective of restraining its overall
deficit, imply a substantial reduction in government expenditures in relation
to GDP. It would not conform to the Government's objectives to increase
taxation to offset the debt service and loss of oil revenues. Consequently,
revenues are expected to grow in line with past trends, except where fiscal
reforms change the incidence or yield of taxes. Official projections have
been prepared in discussion with the Bank and IMF staffs and conform to the
Bank staff's growth projections. Revenues are expected to decline from
29 percent of GDP in 1987 to 26 percent in 1991, including a drop in budgetary
revenues from oil equivalent to 1.9 percentage points of GDP. Amortization of
external debt will increase from the equivalent of 3.9 percent of GDP in 1987
to 4.1 percent in 1991, though amortization of internal debt will remain
constant at 2.0 percent. Since the objective is to reduce the overall
deficit, net of amortization, to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1991, as compared to
3.4 percent in 1987, total government expenditures must decline from
38.3 percent of GDP to 34.0 percent. Net of amortization they must decline
from 32.5 percent to 27.8 percent.
23.     The reduction will be mainly achieved by a greater decline in
government recurrent expenditures to achieve a budgetary saving target
equivalent to 5 percent of GDP. Recurrent expenditures will fall from
24 percent of GDP in 1987 to 21 percent in 1991. Virtually all the fall will
result from restraining i) the operating budget, ii) consumer subsidies, and
iii) transfers to cover the operating losses of public enterprises. The
operating budget would be reduced as a share of GDP by restricting the average
annual growth of government employment to 2 percent and by keeping the growth
of earnings per employee slightly below inflatien.  As a percentage of GDP,

the government salary bill would decline from 10.7 percent in 1987 to
10.1 percent in 1991. Within these limits, the Government is introducing
merit increases, so that some civil servants would have earnings growth
greater than inflation and others less. A salary increase that has been
awarded is being deferred over two years to have a minimal effect on the total
salary bill. Consumer subsidies would be limited by a ceiling for the Plan
period that would effect a substantial reduction over what they would be in
the absence of action.  They would fall from 2.5 percent of GDP in 1987 to
1.6 percent in 1991. The strategy for achieving the limit is discussed in
paragraphs 49 to 52.
24.      A number of public enterprises are a serious drain on government
resources because of their operating losses. The transfers to cover these
losses take several forms as explicit budget subsidies, but are also implicit
subsidies in the form of arrears on taxes and repayment of loans. In certain
cases, such as the railways, the losses are primarily due to unviable
investments of recent years and inadequate prices, whereas in the cases of the
phosphate mines (Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa--CPG) end the related
chemical complex (Groupe Chimique) they arise from depressed world prices and
overstaffing. However, the drastic action needed to cut operating losses will
cause social and political difficulties, especially with the phosphate mines,
which are the main source of income for a whole region. The Government is
putting annual ceilings on total transfers from government account to cover
the operating losses of public enterprises, which should result in a
diminution of these transfers from 1.6 percent of GDP in 1987 to 1.0 percent
in 1991. It has, moreover, requested the Bank's assistance in addressing the
issue of reducing the losses of a number of major public enterprises through a
Public Enterprise Restructuring Loan (PERL), which is under preparation. This
should result in a substantial improvement in the financial results of these
enterprises, in the medium term, though it will first entail major investments
and adjustments.
25.      The Government's policy is to reduce the State's share in investment
and to make it more efficient.  In line with this objective, the Government is
eliminating major unviable projects that have not been started and cutting
back on those that are under way. Government investment will fall from
5.1 percent of GDP in 1986 to 3.9 percent in 1991, whereas investment by
public enterprises will fall from 8.2 percent to 5.7 percent. To ensure that
private investment is not crowded out for lack of credit, a floor is being
placed on domestic credit to the private sector.
26.      The standard of project preparation and programming in Tunisia is, on
the whole, good, but political pressures before November 1987 had led to
substantial investments in large projects that were not justified economically
or socially. These pressures have now been greatly reduced and several
projects whose justification was in question have been dropped. The PERL
would provide a suitable ->ahicle for assessing the viability of certain major
projects that are still included in the VIIth Plan and will determine action
to eliminate or cut them back. Public sector investments in agriculture are
being addressed under ASAL II. On the basis of an analysis in 1985 by Bank
staff of public sector expenditures and of recent data, the Government will
review with Bank staff, as part of the exchanges of views on macroeconomic
policy, the other major public sector investments whose justification is in
doubt to determine appropriate action. The Government is, at the same time,
trying to privatize public enterprises, which will be helped by the

development of the equity market, a program for which it is receiving IFC/UNDP
support (para6raphs 56, 83).
27.      Social costs of adjustment.  Despite the expected overall gains, the
poor will be affected by the reduction in consumption subsidies and
unemployment will persist as a problem. In the absence of the proposed
economic adjustment measures the problems would be worse. Nevertheless, they
are major concerns of the Tunisian authorities, especially in view of
agricultural difficulties in 1988. A number of steps are being to'-en to
mitigate the anticipated hardship. The reduction in subsidies till be
greatest on items with the least redistributive effect so as to minimize the
cost to the poor (see paragraph 52). There are also targeted programs for
helping the poor, such as the Familles N6cessiteuses and subsidized loans for
low income housing. The social security and health care systems are well
developed, though both need strengthening. The Bank is supporting a study of
the social security system to determine how to ensure long term financial
soundness while keeping down contributions by workers, employers, and the
State. An Education, Training and Employment Sector Loan (ETESL) under
preparation would support appropriate reform of the system. Medical care is
widely available at nominal charges, but the health system's further
development requires that a substantial share of costs be recovered through
service charges, with exemptions for the poor. The Bank will support the
Government's efforts to develop and implement a suitable policy through sector
work and a Health and Family Planning Project under preparation.
28.      Unemployment is a long term problem:  because the labor force is
growing even faster than population, it is not expected that the unemployment
rate will diminish significantly during the Plan period, and, according to
longer term projections, it will remain high in the following five years.
Moreover, the problems of agriculture are expected to cost employment
equivalent to 80,000 permanent jobs. Again, the problem would be worse in the
absence of the adjustment program, which reduces the cost of labor relative to
investment. The Plan attempts to reinforce the effects of these relative
prices through a number of schemes to promote labor intensive investment and
self-employment. The Bank is supporting a Small Scale Industries Project
(approved by the Board on February 16, 1988) and the ETESL. The latter loan
would adapt the education and training system better to economic needs, while
addressing a range of issues of labor legislation, wage determination, and
market information that affect employment. It would support efforts to enlist
the private sector in education and training through suitable incentives. A
supplemental budget will mitigate the job losses in 1988 by allocating an
additional D30 million for works programs. D16 million will be financed from
internal and external grants and the rest from internal and external
borrowings. The underlying long term problem, though, is population growth
and the Government is continuing to address it directly through an active
family planning program, and indirectly by changing incentives. The President
has endorsed the concept of the family with three children, and the social
security fund (CNSS) has announced that it will, from January 1, 1989, limit
family allowances to three children, and not four as at present.
29.     Monitoring economic performance.  The macroeconomic scenario that has
been described aims at three major objectives - economic growth, external
equilibrium, and internal equilibrium - and would be supported by the proposed
SAL. To attain them and to establish conditions for sustained growth after
the Plan period presuppose the implementation of the program of reforms of



76SSB
- 11 -
incentives described later in this part of the report, which would also be
supported by the SAL.  At the same time, the Governmnt would need to use a
number of key policy instruments to attain its major objectives, and a number
of monitorable indicators has been devised to reflect any shortfalls in
attaining them. Where the indicators show the need for additional action, the
Government would confer with the Bank on the actions to be taken.
30.             For each of the objectives, a set of macroeconomic indicators,
economic policy indicators, and external environment indicators has been
identified and discussed with the Tunisian authorities. They are included
here as Annex II and are accompanied by a technical note providing the
definition and datz source for each indicator. Projections are made beyond
the SAL implementacion period to indicate the agreed medium term prospects.
31.             There would be three sets of policy instruments, corresponding to the
three major objectives (See Table 3). The set corresponding to the growth
objective derives from the premise that growth will be guaranteed most

effectively by private activity under competitive conditions with an
appropriate incentive structure,  This set comprises three instruments to
prevent public sector investment from crowding out private sector access to
resources. A fourth instrument would be freedom of entry into the market for
private firms. The real effective exchange rate measured with respect to 17
trading partners' currencies will be the primary policy indicator influencing
the external balance. Internal balance policy instruments will be income,
fiscal and monetary policies.
32.      Risks in plan implementation.  Alternative scenarios have been
explored to assess potential effects of the four most likely quantifiable
adverse developments on the macroeconomic program. Possible exogenous
environment developments are a deterioration in the terms of trade and lower
agricultural growth due to unfavorable weather conditions. Potential internal
policy developments are a failure to maintain the intended incomes policy for
non-government workers, and a failure to contain budgetary expenditures,
especially current subsidies and transfers.
33.      The likely effects of a deterioration in Tunisia's international
terms of trade - due to lower prices for non-energy, non-agricultural exports
- would, given the estimated price responsiveness of Tunisian imports and
exports, require a stronger real devaluation and would result in lower
consumption and lower imports, but higher debt ratios. Lower agricultural
growth during the last three years of the Plan, accompanied by an increase in
consumer subsidies in line with GDP to offset the higher agricultural prices,
would have a depressing effect on both GDP growth and consumption. A smaller
real devaluation of the exchange rate is implied given the lower import
demands of reduced GDP growth and the low export-orientation of agriculture.
Although other effects are also present, in both scenarios budgetary revenues
are sensitive to the relative price of traded versus non-traded goods since an
increase in the former generates higher indirect taxes. Hence, a stronger
real devaluation results in higher government saving and a weaker devaluation
results in lower government saving, as compared to the base case.
34.      Failure by the Government to maintain its intended incomes policy for
non-government workers would have several effects. If the real wage were to
remain constant, instead of declining annually by 2 percent as anticipated
under the Government's plans to limit nominal increases in the minimum wages
for agricultural and industrial workers, employment growth would, of course,
be lower, and unemployment would rise to 18 percent, as compared to about
15 percent in the base case projections. Finally, an increase in budgetary
current transfers and subsidies to public enterprises will lower aggregate
savings and investment, and hence GDP growth. For instance, if an increase
from about D330 million in 1986 to D580 million in 1991 is assumed to take
place starting in 1988, investment would decline slightly in real terms and
average GDP growth for the period would be 0.2 percentage points lower. The
cumulative effect of this development would have an even stronger adverse
effect during the next plan period.
35.      Program to be supported bY the SAL.  Macroeconomic performance would
be monitored on the basis of economic indicators. None of the indicators in
itself would be a performance criterion but they would be evaluated together
in the light of exogenous developments. Where the indicators show performance
shortfalls, appropriate corrective measures would be sought. Where
performance is better than projected, a strengthening of the objectives would



7635S
_ 13 -
be considered. The Government has agreed to review the indicators
periodically with the Bank and agree on appropriate measures, in particular
before second tranche release. It would continue these reviews with the Bank
on a semi-annual basis. In conjunction with these reviews of macroeconomic
performance, the Government would also review with the Bank the progress in
attaining the objective for reducing consumer subsidies, (paragraph 54).
36.      Also in conjunction with the reviews of macroeconomic performance,
the Government would review with the Bank transfers from central government
resources to cover operating losses of public enterprises and agree on
ceilings. It would also discuss the major projects in the public sector with
the Bank and agree on action with regard to those that are not economically or
socially justified.
Reforms of Incentives
Trade and Price    tion
37.      Trade liberalization, in particular reduction of quantitative
restrictions, and price decontrol need to be coordinated so that import
competition compensates for any lack of competition in the domestic supply of
goods. The coordination has been simple so far, but, as import restrictions
are removed and domestic prices decontrolled, the preparation of lists of
goods for further action becomes more complex. This has required close
technical collaboration between the Tunisian authorities and Bank staff. The
Ministry of National Economy has, through this collaboration, acquired the
software and capability needed to assess the weighting of goods in the
measurement of import restrictions and price controls, and thereby the means
for clarifying its policies and coordinating future import and price actions.
Trade Liberalization
38.      Through the 1970s and early 1980s the economy developed behind high
and uneven tariff and non-tariff protection. Consequently, trade
liberalization has, from the start of the adjustment process, been a major
element in the efforts to establish a more efficient structure of incentives.
The Government's medium term objectives, as stated in its letter of
development policy for the ITPAL, is to reach a reasonably uniform rate of
effective protection of about 25 percent and to eliminate quantitative
restrictions, except for a limited set of goods where there are social or
political reasons for retaining them, by 1991. The tariff objective has since
been refined; the maximum nominal tariff will be 35 percent and the minimum
15 percent. Progress on tariffs has been rapid, bringing the structure close
to the objective for 1991.
39.      Given the progress achieved in tariff reduction, emphasis will now
shift to removing quantitative restrictions. This poses greater difficulties
and the Government feels constrained to postpone the attainment of full
liberalization from 1991 to 1992. Overall Tunisia is continuing to establish
appropriate conditions for success in its outward orientation of its economy.
It has applied to become a party to the GATT and is expected to accede during
1988. It has also been active in trade simplification, so that procedural
obstacles to trade are relatively small, and is currently replacing the
Brussels tariff nomenclature by the harmonized system -'.

40.      Tariffs.  Successive measures in 1987 and early 1988 supported by the
ITPAL have markedly reduced the level and dispersion of tariffs. The maximum
nominal tariff has been brought down from 236 percent in 1986 to 41 percent
and the minimum raised from 5 percent to 15 percent. The customs formalities
tax (Taxe sur les formalites douanieres-TFD), which was a uniform 5 percent,
has been incorporated into the new tariffs. As a result the average tariff
has fallen from 36 percent to 27 percent, which brings the tariff structure
close to the objective of an effective protection rate of 25 percent. A
simplification of the tariff structure within tariff groups has contributed to
the big drop in the standard deviation from 26.4 in 1986 to 12.5 in 1987.
41.      Import restrictions.  Tunisia has also begun to dismantle its system
of import restrictions and intends to remove them almost entirely over the
medium term. Import restrictions have always been used in the country to help
manage the balance of payments and protect local production, although the
emphasis in recent years has shifted to using demand management and exchange
rate adjustments to achieve external balance. As a result, goods not subject
to restrictions increased from 24 percent of imports in 1986 to 37 percent in
1987 and are expected to be about 50 percent in 1988. The liberalization has
been less effective in eliminating administrative protection. In theory some
form of import restriction could still protect about 90 percent of
production.   In practice, however, the restrictions are often not binding.
They include prnducts such as dates, whose import is banned for phytosanitary
reasons, but whose imports would be negligible if allowed; and petroleum,
whose import is controlled because the sector is a State monopoly. Both are
exports. Restrictions may also limit imports by user, not by quantity.
Though this applies mainly to goods not produced locally, it has a small
weight using domestic production weights. Considerable relaxation also has
been effected for certain users and is not captured by the aggregate index of
restrictions in terms of production weights. In addition to the existing
temporary admissions scheme, enterprises exporting more than 15 percent of
their output have been allowed, since January 1987, to import freely all their
input needs and the privilege has been extended, since January 1988, to other
enterprises up to the value of their exports (in both cases taxes on imported
inputs are refunded after export). Spare parts for plant and machinery
already installed in industry, agriculture, hospitals, and hotels, and all
production requirements for the pharmaceutical industry have been freely
importable since February 1987. These measures have greatly reduced the
importance of the older system of annual authorizations, whereby industrial
producers were able to import inputs on the basis of approved annual
production plans. It is estimated that about 40 percent of production does
not receive in fact any effective administrative protection.
42.      Nonetheless, attaining the medium term objective of removing
virtually all restrictions on imports will require major adjustments by local
producers. The Government considers that the industrial enterprises that are
protected by them will need time to adapt to a liberal import policy. It
classifies these enterprises into infant industries and "poorly integrated"
industries, the latter comprising a number of firms with low value added that
invested under the incentives afforded by the protection of the 1970s and
early 1980s. For infant industries the Government's policy is to define new
activities as infant industries and grant them three years of tariff
protection additional to the present tariffs, with resort to non-tariff



768B5
- 15 -
protection only in exceptional cases. For infant industries that might emerge
during the VIIth Plan period, the three years would count from the date of
their establishment. The poorly integrated industries present a once-for-all
issue that will be addressed through restructuring or closures. The
Government has already announced that it is closing the motor car assembly
plant and further action will be taken with support from the PERL. The
removal of remaining import restrictions will occur in stages, beginning with
the removal of restrictions on goods related to 15 percent of domestic
production in early 1989.
43.      Anti-dumping and safeguard measures.  The authorities are concerned
that, as trade liberalization progresses, the relatively small Tunisian market
could easily be flooded with the marginal exports of its trading partners, and
are seeking measures of protection against unfair trading practices. They
feel justified in their concern by their observation that import prices
frequently fall when local manufacture of the goods in question is started.
Accession to the GATT will place restrictions on the types of anti-dumping and
safeguard measures that can be adopted. Even then it is possible to interpret
them flexibly enough for them to be used as protection against fair trade. It
is important, not only that any anti-dumping or safeguard measures not be so
used, but also that they be so designed as to minimize the pressures on the
Government for inappropriate use.
44.      Program to be supported by the SAL.  By 1992 all restrictions on
imports would be removed, except for a few subsidized consumption goods, a few
luxuries and, in cases where there is special justification, products
competing with infant industries. In any case, they would not protect more
than 25 percent of domestic production, 20 percent corresponding to goods with
administered prices. Restrictions would be removed in four annual stages,
beginning with removal of restrictions on goods equivalent to 15 percent of
domestic production before release of second tranche. A preliminary list of
goods to be freed first was discussed during negotiations.
45.      The Tunisian authorities-will carry out a study of the institutional
tools that could be used for anti-dumping or safeguard schemes, and the
necessary criteria and procedures. Suitable consultants would be hired before
effectiveness. Review of the results and agreement on the program for the
adoption of anti-dumping or safeguard measures would take place before second
tranche release.
Price Liberalization and reduction of consumer subsidies
46.      Price liberalization.  The Government has made considerable headway
in relaxing controls over producer prices and is now taking this process
further while addressing the more difficult issue of distribution margins.
The system of price controls is straightforward. At one extreme are goods
whose prices are fixed by the State, mainly some essentials, including some
subsidized consumer goods, and at the other, goods whose prices are free. In
between are three types of control (homologation, autohomologation, and
liberte controlee), which differ mainly in the procedures for obtaining price
increases. All distribution activities are subject to the type of control
requiring ex post approval of changes of margins while conforming to a set
cost-plus formula (autohomologation). The Government intends to eliminate the



768B5
- 16 -
cost-plus formulae by 1991 so that, from then on, prices will either be free
or administered. Since one of its main apprehensions regarding price
decontrol is that there may be collusive behavior among suppliers, it is
preparing legislation to ensure improved competition.
47.      Under the program supported by the ITPAL, liberalization of producer
prices has raised the share of free price goods in agricultural and
manufacturing output from 5 percent in 1986 to 55 percent in 1988 (using 1984
production weights). The main guiding principles in the choice of items have
been the likely social effects, expected political reactions, and the degree
of competition. Since fixed price goods are, as a rule, essentials, action in
regard to them has been mainly limited to price increases. They include
subsidized goods, which are socially particularly sensitive and whose program
of subsidy reductions is described in paragraphs 49 to 52. Concern over the
lack of competition in several lines of production and in distribution as a
whole has limited the relaxation of controls. Producer prices have been
decontrolled for most goods where there are enough domestic producers to
ensure competition, but controls remain where producers are few.
48.      Controls over distribution margins have not been relaxed
significantly and still cover virtually all of agricultural and manufacturing
output. Their removal has been a lower priority because the authorities
considered them less distortionary of production. The Government is now
beginning the decontrol of these margins. The first group of products whose
distribution margins will be freed will be selected mainly from those whose
import or producer prices are already free. Further decontrol will
necessarily have to be coordinated with import liberalization if the
Government's concern over the risk of monopolistic pricing and scarcity premia
are to be met.
49.      Consumer subsidies.  The tightening resource constraints have
prompted the Government to reduce the overall cost of the subsidies it
channels through the General Subsidy Fund (Caisse Gen6rale de
Compensation--CGC).  The reduction would be effected so as to minimize
hardship for the poor and would be partly mitigated by the Government's other
targeted programs. The present system of subsidies is costly: over 1982-86
it was on average equivalent to 3.5 percent of GDP, or 11 percent of total
government resources. It is also inefficient: available data with the
National Institute of Statistics show that, for each good the subsidy accruing
to households increased with income. But it presents a politically sensitive
issue since the subsidized items are mainly articles of basic consumption.
The greatest share of the subsidy goes to cereals (59 percent), followed by
sugar (10 percent), vegetable oils (9 percent), fertilizers (7 percent), milk
(6 percent) and some other products. The cereals subsidy consists mainly of
subsidies on wheat needed for bread and couscous, whose price is judged to be
the most sensitive of all, followed closely by the price of cooking oil. This
judgement is supported by data collected by the National Institute of
Statistics, which show that the income elasticities of bread and cooking oil
are lower than for the other subsidized goods.

50.      The Government has already taken some bold measures to reduce these
subsidies. Despite memories of violent, widespread protests provoked by an
increase-of the price of bread in 1984, the subsidy on cereals has been
substantially reduced by making the loaf smaller foVthe same price, to
increase the price by weight 15 percent.  From 1985 Xo 1987 the subsidy on
vegetable oil was reduced 64 percent and on fertilizers 17 percent. Although
there were increases in the subsidies on sugar and milk, total subsidies
declined from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1985 to 2.8 percent in 1987.
51.      Fixing annual ceilings on subsidies would appear desirable, but would
not be feasible since the subsidies depend on contingencies outside Tunisia'
control, such as the weather and international prices. Instead, the
Government has set as its target a cumulative ceiling of D950 million over the
Plan period, i.e. D190 million a year on average, as compared to an expected
amount of D1,450 million in the absence of further action. Within this limit,
subsidies would be reduced as evenly as contingencies permit to minimize the
shocks caused by sudden price increases. In 1987 subsidies came to
D197 million.
52.      The strategy envisaged by the authorities for reducing subsidies over
the medium term is to raise prices primarily on the least sensitive items,
those constituting the smallest part of the consumption of the poor.
Fertilizer subsidies are being eliminated under the medium term agricultural
program, those on barley and soya are to cease in 1989. On milk, sugar and



- 18 -
vegetable oil for making soap, the subsidies would be reduced faster than they
would be on wheat and cooking oil. The measures would ensure the greatest
redistributive effect within the overall ceilings.
53.      Program to be supported by the SAL.  The Government's objective over
the VIIth Plan period is to decontrol prices so that at least 75 percent of
producer prices, measured by their weights in agriculture and manufacturing,
and 50 percent of distribution margins are free by 1991. The main producer
prices to remain controlled would be of subsidized staples. These targets
would be attained evenly in four annual steps. The share of free producer
prices has been raised from 55 percent at the beginning of 1988 to
60 percent. Before the release of the second tranche this share would be
raised to at least 70 percent. Distribution margins equivalent to an
additional 10 percent of agricultural and manufacturing production have been
decontrolled and a further 10 percentage points would be decontrolled before
second tranche release. A draft law satisfactory to the Bank to improve
competition in domestic markets would be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies
before seconde tranche release.
54.      The strategy for reducing consumer subsidies would necessarily evolve
with world price trends and the performance of the economy, and the Bank would
review it with the Government semi-annually. The prospects of limiting the
subsidies to D190 million in 1988 have been reviewed. Before release of the
second tranche the Bank would agree with the Government on the ceiling for
1989, taking into account the outturn for 1988. Progress in keeping the
subsidies below the agreed ceiling would be reviewed as part of the
semi-annual reviews of the macroeconomic program with the Bank.
The Finanmfid Sector
55.      As economic liberalization progresses, the needs of borrowers and
lenders for a broader range of financial services will grow. A series of
reforms that began in January 1987 has already removed most of the once
pervasive administrative controls over the sector's operations and is giving a
leading role to the fledgeling money market. The main remaining controls over
banking, apart from normal regulation, consist of i) a cap on bank lending
spreads, ii) lending to priority sectors at subsidized rates. There is also a
minor restriction limiting the differences between the interest rates offered
to different depositors for deposits below D500,000 for less than three
months.  But the requirement of prior Central Bank authorization for bank
loans above a certain size has been removed. The authorities intend to
increase the role of market forces in determining interest rates and the
allocation of financial resources, and to diversify the available array of
financial instruments by extending these reforms and fostering competition
within the sector. The Government has also begun to prepare a program to
develop the capital market.
56.      Money and capital markets.  Development of the money market has
enabled the Central Bank to allow market mechanisms to determine interest
rates to a greater extent and has added to the available range of financial
instruments. In January 1987 it replaced its ordinary rediscounting with
interventions on the money market and the rate on its accomodations, termed
the money market rate, is determined by supply and demand. This rate is the
leading interest rate and has been kept roughly 3 percentage points above



- 19 -
inflation. At present it is 9 3/8 percent. Apart from the banks, non-bank
financial intermediaries and other financial institutions also have access to
the money market. Bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper, both new
in Tunisia, have been traded on the money market since January 1988.  A
program of action covering new methods of Central Bank intervention, rul6s of
conduct of participants, and the introduction of further new instruments will
need to be prepared before the market can be used effectively for open market
operations. The Tunisian authorities intend to review these issues during
1988 with the technical assistance of the IMF. The official capital market
consists of a stock exchange dealing in a small number of securities with a
low turnover. There appears to be no unofficial capital market of
significance and there is no secondary market for government bonds. The
authorities are preparing a program for the development of the equity and bond
markets with the support of the IFC/UNDP.
57.      Lending rates.  The cap on bank lending spreads, which limits them to
3 percentage points above the money market rate, has the drawback that it
limits some borrowers' access to bank financing. But it also presents the
authorities with a dilezmn  since the cost of borrowing from the banks is
already high, thus discouraging raising the cap, while the profitability of
the banks appears to be low. Although the cap permits the market greater play
than did the system of administered interest rates it replaced in January
1987, only the bigger, more creditworthy borrowers can borrow at spreads equal
to or slightly below the 3 points. Smaller, riskier or costlier borrowers may
fail to obtain bank loans at all. Taxes add to the cost of loans, though, in
late 1987, by reducing the main tax, the TPS, from 14.3 percent of interest
charges to 6 percent, the authorities reduced the additional cost from 3.1 to
1.9 points. On the other hand, the introduction of the cap on spreads allowed
rates to rise 1.5 to 2.0 points, so that real bank lending rates now lie
around 8 percent.
58.      Non-performing loans.  Nonetheless, there is pressure to raise the
cap on bank lending spreads arising from the uncertain profitability of the
banks. Profitability could probably be increased by improving the efficiency
of the banks. But the major problem, which is only now being systematically
addressed, is the accumulation of doubtful loans. Non-performing loans are
now a significant portion of bank assets and were partly due to poor credit
maaagement and supervision, which the banks allowed to occur because they
could assume that, when the Central Bank gave its prior authorization for a
loan, it both examined the loan and committed itself to rediscounting it.
Another part of their cause was the pressure on the banks to lend to priority
sectors at concessional rates of interest and the resultant accumulation of
loans to highly leveraged borrowers. The Central Bank has been working with
the banks to put in place a sound system of loan classification and in
December 1987 issued regulations formally establishing the new system. This
will permit a more accurate evaluation of the problem than has been possible
so far. At present indications are that the banks can grow out of it if they
improve their loan management and are allowed to raise their lending spreads.
59.      Fostering competition.  If the banking sector in Tunisia were more
competitive, interest rates could be set free to find t:ieir level. The
concern of the authorities is that the recent reforms have not had time to
generate sufficiently competitive behavior and that, freed from the cap on



- 20 -
their spreads, the banks would raise lending rates unjustifiably high. The
issue of competition is of prime economic concern because of the size of the
sector. Credit to the economy was equal to 68 percent of GDP in 1986 and
financial assets, excluding currency, with deposit institutions was equal to
43 percent. The sector is also large-enough for competition to prevail once
started. There are 21 development, deposit and saving banks; a postal
checking system; seven off-shore banks; four portfolio management companies; a
leasing company; and a number of insurance companies. There is also the stock
exchange.
60.      The authorities are undertaking, with Bank support, a study of
competition in the banking sector that would in particular evaluate the
problem of non-performing loans, examine the structure of the sector and
assess the costs of the banks. On the basis of this study they will determine
future action to improve competition and to raise or remove the cap on lending
spreads. The objective of the authorities is to foster competition in the
financial sector and recent measures are beginning to have that effect. One
part of the problem of insufficient competition has been attitudes: before
1987 the strict and pervasive Central Bank controls gave litte room for
competition and the attitudes they engendered are only now being forced to
change. Another part of the problem is market segmentation: the various
types of banks are restricLed to specified activities, thus lowering the
number of participants in each market. However, competition is growing. A
1987 inter-bank agreement limiting rates offered on deposits was quickly
undermined and the money market is a new competitor with the banks normal
deposit facilities. The authorities are also considering blurring the
demarcations between types of banks, without losing their specialization. One
possibility is to allow development banks to take deposits. Banks could also
be allowed to enter into activities related to their present ones, e.g. the
agricultural banks could finance agro-industries. Another possibility would
be for off-shore banks, whose operations are severely restricted, to establish
themselves in the Tunisian financial market. This would have the additional
benefits of demonstration effects, through the use of new instruments and the
provision of better service, and of training of Tunisian staff. Tunisian
regulations do not create significant obstacles to this and one major
off-shore bank is expected to establish itself shortly. As competition grows
new services, such as factoring, flexible deposits, and cash management, will
be offered by the banks and further reduce market segmentation.
61.      Priority credits.  The major politically sensitive issue is the
allocation of credits to priority sectors at concessional rates. With this
year's disaster in agriculture, it is more delicate than ever. The resources
for these credits come partly from the banks, in which case they are eligible
for rediscounting at concessional rates, and partly from the Treasury.
Recovery of the former is much higher than of the latter. Despite the
sensitivity of the issue, the Government narrowed the priority sectors in
January 1987 to agriculture, exports, and small enterprises. Since
agriculture is accorded the highest priority, other priority credit rates that
are below the present short term agricultural rate (7 percent) will be raised
to at least that level by the end of 1988 and the total of priority credits
reduced. The Government's medium term objective is to raise lending to
priority sectors in stages to at least the money market rate by the end of
1991.



-21-
62.      Treasury bonds.  The coupon on Treasury bonds (bons d'equipement),
which was raised from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent in March, 1987, is subject to
tax exemptions that vary according to the holder. Because of these exemptions
the banks find the coupon competitive with money market rates. Since these
bonds are the only financial paper issued by the Government, the development
of a bond market requires that their coupon be brought into line with money
market instruments and che tax exemptions removed. At present rates the
coupon would be about 8.5 percent. An additional benflct from this measure -
willibe an improvement in the finances of the social security system, which
invests in these bonds but whose earnings are tax exempt because tax is levied
on their payments.
63.      Foreign exchange risk.  Recent cross currency movements, as well as
the devaluation of the Dinar, have caused sizable foreign exchange losses and
have exposed the limitations of the existing foreign exchange risk fund.
Development banks had been encouraged to borrow abroad with the cover of the
fund, whose resources come from fees charged on certain loans (in practice a
tax). This system gave an incentive to borrow in currencies with the lowest
interest rates, notably Japanese Yen, which are the currencies that have
appreciated most. After having carried out a study of the problem, the
Government, while honoring existing commitments, has decided to change the
system. It is introducing two facilities of up to one year, each of which
will cover the debt service in the period it is used. One would be an option
to buy foreign exchange at the spot rate of the contract date for a premium
equal to the differential between the money market rates of the currency in
question and of Tunisia. The other would be a forward cover for a premium
over the spot rate equal to the same differential.  In addition it is
introducing a third facility for concessional loans contracted by banks at the
behest of the State. This would be a temporary facility and would cover the
banks for a year at a time from the anniversary date of the loan and the
premium would be the differential between the money market rate and the loan
rate. For enterprises with liquidity problems due to larger and sustained
exchange rate variations, the banks will provide financing at prevailing
interest rates on a case by case basis. The existing foreign exchange risk
fund will be retained without change to honor existing commitments and will be
eliminated at their end.
64.      Program to be supported by the SAL.  Where the effective costs to
borrowers of priority sector loans is below 7 percent, the present short term
rate for agriculture, they would be raised by increasing the proportions of
these loans that do not qualify for concessional financing. This would be
politically easier than an outright increase of interest rates. The effective
costs of other priority sector credits would not be lowered. These actions
would be taken on January 1, 1989, and their announcement, scheduled for
September, 1988, would occur before loan effectiveness. The remaining
differences between the effective costs of non-agriculture priority credits
and the money market rate would be reduced by one third or 0.8 points,
whichever is less, on September 1, 1989, and this measure would be announced
before second tranche release. Thereafter the effective costs on
non-agriculture priority credits would be increased annually so as to bring
them at least to the money market rate by 1991. (Priority credit rates for
agriculture are following a schedule agreed under the Fifth Agricultural
Credit Project).  The volume of priority credit would be monitored as part of
the macroeconomic performances. The Government would increase the coupon on



- 22 -
Treasury bonds to give an after tax return close to the after tax return on
the money market and rationalize the tax exemptions. Because of budgetary and
legal procedures, the elimination of the tax exemptions can only be effected
through the Loi de Finances for the 1989 budget. Rationalization of the
taxation and increase of the coupon would precede release of the second
tranche. The review of competition in the banking sector would determine
whether the cap of three percentage points on bank spreads for lending can be
increased or removed, and the need for other measures to improve competition.
Consultants would be hired, with suitable terms of reference, before loan
effectiveness. Completion of the review and implementation of measures
satisfactory to the Bank based on its conclusions would take place before
release of the second tranche. The new system for foreign exchange risk
coverage is being established by August 15, 1988. Review of its results and
any necessary modifications would precede second tranche release.
Fiseal Reform
65.      As a necessary component of the reform of the structure of
incentives, the Government is undertaking a thorough overhaul of the tax
system. The present system is the outcome of a long history of amendments and
additions to basic legislation originating from long before Tunisia's
independence and has become economically distortionary, as well as complicated
and often unfair. To establish a tax system that is simple, transparent, and
economically efficient, the Government is replacing the present system of
indirect taxes by a value added tax, and will replace a number of direct taxes
by a single tax on personal income and a single tax on corporate incomes. The
authorities are also preparing a reform of the investigation and judicial
procedures in tax cases. Fairer procedures are needed and, at the same time,
penalties need to be increased to provide adequate deterrence against fraud.
A first draft of the new procedures and legislation has been prepared and the
authorities intend to finalize the reform in 1989.
66.      The value added tax.  The proposed VAT has been discussed extensively
with the Bank staff at the various stages of its preparation. It would
replace a system of indirect taxes consisting of three turnover taxes and an
array of excise taxes. The distortionary effect of the turnover taxes stems
from limits on deductibility between them and the consequent multiplicity of
rates-the compounding of the taxes gives rise to thirteen rates. The excise
taxes add to the distortions; they are levied at about fifty different rates
going as high as 500 percent. The proposed VAT would have three positive
rates. The principal rate would be 17 percent, but basic consumption items
and professional services would pay 6 percent and luxuries would pay
29 percent. A zero rate would apply to exports and agriculture would be
exempt.
67.      There is some likelihood of a revenue shortfall from the introduction
of a VAT, and the application to distribution activities presents special
problems. Consequently, the transition to a pure VAT would occur in stages.
The choice of the VAT rates has been made to balance the need to generate
adequate revenue and the need to ensure acceptance of the new tax by the
public. The rates are high, but correspond to rates at which the turnover
taxes were levied and are, hence, familiar. It is not possible to estimate
accurately the effects on revenues due to the elimination of the compounding



7 68 SD
- 23 -
of the turnover taxes and the removal of the excise taxes. But the likelihood
of shortfalls necessitates some transition measure, and, therefore, a
consumption tax will be levied on a number of products that would be taxed at
the VAT rate for luxuries. It will be levied at three rates at import or
factory-gate. The authorities share the Bank's view that it should be a
temporary tax and will progressively remove it until it is limited to
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, motor vehicles, petroleum fuels, and a few
luxuries. In the meantime it repr-aents a notable improvement in simplicity
and transparency.
68.      Taxation of value added in distribution has always proved difficult
in developing countries and the Tunisian authoLities are proceeding on this in
stages. The VAT will be extended on January 1, 1989, to wholesale firms with
turnovers above a threshold of D500,000. This lag of six months is a prudent
measure to avoid associating the VAT with the rising prices and thereby
marring its acceptance by the public. The authorities consider that the
extension is likely to result in a transient price increase. Since, the
Summer is normally the time of the year when the main increases in consumer
prices occur, they have chosen to effect the extension in winter, when price
increases are small. A lower threshold is theoretically appealing, but is
inadvisable at this stage because the additional revenue will be too small to
justify the increased difficulty of administration. Extension to retail also
presents difficult problems. Only large retail enterprises can be expected to
have book-keeping adequate to permit calculation and verification of the VAT.
However, they are relatively few--a number of supermarkets-and the yield may
not outweigh the cost to an already heavily burdened administrative system.
Nonetheless, the authorities will study the extension of the VAT to retail.
Before second tranche release, there will be an in depth discussion between
Bank staff and staff of the Ministry of Finance on the feasibility of
extending the VAT to retail trade.
69.      The yield of the VAT - and its acceptance by the public - will depend
crucially on the effectiveness of the measures to implement the reform. An
adequately staffed, permanent cell has been established in the Directorate
General for Taxation, to oversee the passage of the legislation. It also does
the initial training and acts as an information/publicity center. The initial
training of tax agents is restricted to an elite corps of inspectors, who are
conducting the further training of agents at all the regional centers. As
part of the public information campaign, the Government has issued a booklet
explaining the VAT in simple terms. It is also organizing seminars for
businessmen and accountants and using radio and television broadcasts.
70.      Direct taxes.  By reforming the system of personal income taxes the
Government intends to eliminate a source of considerable complication and
inequity in the tax system, which increase the difficulty of collection and
give rise to a widespread feeling that the system is unfair. There are
several different taxes on personal incomes, with rates that vary widely,
according to source. The rates can be high for some sections of the
population; on an annual income of D6,000, which would bring a family of five
close to the average national income, the marginal rate is 63 percent, and at
the highest income brackets, the marginal rate is close to 77 percent.
Yields, however, appear to be determined mainly by ease of collection. The
bulk of revenues from these taxes (87 percent) derive from wages and salaries,



76851
- 24 -
while evasion of taxes on professional incomes is believed to be common.
Attempts to counteract evasion, by increasing the statutory rates on some
sources, and to protect wabes and salaries by granting tax-exempt fringe
benefits, such as housing and transport allowances, have further complicated
the tax structure and increased its unevenness. The reform would abolish
differential rates and bring the maximum marginal rate down to 50 percent.
Fringe benefits will be included in the tax base over the medium term. Since
the purpose is to simplify taxation, not to increase it, as this is done
brackets will be adjusted appropriately.
71.      Taxation of corporate incomes is less complex, but, because rates
also vary markedly according to activity and are affected by investment
incentives, they distort the overall structure of incentives. The main taxes
on enterprises are levied at 1 percent on turnover and at rates on profits
ranging from 6 percent (for agriculture and handicrafts) to 44 percent (for
commerce). Income from marketable financial assets is taxed at 20 percent
(IRVM) and interest on bank deposits at 17.25 percent. A reform of corporate
taxation in 1985 did little to change the actual tax structure, but in 1987, a
system of fiscal credits (avoir fiscal) was introduced that reduced multiple
taxation by eliminating the simultaneous application to the same earnings of
taxes on enterprises and taxes on financial assets. These tax credits,
however, yield negative tax rates for activities with the lowest statutory
rates for taxes on enterprises, a defect that will be removed by the proposed
unification of corporate taxes.
72.      The reform of taxation of corporate incomes under preparation is
expected to abolish the tax on turnover, but to retain the four different
rates for undistributed profits. Distributed profits will be taxed through
the personal income tax with the use of the system of fiscal credits.
73.      Program to be supported by the SAL.  The VAT law was submitted to the
Chamber of Deputies on May 11, 1988, and application of the tax, scheduled for
July 1, 1988, would take place before effectiveness of the loan. During 1988
it would apply only to production and to services other than distribution.
Before second tranche release the VAT would be extended to wholesale trade for
firms with turnovers exceeding D500,000. Before loan effectiveness the
authorities would initiate a study of the extension of the VAT to retail and
adopt a program agreed with the Bank based on the study's recommendations.
Also before second tranche, they would agree with the Bank on a program for
removing the consumption tax. A satisfactory draft law for the reform of
direct taxation, with application beginning on January 1, 1989, to incomes
earned in 1988, would be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies before loan
effectiveness and, the new law would be applied before second tranche release.
PART mi - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
74.      Lending.  Since 1962, IDA has committed to Tunisia 10 credits
amounting to US$75.2 million, and the Bank has committed 76 loans amounting to



7S6SB
- 25 -
US$1890 million, both net of cancellations. The Bank's figure includes
US$63 million for a Highway Maintenance Project signed on January 15, 1988,
and US$28 million for a Small and Medium Industry Development Project signed
on April 13, 1988, not yet effective. Project implementation is generally
satisfactory, and important policy changes and institutional improvements have
been achieved. Disbursement delays have been experienced affecting
particularly the education, technical assistance, health and urban projects
due to project-specific problems being addressed through supervision missions
and sector discussions.
75.      Past Bank lending emphasized support for long-term investments in
infrastructure, social development and, more recently, in the agriculture
sector and industrial financing. As of March 31, 1988 the sector sbare of the
Bank Group commitments was as follows: agriculture, 28 percent; industry,
26 percent; transport,and urban infrastructure, 16 percent each; energy,
8 percent; education, 4 percent; health and technical assistance, 1 percent
each. Policy-based lending to support reforms at the sector and
macro-economic levels started in the last two years with the Agriculture
Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL), Loan 2754-TUN, and the Industrial and Trade
Policy Adjustment Loan (ITPAL), Loan 2781-TUN.
76.      The Bank's assistance strategy aims at supporting the country's
transition from a situation of reliance on petroleum exports to a balanced
post-oil era. The overall objective of Bank lending is to contribute to the
implementation of the Government's commendable program of economic reform.
For this purpose, Bank financing will be linked to projects with a direct and
rapid impact on production, employment and exports. The policy loans
mentioned above and the present loan meet these criteria. They will be
followed by other adjustment operations in the coming months, including a
second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan , a project for public enterprise
reform and an education/employment sector loan that would aim at alleviating
Tunisia's problems in these areas.
77.      Although policy loans will account for about 60 percent of Bank
lending in the next two to three years, the strategy is to continue working on
traditional projects with a view to maintaining a role in certain areas where
actions were started in the past, to help the Government improve efficiency in
the provision of urban and social services and to set the basis for the
identification of investments where Bank assistance might be needed in the
medium term. To these ends, operations are planned to finance agricultural
research and credit, water supply, housing finance and municipal development,
and health and population. Technical assistance is also being considered, at
the Government's request, for the promotion of oil exploration.
78.      CESW.  The Bank's economic and sector work will address the problems
to be faced by Tunisia in the medium term, and will continue to provide the
macroeconomic and sector knowledge needed to maintain a fruitful dialogue with
the Government. In particular, it will follow up on the implementation of the
recommendations of the studies carried out in the context of sector and
adjustment loans. The main specific tasks include a mid-term review of the
implementation of the government's VIIth Plan, an analysis of the pricing and
incentive systems in the agricultural sector, a review of the transport sector
strategy, and an analysis of the poverty situation and of the public
expenditures in the social sectors.

79.      Bank Loans Outstanding.  The share of the Bank and IDA in Tunisia's
medium and long term (MLT) public and publicly guaranteed debt outstanding and
disbursed was almost 15 percent at the end of 1987.   That year, debt service
payments on Bank debt amounted to 15 percent of the country's public and
publicly guaranteed debt service, and the ratio of debt service on Bank debt
to exports was 3.8 percent. Because of the current emphasis on adjustment
lending in the period of transition, the share of the Bank in Tunisia's PPG
MLT debt is expected to peak at about 22-24 percent and its share in debt
service at about 24 percent in the mid-1990s. The shift towards more
traditional inve3tment financing by the Bank that will occur around 1991 and
the expected increase in the country's borrowings from commercial sources
should result in a gradual decline of these indicators.
Bank Exverenee with Adg "net Lendin in Tunisa.
80.      Adjustment lending to Tunisia started in 1987, to support the program
of economic reform adopted by the Government after the severe financial crisis
of 1986. Two quick disbursing loans were made in FY87, namely the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) and the Industrial and Trade Policy
Adjustment Loan (ITPAL) for $150 million each. The loans supported the
economic reform measures undertaken by the government at the macroeconomic
level as well as in the agricultural and industrial sectors. Details on the
progress on the implementation of measures are given in Annex IV.
81.      The ASAL focuses on improvements of agricultural policies in the
areas of incentives and pricing (at the consumer and producer levels), public
expenditure, extension and research, input and output marketing, irrigation
management, credit, farm mechanization, livestock, forestry and land tenure
policies. The implementation of policy measures has been satisfactory:
producer and input prices have been adjusted as agreed, distribution margins
for fertilizer have been liberalized, interest rates for agricultural credit
were raised, a more liberal policy for importing tractors is in place,
allocation of funds to the FSDA (Fonds Sp6cial pour le D6veloppement Agricole)
program was limited to the amount covenanted (D13 million), and the actions
expected on organizational and institutional improvements have been
implemented. The loan was fully committed in September 87, and the
disbursement performance has been satisfactory. The second tranche of
$50 million was released last October. A follow-up operation is under
preparation.
82.      The ITPAL focuses on measures to help Tunisia's external and internal
macroeconomic balances. It supports the first stage of industrial pricing and
trade liberalization. The dialogue on fiscal reform leading to the
introduction of the VAT was also started under this loan, as well as the
analysis of measures for the adequate coverage of the exchange risk associated
with foreign currency loans. Implementation of price and trade liberalisation
measures is on schedule, and a new investment code introducing improvements in
the procedures for investment approvals and incentives was promulgated last
Summer. However, some delays have occurred in the preparation of the VAT law
and in the introduction of an improved system for foreign exchange risk
coverage, mainly due to the need to study carefully the impact of these
changes on the economy. Monitoring of the implementation of policy reforms in
these areas will be done as part of the proposed SAL. Disbursements have
experienced delays, associated with the political uncertainties prevailing in
Tunisia in 1987, expected to be dissipated after the Party Congress in



7 68 S5 a
- 27 -
June 1988. The sluggishness of private investment, due to weak domestic
demand, has also slowed the disbursements. These difficulties are now being
solved and disbursements have accelerated in recent months. The conditions
for the release of the second tranche of the loan are expected to be fulfilled
in late June 88.
IFC
83.      As of December 31, 1987 IFC's net commitments in Tunisia totalled
US$23.8 million. This financing has benefited the tourism sector, both
through direct intervention in projects and through assistance to development
banks, and the manufacturing sector, particularly in the chemical,
pharmaceutical, construction materials and textiles subsectors. In textiles,
IFC is helping to modernize and privatize some state-owned mills. The
Corporation has also invested in the first leasing company in the country, and
in the establishment of a Belgian-Tunisian venture in the field of engineering
services. IFC is contributing to the development of Tunisia's capital market
by financing, with the UNDP, a study on the potential for its improvement.
PART IV - LOAN ADMiNISTRATION
84.      Eligible Expenditures.  The proposed loan of $150 million would
finance the foreign exchange cost of imported goods. Not eligible for
financing under the loan are goods financed from other sources and those
specified in a list of excluded items. The exclusions are military or
para-military goods, nuclear reactors and parts, and luxury goods such as
tobacco, precious stones, jewelry, and gold. Petroleum products, natural gas
and foodstuffs would be financeable up to an aggregate ceiling of $30 million.
85.      Procurement.  International competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with World Bank guidelines will be used for contracts of $5 million or more.
Other imports would be procured following usual commercial practices of the
purchaser using no less than three quotations from prospective suppliers
whenever possible. Procurement would be grouped whenever possible into
packages suitable for ICB. For procurement through ICB, bide, bid evaluation
reports and certified copies of contracts would be presented to the Bank prior
to submission of the first application for withdrawal of funds. For other
procurement, prior to submission of the related withdrawal application the
Borrower will furnish all information and documentation that the Bank may
reasonably request in respect of such procurement.
86.      Disbursement.  The Central Bank would be responsible for the
administration of the loan. Disbursements from the loan account would be made
against 100 percent of the cost of eligible imports. Withdrawal applications
for disbursements on contracts of goods procured under ICB would be fully
documented. In all other cases, disbursements will be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) from the Central Bank detailing individual
transactions in a given period, and certification of payment and of
eligibility of the transactions for loan financing. Supporting documentation
for disbursements under SOEs would be retained by the Central Bank until at
least 12 months after the closing of the loan account. A revolving fund
(special account) would be established at the Central Bank. The initial
deposit would be $35 million (approximately four months of disbursements).



7685B

Replenishmentt; would be made monthly or when half of the revolving fund has
been utilized. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed 18 months after
effectiveness. The Closing Date would be April 30, 1990.
87.      Accounts and Audits.  The Central Bank would maintain records of all
transactions under the loan in accordance with sound accounting practices.
All accounts (including the revolving fund) would be audited within 6 months
of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank. Audit reports would include a separate opinion on claims submitted
to the Bank on the basis of SOEs and would state whether the claims were made
in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.
88.      Release of Funds and Tranching.  The Bank will carry out an
evaluation of macroeconomic developments in the country, with particular
attention given to wage, exchange rate, monetary and budget policies.
Transfers from the State to public enterprises and the economic justification
of major public sector projects will also be reviewed. Specific details and
indications will be brought by the negotiation team. Agreement would also be
reached at negotiations on the terms of reference of studies on antidumping
measures and on the evaluation of an eventual extension of the VAT to retail
trade, on the lists of products to be imported freely and the list of products
of which the prices and distribution margins would be decontrolled before
effectiveness and second tranche release. The conditions associated with the
proposed loan aim at the implementation of actions considered crucial for the
success of the government's economic reform program.
89.      The proceeds of the loan would be made available for withdrawal in
two tranches, the first one of $100 million and the second one of
$50 million. The first tranche would be released upon loan effectiveness, and
the second one would become available upon fulfillment of agreed conditions,
expected to be around February 1989. The specific actions to be monitored and
their implementation program are described below:
90.      A new system for the coverage of foreign exchange risk on foreign
borrowings will be established by August 15, 1988.
91.      As a condition of loan effectiveness:
a) a satisfactory VAT system and consumption tax system will be
implemented;
b) a circular announcing the increase of the effective cost of
preferential credit to at least 7 percent effective January 1, 1989 will be
issued;
c) a satisfactory draft law on direct taxation will be submitted to
the Chamber of Deputies; and
d) consultants for the review of competition in the banking sector
and for the studies on anti-dumping measures and possible extension of the VAT
to retail trade will be hired.
92.      As a condition of second tranche release:
a) Macroeconomic developments: the Bank will carry out a review of
macroeconomic developments in the months preceding the release of the second



78SS8
- 29 -
tranche, focusing on the same elements as those in the review carried out
before loan approval by the Board (see paragraph 35);
b  Pricing; i) the share of the producer prices not subject to
control will be at least 70 percent of the value of agricultural and
manufacturing domestic production; ii) at least an additional 10 percent of
the goods (over the June 30, 1988 share) would not be subject to price control
at the distribution stage; and iii) a draft law, satisfactory to the Bank. to
improve competition in domestic markets will be submitted to the Chamber of
Deputies;
c) Subsidies: the Bank would carry out an evaluation of the
performance of the Caisse Gen6rale de Compensation (subsidy fund) in 1988, and
agreement would be reached between the Government and the Bank on the ceiling
of subsidies to be channelled through the Fund in 1989;
d) Trade: i) the share of imports subject to quantitative
restrictions would be 15 percentage points lower than in July 88; and ii) the
results of the anti-dumping study would be discussed with the Bank and a
system of anti-dumping measures agreed to by the Bank would have been
established;
e) Financial Sector: i) a circular announcing that the differential
between the minimum effective cost of preferential credit (except for interest
rates on agricultural credit, that will follow the agreements reached under
the Vth Agricultural Credit Project - Loan 2865-TUN) and the interest rate
prevailing in the money market would be reduced by one third as of
September 1, 1989 will be issued; ii) the results of the study on the
competitiveness of the banking system would be reviewed and measures,
satisfactory to the Bank, based on its conclusions will be implemented; and
iii) taxation of the coupon on Treasury bonds will be rationalized and the
coupon increased to compensate for the elimination of the tax advantages
available to them;
f) Foreign Exchange Risk: the system for the treatment of the risk
implemented in 1988 will be reviewed and, if need be, modified as agreed with
the Bank; and
g) Taxes: (i) the VAT will be extended to wholesale trade with a
turnover of more than D500,000 per year; ii) the results of the study on the
extension of the VAT to retail trade will be reviewed and a program will be
agreed with the Bank for the extension; (iii) the law on direct taxation will
be adopted; and (iv) the Bank and the government would agree on a timetable
for the implementation of the reduction of the number and the scope of
consumption taxes.
ManaS,nent, Coordination and Moditoring
93.      The adjustment program would be managed under the general
coordination of the Ministry of Planning, who will be assisted by the
Ministries of Economy and Finance, and by the Central Bank. The Central Bank
will be responsible for the coordination and monitoring of disbursement
related aspects. Semi-annual reports would be prepared by the government
(through the Directorate General of Planning in the Ministry of Planning) and



7 Sas
-30-
sent to the Bank on the implementation of all elements of the adjustment
program. The format of these reports was agreed upon at negotiations. and
would include data showing the evolution of macroeconomic indicators,
information on the progress on tariff, quantitative restrictions, and price
liberalization, as well as a description of the measures envisaged to achieve
the agreed ceiling on subsidies and other elements of the program.
Cooperation with other agenies
94.      ADB. The African Development Bank started adjustment lending to
Tunisia in 1987 and has so far granted a SDR 80 million loan similar to the
Bank's ITPAL. They expect to appraise in June a SDR 75 million SAL supporting
the same policies than the proposed loan.
95.      IMF. Tunisia has successfully completed the program agreed with the
IMF under its first stand-by arrangement covering the period November 1986 to
May 1988 and is now discussing an eventual extended financing facility. Under
the Stand-by its purchases were the equivalent of SDR 104 million (75 percent
of quota), in addition to which it purchased the equivalent of SDR 115 million
under the compensatory financing facility. It is anticipated that its total
purchases under the EFF would amount to SDR 207.3 million, equal to
150 percent of quota.
96.      Cooperation and coordination between the Bank and the IMF have been
excellent. The Stand-by program provided a short run macroeconomic framework
for the ITPAL and the ASAL, and the content of the two loans were discussed
extensively with the IMF staff. Both the identification and the appraisal
missions of the proposed SAL overlapped with IMF missions, and exchanges of
view with the IMF staff took place. The various components of the proposed
SAL have been discussed at different stages with the IMF staff. There have
been no substantial divergence of views.
Justification and Risks
97.      The proposed SAL would support the program of adjustment and reform
of incentives that the Tunisian Government has formulated in dialogue with the
Bank. The program constitutes a radical and far-reaching shift from the
highly dirigiste system that prevailed in the early years after independence,
when earnings from petroleum were ample, to a greatly liberalized system in
which diminishing petroleum resources would be compensated for by orienting
the economy toward exports and by reforming the fiscal system. The VIIth Plan
and the discussions with the Government attest to Tunisia's commitment to
these new policies. Moreover, the administrative system's quality and
responsiveaess to policy advice are high enough to justify confidence in its
ability to ca:ry out the reforms. The determination of the Government should
not, however, conceal the difficulty of implementing the proposed measures and
the opposition they may face. In particular, the subsidy reductions are a
sensitive political issue that requires care and caution.
98.      Strong, sustained Bank support at this juncture will favor the flow
of funds from other external sources and would greatly contribute to the
country's success in carrying out the structural changes that the Government
plans.  Tunisia is considering economic liberalization with political



168SB
- 31 -
liberalization in an atmosphere of popular support and participation. In
addition, Bank support would help Tunisia deal effectively with the challenges
that will be genersted by the transition to an energy-importing economy. If
there were to be a significant slowdown in growth, Tunisia's particularly
sensitive geographical location and still too rapid population growth could
combine to generate social problems. Strong and early Bank support for the
new regime's growth-oriented adjustment program is justified on these grounds
and will cement the traditionally very good relationship the Bank enjoys with
Tunisia. The progress in the implementation of reforms to date is the best
indicator of the country's commitment to carry out its adjustment program, and
to a large extent minimizes the risk associated with the loan.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
98.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed Loan.

The President ef the World Bank
1818 X Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20433
U.S.A.
Draft Development Policy Letter
Dear Mr. President:
Since 1986, Tunisia has been engaged in a vast program of economic
reform and structural adjustment, in response to the need to adapt its economy
to the post-petroleum era and to transform it into a modern economy capable of
meeting the challenge of international competition.
I
Our program, described in the Seventh Plan documents, received
support from the World Bank in the form of an Agriculture Sector Adjustment
Loan and an Industry and Trade Policy Adjustment Loan, approved by your
Executive Directors on September 1, 1986 and January 27, 1987, respectively.
The International Monetary Fund has also supported our macroeconomic
adjustment policy with a stand-by arrangement through May 1988, which it
approved in November 1986.
As spelled out in the paragraphs below, we fully intend to pursue
and consolidate the adjustment of our country's economy to enable it to grow
in a sustained and sustainable manner, and we trust that the World Bank will
support us in implementing this adjustment policy, specifically by approving a
Structural Adjustment Loan.
Achievements to Date
Since mid 1986 the Tunisian Government has pursued a policy of
macroeconomic stabilization and reform of incentives that included the
following measures: (i) liberalization of foreign trade and domestic prices;
(ii) relaxation of financial and banking controls; (iii) promotion of
investment in the industrial sector; and (iv) start of tax simplification and
reorganization.
In 1986 and 1987, we pursued a consistent policy based mainly on
encouraging exports through an effective devaluation of 17 percent of the
exchange rate and containment of domestic demand by means of, inter alia, wage
restraint. This policy was accompanied by efforts to reduce the budget
deficit and ensure moderate growth in the money supply.
The various measures taken - helped by a favorable trend in
petroleum prices and an abundant grain harvest - produced gratifying results
in 1987, reflected in a 5.8 percent growth in GDP, a reduction in the current
payments deficit to D 111 million or 1.5 percent of GDP, and an inflation rate

of less than 6 percent. Exports rose 13.2 percent in volume terms, with
increased exports of manufactured goods and higher earnings from tourism
accounting for much of this improvement. At the end of 1987, the balance of
payments showed a surplus of D97 million, while the Central Bank of Tunisia's
foreign currency reserves were at a level equivalent to 1.8 months' imports.
These achievements were also attributable in part to concrete
actions taken to liberalize foreign trade. The maximum race of duty
applicable to imports was cut from 220 percent to 41 percent. Quantitative
restrictions were also eliminated on a wide range of products, including raw
materials and most semimanufactures and capital goods. In addition, companies
exporting more than 15 percent of their outp-tt may now freely import all
needed inputs.
As regards price controls at the production level, the prices of
goods with a combined weighting of almost 55 percent have now been
deregulated. At the same time, controls on most of the remaining items have
been relaxed.
A number of measures have also been taken to facilitate financial
interme4iatlon and make it more effective. Interest rate controls on both
deposits and loans have bee?A lessened. Interest rates paid to depositors have
now been essentially deregulated, while the former ceiling on leading rates
has been replaced by a bank spread of three points above the money market
rate. The money market rate has been raised, and it now stands at
approximately 9.5 percent. The money market was recently given a fresh
stimulus, when it was opened to non-banking financial institutions, industrial
and commercial enterprises and other agencies. Certificates of deposit issued
by banks and commercial paper issued by business enterprises are now among the
instruments traded on the money market. Lastly, the mechanisms available to
the Central Bank for intervening on the money market have beea diversified.
Another important reform has been the implementation of a new
Industrial Investment Code. Under the provisions of the new Code, iuvestors
are at liberty to carry out their investment projects and are no longer
required to obtain authorization from the authorities. However, in those
cases where the investor wishes to avail himself of special incentives -
which are now limited to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), export
projects and investments in disadvantaged regions - his application must
first be approved by a special committee.
Lastly, in the spirit of the tax reform now being prepared, the
system for taxing investment earnings has been amended. Tax rates have been
lowered by introducing the concept of "tax credits."
Continued Macroeconomic Adiustment
Our development strategy for the remainder of the Seventh Plan
period and beyond continues to be based on the pursuit of sustained growth in
consonance with macroeconomic balance, and on efficient allocation of
resources, taking into account the impending disappearance of the petroleum
surplus currently available to the economy.



Annex III
Page 3 of 6
- 49 -
We expect GDP to grow by close to 4 percent between 1987 and 1991,
in keeping with the goal of bringing the ratio of debt to current earnings of
the balance of payments down from 175 percent in 1986 to 142 by 1991. This
external constraint will require exports to grow by some 5.8 percent during
the Seventh Plan period; we regard this figure, which corresponds to a growth
of exports of 8.2 percent exclusive of energy, as attainable. This debt
strategy, the maintenance of real wages at a constant level, a monetary policy
compatible with a 6-7 percent inflation rate, a reduction in the budget
deficit to the equivalent of 2.2 percent of GDP by 1991, and an industrial
policy based on the pursuit of efficiency are the elements that underlie the
country's expected economic course. Within the context of the SAL, we intend
to review every six months, jointly with the staff of the World Bank,
macroeconomic developments, including transfers to public enterprises and the
public sector investment program together with the underlying assumptions.
These reviews would also cover possible changes in economic policy to remedy
any slippages that might occur. Each review would be carried out on the basis
of a report that the Ministry of Planning would submit to the Bank reasonably
in advance.
The social cost of our adjustment policy is obviously a matter of
concern to us. Studies on employment and income are under way at this very
moment, and we expect that the conclusions from these studies will assist us
in identifying and implementing appropriate measures to limit the negative
impact of adjustment on the poorest sectors of the population. The World Bank
will be kept informed on the progress and conclusions of these studies, and
they will be the subject of discussion and exchanges cf views during the
semiannual reviews.
Continuation of Reform Program
Achieving significant gains in productivity is one of our priorities
in view of its importance in building a modern, export-oriented economy
capable of growing in a sustained and sustainable manner. We are convinced
that the productivity gains we are seeking can be derived from the presence of
an essentially competitive environment, where resources are allocated in light
of their opportunity costs and where market mechanisms can on the whole
operate transparently. These are the guiding principles laid down in the
Seventh Plan that we have been pursuing since its inception.
Within the framework of these guiding principles, it is our hope
that the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) will in particular serve to underpin
our efforts in the following areas: (i) liberalization of markets for goods
and services; (ii) tax reform; and (iii) more flexible operation of the money
and financial markets.-
A.   Liberalization of markets for goods and services
As mentioned above, a major effort to liberalize prices and foreign
trade has already been implemented and is now starting to bear fruit. This
effort will be continued.



Annex III
Page 4 of 6
- 50 -
As regards prices at the production level, we intend by 1991 to
reach a situation where at least 75 percent of prices in terms of weighting in
the value of production have been liberalized. The next phase, scheduled for
the first quarter of 1989, will bring the proportion of deregulated prices to
70 percent. Similarly, at the distribution level, a special effort will be
made tc deregulate prices accounting for at least 20 percent in terms of
weighting, in two steps of 10 percent each, one before the end of May 1988 and
the second at the end of the first quarter of 1989.
With regard to tariff protection, our current intention is to mark
time in the process of reducing and reorganizing customs tariffs - while
leaving our goal of achieving a protection rate of close to 25 percent by 1991
unchanged - in order to focus more on reducing quantitative restrictions. In
this spirit, we hope to fully liberalize those imports that are still subject
to controls (except for a limited list of items representing approximately
25 percent) by the end of 1992. This would be done in eight semiannual
steps. The first of these planned reductions is scheduled to take p:ace
before the end of the fiist quarter of 1989 and would reduce by 15 points the
weighting in terms of production of imports subject to restriction.
Maintaining low prices for essential foodstuffs in order to protect
the standard of living of the poorest sectors of the population still
represents a relatively large subsidy element paid through the Caisse Gen6rale
de Compensation (CGC). It is the Government's intention to reduce the
cumulative total of these subsidies during the period covered by the Plan from
D 1,470 million without adjustment measures to approximately D 950 million.
This cutback will be achieved by means of certain price adjustments and
eliminating the subsidy for other products. In view of the need to protect
the disadvantaged groups in society, the impact of world prices and rainfall,
and the highly political nature of the issue, we feel it is appropriate to
reduce those subsidies whose effect is least redistributive. In this context,
we hope to hold the amount of subsidies paid by the Caisse G6n6rale de
Compensation (CGC) to approximately D 190 million in 1988. In the context of
the semiannual macroeconomic reviews with the World Bank, we should like to
discuss the status of these subsidies and any corrections that might be
required to offset slippages.
B.   Tax reform
Tunisia's tax system is the result of a long process of additions
and amendments to a legislative base of considerable antiquity. The
Government has embarked on a vast program of reforming the various direct and
indirect taxes to adapt their structure to the needs of a modern economy. The
dauntingly complex system of indirect taxation will be replaced by a Value
Added Tax (VAT), the draft legislation for which was introduced in the Chamber
of Deputies in May 1988. The intended date of application for the VAT is July
1, 1988, and it will be extended to enterprises in the wholesale commercial
sector with a turnover exceeding 500,000 dinars on January 1, 1989.
Government officials will be looking into the feasibility of extending VAT
coverage to the retail commercial sector, and the results of this study will
be discussed with the World Bank before the end of the first quarter of 1989.



Annex III
Page 5 of 6
- 51 -
The Value Added Tax wil? have three positive rates: a reduced rate
of 6 percent will apply to basic consumer items; most items will be subject to
the standard rate of 17 percent, while the enhanced rate of 29 percent will
apply to luxury consumer items.  Exports will qualify for a zero rate, while
farm production will be exempt.
The impact of this VAT reform on budget revenues is difficult to
quantify. However, we cannot afford to run the risk of a sizable drop in
receipts. Tp this end, therefore, consumption taxes will be maintained on
certain items, with three rates being applied; this will be in addition to
such products as fuels, alcohol, tobacco, jewelry, luxury automobiles and
certain other luxury items. It is our intention to gradually reduce
consumption taxes on the items other than those listed above, and to eliminate
them by 1991, depending on their impact on the budget.
The structure of direct taxes will be greatly simplified in relation
to the current situation. The multiple taxes paid by individual taxpayers
will be replaced by a single, unified tax, with a lower maximum rate.
Similarly, corporate bodies will be subject to a single tax integrated with
the tax on individuals. The draft legislation will be submitted to the World
Bank for consultation in July 1988. The text will then be laid before the
Chamber of Deputies in August and the law will enter into effect in January
1989 and will be applicable to 1988 earnings.
We also intend to continue with the significant reform movement
already initiated in the money and financial markets.  This movement includes
consolidation of the money market, diversification of financial instruments,
and adjustment of certain interest rates to better reflect the scarcity of
financial resources.
C.   More flexible operation of the money and financial markets
A major effort will be made to train money market operators and to
formulate a code of conduct. The range of financial instruments is to be
enlarged by introducing short- and medium-term Government bonds. To this end,
and in order to make them more fungible with money market instruments, we plan
to adopt measures to rationalize the taxation of revenues from Treasury bonds
(boasd' quippment) and to raise in early 1989, their current rate of
interest to compensate for the elimination of their fiscal exemption. At the
same time, in the course of 1988, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance
will prepare a study, with support from the International Monetary Fund, on
the possibility of introducing Treasury notes (bonsdutrwsor) as a further
means of consolidating the money market. Between now and the beginning of
January 1989, we plan to raise to 7 percent the effective cost or preferential
loans carrying an interest rate of less than 7 percent by reducing the
proportion of these loans that may be rediscounted with the Central Bank.
Subsequently, and by September of 1989, the gap between the cost of
preferential loans, other than to agriculture, and the money market rate will
be reduced by one-third either by adjusting the percentage of rediscountable
funds or by raising the rates or a combination of the two - the objective
being to align the rates in question with the money market by 1991. In
addition, we propose to review the situation of the banking sector before the



Annex III
Page 6 of 6
- 52 -
end of March 1989, with particular reference to interbank competition, with a
view to considering the desirability of raising or deregulating the bank
spread on loans.
Furthermore, it has become essential to adopt a system for managing
exchange risks that will begin to accustom operators to the fluctuations on
international financial markets without, however, imposing excessive strains
on their cash flow situations. To this end, we propose to introduce by
August 15, 1988 a system for the coverage of the foreign exchange risk
essentially based on market mechanisms. This system would be applicable to
loans contracted in foreign currencies by enterprises and banks, with the
exception of loans contracted by banks at the behest of the State. The risk
on the latter would be covered by a premium equal to the difference between
the rate of interest on the loan and that on the money market through an
arrangement to be managed by the Central Bank. This arrangement and the
volume of these loans would be reviewed with the World Bank in the framework
of the regular exchanges of views that are envisaged.
The various macroeconomic and structural adjustment measures listed
in this letter should enable the Tunisian economy to make the transition to
the post-petroleum era and to grow in an efficient and sustainable manner. It
goes without saying that the adoption of the proposed measures would be
greatly facilitated if the World Bank were to respond favorably to our request
for this Structural Adjustment Loan.
