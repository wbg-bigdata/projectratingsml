MALI: SECOND ?OWER PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower             Republic of Mali
Beneficiaries        Energie du Mali (EDM).
Ministry of Industry, Hydraulicb and Energy (MIHE).
Amount               SDR 24.2 million (US$33.0 million equivalent).
Terms                Standard, with 40 years maturity.
Onlending Terms      The Government would relend 852 of the Credit (US$28
million) to EDM at the prevailing Bank interest rate
(currently 7.65%) for 25 years including a five-year grace
period. EDM would bear the foreign exchange risk on that
amount of the Credit. An amount of US$3.2 million
equivalent (10% of the Credit) to finance technical
assistance and training would be passed on to EDM as
Government equity or as a grant.
Colenders            A consortiun of cofinanciers would provide about US$52.8
million equivalent towards the project costs.
Project Objectives
and Description      The proposed project aims at correcting the most critical
deficiencies in the power sector by: (i) close involvement
of EDM in sectoral planning and streamlining the
relationship between Government and EDM; (ii)
consolidating into EDM the technical responsibility
for construccion and operation of all power sector
facilities and separating its water and power activities;
(iii) effecting improvements in all aspects of operations,
including the introduction of performance contracts for
EDM with specific efficiency targets and provision of
technical assistance and training as well as studies to
improve efficiency. The project would finance part of the
investment program of the power sector for the period 1989
to 1994 including the rehabilitation and extension of the
existing generation, transmission and distribution systems
in Bamako and the outside centers, including the provision
of spares, tools and equipment. In addition, assistance
to GOM will be provided to develop and implement a
household energy strategy.



v
Project Benefits
and Risks            The proposed project would strengthen the institutional
framework of the pov,r sub-sector as well as the power
utility so as to improve efficiency and .o facilitate
future development. Rehabilitation of generation and
distribution facilities would be completed and the power
grid would be extended to meet economically justifiable
loads. The rehabilitation would reduce both the cost of
generation and energy losses. The household energy
component would initiate a concerted effort to protect the
fragile environment around urban areas. There are no
unusual physical risks associated with the proposed
project. Institutional risks would be minimized through
the use of a performance contract for the power utility
and ongoing technical assistance as well as the
Governments commitment to institutional reform.

MALI
SECOND POWER PROJECT
I. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources and Consumption
1.01        Mali's  domestic  energy  resources  consist  of  biomass  (fuelwood,
charcoal, agricultural and agro-industrial residues), hydro, wind and solar energy.
At the present time, only biomass for household energy and hydro for electricity
generation are exploited on a significant scale. Natural forest vegetation covers
some 7.4 million hectares, or 14 percent of Mali's area. Annual forestry arowth
is estimated at 7 million cubic meters. The country's hydro-electric potential
based on the Senegal and Niger River systems is estimated at 1,100 MW, capable of
producing 5,500 GWh in an average year.  Of this potential only about 50 MW (250
GWh) has been developed so far.  A petroleum exploration promotion project (Cr.
1134-MLI) was initiated in 1981 with the aim of compiling geological and
geophysical data to assess the country's petroleum potential. As a result of the
promotional effort associated with the project, two wells were drilled, but proved
dry.  Petroleum interest in Mali has since waned.  A project (Cr. 1403-MLI) to
produce ethanol from surplus molasses from two sugar refineries is under
implementation with IDA financing.   Solar and wind energy are also potentially
significant but only pilot schemes operate at present.
1.02        Statistical inLormation on the energy sector is poor and incomplete.
Energy consumption in 1985 was estimated at 2.7 million tons of oil equivalent
(toe).   Mali's energy demand comes mostly from residential use (93Z) and from
transport (4Z); the remaining demand is from agriculture and industry.  To meet
this demand, the country has relied on its limited supply of fuelwood (6.7 million
cubic meters or 3 million tons), some hydro-electricity (150 GWh) and imports of
petroleum products (172,000 tons).   Fuelwood is the predominant energy .ource,
providing an estimated 95? of the country's gross energy supply. It is used by
some 98? of the households for cooking and heating needs and by small businesses
and commercial enterprises.   Commercial energy demaa,  (principally hydrocarbon
fuels) has grown rapidly as a result of urbanization and the demand for petroleum
products more than doubled between 1970 and 1980, increasing from 82,000 tons to
174,000 tons. In the subsequent two years, there was a decline due mainly to the
commissioning of the Selingue hydroelectric plant in 1980 which reduced diesel
based power generation, but the demand for petroleum products is now back to the
1980 level. The demand for electric power amounted to 189 GWh in 1987 1/ and has
been increasing at an average of about 132 since 1980.
B. The Energy Sector Organization
1.03              Responsibilities in the energy sector are spread among various
agencies and are unusually complex.  The Direction Nationale des Eaux et Forets
1/ Excluding private generation which was estimated in 1987 at about 20 GWh.



- 2 -
under the Ministry of Environment and Livestock is in charge of managing Mali's
forest resources and the supply of fuelwood. The Ministry of Industry, Hydraulics
and Energy (MIHE) is responsible for administering exploration of hydrocarbons,
which  itself  is  left  to  the  oil  companies.    The Ministry  of  Transports,
Telecommunications and Tourism supervises oil product imports and distribution.
Responsibility for the transportation, marketing and distribution of petroleum
products has been left to five private oil and transport companies although prices
are fixed by government agencies.
1.04    Responsibility for the power sector is divided among three agencies: (i)
the Direction Nationale de l'Hydraulique et de l'Energie (DNIE), a government
department under MIHE, whose function is to plan and construct major power and
water schemes and provide technical supervision on the sector; (ii) Energie du
Mali (EDM), the parastatal responsible for operation and maintenance of most power
and urban water facilities including those constructed by DNHE.   Part of EDM's
facilities are operated under a concession agreement, whereby it operates
government-owned facilities for a fixed period, and is allowed to recover its
capital  subject  to  agreed  limitations  on  tariffs.    However,  most  of  the
rehabilitation and extension of diesel, siTall hydroelectric plants and distribution
facilities are now carried out under direct responsibility of EDM; and (iii) Office
pour l'Exploitation des Resources Hydrauliques du Haut Niger  (OERHN), another
parastatal established to operate the Selingue hydroelectric plant and promote
irrigation and fishery activities. In addition, the Organization pour la Mise en
Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS), the regional river authority for the S6n6gal Basin
(Mali, Mauritania and Senegal) 2/, has recently completed the construction of the
Manantali Dam in Western Mali (para. 1.16).
1.05    While some dispersion of responsibilities and functions in the energy
sector can be expected, the organization of the power sub-.;ector seems excessively
fragmen 3d and has contributed to operating difficulties. Examples are: (i) poor
coordination between DNHE, OERHN   and EDM for investment planning and system
operations; and (ii) lack of coordination in fixing tariffs and rivalry in project
decision making.
1.06    To address these institutional problems, the First Power/Water Project
(Cr. 1282-MLI) financed a study to examine the institutional changes required in
the power and water sectors.   Based on the recommendations of this study and
lengthy discussions with the Government of Mali (GOM) during the preparation of
the Public Enterprise Institutional Development Project , which was approved in
June 1988,  and this project,  the Government and IDA have now agreed on the
principles for the institutional reform of the power and water sectors.
Introduction of this new institutional framework is a condition of effectiveness
(para. 1.31).
2/  Guinea has recently joined OMVS, but does not share in the existing faciliti.-s.

C. Energy Policy and Pricing 3/
1.07    GOM has not yet formulated a comprehensive energy policy.  Its objectives
for the sector, as outlined in the second five-year development plan (1981-1985)
are to: (i) evaluate and develop domestic energy resources; and (ii) promote more
efficient utilization of energy in all its forms. To achieve these objectives, its
strategy is to: (i) increase and rationalize fuelwood production; (ii) promote the
use of improved wood stoves or kerosene and LPG as household energy; (iii) increase
the efficiency of the existing power facilities; and (iv) further develop Mali's
hydroelectric potential. Under the third five-year development plan (1987-1991),
which was only recently published, GOM's basic objectives for the energy sector
have not changed.  A World Bank/UNDP energy assessment mission to Mali took place
iln November/December 1988. It will serve as a basis for GOM to formulate a more
comprehensive energy policy.
1.08    The  cost  of  imported  petroleum  products  in Mali  is high,  affected
particularly by substantial overland transport costs and the cost of purchase from
the refineries in Dakar and Abidjan.   A comparison of prices paid by local
companies and prices on the international market shows Mali does not obtain
competitive conditions for the quartities of imports. The reason is partly because
the present pricing structure does not have a built-in-incentive for companies to
procure oil at competitive prices. Pricing of petroleum products in Mali is based
upon a standard price structure for each of the two sources of supply.   A
stabilization fund is fed in the one case or drawn down in the other, by any
difference between the theoretical supply cost set out in the price structure and
the actual cost billed for the distribution companies. Its aim is to provide: (i)
shelter for consumers from price movements on the international market; (ii) cress-
subsidies between products; and (iii) some equalization between regions to achieve
country-wide prices that do not differ too widely. Prices are high and there is
need for rationalizing petroleum product supply and distribution to ensure that
petroleum is secured and distributed at the lowest cost. With financing from a
technical assistance project (Credit 1307-MLI), studies have been undertaken to
identify ways of reducing the cost of petroleum products to the country.   The
studies are currently under review and a plan of action will be prepared for
discussion with IDA.
1.09    Although GOM attaches high priority to household energy and related issues
such as conservation of fuelwood and environmental protection, its approach so far
has been piece-meal and there are few linkages between ongoing and planned
projects. There are a number of forestry projects aimed at improving wood supply,
amongst which the IDA/CCCE/FAC Second Forestry Project.   GOM has expressed its
intention to reorient its forestry activities towards a greater participation of
the rural population in natural forest cover management.   On the demand side
bilateral agencies (USAID and GTZ) have started promoting improved woodstoves.
Recently, the GOM passed a law requiring every household to have at least one
improved woodstove. The law is however not enforced and the relatively high cost

of the improved stoves and the lack of adequate promotional activities have so far
prevented successful market penetration. Major additional efforts are required to
better manage supply and demand of fuelwood.
1.10    At GOM's request the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP)
will undertake a comprehensive household energy strategy study which would include
the assessment of: (i) available woodfuel resources; (ii) demand management and
substitution options; (iii) energy pricing policies; (iv) supply options and market
scenarios; (v) improved institutional arrangaments etc. The study will start in
April 1989 and will take about six months. During negotiations agreement has been
reached to discuss the results of the study with IDA and agree on the strategy
before it is implemented. Given the need to urgently address these issues and its
potential benefits, the project includes finance for a household energy component
to assist GOM with the implementation of an agreed household energy strategy,
developed with ESMAP and other donor assistance.
D.   The Power Sector
1. Existing Electricity Supply Facilities
1.11    The existing electricity supply system in Mali is shown on Map IBRD21018.
It comprises an interconnected power system with a capacity of about 68 MW and
ten isolated secondary centers totalling about 10 MW. Installed captive generating
capacity is estimated at 23 MW. Detailed characteristics of existing facilities
are set out in Annex 1-1. The Selingue hydroelectric plant, owned and operated
by OERHN, is Mali's largest hydroelectric plant and principal source of electric
energy for the Bamako interconnected system. It has a capacity of 44 MW and an
average potential output of about 210 GWh. Since the Selingue hydroelectric plant
was commissioned in September 1980, it has experienced problems with the cooling
of the alternators caused by clogged radiator tubes and OERHN was forced to take
each unit out of service once every six months. This has so far not affected the
operation of the plant since the load level in the Bamako system does not yet
absorb all of Selingue's potential output. OERHN is currently carrying out a study
on how to remedy these problems.   The recommendations of the study will be
implemented  under  the  proposed project.    OERHN's  operation  and maintenance
practices include an annual inspection of the earth dam. Continuation of these
annual inspections by an en-ineering firm acceptable to IDA, submission of their
report to IDA and implementation of their recommendations is a condition of the
Credit.
1.12      EDM operates two plants in Bamako, the Sotuba hydroelectric plant with
an installed capacity of 5.2 MW and an average annual output of 39 GWh, and the
Dar Salam diesel plant with an installed capacity of 18 MW. The isolated centers
are supplied by diesel units varying in capacity from 35 kVA to 1375 kVA except for
Kayes where the 500 kW Felou hydroelectric plant meets part of the demand. By 1982,
EDM's power plants had deteriorated due to poor operational and maintenance
practices and lack of financial resources to provide adequate spare parts.  The
rehabilitation of the Dar Salam plant in Bamako was completed under the First
Power/Water Project with cofinancing from CCCE. With financing from the OPEC Fund,

Power/Water Project with cofinancing from CCCE. With financing from the OPEC Fund,
EDM has constructed a 2 MW diesel plant at Mopti which was commissioned in February
1987.  The rehabilitation of the remaining major generating facilities will be
addressed under the proposed project.
1.13    The principal transmission grid in Mali's interconnected system comprises
130 km of 150-kV line from Selingue to Bamako and 75 km of 30-kV lines forming a
loop around Bamako and supplying the town of Koulikoro about 50 km north-east of
Bamako. The 150-kV system is reasonably well maintained; however, the 30-kV system
and the 15-kV distribution network and substations have not been adequately
maintained or expanded.   This had resulted in limited electrification,  poor
reliability of service and high energy losses, which in 1987 were estimated to be
about 22Z,  including non-technical losses.   The distribution systems  in the
isolated centers are also in poor condition and the average total energy losses are
estimated at about 25Z.   The most urgent rehabilitation work  in the Bamako
distribution system is being carried out with financing provided under the First
Power/Water Project (Cr. 1282-MLI) and this has already helped to reduce losses to
a current level of about 19Z.  In addition, the distribution network is being
extended to parts of unelectrified neighborhoods of Bamako. The proposed project
will continue the rehabilitation and extension work in Bamako and as well in
selected isolated centers.
2. Access to Service
1.14    In 1988 EDM had about 37,000 customer connections of which about 70Z in
the Bamako system. About 31,000 consumers are classified as domestic and about
4? of the population has access to electricity 4/.  Even in Bamako with about
25,000 consumers, the degree of electrification is only about 28Z (Annex 1-2).
In 1987, average annual domestic consumption in the interconnected system was
estimated at 2,200 kWh and at 650 kWh in the isolated centers. The low level of
consumption in the isolated centers is partly explained by the fact that service
is often only provided for a few hours per day because of the limited availability
of diesel fuel.
3. Trends, Patterns and Forecasts of Consumption
1.15    EDM's electricity sales since 1978 are shown in Annex 1-3.  From 1978 to
1981, energy sales in the interconnected system dropped slightly, mainly due to
the deteriorating condition of the Dar Salam diesel plant in Bamako.  However,
following the commiasioning of the Selingue hydroelectric plant in 1980, supply
improved and energy sales grew from 67 GWh in 1981 to 135 GWh in 1987, an average
annual increase of about 13Z. This was the result of meeting suppressed demand and
rehabilitating and extending the distribution system under the First Power/Water
Project. Over the same period, energy generated grew from 81 GWh to 173 GWh, an
average annual increase of about 14Z reflecting a considerable increase in energy

household.



- 6 -
losses which are partially due to administrative shortcomings and to theft (para.
1.34). Detailed demand studies carried out under the First Power/Water Project
have demonstrated that there is a considerable potential for increased electricity
use. Electricity consumption in the interconnected system is forecast to grow at
an average annual rate of 9.6Z through 1995 including the additional demand in the
Segou region, which will be interconnected under the proposed project.   Energy
sales in the isolated systems, which in 1987 accounted for only 8Z of total sales
(13 GWh) have either remained stable or declined since 1978 because of the poor
condition of the diesel plants or non-availability of fuel. Under the proposed
project, demand in the isolated systems is expected to pick up to represent about
10 of total electricity sales by iD95. Forecast of power demand and generation
planning through 1995 are shown in Annex 1-4.
4.  Sector Development, Planning and Investment Program
1.16    A Generation and Transmission Master Plan for the period 1992-2005 was
recently completed. The consultants (Tractionnel, Belgium) has reviewed possible
hydro and thermal alternatives for developing the Malian power system on its own
or as part of an interconnected system with Senegal and Mauritania. The present
installed capacity in the Malian interconnected system would meet the projected
systems demand till 1992. Planning studies carried out in 1985 for the Senegal
power system and the recently completed Mali Power Master Plan indicate that
development of the power facilities at the Manantali dam under construction by
OMVS, is the least cost alternative for expansion of generating capacity for the
region under the assumption that the oil price exceeds US$15 per barrel in 1987
prices.  Initially, the bulk of the output (800 GWh) would be for Senegal, which
has a market five times as large as Mali's, but no domestic hydro resources.   At
a later stage more power would be supplied to Mali.   Power to Bamako would be
supplied through a 350 km long, 220 kV transmission line. OMVS is seeking finance
to construct power facilities at the dam (200 MW) and transmission lines to supply
Dakar, Nouakchott and Bamako.   The amount of financing required (about US$300
million) and the institutional issues relating to ownership and management of the
facilities have delayed the construction of the power facilities, but a decision
on the Manantali power project is expected to be made during the next few months
It is currently anticipated that power from Manantali could be available by l9S
In order to meet the anticipated load growth, an additional 5 MW diesel unit would
have to be installed in Bamako for each year that the in-service date of Manantali
is delayed beyond 1994.
1.17    As Malian demand from Manantali increases, the energy available to supply
Senegal and Mauritania would diminish, leading therefore to the need for additional
hydro capacity for the regional market. The next step would then be to develop the
hydro-electric sites on the Senegal Basin such as Gouina (105 MW, 570 GWh), or
Grand Felou (80 MW, 412 GWh) for the regional market (Mali, Senegal and Mauritania)
or Kenid (30 MW, 200 GWh) for the Mali market alone.
1.18    The main components of the power sector's investment program for the period
1989-1994, which represents the least cost development program for the Mali power
system are: (i) completion of the rehabilitation program and extension of the
distribution system initiat:ed under the Power/Water Project (Cr. 1282-MLI); (ii)



- 7 -
mines and the rehabilitation and extension of the Felou hydroelectric plant (630
kW) near Kayes; (iii) rehabilitation of the power systems in the isolated centers;
(iv) extension of the interconnected system to Segou by 1990 with substations in
Fana and Dioila; (v) extension of the Dar Salam diesel plant by about 5 MW in 1992
(vi) development of the Manantali power station (200 MW, 800 GWh); and
interconnection of the Bamako power system to the Manantali hydroelectric plant
with a 300 km, 220-kV transmission line; (vii) extension of the interconnected
grid to supply Sikasso and Koutiala as soon as Manantali power is available to the
interconnected power system; and (viii) electrification of five isolated towns by
1994.
1.19    The total estimated 1989-1994 capital expenditures in the power sector,
which amounts to US$277 million equivalent in current prices, is summarized below
and showr. in detail in Annex 1-5.

the cost of the Manantali power plant as estimated in the 'Groupement Manantali
Report', July 1985.
b/ Excludes interest during construction.
1.20            The power sector investment program would represent about 102 of
Mali's estimated public sector expenditures for the period 1989-1994. Although
this is considerably higher than the past few years, it is justified because no
major investments in the power sector took place since 1982 apart from those made
under the first Power/Water project.   The current investment program includes
projects such as the Bamako-Segou interconnection and the rehabilitation of the
isolated centers which were considerably delayed pending the resolution of
institutional issues in the sector. About 20% of the investment cost are for the
Mali share in the Manantali power plant to be undertaken by OMVS. The power sector
investment program was discussed and agreed during negotiations.   The economic
viability of the Manantali related investments is again being reviewed, but a final
decision on these investments as well as on the construction of the Manantali power

decision on these investments as well as on the construction of the Manantali power
plant is now expected before mid-1989. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that the power sector investment program be reviewed and agreed with IDA on an
annual basis.
5. Energie du Mali (EDM)
(a) Organization and Management
1.21            EDM was established in 1961 as a mixed capital company with GOM
holding the majority (55Z) of the share capital and two French public agencies,
CCCE and EDF respectively holding 391 and 6X of the shares.  In 1983, GOM took
over CCCE's shareholding.   EDM is administered by an eight member Board of
Directors, all representatives of Government ministries. The General Manager is
appointed by Presidential decree and is responsible for day-to-day management.
Under EDM's current organization structure (Annex 1-6), most operational
departments and staff services report directly to the General Manager and his
deputy.   Functional responsibilities are not always clearly delineated between
departments. The structure also poses a heavy burden on the General Manager and
coordination between units leaves much to be desired.   A more  satisfactory
organization structure has been developed (Annex 1-6), which, for the commercial
operations has already been applied. Further changes will be gradually introduced
as part of the implementation of the manpower study (para 1.32).
(b) Manpower and Training
1.22            EDM has  about  1000 employees  of which 45 are classified  as
professional staff.  There are currently 10 resident technical assistance staff
working within EDM financed by FAC (7) and IDA (3) (Annex 1-7).  Although the
total number of staff is high for a utility of this size, there is still a general
shortage of suitably qualified staff at almost all levels of the organization and
this has been another major obstacle to improving EDM's operations. EDM has its
own training center,  "Centre de Perfectionnement  du Personnel  (CPP)", which
organizes  a variety  of  training courses.    In addition,  six engineers  and
technicians are being trained at the 'Ecole Superieure Interafricaine de
l'Electricit6' (ESIE) and the "Centre de Metier de l'Electricit6" (CME) in C6te
d'Ivoire, which are expected to return to EDM over the next few years. In general,
however, staff training needs to be intensified and this is proposed to be done
under the proposed project (para. 1.32).
(c, Accounting, Audit and Insurance
1.23            EDM's accounting system is based on accrual accounting principles
using the Malian Chart of Accounts 5/. It has a number of weaknesses, which stem
mostly from the absence of appropriate complementary systems for cost accounting
and inventory control. With the help of the technical assistance under Cr. 1282-
5/ Derived from the 1957 French Chart of Accounts.



MLI, some improvements have been achieved, including preparation of separate
operating budgets for EDM's water and electricity activities and the introduction
of imrvoved financial controls.  EDM continues to have a shortage of qualified and
experienced accounting personnel which makes it difficult to enforce existing
controls and procedures. The closing of the 1987 accounts was considerably delayed
for  the  same  reason,  although computer problems  also played  a role.   The
introduction of a new general and cost accouAnting system and the updating of the
fixed asset register, as required under Cr. 1282-MLI, could also not be implemented
as originally anticipated.   Based on recommendations of its external auditors
(Arthur Andersen, Cote d'Ivoire), EDM has started to implement, with the help of
technical assistance staff for the finance and data management divisions financed
by the FAC, a program for computerization of its accounting system, including
applications for budgeting, cost accounting, inventory control, fixed asset
register and cash management. This forms part of the program to strengthen EDM's
organization agreed during negotiations (para 1.32)
1.24            In early 1986 the external audit of EDM's accounts for 1984 and
1985 was completed.  It was the first external audit since 1977.  As expected,
the audit report confirmed many deficiencies and the accounts could not be
certified. EDM incorporated most of the auditor's recommendations, but again the
1986 accounts could not be certified, because many fundamental problems in its
accounting and related systems have not yet been corrected. The 1987 audit showed
continuing improvements, but the accounts could still not be certified for the same
reasons as mentioned above.   At negotiations, agreement has been reached that EDM
accounts will continue to be audited annually by auditors acceptable to IDA and
submitted within six months following the end of the fiscal year.
1.25            EDM maintains insurance cover against regular utility risks, but
the insured amounts have not been increased to properly reflect replacement costs
because of the delays experienced in updating the fixed asset register.   At
negotiations, agreement has been reached that EDM would carry out regularly, a pro-
forma revaluation of its fixed assets in order to assess the adequacy of its
current insurance coverage and make corresponding adjustments in insurance
coverage.
(d) Past Financial Performance and Present Position
1.26            Until 1985, EDM only published consolidated accounts for its
water and electricity operations. The audit reports of the 1984 and 1985 accounts
revealed that previously reported losses of CFAF 900 million for 1984 and CFAF 440
million for 1985 should have been more than double, mainly on account of inadequate
provisions for depreciation and wrongly recorded sales.   Following substantial
tariff increases for water (200Z) and electricity (35Z) in November 1985, EDM
recorded an operating profit of CFAF 1,150 million for 1986. However, its net loss
was about CFAF 150 million after taking into account the necessary prior year



- 10 -
adjustments 6/ based on the auditor's findings and recommendations. These losses
include CFAF 800 million of private sector arrears dating from before 1982 which
were written off. All these adjustments have resulted in a considerable decrease
of EDM's net capital and reserves position. Since 1984, EDM's liquidity position
has remained critical mainly because of poor collection of both water and
electricity bills L!ld high distribution losses. In 1987, EDM's water activities
continued to be unprofitable, but on an overall basis it has reported a net profit.
of about CFAF 90 million.
1.27            For 1985 to 1987, EDM prepared pro-forma financial statements
(unaudited) for its electricity activities, which are set out in Annex 1.8. The
key financial indicators are shown in the following table.

a/ After income tax, interest, write off doubtful debts and prior year
adjustments.
1.28            Unlike  its  water  activities,  EDM's  electricity  activity was
profitable from 1985 to 1987. The major contributing factor to the profitability
are the relatively high average tariffs of CFAF 61 (US$0.20), following a 35Z
across the board tariff increase attained in November 1985 and the fact that about
75Z of its energy sold was purchased from OERHN at CFAF 25/kWh (US$0.08). In spite
of the high distribution losses, this margin was sufficient to cover the operating
losses in the isolated diesel centres. EDM's net income became negative in 1986,
because of prior year adjustments and the substantial write off on private sector
arrears. In 1987, EDM complied with IDA's self financing ratio of 102 stipulated
under Cr. 1282-MLI. However, the high self-financing ratio shown for 1987 cannot
be considered accurate, because it is partly the result of adjustments. To correct
6/ Mainly wrongly recorded sales, fixed assets and depreciation etc.



- 11 -
errors made in previous years following the auditors recommendations, the data
shown should therefore only be considered indicative.
1.29            Although EDM's current ratio appears reasonable, its net working
capital is fully tied up in customet receivables (CFAF 4,300 million). This is the
main reason for EDM's continuing liquidity problems.  In 1986 and 1987, it was
unable to meet part of its debt obligations or settle all its bills for power
purchased from OERHN.  At the end of 1986, EDM was four months in arrears with
OERHN.  This was an improvement over 1985, and was largely due to a tripartite
settlement of arrears between GOM, EDM and OERHN with the help of a structural
adjustment  loan from France.   At the end of 1987  the situation had again
deteriorated to about 7 months. EDM's rate of -etarn on rate base is relatively
high (19% in 1987), not only because OERHN's p.er facilities are not included in
EDM's asset base, but also because EDM does not revalue its fixed assets on a
regular basis. On the other hand, EDM does nake provisions for renewal on about
90% of its fixed assets in line with the requirements of its concession agreement
(para. 1.04). In 1987, provision for depreciation and renewal amounted to about
8.5%  of gross  fixed assets.   The  latter practice  explains  the  acceptable
debt/equity ratio of 58/42, in spite of the incorporation of accumulated losses.
6.              Power Sector Strategy
(a) Institutional Reform
1.30            The main elements of the a;reed institutional reform are as follows
(Annex 1.9):
(i) EDM to have the technical responsibility for planning,
construction and operation of all power facilities, with the
exception of regional and multipurpose projects (e.g.
Manantali) for which ad-hoc arrangements would be made;
(ii)  operation  of OERHN's  power  facilities  by  EDM  under  a
management contract, which will include the integration of
OERHN's electricity personnel into EDH;
(iii)  MIHE would be responsible for policy making, overall planning
and regulatory matters in the power sector;
(iv)  separation of technical and accounting aspects of water and
power activities within EDM and;
(v)  continued  strengthening  of  EDM  and  introduction  of
performance contracts for the power and water activities
(para. 1.32).
1.31            A protocol for the transfer of OERHN's electricity personnel to
EDM was signed on August 24, 1988.   It is currently anticipated that the new
institutional structure of the electricity sector would be operational not later
than June 30, 1989.   EDM's statutes would be amended to allow it to continue to



- 12 -
operate as a mixed capital company (Societe d'economie mixte) under the commercial
code. In addition, EDM would sign a performance contract for its power and water
activities with GOM whiich would require EDM to meet specific efficiency targets.
Revised electricity and water laws would redefine the responsibilities between GOM
and EDM. The draft new legislation for the power and water sectors, e. g. revised
statutes EDM, performance contracts, electricity and water laws and the management
contract between OERHN and EDM have been discussed during negotiations and the
comments are now being incorporated by the GOM.   Enactment of satisfactory new
legislation and signing of a satisfactory EDM/OERHN management contract would be
conditiens of effectiveness. In the longer run a separate water utility may be
created, but at this stage it is not considered advisable.
(b) Institutional Strengthening
1.32            Faced with EDM's still unsatisfactory operational efficiency, the
GOM requested IDA to finance under the First Power/Water Project, a diagnostic
study of EDM's power and water supply activities, which was completed in October
1986.   Based on the recommendations of this report, as well as other studies
covering specific areas, EDM has started to modify its organization structure (para
1.21) and improve its accounting and other administrative systems (para 1.23).
Also, a manpower study is being carried out which includes: (i) evaluation of all
power sector personnel; (ii) integration of OERHN's power personnel into EDM's new
organization structure; (iii) development of an appropriate training program in
cooperation with CPP; and (iv) review of technical assistance needs.   EDM has
stubmitted to IDA a comprehensive program for completing the strengthening of its
organization. It includes a training and technical assistance program, which will
be reviewed in detail under the manpower study. Particular attention will be given
to training of accounting staff, given EDM's difficulties in recruiting staff with
adequate experience. At negotiations, agreement has been reached on the execution
of this program. The agreed actions will be reflected in and monitored through
the performance contract for EDM.
(c) Billing and Collection
1.33            In spite of considerable efforts under the First Power/Water
Project to update customer files and accounts, replace faulty meters and improve
the computerization of billing, EDM's performance on billing and collection has
remained unsatisfactory. At the end of 1986, accounts receivable for electricity
and water 7/ were equivalent to 4.2 months (CFAF 2.8 billion) for the private
sector and 5.5 months (CFAF 2.3 billion) for the public sector, for an average
equivalent to 4.7 months of sales (CFAF 5.1 billion). Although this represented
a marked improvement over the situation at the end of 1985 (5.1 months for the
private sector and 10 months for the public sector), it was largely the result of
the write off of uncollectible private sector bills and tri-partite compensation
between GOM, EDM and OERHN for public sector bills and not because of improved bill
7/ About 85Z of total amounts relate to electricity. The trends are however
the same for water and electricity sales.

collection. At the end of 1987, private sector recei-ables had again increased to
4.6 months equivalent and public sector receivables to 6.5 months.
1.34            Specifit: diagnostic of EDM's commercial operations concluded that:
(i) the updated customer files had not yet been properly integrated into EDM's
operaCions (which is part of the reason for unaccounted o:nergy losses); (ii)
administrative procedures were not only inadequate but even existlag ones were not
enforced (some of the non-paying customers are not disconnected); and (iii) the
organizational structure of the commercial department needed to be considerably
strengthened. EDM embarked in late 1987 on an action plan, which included: (i) a
complete reorganization of its commercial operation; (ii) further and improved
computerization;  (iii)  introduction  of  improved  administrative  and  control
procedures etc. Results were already visible at the end of the first quarter of
1988, when bill collection for private sector rustomers improved from about 81% in
1987 to about 92Z.  EDM faced some major set backs in May 1988 due to computer
problems, but the implementation of the action plan is now well underway. In August
1988 bill recovery for the private sector had improved to 1141. Collection of
arrears from the public sector, remains problematic, but a pl4n to settle cross
debt in the public sector has been agreed to under the Public Enterprise Sector
Adjustment Project which was approved in June 1988. At negotiations, agreement was
reached on a detailed plan: (i) to reduce technical and non-technical energy
losses; 8/  (ii) to improve bill collection; and (iii) with specific collection
targets for each consumer category in order to reduce receivables of EDM to a level
equivalent to four months of sales by December 31, 1989, three months of sales by
December 31, 1990 and to maintain that level thereafter. At negotiations agreement
has been reached that: (i) the plan to reduce energy losses and receivables and to
improve recovery agreed to with IDA will be implemented and reflected in the
performance contracts; and (ii) GOM would make (or cause to be made) adequate
budgetary provisions in the public sector and arrange for payment of bills when
due.
(d) Tariffs and Financial Objectives
1.35            EDM charges uniform tariffs throughout the country and details are
set out in Annex 1-10.   Under the First Power/Water Project  (Cr. 1282-MLI),
consultants have reviewed EDM's retail electricity tariffs as well as the bulk
tariff from OERHN to EDM.   Their reports were completed in 1985.   In November
1985, at the request of the IMF under the third standby agreement and in response
to the poor financial situation in the power sector, GOM increased EDM's tariffs
across the board by 352 and OERHN's bulk tariff by 262 from CFAF 20/kWh to CFAF
25.2/kWh.    The  overall  magnitude  of  the  increases  was  in  line  with  the
recommendations of the tariff studies and it increased the average price to
consumers from CFAF 43/kWh to CFAF 61/kWh which was close to the average long run
marginal cost of supply calculated in constant 1984 prices.   The retail tariff
structure was, however, not changed as recommended by the consultants.   EDM's
statutes do not require it to meet any specific financial targets. Draft financial
8/ Reduction of technical losses is being addressed as part of the rehabilitation
of the distribution system.



- 14 -
objectives for the power sector were discussed during appraisal and are set out in
Annex 1.11.  The principal elements are as follows:  (i) assurance of financial
autonomy for EDM including a reasonable contribution to its least cost capital
expenditure program; (ii) improvement of billing and collection; (iii) review of
the adequacy of the current tariffs; and (iv) for OERHN, the conclusion of a
management contract which takes into account the need to continue to meet its debt
service obligations and to finance its non power activities. During negotiations
agreement was reached to include these objectives in the performance contract.
1.36            Current financial projections for EDM do not indicate an immediate
need for tariff increases. However, the appropriateness of the tariff structure
needs to be reviewed. Future tariffs should not only be determined by EDM's and
OERHN's financial obligations, but also with a view of achieving a reasonable rate
of return on currently valued assets of the power sector in Mali (EDM and OERHN)
and giving the appropriate incentives for conserving electricity. Therefore,
financing for a tariff study, which will also address the latter aspects, has been
included in the proposed project.  At negotiations, agreement has been reached
that the commendations of the tariff study be discussed with IDA and that the
agreed recommendations be applied not later than June 30, 1990.
7. OERHN
1.37            Since  its inception in 1981 until 1985,  OERHN was unable to
generate sufficient income to cover its operating costs and debt service on the
Sdlingu6 hydroelectric plant and transmission line to Bamako. The major reasons
were: (i) bulk sales to EDM were well below the power station capacity, because
of insufficient demand in the Bamako grid; (ii) non-power related activities
contributed only about 1Z of total revenues; and (iii) OERHN's relatively high
operating costs and debt service. In 1986 however, due to the continued increase
in demand in the Bamako grid coupled with a 26Z tariff increase in November 1985
and the relative decline of the US dollar against the CFAF, which considerably
reduced debt service, OERHN became profitable for the first time since its
existence (see Annex 1-12).  OERHN is currently meeting all its long term debt
obligations, but at the end of 1986, it had still about CFAF 3 billion (US$10
million) in accumulated debt service arrears. During 1987, OERHN has started to
settle part of these arrears because at the current bulk tariff rate of CFAF
25.2/kWh, its estimated gross internal cash generation is more than sufficient to
cover its current debt service obligations. It will enable OERHN to settle the
remaining arrears over the next few years.
1.38            As part of the agreed institutional reform of the power sector,
the power facilities of OERHN will be managed directly by the EDM.   A draft
contract has now been prepared, which has been discussed during negotiations.
Details are being finalized by EDM and OERHN, in particular with respect to the
actual transfer of personnel. It is currently anticipated EDM would be paying a
fixed annual fee to OERHN which would reduce the unit cost of electricity as more
energy would be used in the interconnected system. EDM would also be responsible
for all major maintenance (Annex 1-12).

8. Future Financial Position of EDM
(a) Financing Plan
1.39            The estimated financing requirements of EDM for the period 1989-
1994 total US$239 million equivalent, which includes interest during coDaruction.
Of this amount, EDM could be in a position to finance about 25Z (US$60 million)
from internal sources including interest during construction.   The remainder
(US$179 million) would have to be funded from external sources, including IDA.
About US$30 million has already been secured for ongoing rehabilitation and
extension projects (para 1.18) and for the Bamako Segou transmission line.  An
additional  US$62  million  is  expected  under  this  project.    The  financing
requirements mentioned above exclude finance for the Malian share of the Manantali
power station (estimated at US$53 million in current prices), which will be
executed by OMVS as well as the household energy component and feasibility study
for Kenie hydroelectric plant which will be executed by DNHE.  EDM's financing
requirements are detailed in the Fund Flow Statement in Annex 1-8 and summarized
in the table below.

(b) Future Finances
1.40        EDM's Forecast Income and Fund Flow Statements and Balance Sheets are
set out in Annex 1-8, together with the assumptions used in their preparation.
EDM's future financial position should be satisfactory, assuming reduction of
distribution losses and improvement in bill collection in line with measures to be
introduced. The unit cost of energy purchased from OERHN is assumed to decrease



- 16 -
with the introduction of the management contract (para.1.38) and there appears to
be no need to increase retail tariffs until 1992.   EDM's electricity activity
should be able to improve its working capital position and cover its debt service.
1.41        Nevertheless in order to protect EDM's future financial viability,
agreement has been reached during negotiations on: (i) the annual review between
GOM and IDA of tariff levels so that EDM can maintain a reasonable conttibution
(about 20X) to its investments from internally generated funds; (ii) EDM's level
of indebtedness, i.e., it would not incur debt without IDA's prior concurrence,
unless its expected future internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times future
debt service; and (iii) the need to continue EDM's practice to make adequate
provisions for renewal of its fixed assets. Salient features of EDM finances are
summarized below:

E. Bank Group Role in the Power Sector
(a)   History of Involvement
1.42            IDA has assisted the Malian power sector since 1979 when an advance
of US$0.97 million was made through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for
preparatory studies.   In 1983, a credit of US$24 million (Credit 1282-MLI) was
approved. The project included the first phase of the rehabilitation and extension
of EDM's electricity and water distribution systems in Bamako, the rehabilitation
of the Dar Salam diesel plant, construction of a new diesel power plant at Mopti
and  technical  assistance  and  training  for EDM  staff.    Caisse  Centrale  de



- 17 -
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) and OPEC
Fund are cofinancing the project with IDA.  EDM's performance on financial and
institutional covenants stipulated under Cr. 1282-MLI was initially poor, but has
improved since 1986.  EDM complied with the self-financing ratio for the first
time in 1987, however audit reports continued to be received late. New targets for
the accounts receivable and self-financing ratio have been determined during
negotiations of the proposed project. Cr 1282-MLI has been closed on 31 December
1988. The dialogue with the Government and EDM on the power sector has improved,
and is expected to further improve during implementation of the proposed project.
(b) Rationale for Involvement
1.43            IDA's continued involvement in the power sector is needed in order:
(i) to help resolve the sector's complex organizational and institutional issues;
(ii) to ensure that power sector investments Are integrated in a least cost
development program; and (iii) to assist the Government in mobilizing finaLlcing for
the sector's investment program while ensuring that it is directed to priority
projects.    IDA has  taken  a leading  role  in the preparatory work  for the
restructuring of the sector, in investment planning and in the articulation of
measures to restore financial health to the sector. IDA's presence in the sector
is important to ensure that the rehabilitation of EDM's facilities are completed
and that the investment decisions taken in connection with the regional Manantali
multipurpose project are optimized.   IDA has also taken the lead in organizing
donor meetings that have been held to ensure optimal coordination between all the
aid and development agencies active in the sector.
II. THE PROJECT
A.              Project Objectives
2.01            The  proposed  project  aims  at  correcting  the  most  critical
deficiencies in the power sector by: (i) close involvement of EDM in sectoral
planning and streamlining the relationship between EDM and Government; (ii)
consolidating into EDM the technical responsibility for construction and operation
of all power sector facilities  and separating its water and power activities;
(iii)  effecting  improvements  in  all  aspects  of  operations,  including  the
introduction of a performance contract with specific efficiency targets; (iv)
financing part of the investment program of the power Rector for the period 1989
to 1994 including the continuation of the rehabilitation of generation and
distribution systems and extension of the power grid to meet economically
justifiable loads. Excluded from the project is the rest of the investment program
which includes ongoing projects financed by other donors and GOM and projects
related to Manantali such as the Manantali-Bamako interconnection and the extension
of the Bamako-Segou transmission line to Sikasso and Koutiala, pending further
economic studies and a decision by OMVS to go ahead with the construction of power
generating facilities at the Manantali dam (para.1.18). In addition, assistance
to GOM will be provided to develop and implement a household energy strategy.

B. Project Description
2.02            The proposed project consists of the following components which
are described in detail in Annexes 2-1.   MAP IBRD21018 shows the location of
facilities financed by the proposed project:
Power Sector
(a)   Generation:   (i) rehabilitation of Sotuba hydro-electric
plant; (ii) repairs to the cooling water-intake and major overhaul of the Selingue
hydro-electric plant; (iii) extension of Dar Salam diesel station in Bamako by
about 5 MW; (iv) installation of five new diesel units totaling about 2.6 MW in
three load centers (Sikasso, Mopti and Koutiala); and (v) rehabilitation of the
existing diesel stations in four isolated load centers (Kayes, Sikasso, Bougouni
and Koutiala).
(b) Transmission: construction of a 230 km, single circuit, 150
kV transmission line to extend the grid supply from Bamako to Segou, with
substations in Bamako, Segou, Fana and Dioila and associated voltage control
equipment.
(c)  Distribution:  (i) rehabilitation of medium and low voltage
lines and substations in down-town Bamako; (ii) construction of about 200 km of
new medium and low voltage lines and associated substations in the unelectrified
neighborhoods of Bamako to meet their load through 1995; and (iii) rehabilitation
of the existing distribution system in eight load centers (Kayes, Mopti, Sikasso,
Fana, Bougouni, Koutiala, Segou and Markala) and construction of about 275 km of
medium and low voltage lines and substations.
(d) Engineering: consultant services for the engineering,
preparation of bid documents and construction supervision for the generation,
transmission and distribution components.
(e) System studies: (i) generation dispatch study to optimize and
coordinate hydro and diesel generation in the interconnected system; (ii) study
for coordination of system protection in the 150 kV, 30 kV and 15 kV systems and
implementation of recommendations; (iii) loss reduction study; (v) power tariff
study; (v) feasibility study for the Kenie hydro electric project; and (vi) studies
for future power sector investments.
(f)   Training and technical assistance:  (i) local and foreign
training and (ii) about 40 man-years of short and long term technical assistance.
(g) Miscellaneous. Provision of spare parts, vehicles, equipment
and supplies, expansion and repair of office space.
Household Energy
(h) Implementation of a household energy strategy. The scope of
this project component will be determined after completion of the ongoing household



- 19 -
energy strategy study (para. 1.10), but it is likely to include technical
assistance, training and equipment.
C. Project Cost
2.03            The total cost of the project is estimated at US$103.2 million
equivalent, including interest during constr ction, with a foreign exchange
component or US$82.6 million (802).   Cost estimates are based on January 1988
prices, with about 10 percent added for physical contingencies and 1 percent for
price escalation for 1988 to 1990, and 3.5 percent thereafter to 1994. Given the
nature of household component, the cost estimates for that component are notional.
Detailed project cost estimates are set out in Annex 2.2.
D. Project Financing
2.04            An IDA credit of US$33.0 million equivalent is proposed to the
Government of Mali. A part (US$3.2 million) would be passed to EDM as equity to
finance technical assistance and training. About US$28 million would be onlent to
EDM for 25 years including five years grace at the prevailing IBRD interest rate,
with EDM bearing the foreign exchange risk.  The execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement between GOM and EDM would be a condition of credit effectiveness. GOM
and EDM would assume responsibility for any cost overruns. The proposed credit
would finance 100Z of the foreign exchange costs of the repairs and major overhaul
of Selingue hydro-electric plant and the rehabilitation and extension of the diesel
stations in the isolated centers; the distribution systems outside Bamako including
engineering and construction supervision; training services and equipment;
vehicles; tools and equipment; materials and telecommunications equipment
(including installation). The IDA credit would also finance 60X of the cost of
civil works and 10OX of the cost of consultancy services including technical
assistance and the cost of the household energy component.
2.05            Adequate co-financing is available for the proposed project and a
project financing plan is given in Annex 2.3.  KfW, CIDA and EIB have already
agreed to finance the Bamako-Segou transmission line for a total amount of US$23.8
million equivalent. CIDA will also finance additional technical assistance. The
African Development Bank (AfDB) has agreed in principle to co-finance the Bamako
distribution component for an amount of US$11.8 million equivalent.   FAC has
indicated that it will continue its financing of technical assistance for an
estimated amount of US$2.0 million equivalent. CCCE has agreed in principle to
contribute US$12.2 million equivalent for the rehabilitation of Sotuba hydro-
electric plant, the extension of Dar Salam diesel plant and the distribution system
in Kayes. EDM would finance US$17.6 million of the total project cost, including
interest during construction, from internal cash generation.
E. Project Implementation and Monitoring
(a) Status of Preparation and Execution.
2.06            The project was prepared with assistance of Belgian, Canadian and
French consultants and financed under the First Power/Water Project (Cr. 1282-



- 20 -
MLI). Details on the s%atus of preparation for each component are given in Annex
2-1.   EDM would implen.ent all aspects of the proposed project except for the
household energy component and the feasibility study for the Keni6 hydro-electric
plant--a multi purpose project--which will be executed directly by MIHE through
DNHE. EDM would establish a project management unit (which will be integrated in
EDM's new organization structure) as a condition for credit effectiveness. The
project management unit would be assisted by engineering consultants and technical
assistance personnel for the supervision of the rehabilitation of the hydro
electric plants, the construction of the Bamako-Segou transmission line, the
distribution  rehabilitation  and  expansion  and  for  the  diesel  stations
rehabilitation and expansion. Project completion is expected by June 30, 1995; an
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 2.4.

2.08        Supply and erection of materials for the rehabilitation and extension
of the isolated diesel stations with the exception of Kayes and including the
supply of spare parts for existing units will be procured with a single
responsibility contract through ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines (US$5.3
million). Supply and erection of generating and distribution equipment co-financed
by CCCE (US$14.0 million) will be procured f3llowing CCCE procedures. Materials
for the repairs to Selingue will be procured with a single responsibility contract
through ICB (US$1.1 million). The Bamako Segou transmission mission line will be
cofinanced by CIDA. KfW and EIB and procured following their respective procurement
procedures. Supply and erection of distribution materials for the Bamako system
co-financed by AfDF will be procured following the AFDF procedures (US$15.3
million).   Supply and erection of distribution materials outside Bamako (with the
exception of Kayes) will be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines
(US$18.4 million).   Six supply and erection contracts for amounts ranging from
US$1.2 to 10 million each are planned.   Building contracts valued at under
US$200,000 each will be awarded after LCB according to procedures which are
acceptable to IDA and foreign contractors will be allowed to participate.
Consultants and technical assistance personnel to be financed by IDA would be
appointed in accordance with Bank group guidelines and would be employed on terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Contract packages for equipment, tools and
vehicles valued at US$150,000 or more will be procured through ICB. Individual
contracts estimated to be below US$150,000 up to a maximum of US$1 million, will
be procured through international shopping after receipt of price quotations from
at least three qualified suppliers from at least three aifferent countries. IDA-
financed contracts for amounts over US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to prior
review. Other contracts will be subject to selective post-award reviews. A PPF
advance of US$1.11 million has been approved to finance the strengthening of the
commercial department, consulting services and studies, prior to credit
effectiveness.
(c) Disbursement
2.09        The proposed credit is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31,
1995 in accordance with the estimated schedule at Annex 2.5. This corresponds to
the Power Distribution and Transmission All Region Profile. The Government and EDM
would be expected to agree to bear any cost overruns, including any extra costs
associated with a lengthened implementation schedule.   To facilitate project
implementation, EDM will open a special account in a commercial bank with an
authorized allocation of US$750,000 equivalent.   The account will be used to
finance the local and foreign cost of eligible expenditures financed by IDA. The
special account will be replenished on a monthly basis or when the special account
is reduced by a third, whichever comes first.   A provision has been made for
retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million for the repairs of Selingue hydro-
electric plant which are scheduled to start in the first quarter of 1989.
Disbursements of IDA credit will be fully documented except for contracts valued
at less than US$100,000 which will be disbursed against Statements of Expenditures
(SOE's).  All IDA expenditures of less than US$50,000 equivalent will be financed
from the Special account. Disbursement of funds for the household energy would be
done only after GOM and IDA have agreed on the recommendations of the Household

(d) Accounting, Monitoring and Reporting.
2.10        EDM and DNHE would keep separate accounts for the project components
for which they are responsible.   During negotiations, agreement will be sought
that these accounts and those of EDM (para.1.24) as well as the special account
for EDM and the SOE's will be audited annually. All audits should be conducted
according to auditing standards satisfactory to and by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. The audited accoLnts and the auditors' report will be submitted
to IDA within six months following tae end of the fiscal year while SOE's will be
reviewed by IDA on a regular basis. In addition, during negotiations, assurances
have been obtained that GOM and EDM will submit to IDA and the cofinanciers: (i)
quarterly progress reports on the parts of the project executed by EDM and DNHE;
(ii) copies of all consultants' reports or studies financed under the proposed
credit; and (iii) a project completion report within six months of implementation
of all project components.
F.   Environmental Aspects
2.11        The proposed project would not have any major adverse environmental
effects. Most of the 150 kV and 30 kV transmission lines will traverse relatively
sparsely populated areas. They will not cross any national parks. Provision of
grid supply will eliminate the air and noise pollution caused by diesel generation
in the three towns now served by diesels. Measures would be incorporated in the
design of the new diesel units to minimize noise and pollution.  The household
energy component would aim at reducing firewood consumption and improve forest
cover management and disbursements would only be made for the implementation of a
household energy strategy that is environmentally sound.
G. Project Justification, Benefits and Risks
2.12        The proposed project accounts for about 372 of the power sector
investment program for the period 1989-1994.   Excluded from the project are
investments which depend directly on the decision to construct a power station at
the Manantali dam namely: the Manantali-Bamako transmission line and the further
extension of the interconnected power grid to the southern areas of Mali, as well
as ongoing projects such as the transmission line from Selingue to the Kalana mines
and the rehabilitation of the Felou hydro electric plant near Kayes.
2.13        Each major new component of the proposed project has been subjected
to an economic analysis, the result of which are briefly summarized below:
(i)   Bamako-Segou transmission line.   The transmission line is
the least cost alternative for supplying the demand in the
Segou region. The equalizing discount rate (EDR) comparing
the proposed transmission line with alternative isolated
diesel development is estimated at 192 under the assumption
that power from Manantali would be available in Bamako by
1994. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the EDR drops to
172 if power from Manantali would be available by 1996.
(ii)  Isolated centers: The proposed project includes only the
rehabilitation and extension of the generating facilities
and distribution system, which have an acceptable Internal



- 24 -
Economic Rates of Return (IERR). They were estimated as
follows: Kayes 112; Sikasso 20Z; Mopti 16Z and Koutiala 112.
(iii) Extension of the Dar Salam power station in Bamako This is
the least cost alterrative to meet the projected growth in
demand in the interconnected system, while awaiting energy
from Manantali to supply Bamako.
(iv)  Rehabilitation.   For the rehabilitation components of the
project no technical alternatives exist and they are all
urgently needed to improve reliability of supply and to
reduce system losses.
2.14            In order to assess the overall benefits of the investments under
the project, an IERR has been calculated on the basis of incremental costs and
sales resulting from these investments.   Valuing benefits at CFAF 61/kWh (the
existing average revenue of EDM)  the IERR is 152  (Annex 2.6.).   Should the
incremental demand resulting from these investments be 102 lower, the IERR drops
to 112, which is still satisfactory. Other benefits which have not been quantified
include more reliable supply and reduced cost of autogeneration and a reduction in
diesel fuel consumption because of rehabilitation of diesel units and better
utilization of available hydro resources.
2.15            One of the uncertainties concerning the proposed project is the
future growth of demand for electricity. As a result of the rehabilitation and
extension of the distribution network in the interconnected system under the First
Power/Water Project (Cr. 1282-MLI), the quality of service has improved and demand
for electricity has grown rapidly (para. 1.15). In spite of this growth in demand,
the level of electrification in the Bamako area is still estimated at only about
28Z.   Consultants to EDM have carried out a detailed survey of about 3000
households in Bamako to assess the potential load and the extent the population
could afford to pay for electricity. The survey found that in the unelectrified
areas there was a small but significant number of households with their own
generators and a larger number who possessed electrical appliances even in the
absence of electricity grid to use them.  The vast miajority of households still
uses kerosene for lighting, but about 702 of those surveyed indicated their
willingness to contribute up to CFAF 50,000 towards the cost of connection to the
public network. Other consultants have reached similar conclusions with respect
to demand potential in the isolated centers, which until now have been ill served
with electricity by EDM.   On this basis,  the projected load growth appears
realistic. The proposed project would raise the proportion of Mali's population
which has access to electricity from about 42 in 1985 to about 6Z and 8? by 1990
and 1995 respectively (Annex 1-3).
2.16            There are no unusual technical risks associated with the project,
given EDM's experience under the First Power/Water Project and the use of competent
consulting engineers for design, execution and supervision of the different project
components. The main risks are institutional namely: (i) the functioning of the
power sector entities after the reforms have been introduced and (ii) the power
utility's ability to effectively reduce systems losses and improve billing and
collection. GOM and EDM's management are committed to improving EDM's efficiency
and are supporting the reform measures.   Moreover, the training and technical
assistance components are being designed to minimize these institutional risks.

The use of a performance contract would enable close monitoring of institutional
and efficiency improvements.

Energie du Mali: Current Technical Assistance
1.    Since the early 70, French bilateral aid (FAC) has been the major source
of financing for technical assistance to EDM. However, in 1982, under the First
Power/Water Project (Cr. 1282-MLI), agreement was reached to implement a
rehabilitation plan for EDH's water and electricity activities, with the help
of a 13 member technical assistance team. The team members were to operate in
line and staff positions, essentially in the finance, generation, distribution,
planning and training departments and their work was to be complemented by short-
term assignments of specialist consultants.  Electricite de France (EDF) was
selected as the main contractor for this technical assistance, which is being
jointly financed by CCCE, FAC and IDA.   In addition, an expatriate project
coordinator (financed by IDA) was appointed to supervise overall implementation
and advise the general manager of EDM.
2.    The technical assistance started in earnest in late 1983 on the basis of
a detailed program prepared by EDF.  It has encountered major implementation
difficulties on account of: (i) lack of commitment from EDH s management to
redress organizational deficiencies; (ii) large number of unqualified and
unmotivated staff, partly because of low salaries; (iii) poor caliber of some
of the technical assistance staff; and (iv) lack of suitably qualified local
counterparts.  The technical assistance team prepared several proposals for
reorganization and changes in procedures but most were not accepted by EDM's
management. Many units/departments continued to operate without organization
charts and without clearly defined responsibilities, leading to a continuation
of serious management and communication problems. The result has been that the
technical assistance team is not only well behind in the implementation of its
program but also that anticipated improvements in the operational efficiency of
EDM remained well below expectations.  Faced with the lack of improvement in
EDM's operations, GOM requested IDA to finance a diagnostic study of the
electricity and urban water supply sectors, which was completed in October 1986.
3.    With technical assistance from EDF, EDM has redefined its organization
structure. It takes into account that OERHN's electro mechanical installations
will be managed by EDM. EDF has been retained to carry out the manpower study,
which will be financed from the PPF advance, and the scope includes the
integration of OERHN personnel into EDM's organization and a thorough review of
technical assistance and training needs. EDM's management has now accepted the
need for technical assistance and has, in the meantime, requested that most of
the T.A. program would be extended. Subject to review under the manpower study
and after consultation with the donors involved, in particular FAC, most T.A.
contracts have been extended. In some cases, however, the incumbent has been
replaced and/or terms of reference have been revised. This situation has enabled

EDM to continue its rehabilitation plan, in particular, the strengthening if the
commercial department. EDM is also looking into the possibility to establish
a twinning arrangement with one of the smaller district utilities of EDF (Centre
de Vannes). FAC is expected to continue the bulk of technical assistance, but
IDA has been requested to continue to finance one or two key positions.
4.    The current situation with regard to long-term technical assistance is as
follows:
Division                 Source      Nature of Assistance
a)    Finance                  FAC         Accounting system improvements
internal audit, MIS
b)    Data Management          FAC          Computerization of commercial
operations and accotuzting system
c)    Training (CPP)           FAC         Electricity distribution
d)    Commercial               FAC         Customer management
e)    Water                    FAC         Technical and Services
f)    Water                    FAC         Studies and organization
g)    Metering                 FAC         Control and measures
h)    Coordination             IDA          Coordinator First Power/Water
project
i)    Distribution             IDA         Construction
J)    Distribution             IDA         Operational support
5.    In addition, CIDA is likely to provide technical assistance for inventory
control and EIB, as part of its cofinancing of the Bamako-Segou line, may take
over the financing of technical assistance for construction. The exact technical
assistance and training program will be determined upon completion of the
manpower study in May 1989.

MALI: SECOND POWER PROJECT
EDM - Assumptions for Financial Proiections
General
1.        Figures may not appear to add up due to rounding.  Based on the
auditor's recommendations, certain adjustments were incorporated in the
actual 1986 and 1987 financial statements. Therefore, the actual
statements may not always appear fully consistent from one year to another.
2.        The following inflation rates were assumed
1988            1989            1990       1991-1994
Local (Z)       6.6             6.6             6.1             6.1
Foreign (2)    1.0              1.0             1.0             3.5
Income Statements
3.        Energy Sales are as projected in Annex 1-4.  In 1987, EDM's
average retail tariff was CFAF 60.8/kWh sold.  No further increases in
retail tariffs were aseumed until 1992 when the average was increased each
year by 52 up to 1993.
4..       Other Revenues were increased with inflation and development of
the system.
5.        Until the end of 1989, electricity putrchased from OERHN were
charged at the current tariff of CFAF 25.2/kWh purchased. Thereafter
following the signing of the management contract, a fixed annual fee of
CFAF 2.5 billion was assumed. In 1990, services were increased by CFAF 750
million to reflect the cash operating cost of OERHN's power facilities. In
subsequent years, they were increased with inflation and development of the
system.
6.        Fuel Costs have been calculated on the basis of actual fuel
costs and generation requirements shown in Annex 1-4 and the basic
parameters are set out below:
Specific Consumption:           Bamako               250-240 gr/kWh
Isolated diesels    300-250 gr/kWh

Projected improvements are the result of the planned
rehabilitation
Average fuel price: Fuel oil               CFAF 185000/ton
Diesel oil           CFAF 209000/ton
ruel prices have been increased with 3Z per annum after 1991.
Lubricating oil consumption was taken at 4X of total.
7.        Non-fuel O&M expenses are based on the 1988 budget and have been
increased with inflation and development of the system.
8.        Depreciation and provisions for renewal were taken at 6X and
3.3X of average gross fixed assets in operations. This reflects historic
averages used in line with the auditors recommendations. In 1990,
provisions were increased with CFAF 500 million per year to provide for
major maintenance of OERHN's facilities.
9.        Income Tax was taken the higher of 50X of operating income or 1Z
of total revenue in accordance with income tax regulations.
10.       Write-off doubtful debts reflects arrears from before 1986 which
are considered uncollectible.
11.       Interest details are given para. 12  below.  Interest during
construction is capitalized.
Fund Flow Statements
12.       Total borrowings and debt service are shown in the table below.

Financial assistance from CCCE, EIB and for the Kalana-Selingue
transmission line has been assumed to be on-lent by GOM at 5? interest and
20 years maturity including grace periods varying from one year (Kalana) to
seven years in case of CCCE. Funds from AfDF and for Manantali-Bamako
transmission line were assumed to be on-lent at 7.65X interest for 20 years
including five years grace period. Funds from IDA were assumed to on-lent

the project passed on as a grant. It also includes part of the funds for
Kalana-Selingue transmission line.
14.       Gross fixed assets were increased by transfers from work in
progress. Fixed assets were not revalued, but it has been assumed that
EDM, following its accounting practices continues to make provisions for
renewal at an average of 3.3% of average fixed assets in operation.
15.       Net Accounts Receivables reflect the objective to reduce its
level to the equivalent of three months of sales by 31 December 1990 and
onwards.

operation.
17.       Pavables were estimated at 7? of operating expenses and 52 of
capital expenditure for the year.

MALI: SECOND POWER PROJECT
Financial Oblectives for the Power Sector
1.       The overall goal is provision of a reasonably reliable and
economical supply of electricity to the whole country, under the overall
responsibility of a financially autonomous power utility. OERHN will
remain the owner of the Selingue hydroelectric plant and the transmission
line to Bamako, but the power utility will have the responsibility for the
operation and management of these installations.
EnerRie du Mali (EDM) 1/
2.       To ensure financial autonomy, EDM should be able to mobilize a
level of cash resources sufficier.t to finance:
(i)   an adequate level of operations and preventive maintenance;
(ii)   a level of staff remuneration adequate to recruit and retain
qualified and experienced staff;
(iii)   debt service obligations;
(iv)   reasonable working capital requirements;
(v)   a reasonable contribution to its least-cost capital investment
program.
3.       Financial autonomy would: (i) enable EDM to manage its affairs
without recourse to Government subsidies or loans; and (ii) ensure
sufficient credit worthiness to obtain foreign loans (through the
Government or/with Government guarantee) and local loans to meet the
balance of its capital requirements not otherwise funded from internal
sources.
4.       Should Government require EDM to undertake any uneconomic
investments to meet social or regional policies, both the capital costs and
any resultant operating deficits should be financed by Government.
5.       EDM should ensure prompt collection of amounts due from its
customers so that accounts receivable for each of its category of consumers
are maintained at not more than the equivalent of three (3) months
billings. EDM will execute a comprehensive program with a view of
achieving this objective not later than 31 December 1989.
1/ Electricity activities only.

6.       Government and its agencies should ensure adequate provision in
annual budgets to meet electricity charges and furthermore, prompt
settlement of accounts. EDM, for its part, should have full authority to
disconnect supply to pt'blic and private customers whose accounts are
overdue.
7.       In fixing its tariffs, EDM should be permitted to earn a
reasonable rate of return on net revalued fixed assets in operation
sufficient to meet its obligations at para. 2 above. EDM should continue
its practice to make adequate annual provisions for renewal of its fixed
assets.
8.       EDM should measure the ability of existing and potential
electricity customers to pay for electricity and establish an appropriate
economic price policy. Not later than 30 June 1989, EDM (or the new power
utility) will, following the recommendations of the EDF tariff study (1985)
formulate proposals to bring the tariff structure in line with the long run
marginal cost of supply while taking into account the socio-economic
objective of the Government, its uniform tariff policy and possibilities
for cross subsidy between consumer categories.
9.       EDM should ensure that, in supplying electricity economically,
technical and non-technical losses are contained at reasonable levels
(specific targets are to be developed).
10.      EDM should complete its computerization of its accounting system
including application for budgetting, cost accounting and appropriate
systems for inventory management, fixed assets recording and cash
management.
11.      EDM should establish measures of performance to monitor the
efficiency and economy of its operations and the productivity of its
employees.
OERHN
12.      OERHN should introduce an appropriate accounting and budgetary
control system.
13.      While negotiating the management contract for its
electromechanical installation with EDM, OERHN should take into account:
(i)   its long term debt obligations; and
(ii)   the costs of operation and maintenance including major
maintenance.

Annex 1-12
Page 3 of 6
1.       Note on OERHN's financial statements
1.1      The continued increase in electricity demand in the interconnected
Bamako power system, coupled with an increase in bulk tariffs to EDM from
CFAF 20/kWh to CFAF 25.2/kWh in November 1985, has resulted in a
considerable improvement of OERHN's financial position. In 1986, OERHN
recorded its first operating profit. Following the recommendation of an
auditing firm (Cabinet Diarra) OERHN corrected in 1984 the valuation of its
long term debt, which until then had been recorded at historic exchange
rates. A substantial provision for foreign exchange was created. The
extraordinary income (loss) mainly comprises realized foreign exchange
losses and gains, some of which relating to previous years. At the end of
1986, OERHN's current liabilities included about CFAF 3 billion equivalent
in long term debt arrears plus accumulated interest, which explains the
unsatisfactory current ratio of 0.2. Of these long term debt arrears, CFAF
1.8 billion was due to BADEA, Kuwait Fund and BNP and CFAF 1.2 billion wlas
due to the CAA, which settled in the past part of the arrears on behalf of
OERHN. Since 1986, OERHN is able to fulfill all its current long term debt
obligations and it has started to pay off its arrears to tile multilateral
institutions. The major uncertainty at this stage is to what extent EDM
would be regularly paying its bills for power purchased from OERHN, given
its bill collecting problems.
1.2      Apart from its electricity sales to EDM, OERHN generates hardly
any revenue from its other activities, such as irrigation, fisheries etc.
The scope for increasing the revenues from those other activities in the
near future is considered minimal. However, provided that energy sales to
EDM remain at least at the 1986 level and EDM would pay its bills
regularly, OERHN should not have any major financial difficulties. For
1987, gross internal cash generation is estimated at CFAF 2.5 billion which
is more than sufficient to cover the current estimated 1987 debt service
obligations of about CFAF 1.9 billion (at prevailing exchange rates even
lower) as well as part of long-term debt arrears. As bulk sales are
expected to increase further and assuming no change in bulk tariffs, this
surplus could be even higher over the next few years.
2. Management contract for OERHN's power facilities
2.1      As part of the institutional reform of the power sector, GOM has
agreed that EDM would operate OERHN's power facilities under a management
contract. GOM would not agree to a transfer of OERHN's assets to the power
utility, which was IDA's preferred option, but the proposed arrangement is
in line with major objective of the institutional reform e.g. unification
of responsibility for operation of all power facilities. Consultants have
prepared a first draft of a management contract which has been discussed
with the Maliaxi authorities, but the following points remain outstanding:



- 51 -
Annex 1-12
Page 4 of 6
(i)    Assets to be managed
Agreement so far reached between GOM and IDA states that
OERHN's electro-mechanical facilities would be managed by the
power utility without specifying whether this includes the
dam. IDA's position is that preferably maintenance of the dam
should also be covered under the management contract, since
it forms an integral part of the power facilities. GOM's
position on this issue should be clarified during
negotiations.
( ii)    Responsibility for major maintenance and renewal
GOM's position has been so far that since OERHN remains the
owner of the assets it should be responsible for major
maintenance and depreciation and that EDM would continue to
pay a charge per kWh purchased. This would imply that under
the management contract, the power utility would be
reimbursed for the direct operating and maintenance costs of
OERHN's power facilities plus a management fee. Under such a
management, there would be little incentive for the managing
utility to operate more efficiently, and all decisions on
major maintenance would have to be referred back to OERHN,
which would also be required to set aside funds to cover the
costs of major maintenance. While in theory, such a solution
could work it appears to be rather impractical and it does
not meet the basic objective of the institutional reform;
consolidation of responsibilities in the power sector. IDA's
position is that responsibility for major maintenance should
be with EDM, but as owner of the assets, OERHN would be
responsible for depreciation.
(iii)    Revision of bulk tariffs
In spite of being set up as a multipurpose project, Selingue
could be considered as a predominantly power generating
project and consequently the power sector would be
responsible for most of the debt service. At the last bulk
tariff revision in November 1985, a main determining factor
was OERHN s debt service obligations. However, the situation
has changed and as explained above, maintaining the current
bulk tariffs at CFAF 25/kWh, taking into account the growing
demand for electricity in the Bamako grid, will result in
OERHN generating revenues well in excess of its financial
needs. (Unlass of course, it would decide to make



- 52 -
Annex 1-12
Page5 of 6
considerable investments in non-power related activities, or
if GOM would impose income tax on OERHN's profits). It would
also have an adverse effect on the power utility's retail
tariffs, because at CFAF 25/kWh, the utility would not
benefit from diminishing cost/kWh as would normally occur
during the life of a hydroelectric project. Another factor
is that once additional generating capacity such as from
Manantali would become available, Selingue power at CFAF
25/kWh is no longer be an attractive source of energy.
Moreover, assuming a 1OX IRR on the Selingue project, the
average cost/kWh over the life of the project would be in the
order of CFAF 12 to 17/kWh.
In the tariff study carried out by EDF in 1985/86, it was
also pointed out that since most of OERHN's costs are fixed
in nature, it would be more appropriate to have a fixed
annual fee rather than a charge per kWh. Such a fee could
provide for a reasonable return on capital invested in OERHN
and assure repayments of debts.
Another preoccupation of GOM has been, to assure financial
resources for OERHN's non-power activities. The total amount
currently budgetted is only about CFAF 100 million per year,
which is less than 1Z of estimated revenues from electricity
sales. Even if electricity consumers would provide this
amount it cannot be considered a major issue at this stage.
(iv)    Proposed Solution
Taking into account the issues raised above and assuming that
the utility would indeed be responsible for major
maintenance, the preferred solution appears to be that the
power utility pays a fixed annual fee suficient to cover
OERHN's debt service obligations and which at the same time
provide a reasonable return on capital invested by GOM.
Initially, the annual fee could be in the order of CFAF two
to 2.5 billion, which would also allow OERHN to settle its
arrears within the next few years. The adequacy of the
annual fee should, however, be reviewed every three to five
years and adjusted, if necessary. The power utility would be
required to set aside funds for major maintenance.



- 53 -
Annex 1-12
Page 6 of 6
annual fee, EDH would also be required under the management
contract, to have carried out an annual oscultation of the
Selingue dam as well as an independent technical audit of the
power facilities it manages. Most of OERHN's personnel
involved in electricity generation and transmission would
become employees of the power utility.
The advantage of this solution would be that it is
transparent, simple, provides incentives to the utility to
produce as efficiently as possible and it consolidates
responsibilities in the power sector. In addition power
consumers would not be unduly penalized, because of a
prevailing institutional structure in the sector.

MALI: SECOND POWER PROJECT
Background and Technical Details
A.       Bamako Segou Transmission Line
1.       The feasibility of the Bamako-Segou interconnection was first
determined by EDF Dafeco in 1981 as the least cost alternative to supply
electric power to Segou. This was also confirmed later by Tractebel in the
Power Master Plan Study, Nov. 1986. In 1984, Hydro Quebec International
(HQI) was engaged by GOM to prepare the detailed design of the transmission
line. The main characteriatics of the line are:
[i)    Single circuit, 150 kV transmission line (Almelec 228 mm2
conductors), from Sirakoro substation in Bamako to Fana (115
km) and from Fana to S6gou substation in S4gou (115 km);
(ii)    Substransmission line (2/0 conductors) from Fana substation
to Dioila (40 km) insulated for 30 kV but initially operating
at 15 kV; and
(iii)    Substation facilities providing 150 kV switch yard at
Sirakoro in Bamako with 5 MVA reactor, 150/15 kV substation
at Fana with a single 10 MVA transformer and 5 MVA
reactor,and a 150/1: kV substation at Segou with two 10 MVA
transformers and 5 MVA reactor.
2.       Bidding documents for the transmission line were issued in the
following three different lots:
(i)     Lot no. 1 supply of all transmission and substransmission
line materials (steel towers, conductors, accessories)
except insulators and substransmission poles and cross arm.
This lot is financed by CIDA.
(ii)     Lot no. 2 supply of all insulators, 15/30 kV poles and
cross-arms and erection of all transmission and
substrinsmission lines. This lot is financed by EIB.
(iii)     Lot no. 3 supply and erection of all substations materials.
This lot is financed by KfW.
3.       Construction supervision for the transmission line will be
provided by HQI and an European consultant with the European consultant
being the 'Chef de file." The supervision contract will be jointly
financed by CIDA and EIB. The bids were opened in April 1988. EDM has not
signed any contract yet. Bid analysis and contract negotiations are

expected to take about three months and contracts award are expected in
April 1988. Construction period will take about two years for an in-
service date of the line by April 1990.
B.       Rehabilitation of Sotuba
1.       The studv for the rehabilitation of Sotuba hydro electric plant
was carried out by 'Societe Generale de Techniques et d'Etudes" (SGTE)
financed under Credit 1282-MLI. Repairs and parts are needed for the
turbines, alternators, switchgear and auxilliaries, air conditioning,
lighting, gauging equipment, telecommunication and the civil works.
2.       The consultants also studied the feasibility of increasing the
height of the retention wall by 25 cm. The rate of return on this
investment is estimated at more than 202. The cost of the rehabilitation
and improvements which will be financed by CCCE, is estimated as follows:

C.       Bamako Distribution
(a) Rehabilitation of Downtown Network
1.       The distribution network in downtown Bamako is in very poor
condition. The distribution substations are hazardous with little or no
protection. The low tension wires are worn out from breakage caused by
falling trees and branches in the rainy season. The medium voltage cables
need to be upgraded. Overall, the rehabilitation of the downtown network
could considerably improve the system reliability and reduce the system
losses by at least 3Z or about 4 GWh. EDM has prepared a feasibility
study titled "Reseau Electricite de Bamako, Renovation et Restructuration"
Annex 3-1121. The work to be done is summarized below.
(i)   Renovation of eighty-six substations out of the 151 existing
ones;
(ii)   Creation of new outgoing low voltage feeders.  A total of 413
feeaders;
(iii) Reconductering of 15 kV, l5kV, underground cables;
(iv) Replace 166 km of low voltage wires by aerial cables.
(b) Electrification of New Areas
2.       The first PowerlWater Project (Cr.1282-MLI) financed the
extension of the distribution network to the following nine areas in
Bamako namely:
Area No.

Areas no. 12, 15. and 17 have high cost per connection due to the
relative high number of commercial and small industrial customers in the
areas. Overall, a cost of US$1,514 per connection seems reasonable for
this land locked country.
E. Rehabilitation of the Isolated Centers
1.       A detailed study 'Rehabilitat.on des Centrales Diesel de
l'Interieur et des R6seaux de Distribution Associes" (Annex 3-1/8 was
carried out by Tractionnel and completed in April 1987 (Belgium). EDM
supplies power to ten isolated load centers namely: Kayes, Sikasso, Mopti,
Tombouctou, Kita, Bougouni, Koutiala, Gao, Fana and S4goulMarkala. Among
these centers Fana and Segou/Markala, will be interconnected with the
Bamako system within the scope of this project. When the Manantali power
station and the Manantali-Bamako transmission line goes in service,
Bougouni, Koutiala and Sikasso would be supplied from the interconnected
system. Kayes will also be supplied from Kanantali through the
transmission line supplying Dakar.
(a) Generation
2.       The following schematic diagram shows the optimal plan to supply
the load in the isolated centers to mid 1990's.

3.       The plan includes the rehabilitation of the diesel stations and
the diesel units at Kayes, Sikasso, Mopti, Tombouctou, Pana, Bougouni,
Koutiala, Segou and the acquisition of five new diesel units as follows:
1 x 750 Kw for Mopti by 1989;
3 x 500 Kw for Sikasso two by 1989 and one by 1992; and
1 x 350 Kw for Koutiala by 1990.
4.       With the exception of Tombouctou which is being rehabilitated with
West German bilateral aid, outside this project and Fana and Segou which
will be rehabilitated by EDM prior to the effectiveness of this credit, the
proposed project includes the financing of the rehabilitation cost and the
new units as follows:
Town                  Rehabilitation   New Units

Total                        1,460           1,500
(b) Distribution
5.        This component includes the rehabilitation of the existing network
in the isolated centers and extension of the network to meet the load
growth through mid 1990's. In addition, the primary distribution voltage
level at Kayes, Sikasso and Markala will be stepped up to 15 kV from the
present voltage of 5.5 kV to accomodate the load growth in these towns.
The cost of the rehabilitation and extension as well as the cost per
connection is given below:

(1)   Rohabilitation cost per customer Is calculated using the cost of
rehabilitation dlwided by the 1987 number of customers.
(2)   The extension cost per cust4or Is calculated by dividing the
extension cost by tho Incr emental Increase In the number of
customers.
(3)   Tho high cost of extension per customer In S6gou Is due to the
relatively hiah number of Industrial and commorcial customers.
