INTERIM SECOND BENI LIVESTOCK DEYELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        On May 26, 1967, IDA made a Credit (107-BO) of US$ 2.0 million
to the Republic of Bolivia for a first stage Livestock Development Project.
This First Project has progressed ahead of schedule and the Government of
Bolivia is now requesting another Credit of US$ 1.4 million to assist in
the financing of a Second Project to supplement Credit 1OT-BO. This would
be an interim operation confined to the same project purposes and areas.
The objective of the Second Project is to cover the financial gap of about
12 months between the full commitment of the First Credit 107-BO in Septem-
ber 1969, and September 1970, when a more comprehensive Third Livestock
Project, appraised in October/November 1969, could become effective.
There is a continuing demand for long-term development credit to realize
the potential for beef cattle production. There is also a growing domes-
tic demand for beef and attractive export outlets, in neighboring deficit
meat producing countries, are presently being developed.
ii.       The proposed IDA Credit would be used entirely for ranch de-
velopment loans. The Agricultural Bank of Bolivia would provide addi-
tional working capital funds. No additional IDA funds for technical
services are needed. The estimated foreign exchange component amounts
to about 22% of total Project cost, the same as under Credit 107-BO.
The Credit would cover 61% of the total Project cost of about us$ 2.3
million. The balance would be provided by the Agricultural Bank of Bo-
livia (21%), and ranchers (18%). Based upon the average size of ranch
loans made under the First Credit, it is expected that about 110 addi-
tional beef cattle ranches would be financed under the proposed Project.
As under Credit 1OT-BO, investment on each ranch would be phased over a
period of up to three years.
iii.      Project administration and procurement would continue as under
Credit 107-BO. The Livestock Project Division of the Agricultural Bank
of Bolivia, headed by an experienced Project Director, would continue to
provide Technical Services to participating ranchers. The goods and ser-
vices required for the Project would be procured through normal comrer-
cial sources.
iv.       Expected additional benefits to participating ranchers and the
economy are substantial, and proportionately comparable to those under
ProJect 107-BO.  Under the First Project, the financial rate of return
to ranchers was estimated at 17% and 22%, depending on the type of opera-
tion, and the economic rate of return at about 17%. It is estimated that
similar rates of return would be achieved under the Interim Project. The



- ii -
proposed Interim Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$ 1.4 million
under the usual IDA terms and conditions. The Borrower would be the Gov-
ernment of Bolivia who would bear the foreign exchange risk. The Credit
would be channeled through a Project Revolving Fund, located in the Cen-
tral Bank, to the Agricultural Bank of Bolivia who would on-lend the
funds to Beni ranchers on the same terms and conditions provided under
Credit 107-BO.

INTERIM SECOND BENI LIVESTOCK DEVElOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Bolivia is requesting an IDA Credit to as-
sist in financing a Livestock Development Project which would be con-
fined to the same project purposes and areas as the First Livestock De-
velopment Project 1/ (Credit 107-BO). This would be an interim opera-
tion pending a Third, more comprehensive, Livestock Development Credit
which would not be ready for final IDA consideration before mid-1970.
The Project financed with Credit 107-BO is a pilot beef cattle opera-
tion for the Beni area of the Tropical Lowlands, designed to yield ex-
perience in the development of the beef cattle sub-sector that could
be used as a basis for further, more ambitious projects. The Credit
was to be committed over a three-year period from the Effective Date
(October 1, 1967) but was, in fact, fully committed in only 15 months
from the commencement of lending (June, 1968), about one year ahead
of schedule. The proposed Credit would cover the gap of about 12
months between total commitment of Credit 107-BO and effectiveness of
the proposed Third Livestock Project. The appraisal report is based
on the results of a visit to Bolivia by Mr. J. Fransen in July, 1969.
II. JUSTIFICATION OF INTERIM SECOND PROJECT
2.01      A comprehensive livestock project for Bolivia was appraised in
October/November, 1969. The project would provide funds for further beef
development in the Beni and sheep development in the Altiplano. However,
it is estimated that at least one year will pass before a Credit for it
could become effective. Thus, with the full commitment of the 107-BO
funds at September 30, 1969, lending to the livestock industry in Bolivia
would come to a halt. This Interim Second Project is proposed in order
to meet the continuing demand for ranch development financing, and to
maintain the current momentum of lending and the Project administration
network which has been especially developed in the Banco Agricola de Bo-
livia (Agricultural Bank of Bolivia - BAB).
2.02      Expansion of the beef cattle industry has high priority in Bo-
livia's economic development, and is a logical use of existing and poten-
tial resources of the Tropical Lowlands areas of Bolivia. (See Annex 1
for further details of the background to the First Project, Bolivia's
beef cattle sub-sector and a description of Credit 107-BO.)
1/   See appraisal Report Number TO-585a, dated May 2, 1967.  Credit 107-BO
was signed on May 26, 1967 and became effective October 1, 1967.



-2 -
2.03      To July 31, 1969, IDA and BAB had financed about US$ 1.8 mil-
lion equivalent as ranch development loans to producers owning only about
15% of the total cattle population of about one million head in the Beni
area of the Tropical Lowlands. If the standard of productivity of un-
financed ranches in the Tropical Lowlands region is to be raised to the
level of existing loan beneficiaries, the industry would need substantial
further long-term credit and expanded technical and marketing services.
There is a continuing strong demand for long-term credit and an unused
capacity to absorb it on commercial lending terms.
2.04      The following table shows actual and estimated commitment of
Project funds to July and September, 1969, respectively, and estimated
demand to September, 1970. The difference between estimated commit-
ments to September, 1970, and funds available initially indicates the
quantity of funds needed to keep up the pace of on-ranch investment
established under the First Project.

2.05      Annex 2 shows the movement of ranch development funds provided
by IDA under Credit 107-BO. Although there has been an increasing rate
of commitment of funds during the first five quarters it is expected
that future lending will level out at about a rate of 30 loans approved
per quarter.
2.06      The quarterly commitment rate of the IDA component for ranch
development loans is estimated at about US$ 345,000 under the Interim
Project. This is similar to the disbursement rate of the first four
quarters of Credit 107-BO. It would indicate the need for about US$
1.4 million to fill the gap between September 30, 1969, when all funds
under 107-BO were committed, and September 30, 1970, the target date
set for the initiation of a broader livestock project. There are no
major constraints to the effective utilization of the proposed IDA Cre-
dit. There is an adequate supply of local and imported breeding cattle,
continuing rancher demand and sufficient local currency contributions.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER CREDIT 107-BO
A. The Project Under Credit 107-BO
3.01      The Project financed by Credit 107-BO was designed as a first
stage project, confined to the Department of the Beni (see Map 1). The
Credit provided funds for the partial development of about 150 establish-
ed commercial ranchers to increase their herds and production (Annex 3
gives details of the development of a typical ranch under Credit 107-BO).
It provided 85% of loan funds for long-term ranch development. The ba-
lance was covered by BAB, which also provides short-term working capital.
Technical services were also supplied to participating ranchers. The
Project also included a country-wide survey of livestock and meat mar-
keting and a land tenure survey. These surveys would provide informa-
tion for the more comprehensive Third Project.
B. Comparison of Forecast with Actual Performance
3.02      Investment in pasture improvement under Credit 107-BO was lower
than predicted, although the proportion of this investment category had
increased in later stages of the Credit. As regards livestock, the number
of cattle acquired by participants was less than expected but the average
price paid was about double that forecast. Higher prices were due princi-
pally to the purchase of a significant proportion of higher priced imports
from Brazil. The acquisition of a smaller number of cattle by beneficiaries
was compensated, however, by higher retention rates. This was noticeable
not only in respect of participants, who are eager to take advantage of



- 5 -
their expanded capacity resulting from investment under the Project, but
also of ranchers in the region at large, whose ranches are under-stocked 1/
and who wish to benefit from the favorable cattle production outlook for
the region (para 3.13). Higher retention rates have decreased the supply
of breeding cattle originating in the region and have driven up the price
of breeding cattle. Imported cattle tend to be of better quality and thus
more expensive than locally produced, even under previous conditions. The
overall composition of predicted and actual investment is as follows:

On-Ranch Development Loans
3.04      The demand for loans has been steady and at July 31, 1969, 140
loans, aggregating approximately US$ 1.7 million equivalent, had been ap-
proved by BAB. The balance of loan funds was fully committed by Septem-
ber 30, 1969. As there is a grace period of four years, there has been
no repayment of principal.
Quarterly Development Loan Approval
3.05      The distribution of ranch development loans by quarters as at July
31, 1969, was as follows:
Average Loan Size       Total Volume
QUARTER             Number           per Ranch
of Loans         (us$ '000)            (US$0ooo)
1 (July-Sept. 1968)         18                12.0                 217.0
2 (Oct.-Dec.  1968)          31               11.5                 357.0
3 (Jan.-march 1969)         31                10.6                 328.0
4 (Apr.-June  1969)         50                14.1                 704.0

TOTAL                140                12.4               1,735.0
Loan size ranges from US$ 3,100 to US$ 98,000 equivalent.  The overall aver-
age is US$ 12,400 equivalent as compared with forecast of US$ 14,400 equiva-
lent. The geographic distribution of loans has been confined to the Beni
area, as planned.
Source of Financing
3.06      At July 31, 1969, the total investment cost of 140 approved ranch
plans was about US$ 2.2 million equivalent (para 2.04), financed approxima-
tely as follows: IDA 68%, BAB 12%, and participating ranchers 20%. There
has been no variation between forecast and actual contributions.
Commitments and Disbursements by BAB
3.07      Total disbursement by BAB at July 31, 1969, was approximately
US$ 1.2 million equivalent or about 57% of the amount allocated for ranch
development. An additional 24% of the funds had been committed, leaving



- 7 -
19% uncommitted. This balance was fully committed by September 30, 1969
(para. 2.04). Although BAB disbursements to meet ranch development plans
are projected over two to three year periods, it is expected that about
75% of each ranch investment program would be carried out in the first
year of development. Thus, a substantial disbursement can be expected in
1969 and early 1970 for the 140 loans approved.
D. Organization and Management
Channeling of Loan Funds to the Agricultural Bank of Bolivia
3.08      The Borrower under Credit 107-BO is the Republic of Bolivia, which
bears the foreign exchange risk. The effective date was October 1, 1967,
and the closing date is June 30, 1972. The Credit carried standard IDA
terms. The Central Bank acts as fiscal agent for the Borrower. The Gov-
ernment has established at the Central Bank a Project Revolving Fund to
make and receive payments connected with the Project. It channels funds
to BAB at an interest rate of 4% for a term of 16 years including five
years of grace. During this 16 year period, repayments, not required for
servicing the Credit, would be re-lent to BAB, for further lending under
the Project on the same terms and conditions.
The Agricultural Bank of Bolivia (BAB)
3.09      The BAB, a Government owned development bank, is the executing
agent for the Project. Its participation in the Project to July 31, 1969,
is summarized as follows (which includes commitments to ranchers, contri-
bution to technical services and working capital requirements of sub-
borrowers):
BAB's Contribution to   31/69
No. of         % of       Amount of

Technical Services               140            43           o.o6
Working Capital                  140           100           o.60
TOTAL                       140            -            0.92
BAB's participation is the same as that agreed during negotiations of
Credit 107-BO.

Lending Terms and Conditions to Sub-Borrowers
3.10      Loan terms to ranchers are 12 years including a grace period of 4
years. Interest charge is 12% per annum on outstanding balances. Loans are
made only after the Project Director has approved ranch development plans,
prepared by field technicians employed by the Livestock Project Division,
established within BAB specifically to service Credit 107-BO. All loans are
then submitted to the Project Loan Committee comprised of the General Mana-
ger and Credit Manager of BAB and the Project Director, for final approval.
Project Administration
3.11      The Project is coordinated by a Project Loan Committee (para 3.10).
This committee meets when necessary, usually twice monthly at BAB headquar-
ters in La Paz, to approve loans and review Project progress.
3.12      The original Project Director resigned after about one year in
post, during which time he and BAB had established a basically sound proce-
dure for loan evaluation and operation and had engaged and partially trained
local technical field staff. These procedures and staff training were re-
fined and improved by an acting Project Director seconded by the Bank from
January to August, 1969, and lending operations proceed well ahead of sche-
dule. A new permanent Project Director has recently been appointed by BAB
in agreement with IDA and is expected to report to duty in Bolivia late in
November, 1969. In order to avoid interruptions to the lending process,
arrangements have been made for an Acting Project Director to be appointed
for short periods prior to the arrival of the new Project Director. The
Project Director reports to the President of BAB through the General Man-
ager. As a member of the Loan committee he votes on all loan applications.
A competent technical staff of five technicians, one of whom holds the po-
sition of Assistant Project Director, are assigned to the Livestock Project
Division and work full-time under the Project Director. In addition to the
preparation of ranch development plans, the technical staff devotes con-
siderable time to screening project inquiries, supervision of approved loans,
veterinary control and advice to sub-borrowers, and to the promotional and
educational aspects of the Project. This arrangement works well and the
technical services are appreciated by the ranchers. Current arrangements
for Project administration and technical staff numbers are adequate for the
needs of the Interim Second Project.

3.13      The Project is too new to measure financial and economic gains,
but physical progress has been good and the administration and management
are effective. When the First Credit was made, IDA estimated that the
Project would yield an average annual net return to the economy of Bolivia
of about 17%. Results and current market prospects indicate this target
will be met. In August, 1969, the Livestock Producers Association of the
Beni and COMIBOL (the State mining monopoly) signed a three year agreement



- 9 -
whereby the latter would purchase beef from the Association at a price of
about 4.50 pesos/kg carcass weight. This agreement provides the producers
of the Beni with a firm long-range market at prices about 15% above those
envisaged during appraisal of the First Project. This price increase com-
pensates for the increase in investment costs associated with higher prices
for breeding cattle (para 3.02).
3.14      The 140 ranchers participating to date owned together about 145,000
head of cattle before the beginning of the Project. This is approximately
15% of the estimated cattle population in the Department of the Beni. Projec-
tions over the 12 year life of the loans, indicate a doubling of cattle num-
bers belonging to sub-borrowers and a two-fold increase in output at the end
of the 12 year period. The First Project is thus expected to result in the
annual incremental production of 8,400 m ton carcass weight per annum, valued
at about US$ 2.7 million.
Livestock and Meat Marketing Survey
3.15      A livestock and meat marketing survey has been organized by BAB,
as required by the Credit Agreement of 107-BO. The purpose of the survey
is to evaluate whether demand and infrastructure are sufficient to absorb
additional production from a third stage project and from the livestock
project currently under consideration by the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) for the regions of Santa Cruz, Tarija and Chuquisaca. A study
group, made up of qualified experts from USAID, British Mission to Boli-
via and a qualified Bolivian cattleman, assumed responsibility for the im-
plementation and conduct of this survey. The report of the survey was
made available to BAB and IDA in mid-October 1969.
Land Tenure Survey
3.16      In accordance with the Credit Agreement of 107-BO a land tenure
survey is being undertaken by BAB, through an experienced team of the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin. Data are being collected throughout the Department
of the Beni and adjoining areas, which will assist in the implemenation of
the proposed Third Credit. This survey is progressing well and preliminary
reports should be available by the end of 1969.
IV. THE INTERIM SECOND BENI LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
4.01      The Second Livestock Development Credit would supplement Credit
107-BO and would be restricted to the same project purposes and areas. The
total cost of the Interim Project is estimated at about US$ 2.3 million.
Benefits and costs are expected to be similar and proportional to those of
the First Project. An IDA Credit of US$ 1.4 million would provide 68% of
ranch development financing. The balance would be provided by BAB (12%) and
ranchers (20%). Additional funds would not be needed for technical services,
since the Borrower has requested that US$ 30,000 of the unallocated category
of Credit 1OT-BO (US$ 200,000) be reallocated to technical services and the



- 10 -
balance to the on-ranch development category. This would provide for all
expected costs under technical services, including a reasonable contingency
allowance. In addition, the costs associated with the employment of the
Project Director are to be shared with IDB since he would also assist BAB
with the execution of a project to be partially financed by that institu-
tion. To meet the working capital requirements of sub-borrovers under the
Interim Second Project, BAB would supplement the funds remaining under the
First Project with the equivalent of about US$150,000.
4.02      The Project estimated foreign exchange component amounts to 22%
of total cost, the same as under Credit 107-BO. Thus about 66% of the pro-
posed Credit would finance local currency expenditures.
4.03      Although the analysis of the performance under Credit 107-BO
reveals that there have been variations between projected and actual input
prices (para 3.02) and between projected and actual beef prices (para 3.13),
they have tended to compensate each other and consequently it is expected
that rates of return estimated for the First Project will be met. Under
the First Pro3ect, the financial rate of return to ranches was estimated
at 17% and 22%, depending on the type of operation, and the economic rate
of return at about 17%. Producers benefiting from the proposed Credit
would be of similar type, located in the same region, and subject to simi-
lar conditions as those under Credit 107-BO. It is therefore estimated
that the financial and economic rates of return estimated for the First
Project are valid for the proposed Interim Project.
4.04      The Credit would be made on normal IDA terms to Government, who
would bear the foreign exchange risk. As under Credit 107-BO, the Central
Bank would act as fiscal agent for the Borrower in channeling credit funds
to BAB (para 3.08). The Government, through the Project Revolving Fund es-
tablished in the Central Bank for the servicing of Credit 107-BO, would
make the proceeds of the IDA Credit available to BAB in local currency, at
an interest rate of 4% for a term of 16 years, including five years of grace.
During this 16 year period, repayments not required for IDA debt servicing
would also be made available annually to BAB ou the same terms and condi-
tions for further lending under the Project. BAB would on-lend to partici-
pating ranchers at 12% per annum for a term of 12 years, including a four
year grace period.
Disbursements
4.05      The purpose of this Interim Project is to prevent a halt in lend-
ing operations to livestock producers in the Beni between September 30, 1969,
and September, 1970, when funds from a third project may become available
(para 2.01). By September 30, 1969, BAB had approved ranch development loans
equal to the funds in this category under Credit 107-BO. However, BAB dis-
burses development loans to ranchers in tranches over two to three years and
withdraws funds from IDA only after actual disbursements to ranchers have
taken place. Therefore there remains a substantial balance in Credit 107-BO



- 11 -
after September 30, 1969. BAB would continue to withdraw from Credit 1OT-BO,
even in respect of new loans made after September 30, 1969, until the rele-
vant category in that Credit is fully disbursed, and then would plan to draw
on the proposed new Credit which at that time would have become effective.
Satisfactory arrangements have been made to provide the services of an Acting
Project Director, as required, to prevent an interruption in lending pending
the arrival of the new Project Director (para 3.12).
4.o6      As under Credit 107-BO, IDA would reimburse Government 85% of
eligible ranch development loans, upon receipt of certified statements
of disbursement.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      Progress under Credit 107-BO has been better than anticipated.
All funds available for on-ranch development loans have been committed.
Credit demand by ranchers continues to be strong. It is too early to
measure precisely the financial and economic effects of Credit 107-BO but,
from ranch inspections and rancher responses, there is every reason to be-
lieve that the favorable returns estimated at appraisal will be obtained.
Therefore, to fill the gap of approximately 12 months between full commit-
ment of Credit 107-BO funds (September 1969) and effectiveness of a Third
Project (about September, 1970), a Second Credit of US$ 1.4 million would
be appropriate.
5.02      The assurances and covenants of Credit 107-BO would be continued
in this Second Livestock Development Credit to Bolivia insofar as they are
applicable.






ANNEX 1
BOLIVIA
INTERIM SECOND BENI LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1/
BACKGROUND TO PROJECT 107-BO-
A. General
1.        Bolivia has an area of 1.1 million km2 and is completely land-
locked. It may be divided into three geographical zones: the altiplano
(highlands), the yungas (intermediate valleys) and the llanos (subtropi-
cal and tropical eastern lowlands).
2.        Agriculture employs more than two-thirds of the total labor force
of the estimated 3.7 million population, the greater part of which lives on
subsistence holdings in the altiplano. Since 1952, when the government re-
distributed land ownership in the altiplano, agricultural production has
barely kept pace with population growth (1.7%) and has declined from about
one-third to one-fourth of GDP in the same period. More recently, however,
the production of sugar, rice and cotton has increased appreciably in the
lowlands, and the first two have reached levels of self sufficiency. The
lowlands, representing 65% of the total area of the country and containing
only 15% of the population, offer very good opportunities for beef cattle
development.
B. The Beef Cattle Sub-Sector
3.        The cattle population of the lowlands is about 1.2 million
head, or two-thirds of the national total, and is largely concentrated
in the Department of Beni. Official sources estimate an extraction
rate 2/ of 10% for the lowlands. Annual production from the Beni De-
partment alone averaged 6,500 m ton of dressed beef from 1960 through
1965. This was roughly one-half of the total national production.
The relatively low average carcass weight has remained fairly constant
at around 180 kg per head in the same period.

2/   Total number of cattle slaughtered annually expressed as a per-
centage of total cattle population.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
4.        Domestic per capita consumption has also remained stable at
about six kg per year (the lowest in South America), although wide re-
gional variations are apparent, e.g. La Paz and the tin mines consume
three times more beef than the national average. Beef imports and ex-
ports have fluctuated markedly in the last five years, but their total
value has remained very small.
C. Animal Health
5.        Animal health problems in the Beni reflect inadequate man-
agement, the absence of a field diagnostic service, and limited appli-
cation of disease control measures. The most important diseases are
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD - Aftosa) and Paralytic Rabies, which could
be controlled by routine vaccination programs. During negotiations as-
surances have been obtained that all cattle belonging to ranchers par-
ticipating in the Project would be routinely vaccinated against FMD
and Rabies. Other factors, such as low fertility rate, calf mortality
caused by dieseases of the newborn, and internal parasites could be
brought to acceptable levels through appropriate herd management.
D. Agricultural Services
6.        The agricultural services of Bolivia were built up as semi-
independent organizations in the period following the agrarian revolu-
tion of 1952. They were incorporated in a reorganized Ministry of Agri-
culture in 1965.
7.        The extension service's agents have little training in animal
husbandry. Field veterinary services are mainly concerned with Rabies
control in the lowlands, and with an FMD campaign in the Department of
Cochabamba, which is to be expanded to include the lowlands. Assurance
for this has been obtained during negotiations. The Ministry of Agri-
culture plans to establish a field diagnostic service and a major vac-
cine production center in the lowlands, coupled with expanded field
veterinary activities.
8.        The School of Agriculture at Cochabamba is poorly equipped
and staffed, as is the Veterinary School at Santa Cruz, but realistic
efforts at reform are being made in the latter, where the present aim
is to produce 20 graduates a year. An intermediate level of training
is given at the six practical agricultural schools, which graduate a-
bout 100 students a year, most of whom go into the extension service.
9.        There are two agricultural research centers concerned with
cattle production. The Trinidad center in Beni has done some breeding
work and has started to keep records recently. The Saavedra station
of Santa Cruz is designing and testing systems of husbandry suited to
the environment.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
10.       Medium and long-term agricultural credit, for which the de-
mand is great, is available only from public sources, the most impor-
tant of which is the Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB), an autonomous
organization under the general direction of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Besides lending from its own resources, BAB has channelled funds from
USAID, which is also assisting with reorganization and management, and
the Interamerican Development Bank. Interest charged is 12% per an-
num, and most loans are made for 12 years. During negotiations, it
has been assured that BAB would initiate separate accounting of its
commercial and subsidized operations.
E.  Government Policies on Livestock DevloPment
11.       The Government has recently emphasized in its policies the
development of the beef and wool industries, and BAB is playing a major
role in channelling funds to these sectors. The Government has also
initiated an ambitious plan to reorganize the Ministry of Agriculture
in an attempt to provide the ancillary services necessary for develop-
ment of the livestock industry. The tax burden on livestock producers
has always been kept small and movement of cattle within the country
has remained free. Meat prices to the producers have remained unregu-
lated, but those to wholesalers and retailers have been kept at the
same level for the past five years in the main consumption centers.
F.  The    Sect Area
12.       The Project area is that part of the Beni which is predomi-
nantly grassland, and comprises mainly the very extensive flood plains
of the Mamore River and its tributaries. Its size is around 12 million
ha, two million of which are in ranches.
13.       The climate is tropical with an annual rainfall averaging
1,800 mm, of which 60% occurs in January-April. The mean temperature
is 260 centigrade. Soils are young alluvials, varying from sandy to
clay loams, with clay subsoils or pan at a depth of one m or less in
extended areas. The climax vegetation is high forest of many species,
while grassland predominates in the central floodplains. The area
lies at a general altitude of about 250 m above sea level and is very
flat. Partial flooding occurs at the time of the summer runoffs.
14.       In Bolivia, ranch size is usually expressed in terms of cattle
numbers. In the Beni, approximately 40% of all ranches have a herd size
of between 400 and 1,000 head of cattle. A total of about 300 ranches
are included in this size category. The typical ranch to be developed
would initially have about 600 head of cattle and approximately 4,000
ha of pasture land, of which about 2,400 ha would be improved under the
Project. The Beni ranches are extremely understocked, even when taking



ANNEX 1
Page 4
into account the extensive grazing production system followed in the
area. Ranchers have the right to own five ha of land per head of cattle
under the Agrarian Reform Law, but the process of title clarification is
lengthy and makes it difficult to obtain credit. As a condition of the
proposed IDA credit, a process for quick clarification of land titles to
participating ranchers has been established by Government.
G. Description of the Project
15.       In view of limited government experience and resources for
this type of development and insufficient supply of breeding stock,
the Project would be restricted to the partial development of 150 com-
mercial beef cattle ranches in the Department of Beni. The Beni has
greater immediate potential for livestock development at higher re-
turns than other lowlands regions and also has better developed mar-
keting facilities. Project investments and the proposed IDA credit
would amount to US$ 4.0 million and US$ 2.0 million respectively.
The Project would represent the first stage of a long-term livestock
development program, directed primarily at improvement of beef cattle
production in the lowlands.
16.       Investments would be for fencing, corrals, water points,
light equipment and tools, essential barns and housing, selected pas-
ture improvement, purchase of breeding stock (limited to not more than
50% of individual ranch development loans), working capital and tech-
nical services. The above investments would increase carrying capacity,
permit a more efficient and fuller utilization of the pasture produced,
and improve stock quality and performance. Due to the present under-
stocked condition prevailing on most ranches, only about 60% of each
participating ranch would need to be developed under the Project to
provide adequate pasture for existing and projected herd size.
17.       As a complement to the Project, BAB will:  (a) financially
and technically assist in the development of about eight representa-
tive ranches in the Departments of Santa Cruz and Tarija; (b) conduct
a land tenure survey in the lowlands; and (c) carry out a national beef
and live cattle marketing study. The above activities would be under-
taken under terms of reference to be agreed upon with IDA, and would
help to provide the basis for a second stage of livestock development.

1/ Cheese Sales:  Estimated to return 160 Pesos/cow milked/year. During years 0-3, 50 per cent of the cows would
be milked 100 days;  years 4-6, 75 per cent of cows would be milked and years 7-12, 25 per cent of the cows
would be milked.  It is estimated that each cow would produce 2 liters of milk per day or 200 liters during
the 100 day milking season.  It requires 10 liters of milk to produce 1 kilogram of cheese.  This results
in a production of 20 kilograms of cheese/cow milked/year.  Cheese is sold at 8 Pesos per kilogram resulting
in a return of 160/Pesos/cow milked/year.
2/  Ninety five head at 800 Pesos/head annually during years two through six.
