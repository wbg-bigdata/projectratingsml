MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF HONDURAS
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1. I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of Honduras for SDR 7.4 million, the equivalent of US
$10.8 milliun, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance an
Environmental Development Project.
2. Background. Honduras is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the Latin
America and Caribbean Region, with an annual per capita income of $580. About one third of the
population lives in extreme poverty. Although the natural resource potential of H-onduras is
substantial, population growth of about 3% annually, along with inappropriate land management
and forestry policies, have been responsible for the conversion of large areas of high forestry
potential into other less suitable actiNities, the destruction of vital watersheds, and the loss of
important biodiversity assets. Unplanned urban settlements, the lack of budgetary resources and
inefficient cost recovery policies to finance the necessary infrastructure are among the leading
causes of inadequate quality of water supply, poor sanitation, deficient solid waste management,
and the resulting health problems.
3. Public awareness of the importance of protecting the country's valuable timber, soil, water, and
coastal resources and improving the quality of urban life has been growing as a result of
increasing evidence that the unsustainable exploitation of these resources and urban deterioration
threaten the country's economic development and health. Legislation for agriculture, forestry, and
municipal government has been enacted which has helped establish a framework for improved
resource management. The Government of Honduras (GOH) has also moved to coordinate and
implement its environmental policy by enacting in July 1993 an Environmental Law (Ley General
del Ambiente - LGA), which established a Ministry of the Environment (Secretaria del Ambiente -
SEDA), issuing implementing regulations, and completing the Environment and Development
Action Plan (Plan de Acci6n de Ambiente y Desarrollo - PAAD). The new Administration, which
assumed office in January 1994, has affirmed the environmental initiatives of its predecessor, as
well as the commitment to protect the environment and promote the sustainable use of the
country's natural resources.
4. Key Environmental Issues. Hondura- principal environmental concern is the sustainable use
of natural resources. The key environmental issues identified in the PAAD are related to
deforestation, soil degradation, water pollution, depletion of coastal and marine resources, and the
loss of biodiversity. The most visible and perhaps most pressing environmental issue is that of
deforestation. In the last thirty years, Honduras has lost about 40% of its forest, principally as a
result of an advancing agricultural frontier and extensive livestock ranching, in addition to logging
and firewood extraction. More than half of the cleared land was only suitable for forestry, so that
deforestation has neither served the interests of the environment, nor that of sustainable
agricultural development. Soil degradation occurs in two principal ways in Honduras. One is with
respect to poor farmers engaged in hillside farming. It is estimated that at least 25% of the land
used for agriculture falls into this category and that 30 to 40% of the population is engaged in
subsistence level hillside farming. Improper farming practices have led to significant soil erosion,



2
which has had negative economic and cc ological consequences. The second concerns flatland
agricultural activities in the coastal plains and X alleys The .e lands have been dedicated for
decades to extensive livestock productiorL and the production of export crops. Soils have been
depleted because of monocultu re practices and contaminated by the indiscriminate use of
agricultural chemicals, causing both economic loss and health hazards. Water pollution has
several causes. The often excessive and uncontrolled use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides,
particularly in coffee and banana production, has colitaminated both water and soils. The lack of
adequate sewage treatment facilities has contaminated the country's major rivers. Inadequate
handling of solid wastes, and the failure to treat industrial and hospital wastes has also increased
water and soil contamination. The depletion of marine and coastal resources has become a matter
of increasinh corncern as shrimp farrning continues to play an increasingly important role in the
national economy. The estuaries and mangroves of both coasts have been subject to deterioration
as a result of their over-exploitation and contamination. According to a 1993 study, as reported
by SEDA, between 1989 and 1992, 17% of the high-quality mangroves (categories other than
stressed and dwarf mangroves) in the Gulf of Fonseca were lost. Coral reefs have been destroyed
in the Bay Islands area on the Atlantic coast at an alarming rate as a result of tourism,
sedimentation, and contamination. And, as a consequence of the expansion of the agricultural
frontier and the destruction of forest cover Honduras has experienced significant loss of
biodiversity.
5. The Environmental Sector. In an effort to develop a more comprehensive and coordinated
set of environmental policies, the Govemment created the National Commission for the
Environment (Comisi6n Nacional del Medio Ambientc - CONAMA) in July 1990, with
responsibility for preparing legislation, developing policies and regulations, establishing training
programs, and monitoring compliance with international treaties. CONAMA, supported by an
Institutional Development Fund grant, drafted the PAAD described above. As a result of the
enactment of the LGA in July 1993, CONAMA became the Ministry of the Environment, SEDA
with the principal respoasibilities, in addition to policy, planning, and coordination activities of
CONAMA, of: (a) providing technical assistance to sec. ar agencies and municipalities; (b)
coordinating the developmrent of a national land use plan; (c) evaluating environmental impact
assessments and the issuance of environmental licenses for projects; and (d) developing
environmental norms and standard.
6. The enactment of the LGA, the issuance of the PAAD, and the initial regulations issued by the
GOH have been major achievements in themselves. They are the basis on which to develop
institutions and improve environmental management at the national and local levels, and by public
agencies and private organizations. However, the development of a sound institutional
framework on which to support a broad and far-reaching environmental agenda and to implement
the growing body of environmental laws and regulations has only just barely begun. SEDA faces
some difficult challenges in fiulfilling its legislative mandate and establishing its environmental
leadership position. Sector agencies, often representinlg interests more concerned with
exploitation rather than conservation of natural resources, and operating under their own laws and
with large bureaucracies, may resist being integrated into the environmental approach established
by the new law. In adduition to national agencies, Honduras' 291 municipalities, with important
environmental responsibilities under the 1992 Municipal Law, must be integrated into the new
scheme. Overcoming sector agency resistance and establishing leadership will require SEDA to
demonstrate competence, political skill, and commitment.



3
7. The most important sectoral agencies with environmental responsibilities are: (a) the Ministry
of Natural Resources (Secretaria de Recursos Naturales), which has jurisdiction over forestry,
agriculture, mining, water resources, and fisheries; (b) the Ministry of Public Health (Secretaria
de Salud Publica), which has jurisdiction over water quality and food products; and (c) the
Ministry of Communications, Public Works and Transport (Secretaria de Comunicaciones, Obras
Piblicas y Transporte), which is responsible for large public sector infrastructure projects. Other
important agencies with environmental responsibilities include the Hondurar. Forestry
Development Corporation (Corporaci6n Hondurefia de Desarrollo Forestal), the National Electric
Energy Company (Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica), the National Autonomous Water and
Sewerage Service (Servicio Nacional Aut6nomo de Acueductos y Alcantarillados), and the
Honduras Tourism Institute (Instituto Hondurefno de Turismo). The Ministry of Planning
(Secretaria de Coordinaci6n, Planificaci6n y Presupuesto - SECPLAN) retains important
planning authorities that affect the environment, particularly in relation to public investment and
land use planning. With regards to legal enforcement, the GOH has recently created the Public
Prosecutor's Office (Fiscalia General de la Repuiblica), which shares criminal and judicial
enforcement responsibilities on environmental matters with the General Attomey's Office
(Procuraduria General de la Repuiblica - PGR).
S. Legal Framework Honduras' 1982 Constitution establishes the general framework for
environmental protection and the enactment of environmental laws. Article 45 gives the State the
responsibility of maintaining an environment that will protect the health of the people, and Article
340 provides authority for it to regulate natural resources and for granting use permits to the
private sector. However, it was not until July 1993 that the LGA was enacted. The new law has
substantially altered the legal and institutional framework for environmental management by: (a)
establishing the principle that coordinated planning and management are necessary for the
successful management and preservation of natural resources; (b) creating a lead environmental
agency, SEDA, with responsibility for sector policy development, coordination, and planning; (c)
requiring environmental impact assessments for public and private activitieb Aith potentially
negative environmental consequences, as established in the regulations of the National System of
Environmental Impact Assessment (Sistema Nacional de Evaluaci6n de Impacto Amnbiental -
SINEIA); (d) providing for the issuance of environmental standards and regulations; and (e)
creating a legal environmental enforcement arm, the Environmental Attomey's Office
(Procuraduria del Ambiente) within PGR.
9. Government Sectoral Policy, Strategy, and Objectives. The GOH is dedicated to
protecting the environment and the promotion of sustainable development of the country's natural
resources. Some of the measures in the GOH's strategy are: (a) on the issue of deforestation, to
reorient the role of the public sector away from production and marketing and towards
management and protection of public forests, extension and research, regulation of private
forestry activities, fire protection, and the establishment of forest reserves in public lands; (b) to
establish policies and alternatives that discourage the further expansion of agriculture to
unsuitable lands, provide technical assistance to limit soil erosion and degradation, and regulate
the use of chemicals and fertilizer; (c) to develop water pricing policies to encourage a more
efficient distribution of water resources and carry out a master plan for the development of water
resources; (d) to develop effective command and control mechanisms, economic incentives and
disincentives to control pollution, and investments in waste treatment and disposal facilities; (e) to



4
improve management of protected areas and parks for the purpose of preserving biodiveisity; and
(f) to strictly enforce environmental assessments to economic activities that affect fragile marine
and coastal resources.
10.  Project Objectives. The proposed project has three sets of objectives. The first set of
objectives is to strengthen the capacity of government agencies in environmental and natural
resource planning; policy, legal and regulatory framework development; interagency and
intersector coordination; environmental monitoring; and enforcement of environmental laws and
regulations. The proposed project will help establish the PAAD as a permanent planning process,
and through it develop the capacity of sector and other government agencies to incorporate
environmental variables in their natural resource and land use plans. NGO and public
participation is an essential element of the environmental planning process, which will be amply
supported by the project. The second set of objectives is to assist SEDA and relevant sector
agencies in the strengthening and implementation of a national system of environmental impact
assessment; to develop the methodologies for the preparation and processing of environmental
impact assessments and environmental audits in high priority sectors; and to engage NGOs,
communities and the private sector in the environmental assessment review process. The third set
of objectives is to develop the environmental management capacity of selected municipalities in a
manner that will increase the involvement of grassroots organizations and individuals in the
environmental affairs of their communities; and to finance, on a pilot basis, environmental
subprojects at the municipal and cormmunity levels, and by small and micro-enterprises, through
the Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondurenio de Inversi6n Social - FHIS).
I1. Priject Description. The proposed project will be carried out over a six-year period,
starting in 1995. It has four components with a total cost of approximately US $12.5 million:'
(a)   The Environmental Planning and Legislation component (US $3.5 million, 28% of
total project costs) will: (a) strengthen SEDA's capacity to carry out its policy-
setting, sectoral and land use planning, monitoring, coordinating, and normative
functions. The proposed project will finance technical assistance for updating the
PAAD, assisting with the incorporation of environmental variables in the design
and implementation of sectoral and land use planning initiatives, developing
planning methodologies and strategies, and carrying out of studies; (b) design and
implement a National Environmental Information System (Sistema Nacional de
Informacion Ambiental - SINIA) to integrate existing information retrieval and
management initiatives and to support the design and implementation of
environmental information systems at the local and sectoral levels; (c) establish a
consistent legal and regulatory framework through harmonization of existing laws
and regulations, establish norms and technical standards, and provide training and
technical assistance on environmental legislation to lawyers and judicial branch
members; and (d) coordinate all the training activities under this project and will
design and implement environmental public awareness activities.
(b)   The Environmental Ouality Assessment component ($2.2 million, 18% of total
project costs) will: (a) strengthen the National System of Environmental Impact
The costs estimates include contingencies and taxes, unless otherwise noted. Totals may not add up due to
rounding.



5
Assessment (Sistema Nacional de Impacto Arnbiental - SINETA), which will
ensure that all investment projects give due consideration to environmental issues
according to established procedures: and (b) carry out pilot EIAs and
envirornmental audits in selected sectors (forestry, agro-industry, mining and
energy) to provide hands-on experience and help draft EIA and environmental
audit training and operations manuals.
(c)   The Local Government Environmental Management component (US $5.3 million,
43% of total project costs) will: (a) strenglhen the capacity of selected local
governments and communities by providing technical assistance on environmental
management, subproject identification and design, by engaging the population
through seminars and workshops aimed at increasing the environmental awareness
of the population and preparing municipal environmental action plans; and (b)
provide funding for environmental investments at the municipal and community
level through the Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondurenlo de Inversi6n
Social - FEHIS) and, on a pilot basis, a small line of credit for environmnental
investment managed by intermediary NGOs and directed at small and micro-
enterprises. Additionally, technical assistance will be provided to the FHIS to
incorporate environmental aspects into subproject design, implementation,
supervision, and evaluation.
(d)   The Administration and Proiect Coordination component (US $1.4 million, 11% of
total project costs) will: (a) strengthen SEDA's administrative unit through the
design and implementation of sound administrative, budgeting, and accounting
systems; and (b) establish a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in SEDA to assist
with project implementation.
12. Project Costs and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at US $12.5 million,
including taxes and contingencies. The foreign exchange costs amount to US $1 .9 mnillion,
approximately 15% of the total project cost. Given the nature of the proposed project, most of
the project cost (80%, excluding taxes) is for local expenditures, which consist of local salaries
and consultants, office fumiture and supplies, and environmental investments. The larger
expenditure categories are the environmental investments with US $3.1 million (25% of total
project cost), consultants and technical assistance with US $2.4 million (190%6), and studies with
US $1.7 million (14%). The proposed IDA credit of SDR 7.4 million (US $10.8 million
equivalent) will finance 86% of the total project cost over the projected six-year implementation
period. It will cover 100% of the foreign exchange expenditures and 89% of the estimated total
local costs. Local cost financing is justified because of the severe budgetary constraints of the
GOH, which will need assistance in financing the establishment costs of the new institutional
framework for environmental management.
13. Project Implementation. SEDA will be responsible for overall project management.
FHIS will be responsible for the Environmental Investment Subcomponent. Overall responsibility
for the management of the project in SEDA will fall on the PCU, which has coordinated the
preparation and design of the project. The PCU will work closely with SEDA's two directorates,
the General Directorate of Environmental Policy and Planning (Direccion General de Politicas y
Planificaci6n Ambiental - DPPA) and the General Directorate of Envirornental Assessment and



6
Control (Direcci6n General de Evaluaci6n y Control Ambiental - DECA), and with FHIS. The PCU
will be responsible for overall project management, for the preparation of the annual operating
plans and budgets, for ensuring technical standards during project implementation are met, and for
all the administrative matters related to the management of the project, inler alia, processing all
disbursement applications, requests of prior clearance by IDA, and other IDA-related
administrative tasks. DPPA will have the lead responsibility over the Environmental Planning and
Legislation Component and the Technical Assistance for Municipal Environmental Management
Subcomponent. DECA will have the lead responsibility for the Environmental Quality
Assessment Component. FHIS, which has been financed by IDA through two previous
operations (Credits No.2212-HO and No. 2401-HO) will have the lead responsibility for the
Environmental Investment Subcomponent.
14. The overall framework for the selection and management of the environmental investment
subprojects is contained in the operating procedures and guidelines which SEDA and FIS have
agreed to. SEDA will have a continuing role of commenting on environmental subprojects by
participating in the approval of subprojects as part of FHIS' operating committee. In this
capacity, SEDA will have the right to veto subprojects that are environmentally unsound, within
an established period of time (five working days). FHIS will be responsible for the contracting
and supervision of subprojects, using the same procedures that it uses with its other infrastructure
subprojects. Under these procedures, works are executed by private contractors and are
supervised by FI-IS until they are completed and transferred to the municipality for operation and
maintenance. For the execution of the pilot line of credit, FHIIS will operate through its Informal
Sector Support Progran (Programa de Apoyo al Sector Informal - PASI). Subloans will be made to
intermediary NGOs at market-oriented rates with repayment terms of up to two years, and they in
turn will make subloans to the final beneficiaries.
15. The proposed project will be implemented over a period of approximately six years, and is
expected to be completed by June 30, 2001. Retroactive financing is expected in an amount of up
to US $1.08 million (10% of total credit amount) for eligible expenditures incurred after July 1,
1994. These eligible expenditures include principally: (a) the establishment and operation of the
PCU, a land use planning unit at SECPLAN and an environmental unit at FHIS; and (b) technical
assistance on environmental management to selected municipalities. All project activities will
begin in the first year of the project, with the exception of the Pilot Environmental Impact
Assessment and Auditing Subcomponent and a few other minor activities. Project costs are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group Operations in Honduras are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13715-HO, dated February 28, 1995, is also
attached.
16. Project Sustainability. By strengthening the environmental policy-setting and
management functions at SEDA, the proposed project will help the Ministry fulfill its role as the
lead agency for the sector. The proposed project's emphasis on raising environmental awareness
and the demonstrated capacity of FHIS to manage small-scale investment subprojects, will ensure
sustainability of project activities and benefits beyond the life of the proposed project. Because of
its mandate as a planning, policy-setting, normative and monitoring agency, SEDA will remain
relatively small but will be bolstered by the addition of qualified technical and professional staff.



7
The proposed project will require a modest increase in the oudget of SEDA, from US $300,000 in
1995 to US $392,000 in 2001. Within the context of the budgets for recurrent expenditures of
the agencies involved in the project (SEDA, SECPLAN, Ministry of Natural Resources, Ministry
of Public Health, General Attorney's Office, General Prosecutor's Office) the average incremental
recurrent expenditure of approximately US $200,000 per year can be easily absorbed.
17. Country Specific Lessons Learned from Previous IDA/Bank Involvement. Although
there has been some recent improvement in project implementation, IDA/World Bank projects in
Honduras have often experienced delays and problems because of weak management and
budgetary constraints. Frequent staff tumover in project management and cumbersome
administrative procedures have also hindered project implementation. However, many of these
problems have been avoided in the two IDA operations with FlIS (Credit No. 2212-HO,
February 1991; Credit No. 2401-HO, May 1992). The success of these operations have been
influential in selecting FHIS to be the executing agency for the investment component of the
proposed project. The FHIS success is in large part due to its status as an autonomous agency,
free of government administrative regulations and salary constraints. Addressing the underlying
causes of many of the project implementation problems will require a much ionger time horizon
by means of concerted actions to reform civil service and public sector management and
budgetary practices. These structural issues are being addressed by IDA in the context of the
preparation of a public sector adjustment operation. In terms of the proposed project, several
actions have been and will be taken to avoid project implementation problem: (a) to overcome the
problem of weak management, technical assistance is being provided and institutional
strengthening activities are being financed; (b) to address the problem of budgetary constraints,
the commitment of the GOH has been obtained throughout the project preparation process, the
incremental recurrent expenditu.es have been kept at a minimum, and provisions are being made
for IDA review of annual budgets and operating plans; (c) to minimize staff turnover, the project
is benefiting from the experience of other operations in Honduras and is financing with the credit
the consultants of the PCU; and (d) the problem of cumbersome administrative procedures is
being addressed by selecting FH-S, with its proven track record, to be responsible for the
implementation of close to a third of the project's budget; and by contracting a procurement
agency to assist with the procurement of goods and services.
18. Sector Specific Lessons Learned from Previous IDA/Bank Involvement. IDA/Bank has
financed environmental projects focusing on institutional development in Brazil, Bolivia, Chile,
and Mexico, and others that are currently at different stages of preparation. IDA/Bank staff and
consultants who have worked on preparing and implementing three of those projects have been on
the appraisal team for the proposed project and the project design has incorporated the lessons
that they have learned. The principal lessons learned from the previous IDA/Bank projects are
that a successful environmental project requires, inter alia, strong political commitment; well
defined medium and long term objectives, supported by an established and open planning process;
consistent legal and regulatory framework; closely coordinated actions of the many institutions
whose activities affect the environment and its management; clear undi.rstanding of environmental
issues by key officials, as well as the population at large; and adequate information to manage
environmental and natural resource programs. The GOH has been instrumental in defining the
project's objectives to meet the requirements listed above, and has demonstrated its commitment
to them throughout the project preparation process.



B
19. Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy, as discussed by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit No. 2450-HO on August 5, 1993. It is also consistent
with the Government's adjustment program begun in 1990. Specifically, it will complement the
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (Credit No. 2540-HO), which supports fua'damental
ins.itutional and policy reforms with respect to forestry management, and two operations
currently under preparation, the Natural Resources Management Project and the Basic Education
Project. IDA's role in the proposed project, on the pivotal issues of environmental policy and the
development of the institutional framework in this emerging sector, will help coordinate and
rationalize assistance from bilateral and multilateral agencies.
20. Agreed Actions. During project preparation, agreements were reached regarding the role
that SEDA and key government agencies will play in support of an environmental and land use
planning process, enforcement of environmental legislation, definition of environmental policy,
and coordination of environmental management activities Additionally, agreement was reached
regarding the role of SEDA and sectoral agencies in the development and implementation of the
SINIA and SINEIA, a pilot technical assistance program for selected municipalities on
environmental managemeint, and support to municipalities and communities on for the design and
implementation of environmental investment subprojects through FHIS.
21. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the GOH that: (a) the agreements listed in
the implementation schedule will be signed by the dates indicated therein; (b) the economic
incentives, biodiversity conservation and solid waste management studies will be completed by the
dates indicated in the implementation schedule and that the relevant results will be incorporated in
the Borrower's environmental planning initiatives; (c) the Special Account will establ.shed and
maintained; (d) the project accounts and Special Account will be audited annually by independent
auditors satisfactory to IDA and a copy of the audit report, including a separate opinion on
Statement of Expenditures, will be provided to IDA through SEDA's PCU within six months of
the end of each fiscal year; (e) procurement arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, will be followed;
(f) quarterly progress reports, in a format satisfactory to IDA, will be sent to IDA, through the
PCU, within 30 days of the end of the quarter starting with the third quarter (July-September) of
1995 during the first year; thereafter the progress reports will be sent to IDA semi-annually within
30 days of the end of the semester starting with the second semester (July-December) of 1996; (g)
an operating plan and budget for the succeeding year will be submitted by each November 30
(including November 30, 1995) throughout the project implementation period; the annual
operating plan and budget will be submitted to IDA for review and approval; joint GOH-IDA
annual supervision reviews will be held no later than March 31 of each project year beginning in
1996; and a project mid-term review will be carried out no later than September 30, 1998; and (h)
the PCU will be maintained adequatel. staffed and equipped during the life of the project; and
adequate space to accommodate the incremental personnel, consultants and equipment will be
provided by all the participating agencies.
22. Conditions of Disbursement. The following are conditions of disbursement: (a) for legal
training activities, a signed agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between the GOH and the Judicial
School of the Supreme Court (Escuela Judicial de la Corte Suprerna de Justicia); (b) for any FHIS-
implemented activities, a signed agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between the GOH and FIIS
regarding the implementation of the Environmental Investments Subcomponent, including the



9
environmental assessment criteria that will be used to select and evaluate the subprojects and the
role of SEDA in subproject approval and monitoring; (c) for municipal and community
environmental investment subproject categories financed through FHIS, the relevant pre-
investment studies, satisfactory to IDA; and (d) for the small and micro-enterprise line of credit
managed by FHIS, the relevant pre-investment studies, satisfactory to IDA.
23. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness. Conditions of effectiveness are: (a) the operating plan
and budget for the first six months of the project (July - December 1995) submitted to IDA; and
(b) a formal letter of commitment from the GOH to provide counterpart funding and to make the
required annual budget allocations for the project.
24. Poverty Category. This project is not in the Program of Targeted Interventions.
However, it addresses the issue of poverty by targeting communities to receive environmental
services which are essential to the improvement of the quality of life of the poorest sectors of the
population. It also seeks to improve environmental management, thus increasing the sustainability
of pruductive activities of the rural population.
25. Environmental Aspects. The proposed project has the Environmental Classification of
"B". Investment subprojects that will be financed through FHIS will be screencd for
environmental impacts following the procedures established by SINEIA. By strengthening sector
institutions, raising the awareness of environmental issues in both the Government and local
governments and communities, and helping to halt environrnental degradation through training,
technical assistance and direct environmental investments, the proposed project will have a
beneficial impact on the environment and the population's health status.
26.  Program Objective Categories. This project is formally designated in the Program
Objective Category "Environmentally Sustainable Development" because it directly addresses the
need to develop a consistent framework for environmental policy development and planning, for
the consolidation of an environmental impact assessment system, and for the implementation of
investments at the municipal and community level. Additionally, tin's project is relevant to other
Program Objective Categories because it will contribute to the improvement of the quality of life
of the poor in the selected municipalities as a result of the environmental investment subprojects
financed; because it will provide women of the pilot municipalities with relevant environmental
training and technical assistance; and because the private sector, as represented by small and
micro-enterprises, will have access to the line of credit managed by FEIS that will enable it to
take advantage of the emerging business opportunities for environmental management.
27. Participatory Approach. One of the key objectives of this project is to open the policy
and planning pmcess to participation by all sectors of society. This includes groups ranging from
the largest companies, to NGOs and the smallest communities. The municipal technical assistance
activities will, particularly, enhance the role that the latter will play by providing opportunities for
training and the identification of environmental priorities at the community level. Likewise the
process of developing the SINEIA and the technical procedures for the preparation of
environmental impact assessments and audits also seeks to create favorable conditions for training
and participation of public and private orgaliizations and society in general.

28.  Project Benefits. Sustainable economic growth in Honduras depends on halting the spread
of environmental degradation and on the sound management of the country's natural resources.
The proposed project will help Honduras meet its environmental challenges by developing the
institutional framework required for successful environmental management and carrying out
needed investments at the local level. The following important issues will be addressed in
establishing a rational system of environmental management: (a) weak institutional capacity to set
national policies, strategies, and plans; (b) inadequate coordination between agencies having
environmental responsibilities; (c) conflicting laws and regulations; (d) inadequate environmental
norms and technical standards; (e) inadequately trained technical staff in institutions with
environmental responsibilities; (f) a lack of public awareness and involvement in environmental
matters; and (g) limited involvement of municipalities and communities in environmental
management matters. In addressing these issues, the project provides an institutional framework
for the Government to address its environmental problems and for IDA and other external
financing agencies to finance projects in support of these efforts.
29. Risks. The project has four principal risks. First, is the possible resistance to SEDA's role
in the sector. SEDA is a new institution and may experience resistance from older, larger, and
more powerfWl public sector institutions to its lead role in the sector. Second, are difficulties that
may be encountered by the project's complexity. Although project preparation work was directed
at keeping the project as simple as possible, the nature of environmental projects that cut across
many sectoral activities, and the nature of institutional development projects that call for the
development of many capacities, have made some project complexity inevitable. Third, is the
problem of human resources. Although a major objective of the project is the development of
human resources capacity, systemic problems in the public sector make the recruitment and
retention of qualified persons to work in the civil service difficult. Fourth, is the risk of receiving
timely and adequate counterpart financial support. These risks have been reduced in the following
manner: (a) key sectoral ministries have been incorporated in project design and implementation;
(b) the role of each of the participating agencies has been clearly defined and the coordination of
their actions will be under the responsibility of a well qualified and equipped PCU operating from
the early stages of project preparation; (c) ample opportunities for training and professional
development of public sector staff will help attract and retain qualified personnel; and (d) the
project has been designed so that the incremental counterpart funding requirements are modest
and specific Government commitment on this poin: has been obtained.
30. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
