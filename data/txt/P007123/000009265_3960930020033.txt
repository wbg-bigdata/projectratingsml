MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THU
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN ONF US$104 MILLION
TO THE R$PUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT AND URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.             The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Ecuador for US$104 million equivalent is submitted for approval.  The
proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, with 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable rate, and help finance a Municipal Development and Urban
Infrastructure Project.  The project would be cofinanced by IDB for US$104 million
equivalent and GTZ for US$4 million equivalent.
2.             Dackqround.  Ecuador's urban population more than doubled between 1962
and 1982 to 4 million, and by 1987, 55% of Ecuador's 9.9 million inhabitants lived in
urban areas. Urban agglomerations in the 100,000 to 200,000 range grew most rapidly,
with their participation in the total urban population rising from 4% in 1974 to 19%
in 1987.  The population of the two largest cities, Quito and Guayaquil, more than
doubled between 1974 and 1989 to 1.2 million and 1.7 million inhabitants,
respectively.     This  explosive  urban  growth  has  outstripped  the  ability  of
municipalities to keep pace with the overwhelming increase in demand for services and
infrastructure.   For example,  69% of the total urban population had access to
drinking water in their houses in 1987, down from 75% in 1982; and only 53% had
access to adequate sewage facilities in 1987, down from 62% in 1982.   These unmet
infrastructure needs are significantly higher outside of Quito and Guayaquil.   For
example, the percentage of families without potable drinking water was over twice as
high in municipalities with 25,000 to 50,000 inhabitants than in Quito and Guayaquil.
These  infrastructure  shortages  represents  (a)  a  serious  constraint  on  the
productivity of Ecuador's increasingly important urban economy (representing 70% of
GDP), and hence its ability to sustain and increase the incomes of urban workers; (b)
an additional burden on the poor, who are most likely to suffer from lack of these
services; and (c) environmental degradation, because sewage and solid waste are not
being disposed of properly due to lack of necessary infrastructure or failure to
design new systems properly and to operate existing systems adequately.
3.             Before recent reforms, legal, institutional, and financial constraints
inhibited  municipalities  from  meeting  the  demands  for  urban  services  and
infrastructure for which they are legally responsible.  In    December    1988,    the
Government of Ecuador reguested assistance from the Bank and IDB for a project to
remove these constraints.   Early in project identification, IDB, GTZ and the Bazj,
agreed to cooperate in project preparation and to provide cofinancing. The ensuia.
dialogue with the Government resulted in an agreement for a two-stage strategy,
involving the design of a program of significant institutional reforms followed by a
project building on these measures. A far-reaching reform program was then designed
in cooperation with the Bank/IDB/GT2 and partially financed by a Project Preparation
Facility. The Government incorporated these reforms in a policy letter to the Bank
that addressed three main problem areass    (a) general institutional and  legal
constraints  to  municipal  development;   (b)  the  system  of  intergovernmental
national/local transfers; and (c) lending to local governments.



4.             The Local Government Development Law  (LGDL)  of May  1990 embodied
significant reforms for all three of these areas. This law significantly reduced the
general constraints to municipal development bys allowing full cost recovery for
sewer and water systems; prohibiting deficit financing of municipal payrolls; and
establishing a committee to coordinate the actions of the Central Government agencies
working with municipalities.    Most  importantly,  the LGDL  revised the  national
local/transfer system.  This system had previously rewarded fiscal irresponsibility
and expenditure inefficiency by giving discretionary grants to municipalities in
direct proportion to their fiscal deficits. Furthermore, the system was inequitable
in that municipalities with high fiscal capacity often received higher per capita
grants than those with low capacity.  The aew transfer system is formula-driven.  Of
the amount going to municipalities, 60% goes to automatic revenue sharing to
municipalities based on population, poverty and fiscal effort criteria (weighted 60%,
30% and 10%, respectively); and 40% goes to the I4unicipal Investment Fund (MIF)
established to serve as a reliable source of counterpart funding for municipal
projects, to be administered by the Development Bank of Ecuador (BEDE). To become a
more effective lender and provider of technical assistance to local governments, BEDE
has agreed to abandon its policy of fixed interest rates and raise its rates to
market  levels  by  June  1992  (para.  9)  and  has  reorganized  completely  its
administrative structure to improve project evaluation and general operational
efficiency. The project will build on all of these initiatives to strengthen further
the municip-l capacity to provide urban services and infrastructure in an efficient,
equitable and fiscally responsible manner.
5.             Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.    The  Bank's  strategy  for  fully
exploiting Ecuador's productive potential and alleviating pervasive poverty includes
medium-term policies to redefine the role of the public  sector.   Within this
strategy, the local public sector should:   (a) rely less on subsidies from the
Central Government and more on its own revenues; and (b) increase expenditure
efficiency.   The rationale for the Bank's involvement to date has been to help
develop the overall macroeconomic strategy in which these individual local government
reforms (e.g., intergovernmental transfer system, cost recovery, and interest rate
policy) are integral parts.   The Bank's continued involvement through the proposed
project will help the Government to implement this strategy to maximize benefits at
both the national and local levels.   Furthermore,  the Bank can facilitate the
mobilization of cofinancing when appropriate and strengthen institutions through the
introduction of new technologies in such areas as budgeting, information systems, and
environmental assessment.
6.             Project  btjectives.    The  project's  main  objectives  are  to:  (a)
increase the fiscal autonomy of municipal governments; and (b) to strengthen their
capacity  to deliver  services  efficiently  and equitably.    This will  contribute
directly to the attainment of the Government's macroeconomic goals of reducing the
public  sector  deficit  and  ircreasing  sector  efficiency  and  equity.    Specific
objectives  are  to:    (a)  make  the  national/local  revenue-sharing  system  more
transparent, equitable, predictable, and effective in mobilizing local revenue; (b)
reduce  discretionary   fiscal  transfers  to  municipal  governments;   (c)  help
municipalities generate current account surpluses by increasing own-source revenues
and by reducing expenditures; (d) increase municipal capacity to plan and execute



- 3 -
efficient, equitable, and environmentally sound projects, as well as to maintain
existing physical assets; Ce) improve targeting of benefits to the lower-income
population; (f) strengthen BEDE as a reliable source of financing and technical
assistance  for  municipal  governments;  and  (g)  enhance  training  of  municipal
employees.
7.             Proiect Description.   The proposed project would finance two main
components: (a)   Institutional Development and Trainino (US$27.0 million or 9% of
*    total  project  cost),  including  institutional  development  for  both  BIDE  and
municipalities and training of employees and instructors of municipalities and
national municipal support institutions; and (b) Infrastructure (US$273.0 million or
91% of total project cost) encompassing (i) physical investments in construction and
rehabilitation of public infrastructure (e.g., water, sewerage, storm drainage, solid
waste collection and disposal, and roads), (ii) community facilities (e.g., markets,
parks, and slaughterhouses), an well as procurement of materials, equipment, and
vehicles for maintenance or the provision of public services, and (iii) feasibility
and engineering studies, supervision, and auditing needed to prepare, carry out and
monitor the above investments. All municipalities and municipal and regional utility
enterprises (hereafter, municipal enterprises) potentially would be eligible to
participate in the project, provided that they meet project eligibility criteria.
Although all municipalities and municipal enterprises would be eligible for the
Institutional Development and Training component, only those meeting the financial
and institutional eligibility criteria would be able to borrow for infrastructure.
This is to ensure that they have the capacity to operate and maintain the
infrastructure and the ability to meet debt service requirements.   in addition to
these requirements for municipal governments in general, there are specific
requirements for municipal and regional enterprises.
8.             Project implementation manuals define criteria for subborrower and
subproject  eligibility.    To participate  in  the  Infrastructure  Component, each
municipality must present an institutional and financial action plan (IFAP) showing
how it will raise revenues and increase expenditure efficiency for both current and
capital expenditures, as well as improve management for project implementation. Only
municipalities and municipal enterprises with balanced current accounts and adequate
debt capacity will be eligible to participate in the Infrastructure Component. To
incorporate the recommendations of the Bank's sector study on urban water and
sewerage, municipalities or municipal enterprises wishing to invest in these systems
must: (a) have a sufficiently autonomous entity for project implementation, and (b)
*    must develop a financial and institutional development plan to assure full cost
recovery and management efficiency.
9.             The borrower would be the Republic of Ecuador, which would onlend the
proceeds of the loan to BEDE with the Government assuming the dollar-to-sucre
exchange and cross-currency risks. The exception would be the portion allocated to
finance institutional development and training expenditures, which would be
transferred to BEDE as a grant, and also transferred to subborrowers as grants. The
interest rate charged to BIDE would be variable based on its onlending rate to
subborrowers minus a spread to cover operating costs.   The spread would be set
initially at four percentage points, which could be adjusted, subject to Bank



approval, to assure that operating costs are covered. BEDE's onlending rate to its
borrowers would be variable and set in accord with the understanding reached between
the Bank and the Government (letter of the Junta Monetaria, December 13, 1989).  In
accordance with this understanding, this rate, currently at 39%, would be adjusted
biannually so as to reach the commercial bank lending rate by June 30, 1992, or
considerably earlier if nominal interest rates decline. Municipal repayment of loans
would be quaranteed by municipality's revenue-sharing receipts.
10.            Tota' project cost is estimated at US$300 million equivalent.   The
total foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$97 million, or 32.3% of the total
cost. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group Operations in Ecuador are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report no. 9082-EC dated October 22, 1990 is also
attached.
11.            Agreed Actions.   During negotiations,  assurances were obtained as
follows:   (a) From the Central Government that it will: (i) maintain institutional
reforms adopted during project preparation; (ii) agree that BEDE would retain up to
25% of the amount borrowed from the Government as an equity contribution, subject to
review, which could increase the percentage repayment from BIDE to the Government
(see (b)(v)); (iii) establish a Steering Committee to advise on coordination,
implementation, evaluation, and financing of the training programs within three
months after loan effectiveness; (iv) agree that the Procuraduria General del Estado
and Contraloria General de la Kacion will review the basic model bidding documents
for civil works, goods, and services  for the Project, but not  for  individual
subprojects;  and  (v) annually  review with the Bank performance  in meeting the
objectives of the policy letter; and (b) From BEDE that it will:  (i) raise interest
rates to market levels for all new BEDE loans in accord with the interest rate
understanding between the Government and the Bank; (ii) adhere to the Project
Implementation Manuals; (iii) engage a person satisfactory to the Bank to serve as
Project Coordinator, a department management-level position subordinated to the Board
of Directors, who would control employment status of high-level project staff; (iv)
meet agreed financial targets; (v) commission a study acceptable to the Bank to
determine "adequate" level of capitalization for BEDE, revise the estimates of the
total amount of capital transfers to BEDE under current and pending legislation, and
recommend appropriate actions to correct any imbalances;   (vi) present an annual
financial management plan acceptable to the Bank; (vii) submit all projects costing
more than established limits to the Bank for prior approval (US$4 million for sewer
and water projects and US$1 million other investment projects); (viii) produce a
model career development plan acceptable to the Bank for ensuring greater employment
stability for municipal civil servants within six months of loan effectiveness and
require that it be adopted by municipalities; (ix) allocate first-year transfers from
the Municipal Investment Fund as agreed and provide the allocation methodology for
the following years within 10 months after effectiveness; and (x) annually review
with the Bank:  borrowing capacity and creditworthiness of subborrowers, compliance
with the loan agreement, financial performance, the annual   financial management
plan,  allocation  of  grants  and  subloans,  achievement  of  Bank's  percentage
participation   in  project  cost,   cost-recovery  performance,  compliance  with
environmental provisions, and implementation of the institutional development and
training component.



12.            Conditions of loan effectiveness specify thatt (a) the loan agreement
between the Government and IDB be signed; (b)  the BEDE Projsct Committee be fully
operationall (a) project implementation manuals be issued; (d) terms of reference for
the model career development plan be prepared; (e) operational procedures for
automatic revenue sharing would be established; (f) staffing procedures defined in
para. 11 (b)(iii) be accepted; and (g) the subsidiary agreements be signed between
the Government and BEDE, as well as between BIDS and other participating entities.
13.            Benefits. Benefits includes   (a) financial, by institutional reforms
of the national transfer and credit systems to provide incentives for municipalities
to increase own-source local revenues as well as expenditure efficiency; (b)
institutional, by strengthening the capabilities of BEDE, the municipalities, local
utility enterprises, as well as other municipal support institutions at the national
level; (c) economic, by providing an average economic rate of return of 31% on a
sample of subprojects representing 12% of total project costs; (d) environmental, by
introducing the screening of subprojects with p-tential for negative environmental
impact at the municipal level; and (e) social, through lifeline rates for basic urban
services and long-term financing, making cost recovery affordable to low-income
families. A distributive analysis indicates that at least 80% of the benefits would
be received by low-income groups.
14.            Risks. The main risks are lack of initial interest on the part of
municipalities for doing the fiscal reform required and the continuity in political
commitment to the project during its implementation.   The project has a built-in
mechanism to manage these  risks  in that  it allocates  the  resources  based  on
performance:  those municipalities that are eligible earlier and perform better would
receive more resources.   The incentives built into the reformed transfer system
should  also  stimulate  the  transfer  of  innovations  from  the  lees  successful
municipalities to the more successful ones. In addition to these general risks, there
is the possibility of inefficient project management by BEDE and municipalities.
This risk has been diminished through technical assistance and training during
project preparation, as well as the institutional development requirements in the
eligibility criteria.   There is also the risk of lack of continuity in project
management by municipalities due to staff turnover.   This would be reduced by
technical assistance in the preparation of legislation to grant civil service status
to municipal employees. Finally, reforms already implemented might be abandoned.
While real, this risk has been reduced through their embodiment of the reforms in
legislation as well as by specific related loan conditions.
15.            Recomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would compl
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directo;
approve the proposed loan.
