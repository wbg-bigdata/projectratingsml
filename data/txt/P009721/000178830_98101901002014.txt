PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
INDIA - BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1473-IN)
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a performance audit of a Bank
loan to finance part of the cost of Phase III of the development of the Bombay
High and North Bassein (subsequently eliminated) offshore fields. The loan
was made to the Government and onlent to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission
(ONGC), a Government-owned entity.  The loan, in the amount of US$150 million,
was approved in June 1977 and fully disbursed in December 1980, on schedule.
The proceeds financed the cost of laying oil and gas pipelines and equipment
and installation of one processing and two well platforms. The project, with
some modifications in scope, was completed with a two-year delay (mostly for
valid reasons), but with a small saving in capital costs. Full production
level (140,000 BPD of crude oil and 2.1 million m3 of natural gas per day)
was reached in March 1981.
The report consists of the Highlights prepared by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) and a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared
by the Bank's Energy Department. Following its abbreviated procedure, OED
has reviewed the Appraisal and President's Reports, the loan documents,
the summary of the Board discussions and the PCR, and had discussions with
Bank staff. On the basis of this limited review, OED in general finds no
reason to disagree with the conclusions of the PCR. Comments received from
the Borrower have been taken into account in finalizing the report and are
reproduced as Attachments A and B to the audit memorandum.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
INDIA - BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1473-IN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The loan under review in the amount of US$150 million was to finance
part of the cost of Phase III of the development of the Bombay High and North
Bassein fields.  A second Bank loan (Loan 1925-IN) toward Phases IV and V in
the amount of US$400 million was approved in 1980. The Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC), a Government-owned entity, was the beneficiary and imple-
menting agency.
2.        The objective of Phase III was to reach a production rate of 140,000
barrels per day (BPD) by the end of 1978-79, and involved development dril-
ling, building of offshore processing platforms, laying of subsea pipelines,
and construction of onshore terminal facilities and a supply base (PCR, paras.
2.04 and 3.04).  The Bank considered that the institutional strengthening of
ONGC, and in particular of its offshore expertise which at that time was
almost non-existent, was also an important objective of the project (PCR,
para. 6.02).  Furthermore, the Bank viewed the project as offering an oppor-
tunity to mobilize external financial resources through commercial borrowing
(PCR, para. 2.02).
3.        The project was successfully implemented and the objectives largely
met.   ONGC achieved on schedule its first target which was to install the
crude oil and natural gas pipelines and to complete the minimum offshore and
onshore facilities required to transport oil and gas to Bombay before the
onset of the 1978 monsoon season, i.e. by mid-1978, thereby avoiding the
interruption of oil production (80,000 BPD) during the monsoons and making
possible the utilization of natural gas (1.2 million m3 per day) previously
flared.
4.        The second physical target, namely the installation of the remaining
project components to achieve a crude oil production level of 140,000 BPD and
2.1 million m3 per day of natural gas, was realized in 1981 with a delay of
two years. A major reason for the delay was the need to revise the program in
midstream, following the findings (in 1978) of studies undertaken to reassess
the available  reserves1'.   This  required to defer the development of the
North Bassein field, which was to be developed in conjunction with Bombay
1/   The studies confirmed ONGC's original estimates that put the reserves
of the North Bassein field at roughly half the level that had been
originally estimated by an independent consultant commissioned by the
Bank (a normal requirement by commercial lenders for petroleum projects),
proving that ONGC's initial evaluation was correct.



High, and to extend in its place the development of Bombay High into the
southern portion of the field (PCR, paras. 2.02, 2.03, 3.01 to 3.04).  Other
reasons refer to extensive modifications in the design of the main processing
platform, further design and engineering changes in other components of the
project, late deliveries of critical equipment and materials, accidents in
offshore construction work, delays in onshore work due to problems with land
acquisition, delivery of equipment, labor disputes and power shortages, and
problems in the organization and management of a foreign contractor (PCR,
paras. 3.06 to 3.11, 6.03).   Many of the causes for the delay were beyond
ONGC's control, while the rather tight schedule and the inherent difficulties
in planning construction activities around an 8-month window between monsoons
should be appreciated.   Despite these obstacles,  the project was completed
with a saving of US$ 3 million in capital costs, largely through increased
productivity in drilling (PCR, paras. 3.13 and 3.14).
5.        Institution  building  objectives  were  also  essentially  achieved.
While ONGC agreed during project preparation to hire consultants to assist in
the establishment of appropriate management procedures, significant delays
were incurred in finalizing TOR and selecting the firm.  ONGC's organization
was growing rapidly and staff did not accord this activity a high priority at
a time when other matters were pressing.   In the initial stages, therefore,
ONGC's staff appears to have offered less than full cooperation to the con-
sultants, a problem which was subsequently resolved.  While the consultant's
report was never fully discussed with the Bank, a number of recommendations
were used by ONGC to strengthen particular facets of its institutional
structure and capacity (e.g., improvement of the accounting system, more
extensive use of computer facilities, design of management information
systems), and consultants did provide ONGC's management with valuable inputs
(PCR, paras.  6.02,  6.04 to 6.06,  6.10,  9.05).   At the time of appraisal,
neither the Bank nor ONGC had a clear concept of the type of assistance which
was required to handle a project of that size and complexity, and the Bank was
unable to convince ONGC that an association with qualified project management
consultants would have been useful in overcoming problems related with the
rapid growth of the offshore activities.
6.        Although considerable efforts were devoted to convince GOI that it
could mobilize commercial finances for offshore development, commercial bor-
rowing for the project was initially limited.  Discounts in the open market
providing substantial savings not feasible under the terms of suppliers'
credits and the relatively high level of foreign exchange reserves were major
factors that influenced ONGC's and the Government's hesitation to borrow com-
mercially.   To that extent, the Bank's catalyst role was limited.  However,
the Bank's Appraisal Report was used to mobilize US$50 million from commercial
sources -- India's first commercial borrowing -- and in the following phases,
when commercial borrowing became necessary,   ONGC established itself as a
reliable borrower as evidenced by the US$200 million borrowed on the Euro-
dollar market in FY81 and US$185 million from various commercial sources in
FY82.   At present,  ONGC is considering regular borrowings  from commercial
sources to finance part of its investment program.



- vi -
7.        ONGC has evolved into a strong entity and its technical performance
has been commendable (PCR, paras. 4.01 to 4.04). Profitability has been lower
than forecast at appraisal due to, inter alia, lower production following the
delay in project completion and the inadequacy of price recovery for crude oil
and gas (PCR, paras. 7.01 to 7.05). However, in 1981 the Government increased
oil prices substantially, from US$5/barrel to US$18.3/barrel, and evolved a
principle for pricing of offshore gas, which currently results in an average
of US$5.26 per MCF; this should improve ONGC's future profitability and
internal cash generation to support investment programs. Recalculated economic
and financial rates of return are satisfactory.   In addition,  the project
facilitated the transfer of technology with respect to sophisticated oil and
gas  installations,  including  the engineering and  construction of offshore
structures. From the sectoral perspective, several studies have been carried
out by various agencies and committees on India's future energy balances. The
1979 report of the Working Group on Energy Policy, which is the most compre-
hensive, assessed the impact of the commercial energy availability on economic
development, as well as the likely impact of an active energy conservation
program on India's future energy balances, and recommended constructive policy
measures.
8.        In analyzing the project experience, the PCR (paras. 9.02 to 9.06,
9.09 and 9.10) stresses the expediency of appraising offshore projects at
a relatively late stage of the project cycle in order to increase the re-
liability of cost estimates; the provision for relatively high physical
contingencies; the importance of convincing the implementing agency on the
benefits to accrue from technical assistance and of securing their full
support before consultants are engaged; and the significance of making Bank
loans directly to the beneficiary instead of through the Government.   The
advisability of appointing project managers for each major construction
activity covering all its phases and aspects of implementation and involving
both contractual and technical matters (PCR, paras. 6.08 and 6.09) is another
interesting lesson in project management.

Ooiuats by GOl on the Draft Project Performance Audit
Report (P?g) ox Fi-rt Bombay High Off inhore Developmext
Project - Isoau No.1473-IN received ride letter dated June 19,
1982, from Mr. Shiv S. Kapoor, Director, Operatioxe
maluati on Department, World Bank.
1-    Paragraph 1 of the preface states that the project,
with some modificatio   in scope, was completed with a
,tvo Year del@*  Though the reasons for the delays whLich
have mple justification, have been sufficiently explained
Incorporated  subsequently in paragraphs 3.06 tlrough paragraph 3.11 of
in Preface    the oompletion report, it would be appropriate to indicLte
in the prefaoe as well that the delay was not 'Vithout
sufficient and justifiable reasons so as to avoid a wrorg
impression being created in the mind of the reader. We
would suggest that the words " for valid reasons t' be
inserted after the words " was completed with two year.
delay " appearing in the ninth line of the preface.
Alternatively, the words" for reasons explained subeequently
in Paragraph 3.06 through paragraph 3.11 Of the oompletion
report " might be inserted after the words " was completed
with a two year delay " in line nine of ihe preface.
Incorporated  2.    Under the heading " ote         ttW      , which
in Basic     forms part of the Project Performance Audit basic data
Data Sheet    sheet, it has been indiLcated that the actual of re-estimated
datet when all physical components willbe completed is
April, 1983. The fact is that the only item left to be
completed is the Nhava S}aeva supply base which, in terms
of ot'iginal estimates works out to less than 3 per cent of
the total project. This needs to be indicated clearly in
order to appreciite better the extent to whidh the project
has been completed.
Incorporated  3.    Under the section on "Highlights" in line two of
in Highlight  paragraph 2 thewords " by the end of 1978 "t should
2    s read as " by the end of 1978-79" so as to ensure
para.        correctness of the facts.
4.    We do not agree with the statement made in Paragraph 5
Incorporated   of the Highlights that ONGC offered JAss than full cooperation
in Highlights  and that it recruited consultaits merely to satisfy the Bank.
para. 5      TEe fact is that ONGC was,and is,perfectly amenable to the
obtaining of oonsultant's a*vice for improvements wherever
necessary. In the instant case, the consultancy firm of M/s
Price Water House was aPpointed to review the accounting
*       system which it found to be as adequate and upto international
standards. The firm aJso found the software for the pay roll
and mateia. accounting which had been computerised as satisfac-
tory. Consultants were also informed that ONGC was in the
process of devising software in order to computerise its
entire accounting functions. To suggest therefore that Bankts
efforts and insistence on the need for ONGC to retain consul-
tants were misconstrued would not oe correct and is more in

the nature of subjective opinion which inLdocument like PPAR
should' be avoided.
Incorpo-  5.     In paragraph 6 of the highlights it has been stated that the
rtd i Bank's Executive Directors expressed concern on the limited extent
rated ln  to ihich ONGO resorted to external commercial borrowing.  We do
Highliphts6not share the concern expressed in the Bank since the reasons
para. 6   indicated subsequently in paragraph 6 for ONGC resorting to externa.L
commercial borrowings in limited manner were most valid reasons,
The fact that there existed a relatively high level of fore gn
exchange resources ana that discounts in the open market provided
substantiaL savings not feasbible under the terms of supplierbp
thaSi*txxa credits were sound reasons for not allowing ONGC to
have recourse to unrestricted external commercial borrowing.
Subsequently, however, on the basis of needs, increased sock
coi.mercial borrowings were resorted to as would be evident from
the following:-
1980-81
Buro doklar Loan from
lanufactures Hanover                   US$ 200
-    Trust(Leader)
1981-82

Morgangrenfell, Singapore               U58  30 .<'iION
(ii)Buyer's credit from
BUICS, SingapOore                      US$ 42.10 MILLION
(iii)Supplier's credit from                  Yen 1o5354 BILLION
JaPaa
(iv) EXIM Bank,U.S.                        US$ 23-37 MILLION
(v)Buyer's credit from                     DX  50 EITLLION
10?W, Germany
In respect of ONGC's Bank assisted Project, cofinancing
from the OP:2C fund are not inbluded in the above statement.  It
would therefore be evident that GOI and ONGC have resorted to
external commercial borrowfings whenever such borrowing were
considered necessary.  The draft PPARi may therefore please be
eL    anaended accordingly in keeping withLfactugl position indrcated
above.
Further, it has been stated in line 6 of paragra-ph 6 of
the Highlights that total borrowing had been of the order of
US dollaxs 3.4 aillion equivalent.  Actually, total oorrowing during
1977 through 1980 were Rs.3,387 Billion.  Similarly, line i
7 of the same paragraph spoeaks of a dollar 15 miLfLon loon.i
fron the OPEC fund(.  The loan was in fact for dollars 14 mi1liono

Reflec- 7*    Again, in paragraph 1.04 of the completion report, it has been
ted in  stated that a production level of 240,000 BPD was to be achieved by
PCR, para.mid 1982 * In fact, this level was to have been achieved by March
1.04 foot1982 and was actually achieved on February 11, 1981.
note 2/
8.    The report of the reservoir oonsultant as indicated in
paragraph 2.03 of the completion report is not susceptible of
verification. In terms of the report cf begolyer and Mc Naughton
for 1977,the fiel containud 800 million metric tonnes of Oil of
wLich the amount recoverable was 167 milIion metric tonnes.
Incorpo- 9.    It has been stated in paragraph 2.04(c) that two 209 Km
rated in sub sea lines 30 inches and 26 inches in diameter were to be
PCR,  . part.of the project,. Actually, length of the oil line 30 inches
para.2.04in deameter, is 203.07 Kmo Similarly, the length of the gas
line 26 inches in deameter is 202.34 Km.
10.    In so far as Para 3.06 of the completion report is
Reflec- concerned, it would be factu'al to say that the phase-III(b)portion
ted in  comprising 3A,SB and BHN was delayed. There was delay in construc-
PCR,    tion activity on account of internaL problems in the contractor's
Para.3.06organisation.  However, as far as  ONGC was concerned it made
efforts to properly plan the implementation of the project. Delays,
nevertheless, "ccured as a result of several constraints chiefly
relating to modifications required in the platform and the fact
that the implementation schedule  had little; slack for time.
I1.    As the Bank are# aware, the BIN Platform was planned
Reflec- to be erected at a distance of about 150 feet fronL the "F" platform.
ted in  On account# of delays in obtaining soil data for the BHN platform,
PCR,    0NTGC made use of soil data available for the F Platform.  This
para.3.07data normally should not have varied since there was extreaely
close proximity between the two platforms. Subsequently, when
actual soil coring was dor at the BHN platform ONGC discovered
variation in the soil data which necessitated structural modification
changes as well as additional piles on the 3HN platform9  This led to
some delay and the contractor was given some change orders.
ONGC made arrangements for soil coring for the BHN location
to be done earlier but the contractor to whbm this job was
assisgned did not mobilise his spread and demanded additional
compensation which was notdue to him. Hence soil coring work
was retendered and by the time it was commenced on the BI-f
location, BII platform contract hat aLready been awarded to the
contractor.
12.   In so far  as paragra-)h 3,08 of the completion report is
Reflec- concerned, it snoula be noted that the BHN project was awardedo 4L
ted in  turn key kzix basis where the oasic design data had been furnished
PCR,    by Oi`GO and its consultant EIu.  The turn key contractor was
para.3.08required to ca7ry out detliled engineering based on the designs
to be furnished oy SNGO,  All other data made available Dy ONGC
was only indicative and the contractor was required to aevelop
further d.etai±s ducring the course of detailed engineering.  ONGO
did not incend, eith-er  explicitly or implicitly, to Sup4ly all,
L    specifications and drawings toLcontractoro  It would, therefor.,
not oe correct to say that ONGC's requirement should have been spelt
out in the specifications and drawings and not modified suosequen-
tly.

13.     It is a *act that the late deliveries of critical
Reflec-  equipment and m'aterial ordered by the contractor led  to some
ted in   delays in project completion.  There were problems also with
PCR,     regard to inter facing between ONGC supPlied equiPment and*
para. 3.1lthat supplied by the marine contractor on account of incorrect
foot-    interpretation.  These also resulted in sons delays. Nevertheless
note 1/  ONGC's consultant,,EI2, has stated that the total e'ffect on the
project completion date due to the various delays mentio*ed
in paragraph 3.06 through 3911 is not more than 55 days.
Incorpo- 14.     It was the 34 deck and not the BHN deck as-indicated in
rated in paragraPh 3.09, which had to undergo certain repaird duri4g
PCR,    installation.  The puncturing of the sub  sea pipeline was
para. 3.O9probably by an anchor from the contractor's barge and not by an
anchor from the supply boat as indicated in paragraph 3.09.
I-nco _15.      AccoltLng to paragraph 3.15, dollars 68.75 million and
rtcorpo  dollars 81 .25 million were actually disbursed against project
rated in compbnents indicated in this paragraph at (a)  and (b) respecti-
PCRa .15vely   However ONGC made payment and filed reimbursement claims
para315 to the extent of dollars 68,65 million and 81.35 mllion for
the project components (a) utnd (b) respectively. As opposed
to the figures of actual cumulati-'e disbursedent indicated in
paragraph 3.s6,  cumulative payments made by ONGC were as
f oll ows: -
1977-78                          $ 54.35 million
1978-79                          $ 68.65 million
1979-80                          S106.17 million
1980-81                          $150million
Reflec- 16. no Contractor's performance has been commented upon in
ted in  paragraphs 3.18 and 3.19.  The problems in the internal
PCR,    organisation of the ccntractor and the delays whidh it
para.3.l8resulted in are well recognised and OiGC cannot be asked to
foot-   undertake responsibility on this account.  We do, however,
note 1/ agree that some delay was caused on account of the dif-I-erence in
the soil data obtained as well as other reasons indicated in
paragraph 3.08.  Nevertheles3, the major share of res?onsibility
for delay rests with the contractor who underestimated the
magnitude of the work invQlved and did not put in adequate
efforts to ensure timely project completion. The claims of the
contractor in relation to the BHN, SA and SB platforms are
undrer negotiation*,
Incorpo- 17.    The table indicated in paragraph 5.01 should be taken

Reflected          18,    The assumptions made for purposes of economic evaluation
in PCR,          at appraisal and at current values as given in paragraph 5.02 are
para. 5.)2         not susceptible of verification since we are not aware of the
footnote l/        prices that have been adopted as the basis.
19.    It has been stated in paragraph 6.02 that until 1974
Incorporated
PCR,               virtually all of ONGCts activities were concentrated onshore
para. 6.02          In order to appreciate better ONTGC' B offshore activity it would be
relevant to note that seismic surveys were undertaken for the
first time for the Bombay High area in December, 1966 and for the
second time in February 1972.  Additionally, the first well in
the Bombay offshore area(Tarapur Structure) was spoudded on I
October 11, 1973. It would therefore be apprOpriate to 3ubstitute
" 1973" in place of "1974" in line 1 of paragraph 6.02.
20.    It has been indicated in paragraph 6.03 that the decision L
L          suffered since the post of Member(Offshore) incharge of the
Reflected in       Bombbay Offshore project lay vacant for more than a year.  In
PCR,                this context, it is pertinait to note, that Bombay Off shore
para. 6.03          workLlooked after directly by the Chairman ONGC as an additiona-L
assignment and matters relating to the pvoject were referred
to him not only in his capacity as Chairman but also in his
capacity as Member(Offshore). There were,therefore, no gaps in
decision making.
Reflected           21.    In the context of a statement made ih paragraph 7.05 th ,t
in PCR,            Government has indicated that prices zor ONGC's Oil and gas would
ara PC' 5          'be revised durirg FY 1982y it should be noted that the prices
para. *.05          of crude produced and sold by ONGO was raised to Rs.1182 per
metric tonne ex-well head as against onshore and offshore prtcea
ranging from Rs.300 to Rs.450 per tonne. This price revision
was ef, ective from July 11,1981.
22.    Contrary to what has been stated in paragraph 9.07,
Incorpo-            the oorrowing fom OPEC Fund was to the extent of $ 14 million.
rated in            Also, ONGC's borrowing during FY 77-80 was of the oraer of
PCR,                Rs.3387 million  and not U US $3.4 billion as stated. -We would
para. 9.07          su ;gest that the last line of ti28 paragraph  be modified to
read as follows.- "BuLk of the borrowings w9r;,therefore,from local
sources particularly GOI and OIDB".
Reflec-  he         23.    On externaJL cofinancing which has been discussed in
ted in     7        paragraph 9.08, it isL          _  ato what we have stated
PCR,   D      's earlier in these comments that commercial borrowingswere resbrted
para.  08           to by ONGC whenever cpngidered necessary.  GOI is not averse to
para. 9.08          external cofinancing per se.  This would be evident from the
details of external borrowings made by ONGC in 1980-81 and
1981-82 as given earlier in these comments.

INDIA
FIRST BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
COMPLETION REPORT
I.   Introduction
1.01      On June 30, 1977, the Executive Directors approved a US$150 million
loan to India, to finance part of the cost of phase III of the development
of the Bombay High field. This was the first lending operation of the Bank
for petroleum development - until then the Bank had only financed a relatively
small number of oil and gas pipelines. This loan was the first of a large
number of other petroleum development projects 1/.
1.02      India is a net importer of oil, and is not expected to reach self
sufficiency in the foreseeable future. Existing fields will, by 1985, enable
India to produce domestically about half of its annual petroleum requirements,
then estimated at 45 million tons. Oil imports now account for almost 80% of
merchandise exports. The importance of Bombay High to the Indian economy
cannot be overstated. The field, in early 1981, is producing at a rate
of 140,000 BPD (barrels per day), equivalent to 7 million tons per annum,
or 20% of India's petroleum requirements. The annual savings in foreign
exchange resulting from this production level can be estimated at US$1.9
billion using current market prices for equivalent crude. In parallel with
the development of Bombay High, Indian consultants have acquired considerable
expertise in offshore technology, an Indian concern has successfully started
the construction of offshore platforms, and the Oil and Natural Gas Commission
(ONGC), the beneficiary, has since embarked on an ambitious offshore explora-
tion program, which has resulted in several discoveries, some of which are now
being developed.
1.03      Oil was discovered in Bombay High in 1974.  The structure is located
some 160 km west-northwest of Bombay, at an average water depth of 80 m (see
attached map). Production started in May 1976, and the field was developed
in successive stages; the objective of phase III was to reach the production
rate of 140,000 BPD by the end of 1978/79 2/. Although start of production
was as scheduled, the build-up of production was delayed and the Phase III
target was reached two years later; the reasons for the delay are analyzed in
this report.
1.04      Development of Bombay High is continuing, and the target of phases
IV and advance action on phase V, now under implementation, is to reach a
production level of 240,000 BPD by mid-1982 3/. Proposals to reach 300,000-
1/   By June 30, 1981 the Bank and IDA had made 15 loans/credits for the
development of petroleum resources in 10 countries.
2/   The actual production rate at the end of 1978/79 was 100,000 BPD or
71% of the target.
3/   The Bank made'a second loan towards phases IV and V (advance action) of
Bombay High Development in December 1980, for an amount of US$400.0
million. The production target of 240,000 BPD was actually achieved
by the end of March 1982.

340,000 BPD by the mid-eighties are now under review; consultants are presently
also designing a water injection program which will be required from 1983/84
onwards. As a result, Bombay High will remain an important asset of the
Indian economy in the foreseeable future.
L.05      This report is based on ONGC's completion report, which provided
important background data on certain items, and the findings of a mission that
visited India in April 1981.
II. Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      During February 1976 the Government of India requested the Bank to
provide guidance and assistance in the further development of the Bombay High
oil field which was then in the process of being put into production. A Bank
mission visited India shortly thereafter and drafted terms of reference for:
(i) a study of fractionating the associated gas from the field and its down-
stream utilization in the Bombay region (this study was under the auspices
of the Working Group on Optimal Utilization of Bombay High Crude/Natural Gas);
and (ii) a feasibility study for the transportation of crude oil and natural
gas from the oil field to a location near Bombay, including shore facilities
for handling and processing the crude oil and associated gas (under the
auspices of ONGC). At ONGC's request, a Bank mission subsequently drafted
terms of reference for a feasibility study and preliminary engineering for a
supply base at Nhava Sheva, the new port site for Bombay. Subsequent Bank
maissions collaborated closely with ONGC in the review and evaluation of the
i-indings of these studies. Later in 1976 the Government requested Bank
participation in financing the next stage of development of Bombay High. The
project was appraised during January 1977.
2.02      The Bank viewed the Bombay High project as offering an opportunity
io mobilize external financial resources through commercial borrowing which
in turn would benefit other sectors of the economy. For this reason, the Bank
felt it important that at least the precedent should be established for
India-s financing some of the investment in the petroleum sector through
external borrowing. With this objective the Bank appraisal mission included a
financial consultant knowledgeable in petroleum project financing to apprise
the Government and ONGC of the relevant financing schemes and mechanisms
available through the international banking community. Also in this same
context, the Bank commissioned a reservoir consultant to undertake an inde-
pendent assessment of the Bombay High and North Bassein (another oil discovery
about 60 km closer to shore than Bombay High) oil reserves and production
potential. An independent evaluation is a normal requirement by lenders for
petroleum projects secured by oil or gas reserves and would enhance ONGC's
access to commercial borrowing. It should be noted here that ONGC did finance
a portion of the project through a 50 million Eurodollar loan.
2.03      The reservoir consultant, appointed by the Bank with the agreement
of ONGC in January 1977, estimated that the Bombay High field contained 812
million tons of oil of which 252 million tons could be recovered with water
fnjection over an estimated life of 30 years. In October 1979, ONGC's new



consultant re-evaluated the field with results essentially in agreement with
the earlier assessment. It reported estimated oil in place to be 896 million
tons with 233 million tons being recoverable over the same life span.
2.04      The project defined at the time of appraisal was based on:    , a
feasibility study of the transportation, handling and processing facilities
for crude oil and gas; (ii) a supply base study; (iii) a reservoir study; and
(iv) additional studies on offshore processing platforms. These studies
defined the main parameters for the pipelines, processing platforms and
onshore facilities comprising the following project components:
(a)  development drilling - 16 production wells from 4 platforms
at Bombay High and 4 wells from 1 platform at North Bassein;
(b)  processing platforms - an interim platform (Platform F) and a
main processing platform (BHN) in the northern part of Bombay
High and one processing platform at North Bassein;
(c)  subsea pipelines - two subsea lines 30" and 26" in diameter
with a length of about 203-km and 202-km respectively;
(d)  onshore terminal - facilities at Uran to stabilize and store
crude oil and tranship it to Trombay; gas processing (LPG)
and ancillary facilities;
(e)  transfer lines - four pipelines 8" to 30" in diameter to
connect Uran with Trombay;
(f)  supply base - berthing facilities, repair shops, warehouses,
administrative buildings and offices at Nhava Sheva;
(g)  telecommunications and control - a telemetric communication
and control system covering the entire Bombay High operation;
and
(h)  engineering and technical services - consultants to prepare
detailed engineering designs, supervise construction and
assist ONGC in project management.
III. Implementation
a.   Background
3.01      At the time of appraisal, ONGC's immediate goal was to install the
crude oil and natural gas pipelines and complete the minimum offshore and
onshore facilities to transport oil and gas to Bombay before the onset of the
1978 monsoon season (June to September). The reason and urgency for doing
this was that oil production during the monsoons had to be greatly curtailed
because of difficulty in transferring crude oil to tankers at the single buoy
mooring system (SBM) stations during heavy seas. A pipeline would allow



- 4 -
uninterrupted flow regardless of weather. The gas pipeline was urgently
needed to avoid flaring the associated gas produced with the oil. It was
impossible within this time frame to install a platform with all the necessary
facilities to process the crude oil and natural gas. ONGC, therefore, opted
to install a small interim platform ("F" platform) with minimum facilities
which could recover all but the low pressure gas 1/ and which could handle a
crude oil production rate of 80,000 BPD. ONGC was able to achieve this
key target by June 1978, in accordance with the appraisal schedule. ONGC
planned to install the remaining project components by the end of 1978,
giving itself about five months' grace before the 1979 monsoon. The crude oil
production target on completing these facilities was 140,000 BPD.
b.   Changes in Project Scope and Timing
3.02      On January 10, 1978 ONGC advised the Bank of a revision to its devel-
opment schedule. The oil and gas pipeline and the interim platform F along
with minimum offshore and onshore production and processing facilities were
to be commissioned in mid-1978 (on schedule) and the North Bassein process
platform along with its well platform and wells in April 1979 (approxi-
mately 10 months behind the original target date). Crude oil and natural
gas production targets from the two areas were set at 80,000 BPD and 1.2
millioi m per day respectively from Platform F and 20,000 BPD and 0.4 mil-
lion m per day from North Bassein. The Bombay High North Platform (BHN)
was to be completed in March 1980 (approximately 12 months behind schedule)
along with 4 well platforms and 16 wells to give a production rate from the
field of 120,000 BPD of crude oil and 2.1 million m per day of natural gas.
3.03      As indicated above, the implementation of Platform F, the oil and
gas pipelines and the related minimum Uran terminal facilities proceeded on
schedule so that the first production target of 80,000 BPD was achieved in
mid-1978. However, the offshore development program was slowed down pending
completion of further reservoir studies of the Bombay High and North Bassein
fields.   The main concern was the quantity of crude which could be produced
from North Bassein and whether or not it was cost effective to develop this
field in conjunction with Bombay High. ONGC's Institute of Petroleum Explora-
tion (IPE) had, from the beginning, differed with the foreign consultant
on the size of the North Bassein oil reserves. IPE's interpretation of the
data indicated roughly half the reserves estimated by the consultant. This
difference was finally resolved in September 1978 when the consultant completed
a reassessment of reserves, based on additional data acquired from the field,
and concluded that IPE-s initial evaluation of the field was essentially
correct. On this basis the decision was made to defer the development of North
Bassein and to extend the development of Bombay High into the southern portion
of the field. On October 11, 1978 the Government formally requested the Bank
to approve this change in project scope. The Bank approved the revised scope
on November 28, 1978 and the Loan Agreement was amended accordingly.
1/   The low pressure gas, since the commissioning of BHN, is no longer
flared.



3.04      The revised scope comprised Platform F, the crude oil and natural
gas pipelines and minimum terminal facilities designated as Phase IILA
and already commissioned at the time and the Phase IIIB portion defined as
follows:
(a)  installation of a major process platform (BEN) adjacent
to Platform F to process crude oil produced in the
northern part of Bombay High;
(b) installation of 4 well platforms (NI, NJ, NK, NL) with
flow lines in the northern part of Bombay High;
(c) installation of a well-cum-production platform (SA) with
utilities and living quarters for 14 persons and a well
platform (SB), both in the Central/southern part of Bombay
High, including flow lines and an 18" submarine pipeline
to BHN;
(d) shifting the existing single buoy mooring system (SBM) to
location near SA to load crude produced at SA and SB onto
tankers;
(e) drilling 26 production wells from the well platforms above; and
(f)  installation of the Uran terminal and Nhava Sheva supply base
facilities in the original project scope.
3.05      The construction completion target for the offshore portion of Phase
ITIB was set for the end of May 1980 (before the monsoon season), and the
onshore facilities were to be constructed in phase with the offshore work. On
completion of the production wells associated with the Phase IIIB platforms,
by September 1980, a production rate of 130,000 BPD crude oil rate was to be
achieved.
c.   Implementation Delays
3.06      Phase IIIA of the redefined project, as indicated previously,
proceeded smoothly and was completed on schedule, but the Phase IIIB portion,
rescheduled for completion in May 1980, was not completed until March 1981.
As a result, the project as redefined was actually completed two years later
than envisaged for the original project at the time of appraisal. Of course,
one half of this delay (i.e. one year) is economically justifiable on the basis
that the major change in scope (i.e. deferral of the North Bassein development
and switching to the development of South Bombay High) was mandated by new
information about the reserve and productivity estimates as discussed (para.
3.03). The additional delay in completing the project was due to a number of
causes many of which were out of ONGC's control. According to reports,
there were also internal problems in the organization of one contractor
resulting in poor coordination of the construction activities; this may
account for the fact that five senior people, up to the level of vice-
president, were dismissed from that company during execution of the
contract.



- 6 -
3.07      There were additional reasons for the delay in finishing offshore
construction before the onset of the 1980 monsoon. First there was practically
no slack in the schedule. Nevertheless, the schedule could have been kept had
all activities proceeded as planned, especially in view of the fact that there
was a very pronounced lull in offshore construction activity at that time;
ONGC had ordered all long-lead time equipment items in advance of the offshore
contract, and these were subsequently delivered on time. Unfortunately, the
contractor for the soil coring (survey) work failed to mobilize and demanded
additional compensation and the soil survey was therefore re-tendered causing
delays. To gain time, the engineering consultant initially designed the
processing platform (BHN) on the basis of the soil data obtained for the
adjoining Platform F and well platform A. Normally soil characteristics will
not vary significantly over such a small area. However, when the soil data for
BHN became available, it was found that the soil properties were not as good as
at Platforms F and A locations. It was necessary to extensively modify the
platform design after the offshore contract had already been awarded. Con-
sequently, instead of gaining time, the result was actually a delay. Never-
theless, ONGC cannot be faulted for taking this small risk considering the
potential oil production gain or loss which was at stake. It is also
understandable that on a tight project schedule all activities will not
always mesh as they should.
3.08      Because of the tight schedule, some of the basic design parameters
given to the contractors were based on tentative data or rough specifications
and consequently, there were numerous change orders made by ONGC as better
information became available. It is virtually impossible on a complex contract
such as the one in question to avoid change orders. They can, however, be
minimized both in numbers and scope by carefully spelling out all the require-
ments in the specifications and drawings and not modify these after the contract
is awarded. There were further difficulties in maintaining the construction
schedule by late deliveries of critical equipment and materials ordered by the
contractor.
3.09      It soon became apparent that the offshore construction work could
not be completed before the monsoon. ONGC, therefore, agreed to have the
contractor mobilize a semi-submersible derrick barge (capable of working
in heavy seas) so as to continue the construction activities through the
monsoon season and avoid losing four months of construction time. Additional
delays occurred to repair damages resulting from two accidents during construc-
tion. A crane cable snapped while lifting the SA deck into place causing it
to strike the jacket and damaging the deck and some of the equipment and
instrumentation installed on it. Also, a subsea pipeline was punctured,
probably by an anchor from the contractor's barge, during this period.
3.10      Implementation delays were also experienced in the onshore work.
First of all, there was a problem with land acquisition for the Uran terminal.
The site originally selected by ONGC was not granted by the Government, and
ONGC ultimately had to accept a plat in a hilly area requiring extensive earth
moving to develop a level plant site. ONGC awarded a turnkey contract for all



- 7 -
the terminal facilities based on an April 1980 completion date. Actual com-
pletion took place in March 1981. Delivery of steel plate for pressure vessels
was delayed approximately 3-4 months by a strike at the supplier's plant.
Most of the additional delay was due to labor disputes and power-shortages in
India during the fabrication and construction period. An airline strike also
delayed some critical air shipments.
3.11      Work on the Nhava Sheva supply base is still going on and is now
expected to be commissioned in March 1983. The base is not critical to ONGC's
oil operations, but it will facilitate its supply and maintenance activities
now conducted from the crowded Bombay area. Construction at Nhava Sheva was
delayed by difficulties in acquiring access to the base. ONGC leased the land
for the base from the City and Industrial Development Corporation of the
Government of Maharashtra, but the land needed for an access road was held by
private owners opposed to relinquishing their land for this purpose. The prob-
lem was ultimately resolved when the Government of Maharashtra completed the
necessary acquisition and compensation process 1/.
Achievement of Objectives
3.12      ONGC achieved its first target of piping crude oil and natural
gas to shore by mid-1978 thereby avoiding the interruption of oil production
during the monsoons and allowing the utilization of gas previously flared. By
completing BHN, the SA/SB platform complex and the drilling platforms and wells
in the northern part of Bombay High, ONGC has reached its objective of 140,000
BPD crude production, approximately 2.1 million m per day of natural gas and
the LPG extracted from the gas. However, realization of this objective has
been delayed two years, from 1979 to March 1981, due to the circumstances
previously described. Nevertheless, even with the delay ONGC's achievement was
noteworthy considering it had to revise its development program in "midstream"
and the difficulty in planning construction activities around an annual 8
months' "window" between monsoons. It could be said that ONGC should not
have set such an ambitious program for itself but the returns are exceptionally
high in oil production projects and even at a more leisurely pace, events could
have contrived to the delay of the project even further. Moreover, all equip-
ment, materials and contracts were obtained on favorable terms since offshore
costs escalated sharply after 1979.
Project Costs
3.13      The project was completed with a small saving of Rs. 24 million.
Actual and estimated costs are compared in Annex 1. Annex 2 compares the total

(of) the various delays... is not more than 53 days" (Attachment B, para.
13). This estimate could not be verified by Bank staff.



actual cost of each component with the estimated cost plus its prorated con-
tingencies. The comparison is made in rupees because ONGC converts foreign
exchange costs to rupees in its accounts. Since the scope of the project was
changed after appraisal, the comparison is not on an exact equivalent basis.
It is unlikely, however, that there would have been a substantial difference
in cost had the project proceeded as originally defined. The principal changes
were the deletion of the North Bassein process and well platforms and the
addition of the SA/SB well platform complex in the south central portion of
Bombay High. The North Bassein process platform would have been about half the
size of BHN, quite similar to F Platform except for the addition of gas com-
pression facilities. Allowing US$9 million for a compression module and other
costs in addition to the US$26 million cost of F Platform, the North Bassein
unit would have cost about US$35 million. By comparison the SA/SB complex
installed cost was US$45 million.
3.14      The cost comparison in Annex 2 shows four sizeable variances.  There
is approximately a 50% cost overrun for well platforms. In addition to the
delays in awarding contracts for well platforms, it is also due to the extra
costs associated with the SA/SB complex which included the repair and reinstal-
lation of a single buoy mooring system, a sub-sea pipeline, a flare tower, and
production facilities, utilities and operator living quarters on SA. The Uran
facilities overran the estimated cost by about 27% mostly because of the
prolonged implementation period. Well costs were approximately 35% less
than estimated. These costs were estimated on the basis of drilling time and
drilling rig rates prevailing at the time of appraisal. The lower cost
apparently reflects increased productivity in drilling and reduced rig rates.
For example, an expensive drilling ship was released shortly after appraisal.
As for the approximate 40% savings in engineering, technical services and
project supervision costs, it was assumed that these services would mostly be
supplied by expatriates with modest participation by local firms. As it
turned out, a local consultant was able to undertake a major portion of the
engineering, design and project supervision with back-up expatriate firms.
Disbursements
3.15      At the time of appraisal the Bank loan was to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the construction of two sub-sea pipelines from Bombay High
to shore, the equipping and installation of processing platforms and the
gas processing plant. When the project was redefined, items to be financed
by the loan were also revised and actual disbursement was as follows:
US$ Millions
(a) Laying of the oil and gas pipelines
from Bombay High to Uran                          68.65
(b) Equipping and installation of one
process platforms and two well-platforms          81.35
150.00

particularly low on account of the delay in the start-up of the BHN platform
(para. 3.03). If that year is excluded, the profile of disbursements can be
considered as representative of an offshore development project.
Performance of Consultants
3.17      ONGC employed two technical foreign consultants and a local engineer-
ing firm backed-up by two foreign consultants to assist in carrying out all
phases of project implementation from design to construction supervision. In
the view of ONGC, their performance was entirely satisfactory, and this is also
the conclusion of Bank staff who have supervised the project.
Performance of Contractors
3.18      Except for the BHN and SA/SB contracts, all contracts were executed
satisfactorily without undue problems. In the case of the contractor referred
to in para. 3.06, both ONGC and the contractor undoubtedly share responsibility
for the problems and delays 1/. Approximately US$12 million in claims for change
orders were still under negotiations in March 1981. It is expected that a
mutually satisfactory settlement will be reached. That contractor has partici-
pated in the Bombay High offshore development from the very beginning and
continues to bid on contracts for the Phase IV and V development programs.
3.19      Nhava Sheva supply base has been delayed until March 1983, but
this cannot be attributed to the contractor. A contract was only awarded
in March 1980 after a permit to begin construction was finally granted by
the government authorities. This left little time to begin any effective
work until after the monsoon.
1/ The Borrower considers that the major share of responsibility for the
delay rests with the contractor (Attachment B, para. 16).

IV. Operating Performance
4.01      An inspection of the project facilities showed excellent to good
housekeeping and care of equipment. ONGC reported equipment performance and
facility operations to be satisfactory. Operators were alert and knowledge-
able in explaining the operation of facilities under their care and appeared
to take pride in their work. There was ample evidence to suggest that the
facilities were manned by competent trained personnel.
4.02      Satisfactory steps have been taken to maintain the offshore struc-
tures and installation. ONGC has hired a subsidiary of British Petroleum
Corporation, OMISCO, to advise it on offshore maintenance and to survey the
submarine pipelines for corrosion and safe operation. A multi-purpose supply
vessel has been engaged to install additional sacrificial anodes where
required and to remove marine growth from the structures. In addition, an
inspection vessel has been hired to conduct non-destructive tests and inspec-
tions to monitor the structural integrity of critical offshore structural
members. ONGC plans to purchase its own general-purpose vessels eventually
and only contract for the various maintenance, inspection, pollution control
and other services required for its offshore operations.
4.03      ONGC's concern with personnel and fire safety on its offshore
installations is much in evidence. "No Smoking" and "Hard Hat" rules are
enforced in the operating areas. Fire fighting, platform abandonment and
other emergency instructions and equipment are prominently displayed. All
platform areas are covered by heat and smoke sensing devices to warn of fire
and ultimately automatically shut down operations. A deluge sprinkler system
is installed on all platforms, and the multi-purpose supply vessels servicing
the platforms are equipped for fighting platform fires. Along with life
jackets and collapsible boats, the platforms contain survival capsules in
case the platform has to be abandoned. A safety engineer and his assistants
administer and carry out the safety program for the manned platforms. Two
ONGC officers are responsible for fire safety and conduct weekly fire drills
on all manned platforms. In early 1981 the International Labor Organization
sponsored a visit to India by the former principal petroleum inspector of the
U.K. Department of Energy to review offshore safety practices and assist the
Government in drafting legislation covering offshore safety regulations and
codes. The consultant expressed satisfaction with ONGC's operations.
4.04      ONGC's offshore operations, like any similar operation, pose some
risk of an oil spill in the case of an accident or operational error.
Although a massive spill in rough weather would be difficult to contain, ONGC
is prepared to handle such situations on a more modest scale. The Indian
coast guard patrols the submarine pipeline route to keep away shipping that
might drop an anchor and puncture the crude oil line. In 1979, a UNDP grant
sponsored experts from the International Maritime Consultants Committee to
assist ONGC in preparing a pollution control program and provided funds for
the procurement of equipment and chemicals. ONGC personnel were subsequently



- 11 -
trained in the UK in the various techniques of spillage containment and the
use of equipment and chemicals available for clean-up operations. ONGC
presently has a chartered vessel equipped and manned for pollution control and
has been authorized by the Government to procure two of its own, the first to
be delivered in 1982.
V. Economic Performance
5.01      As mentioned above, total project completion was two years behind the
appraisal schedule, which resulted in a corresponding delay in the realization
of the full benefits of the project. Appraisal and actual production results
can be compared as follows:
Crude Oil (million tons)
Fiscal Year                  1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982   1985 (Est.)
Appraisal                    0.4    2.1    4.8    6.8    10.0   12.0   12.0
Actual/Estimate              0.4    2.1    3.2    4.2        5.0    8.0   16.15
Natural Gas (million Nm )
Appraisal                     -       -    152.7  209.5   571.0  674.5
Actual/Estimate               -       -    196.0  363.0   293.0  482.0
The lower build-up of production of crude oil is due to the delay in the
completion of phase III and the delay in the subsequent start-up of phases IV
and V. The optimal production level for the Bombay High field was established
at 12 million tons of oil per annum in 1977, but was recently revised upwards,
following the experience with the reservoir since that time. The sustainable
production level is now assessed at 16-17 million tons per annum, which
explains the higher output expected in 1985.
5.02      Because of the substantial increase in the price of crude oil since
1977, the benefits of the project exceed appraisal's expectations by a wide
margin. The assumptions made at appraisal for economic evaluation purposes,
and current values can be compared as follows:
Appraisal    Current
Crude Oil (US$/Bbl)                     13.0           32.0
Gas (US$/thousand Nm3)                  55.5          180.0
LPG (US$/ton)                           90.0          300.0
At appraisal, the economic rate of return on the project was estimated at 165%;
including sunk costs, the rate of return was 66%. Under current prices, the
rate of return has increased to above 300%; including sunk costs, it remains a



- 12 -
high 143%. 1/ The benefits of the project are highlighted by the fact that,
at a 10% discount rate, the cost of producing a barrel of oil at Bombay High
is only US$4.10. The economic rates of return are compared at Annex 3.
VI. Institutional Performance
a.   Background
6.01      The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) is a Government-owned
statutory body created in 1959 by an Act of Parliament to "plan, promote
and implement the development of petroleum resources and the production and
sale of petroleum products produced by it." ONGC is by far the major producer
of petroleum in India, and carries exploration activities on a large scale,
all over the country.
6.02      Until 1973, virtually all of ONGC's activities were concentrated
onshore, where it was producing oil in Assam and Gujarat. Following the
discovery of oil in Bombay High, the Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) was set up
in Bombay, with the duties of exploring for, and developing petroleum resources
in the offshore. At that time, the offshore expertise available in India in
general, and with ONGC in particular was almost non-existent. The Bank
therefore considered that the institutional strengthening of ONGC, particularly
regarding its offshore operation was an important objective of the project.
As a result, the Bank insisted on the recruitment of management consultants
to assist in the establishment of adequate project management procedures,
and appropriate management information systems. ONGC was not receptive to the
proposal, but eventually agreed on the recruitment of consultants at negotia-
tions. The institutional objectives of the projects can be considered as
having been attained, although, perhaps less through the consultants, and more
through the learning experience, and effective recruitment practices.
b.   Organization and Management
6.03      The Commission consists of a Chairman, four full-time members
(Finance, Materials, Offshore, and Onshore), and three part-time members
(representing the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and
Fertilizers, and the Planning Commission). BOP is headed by the Member Off-
shore. The position was vacant for more than a year, during which the Chairman
also acted as Member Offshore, providing continuity in the decision-making
process but burdening the Chairman with a major additional function which pro-
bably had some adverse impact on the speed of the decision-making process.
Since May 1980, the position has been filled by an experienced individual,
the organization of BOP has been streamlined, better internal procedures have
been introduced, and on the whole, the organizational framework can now be
considered satisfactory.
1/   On the basis of the prices of oil product prevailing at appraisal time,
the rate of return on Bombay high, including sunk costs remains a high
78%; it is still higher than the appraisal estimate because of lower
investment costs relative to output, and lower operating costs.
The Borrower points out that he is not aware of the price assumptions
and cannot verify them (Attachment B, para. 18).



- 13 -
c.   Staffing
6.04      From a small nuclei of personnel in 1974, BOP has at present a staff
approaching 2,300 which is reasonable, considering the size of the offshore
activities. BOP has given priority to recruiting fresh graduates, and
providing training programs in offshore technology both in India and abroad.
In view of the continuing increase in offshore construction and operations,
BOP still faces a shortage of middle-level managers with sufficient experience,
and, as a result, senior staff are considerably overloaded. This situation
is not likely to be overcome in the short run, and ONGC owes much to the
dedication, and motivation of its senior staff.
d.   Management Systems
6.05      As agreed during negotiations, but after some delay (due to differ-
ences of opinion between ONGC and the Bank regarding the extent of consultancy
services required), ONGC appointed a management consulting firm to review
ONGC's project management techniques and management information systems. The
consultant's report was candid and critical in places but contained a number
of constructive recommendations. While the working relationships between
ONGC staff and the consultants were often times strained, ONGC management did
take action on several recommendations which helped improve ONGC's opera-
tions.
6.06      Subsequently, at the suggestion of the Bank, a well known accounting
consulting group reviewed the adequacy of the accounting system, the feasibility
of accelerating the use of computers, and the design of the management informa-
tion systems. The consultants found the basic accounting systems and practices
of ONGC, as well as its computerized payroll and material accounting systems,
satisfactory. This report was better received, and provided the management
with valuable inputs particularly relating to the plans for computerizing
ONGC's entire accounting functions.
6.07      At present, comprehensive reports are prepared by BOP on a monthly
basis, covering all its activities, from drilling to construction, operation,
personnel and finance, and provide the senior management with essential
inputs for the decision-making process. The reporting system can be con-
sidered as fully adequate.
e.   Project Management
6.08      From the beginning, BOP has followed the practice of appointing
project managers for each major construction activity. Project managers
are expected to monitor the implementation of a project in all its phases,
and are involved in all the aspects of its implementation, covering in the
process contractual as well as technical matters. ONGC was in the earlier
stages handicapped by the availability of personnel capable of handling these
duties effectively, and has by now developed a cadre of staff with reasonale
experience.



- 14 -
6.09      BOP still continues to give high priority to the matter, and has
recently spelled out in detail the responsibilities the job of project manager
entails, the authorities of the different layers of management have been
defined, and the reporting system has been standardized. In addition, a
consulting firm has also recently been hired by ONGC to review project
management procedures, so that one might expect continuing progress in this
area.
f.   Conclusion
6.10      Taking into account the fact that ONGC initiated the development of
offshore reserves only five years ago, the record of ONGC and BOP in particular
can be considered as excellent. A capable organization has been built up, a
core of professionals has been trained, and has gained solid experience, and
as a result, ONGC is in a much better position now to handle the exploration
and development of offshore resources. However, in view of the rapid and
ongoing increase in the scope of offshore activities, the organization will
continue to face serious challenges.
VII. Financial Performance
a.   Operating Results
7.01      A comparison of ONGC's financial results with the appraisal forecast
appears at Annex 4 of this report. Over the 1977-1980 period, no significant
changes were introduced in the key financial parameters affecting ONGC's
performance: the prices ONGC recovers for crude oil and gas have remained
identical, and the depreciation policies have remained substantially the
same. During that period, several factors weighed towards lower profits and
lower internal cash generation than anticipated at appraisal time, in parti-
cular lower crude oil production (31.2 million tons vs 36.4 million tons
mostly because of the delay in project completion), the introduction of
dividends on Government equity (Rs. 630 million - US$78 million, vs nil
expected at appraisal time), and high income tax payments 1/ (Rs 680 million
- US$85 million, vs nil expected at appraisal time).
7.02      However, ONGC's performance has been up to, if not exceeded, the
expectation at appraisal, essentially because of lower operating costs
(over FY 1977-1980, operating costs amounted to Rs 1,553 million vs Rs. 3,366
million expected at appraisal time, mostly on account of the then anticipated
high cost of offshore operations). ONGC's performance can best be compared
in terms of internal cash generation:
1/ This is mostly due to lower investment tax credits, which in turn was
caused by the lower investment program.



- 15 -
--FY 1977 - 1980 (Rs. million)---
Appraisal    %         Actual    %
Internal cash generation              4,042       30         4,906    49
Equity contributions                  4,210       31         1,702    17
Long term borrowings                  5,178       39         3,387    34
Total                           13,430      100        9,995   100
Investment program                   13,430      100         8,995   100
As the above table indicates, ONGC generated significantly higher internal
cash than anticipated, and financed a higher proportion of its investments
from internal sources; however, the capital investments were some 25% below
appraisal expectations, on account of the delay in project completion, and
the resulting delay in starting phases IV and V of the Bombay High develop-
ment.
b.   Balance Sheet
7.03      The Balance Sheets as of 3/31/80 can be compared as follows:
3/31/80 Balance Sheet (Rs. million)
Appraisal       %      Actual      %
Net fixed assets                      9,883        74       6,315      68
Work in progress                      2,341        17       1,866      20
Investment                              504         4         250      3
Working Capital                         712         5         845       9
Total                     13,440       100       9,276    100
Equity                                7,962        59       5,578      60
Long term debt                        5,478        41       3,698     40
13,440      100       9,276    100
ONGC's Balance Sheet as of 3/31/80 remains strong, and in percentage terms,
close to appraisal expectations.
c.   Financial Covenant
7.04      As the main external parameters affecting ONGC's financial
performance is the price it receives for oil and gas, the single financial
covenant under the loan required ONGC to carry out on a periodic basis,
pricing studies with a view to meeting a 15% DCF rate of return target for the
project and any subsequent development. At appraisal, the DCF rate or return
was assessed at 19.8%, while the latest estimate yields 17.4% (Annex 4). The
lower return is due mostly to the significantly higher cost of offshore
development, since appraisal. Nevertheless, ONGC complied with the covenant,
and provided on a regular basis its estimate of the DCF rate of return.



- 16 -
d.   Financial Prospects
7.05      A comparison of the appraisal forecast for FY 1981 and FY 1982, with
the current expectations appears at Annex 4, and indicates lower profitability
and higher indebtedness. There are several factors explaining these trends,
in particular: (i) no equity contributions; (ii) significantly higher capital
spendings; and (iii) lower production. However, the Government implemented
higher prices for oil and gas in July 11, 1981, and a substantial improvement in
ONGC's cash generation is now expected. ONGC financial performance will continue
to be monitored closely, under the Second Bombay High Development Project,
now under implementation.
VIII. Performance of the Bank
8.01      Throughout the implementation of the Project, relations between the
Bank, and GOI and ONGC have been good. ONGC sent, as required, quarterly
technical progress reports, and annual reports on financial performance and
prospects, and general managerial matters.
8.02      At ONGC's request, two short missions visited India to provide
specific assistance on procurement matters and accelerate the awarding of
contracts. Subsequently, the Bank requested that procurement matters in-
volving the Bank be handled in Washington, and ONGC agreed; the Bank speedily
gave its clearance to bidding documents and contracts award, and no particular
difficulties were experienced.
8.03      Possibly the biggest contribution of the Bank took place during
project preparation and appraisal as at that time, ONGC was not familiar,
and perhaps lacking confidence in offshore exploration and development. By
drawing Terms of Reference for the technical consultants (para. 2.01) and
assisting ONGC in reviewing their recommendation, the Bank in effect initiated
a process that, in fact, is continuing to this day, i.e., the transfer of
offshore technology to India. This aspect of Bank involvement has been
largely a success, as ONGC has built up confidence in offshore technology, a
large number of staff have been trained, and the technical capability of ONGC
is now respected internationally. The supervision missions have possibly lead
ONGC to tighten project management and costing procedures.
8.04      ONGC and GOI have confirmed that complying with Bank requirements
has not caused particular problems as ONGC procedures, in areas such as
procurement, are in many respects similar to those of the Bank. Covenants
agreed to during negotiations were complied with, except that with respect
to the management consultants (para. 6.05) where the assignment took place
about fifteen months late. The loan agreement was amended to reflect the
change.
IX. Conclusions
9.01      Notwithstanding the two-year delay in project completion, the project
was largely a success, its economic importance has been enhanced by the crude



- 17 -
oil price rises in 1979, and ONGC is a considerably stronger entity than it
was in 1976.  Important lessons to be drawn from the first project of the
Bank in offshore development are listed in this section.
a.   Timing of Appraisal
9.02       The appraisal of this project was timed to permit early execution of
the essential pipelines carrying the crude oil and gas from Bombay High to
Uran (para. 2.04-item (c)).  The offshore industry is characterized by large
swings, as periods of relatively low activity are followed by periods of
intense activity on a worldwide basis. As a result, cost estimates are
particularly difficult to prepare with any degree of accuracy. ONGC's practice
of entrusting the detailed design of platforms to the contractor, which is
also followed by some international oil companies, makes it difficult even to
estimate the final cost of a platform, even after a contract has been awarded,
since a large number of change orders can be anticipated.
9.03      As a result, the Bank ought to finalize the project appraisal at a
relatively late stage of the project cycle in such a way that negotiation
would coincide with the evaluation of bids, and contracts would be awarded
shortly after the submission of the project to the Executive Directors; this
pattern was followed for the Second Bombay High Project.
9.04      Even after contracts have been awarded, it would be prudent to include
a relatively high provision for physical contingencies, as contracts are, sub-
jected to numerous change orders.
b.   Management Consultants
9.05       Several factors detracted from the effectiveness of the management
consultancy assignment, namely: the friction in the working relationship
between the consultants and ONGC staff; the initial differences in opinion
between ONGC and the Bank regarding the extent of consultancy services required;
and the very candor of the consultant's report. While the technical competence
of the consultant was not an issue, the absence of mutual goodwill and trust
made implementation of all the consultant's main recommendations more difficult.
In the future, the Bank has to pay closer attention to the likely working re-
lationship between consultants and the borrower. Finally, the Bank should
finance the critical consultancy services (which it did not do in this case)
so that it can be more effective in ensuring the success of the consultancy
assignment.
9.06      Experience with ONGC suggests that it does hire consulting services
when the need is identified. ONGC has thus recently recruited a consultant
to advise on project management techniques, and this step was taken largely
following past experience.



- 18 -
c.   Cofinancing
9.07      As indicated in para. 7.02, ONGC borrowed over FY1977-80 about
US$403 million, including US$101.1 from the Bank (the Bank loan had not
been fully disbursed by March 1980), US$50 million on the Eurodollar
market, and US$14 million from the OPEC Fund (onlent to ONGC by GOI). The
bulk of the borrowings was therefore from local sources, particularly GOI
and OIDB.
9.08      This relatively low percentage of external cofinancing can be
explained by the fact that in 1977, ONGC's international reputation, particu-
larly on the offshore side, had not been established, and significant foreign
exchange reserves were available to GOI at that time. Moreover, GOI was
particularly reluctant to attract commercial banks financing even for projects
which readily lent themselves to such financing when the possibility of
securing financing from other sources on more favorable terms still existed.
For future projects, it will be important to mobilize significantly higher
levels of external cofinancing, on the following grounds: (i) offshore
development projects are generally attractive to private and public financing
agencies; (ii) the reputation of ONGC is now established; and (iii) foreign
exchange reserves in India have declined, inter alia, because of the signifi-
cant burden of oil imports on the economy. Recent actions indicate the Govern-
ment's intention to tap foreign commercial financing sources more extensively
to help finance ONGC's investment program. In FY1981, ONGC obtained US$200
million from the Eurodollar market and in FY1982, it secured US$159 million
in commercial loans and suppliers credits. Starting in mid-FY1982, the
Government also authorized ONGC to routinely request commercial financing
proposals in conjunction with major procurement tenders issued for inter-
national bidding. With this approach, ONGC expects to raise substantial
amounts (US$200-US$400 million per year) from commercial sources in the
next several years.
d.   Identity of the Borrower
9.09      Bank policy normally requires that loans be made to the implementing
agency. In the case of this project, and the Second Bomhay High project as
well, loans were made to GOI, and subsequently onlent to ONGC under satis-
factory subsidiary loan,agreements. At appraisal, the Bank insisted that ONGC
be the borrower, but during negotiations, it had to yield on the grounds that
direct Bank lending to implementing agencies run against GOI policy.
9.10      Lending to ONG would not have enhanced measurably the efficiency
of project implementation, nor would have it averted the delays. However
it would have enhanced ONGC's posture vis-a-vis external financiers and
foreign oil companies. In the future the Bank ought to maintain a dialogue
with GOI on making implementing agencies direct borrowers under Bank loans.
