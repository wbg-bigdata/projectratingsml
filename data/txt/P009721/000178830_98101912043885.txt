APPRAISAL OF BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        In 1975 India's total internal demand for commercial energy was
estimated at 93.2 million tons of oil equivalent, of which petroleum accounted
for about 24%. Per capita consumption was about 11% of the world average.
Despite maximum economic use of its domestic energy resources (coal, hydro-
power and more recently petroleum and natural gas), India has not achieved
energy self-sufficiency and has to import about 62% of its petroleum require-
ments. Following the increase in world oil prices of 1973/74 and subsequent
years, the cost of petroleum imports rose from US$265 million in FY73 to about
US$1.6 billion in FY76 when they accounted for about 25% of total imports.
Energy demand projections show that, despite conservation and development of
alternative sources of energy (mainly coal), demand for petroleum will con-
tinue to grow in the future. Total requirements are estimated at about 50
million tons in 1985 and 67.5 million tons in 1990 compared to 22.3 million
tons in 1975.
ii.       Current production of crude oil and natural gas is about 8.9 mil-
lion tons and 2,300 million cubic meters, respectively, and comes mainly from
onshore fields in Gujarat and Assam. Total onshore reserves are estimated at
about 230 million tons of oil, sufficient to meet about 10 years of cur-
rent requirements. India's onshore potential has been partially explored but
no exploration of the Continental Shelf took place before 1973 since it was
thought that offshore oil would not be economical at pre-1973 prices. In
1973/74 the GOI decided to step up oil exploration offshore and entrusted
this responsibility to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), a statutory
body created in 1959, which had been exploring for and developing hydrocarbon
resources onshore. In 1974 ONGC drilled its first offshore exploratory well
in the Bombay High structure, located 160 km offshore Bombay, and struck oil.
Subsequent drilling led to the discovery of the North and South Bassein fields
located some 100 km west of Bombay. As of March 1977, proven recoverable
offshore reserves are estimated at about 280 million tons of oil equivalent,
of which 90% is crude oil and 10% natural gas. The Bombay High and Bassein
North fields should yield up to 13 million tons of oil equivalent at maximum
production. ONGC is competent to undertake the development of these two
fields and has hired Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (CFP) to assist their
own staff in reservoir engineering studies. Bombay High and Bassein North
production will be substituted for crude oil imports and is expected to bring
about net savings of US$16 billion over the next 20 years.
iii.      ONGC has already carried out the first two phases of development of
Bombay High. Commercial production started in May 1976 and reached two
million tons per year in March 1977. The project for which the Bank assist-
ance is requested consists of Phase III of the development program, which was
approved by the government in May 1977. It includes drilling of about 20



- ii -
development wells and the construction of about five well platforms, three
processing platforms, two subsea lines to shore, subtransmission lines and
onshore facilities. Design of the pipeline is completed and the contract
for pipes has been awarded. Tender documents for construction of the pipeline
and of the first processing platform have been issued; those for the Bombay
High and North Bassein platforms should be issued shortly.
iv.       The project cost is estimated at US$571 million of which 73% (US$417
million) is foreign exchange. The cost estimates are based on ONGC's histori-
cal costs for drilling and well platforms, and consultants' estimates for
major infrastructure. Physical and price contingencies of about 15% and 8%,
respectively, have been applied.
v.        A Bank loan of US$150 million to the Government of India is proposed
for a 20-year term including three years of grace; it would cover 26% of the
total cost of the project. The balance will be financed from ONGC's own
resources, Government equity and loans, bilateral aid, loans from the Oil
Industry Development Board, and commercial borrowing. The Government has
agreed to relend the proceeds of the Bank loan to ONGC for a period of not
more than 20 years including three years of grace at an interest rate of
10-1/4% per annum. The Government has also undertaken to cover promptly all
of ONGC's financing requirements, including its working capital requirements.
vi.       ONGC, with the assistance of consultants, will be responsible
for carrying out the project and is competent to do so. ONGC has agreed to
hire management consultants to assist in the establishment of adequate project
management procedures and a management information system prior to December
31, 1977. Construction of the project is expected to start in the fall of 1977
and be completed in 1979. This schedule is tight but manageable.
vii.      The proposed Bank loan will finance the foreign exchange cost of
the construction of the two subsea pipelines and of the construction and
equipment of two well platforms, two processing platforms and the gas process-
ing plant. Procurement of the Bank-financed items will be according to inter-
national competitive bidding. ONGC's procurement procedures, which are satis-
factory, will be used for all other items.
viii.     The project presents ecological risks inherent to offshore petroleum
development, but ONGC has taken steps to ensure that design and construction
will be of appropriate standards. A preliminary study of the environmental
impact of the project has been carried out and will be supplemented by an
in-depth study to be financed by UNDP. Adequate protection against sea and
air pollution is included in the project.
ix.       ONGC is a large organization with a staff of more than 23,000.
Its methods of operation are generally adequate. ONGC is implementing a
comprehensive training program for offshore operations. In the course of



- iii -
project preparation a number of institutional issues were identified and
discussed with ONGC and the GOI. Satisfactory steps have been taken to
resolve these issues, particularly in planning and budgeting and staffing
of the offshore project organization.
x.        ONGC's financial situation has been satisfactory in the past, and
the GOI has taken the necessary steps to raise the price of crude oil to
ONGC when required. Financial projections show that ONGC will generate
sufficient funds to repay its debt and contribute toward the cost of future
oil and gas development. Since the GOI has decided to finance the development
of Bombay High by equity and borrowings in equal ratios, ONGC's debt/equity
ratio will remain satisfactory and will leave a margin for further borrowings.
xi.       The GOI has set the price of offshore crude oil at US$5/barrel.
At this price the development of Bombay High should yield a discounted cash
flow (DCF) return to ONGC of about 19.8%, which is satisfactory. The GOI
has agreed that it will carry out from time to time a review of the price of
the oil and gas produced by ONGC to determine the price levels needed to
enable ONGC, under conditions of efficient operation, to meet its operat-
ing expenses and earn a return on invested capital sufficient to cover its
debt service requirements, maintain adequate working capital and finance a
substantial portion of its proposed capital expansion. ONGC has agreed that
it will prepare and furnish each year to the GOI an economic and financial
evaluation of the project and of any subsequent major development which will
indicate the level of price required for ONGC to earn a DCF return of at
least 15% and which will also provide information on ONGC's future financial
performance. In the light of ONGC's past and projected performance, it is
expected that ONGC's financial viability will be reflected in rates of return
on invested capital of 10 to 14%, a capacity to self-finance 30 to 50% of its
development expenditures and an annual debt service coverage of 2 to 2.5
times. It is expected that prices which would ensure a DCF return of 15%
would bring about at least-such results.
xii.      The development of Bombay High will increase India's domestic
energy resources and drastically reduce its dependence on imports. Oil
and gas will be used in domestic refineries, fertilizer and other indus-
trial plants. The Bombay High development program would yield an economic
return of 165% if sunk costs are excluded; this return would be 66% if sunk
costs are included. The return is less sensitive to variations in program
costs than to delays in production.  A delay of one year would reduce the
return (including sunk costs) to 50%, which would still be very satisfactory.
xiii.     Subject to the recommendations in Chapter VIII of this report,
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$150, million to the Goverament
of India for a 20-year term including three years grace.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The increases in the world oil prices in 1973/74 and in subsequent
years have led a number of countries to reassess their energy supply policies
and to look more intensively for domestic sources which could be substituted
for imports. In India, which imports 62% of its petroleum requirements, the
impact of the oil crisis on the balance of payments was very severe. The cost
of petroleum imports rose from US$265 million in 1973 to US$1.6 billion in
1976, when they accounted for about 25% of total imports. Since India's
petroleum consumption is low and limited to sectors where other sources of
energy cannot economically be substituted for petroleum, there is little scope
for reducing petroleum imports by developing alternative sources of energy.
The Government decided, therefore, to concentrate on developing indigenous
petroleum resources, particularly offshore where potential oil-bearing struc-
tures were known to exist but had not been explored since they were not deemed
commercial at pre-1973 prices. The Government entrusted the responsibility
for offshore exploration to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, a statutory
body created in 1959, which had been exploring for and developing hydrocarbon
resources onshore. In 1974 the Commission drilled its first exploratory well
in the Bombay High structure, located 160 km offshore Bombay, and struck oil.
Subsequent drilling led to the discovery of the North and South Bassein fields
100 km west of Bombay. The development of Bombay High proceeded rapidly;
commercial production started in May 1976 and rose to about two million tons
per year by March 1977. As of March 1977 proven recoverable reserves are
estimated at about 250 million tons of oil and 30,000 million cubic meters of
gas, which could yield up to 13 million tons of oil per year and 1,500 mil-
lion cubic meters of gas per year, at peak production.
1.02      In February 1976, the GOI requested the Bank to provide guidance
in a study of the utilization of natural gas and natural gas liquids to be
produced at Bombay High. A Bank mission visited India to assist in,the pre-
paration of terms of reference for this study, and at ONGC's request extended
its assistance to the preparation of terms of reference for a feasibility
study of facilities required to produce, transport and process the oil and gas
production of Bombay High. In 1976 the GOI requested Bank financing for the
development of the Bombay High (BH) and Bassein North (BN) fields.
1.03      The proposed project will be the first project in the Indian oil and
gas sector in which the Bank is involved. 1/ It includes the drilling of
development wells and the construction of production, processing, transport
and storage facilities required to utilize the oil and gas production of the
BH and BN fields. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$571
million, of which 73% is foreign exchange. A Bank loan of US$150 million is
recommended to finance the foreign exchange cost of the construction of two
subsea pipelines, and the construction and equipment of two processing plat-
forms, two well platforms and a gas processing plant. 2/ The Borrower will
be the Government of India which will relend the proceeds of the loan to
the Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

1.04      The present report is based on the conclusions of a preappraisal
mission in October-November 1976 and of an appraisal mission in January-
February 1977 consisting of Messrs. P. Bourcier (Economist), J. Chang
(Financial Analyst), L. Forget (Lawyer), H. Schober (Engineer) and R. Williams
(Financial Consultant, U.S.). The estimation of the hydrocarbon reserves is
based on two reports by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (Consultants, U.S.), which
were commissioned by the Bank.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      A striking feature of energy consumption in India is the very large
share of non-commercial energy in total energy supply. In FY71, the total
share of non-commercial fuels (animal and vegetable wastes, firewood, char-
coal, etc.) was estimated 1/ at 58% of total final consumption, the remainder
being divided among coal (16.5%), electricity (15.7%) and oil (9.8%). Tenta-
tive projections by various institutions and individuals in India and other
countries indicate that, while demand for non-commercial energy will decrease
in relative terms in the future, it will continue to increase at about the
same annual rate as the population.
B. Past and Projected Demand and Supply of Commercial Energy
2.02      In 1975, per capita consumption of commercial primary energy in
India was .157 tons of oil equivalent (Toe), or 11% of the world average.
Over the past ten years total demand for commercial primary energy grew
from 51.8 million Toe (MToe) to 93.2 MToe at an average rate of 6% per annum
(Annex 3). Energy elasticity to GNP, over the same period, was 1.85, com-
pared to an average of 1.4 for developing countries in the same income group.
The main consuming sectors are the mining, manufacturing and transport sec-
tors, which together account for about 78% of total demand. The remainder is
divided among residential and commercial (12.5%), agriculture (4.5%) and
others (5%). Since 1965 the sectoral distribution of energy demand has not
changed substantially. Demand projections by the GOI Fuel Policy Committee 2/
indicate that demand for commercial primary energy should grow at a somewhat
faster pace (8%) in the future to reach about 300 MToe by 1990 (Annex 4).
On the basis of these projections (which take into account the effect of the
1/   P.D. Henderson.  India:  The Energy Sector. 1974.
2/   Fuel Policy Committee Report, 1974.



-3..
increase in world oil prices in 1973/74), per capita consumption should reach
.350 Toe by 1990, which would be equivalent to the per capita consumption of
Brazil in the early 1970's.
2.03      India's energy policy is predicated on the maximum economic use of
domestic resources, mainly coal and hydropower and, since the late 1950's, pet-
roleum and natural gas.
(i) Coal
2.04      India's total coal reserves are estimated at 83,000 million metric
tons (Mmt) which should be sufficient to cover the needs of India for the
next 50 years under current assumptions of economic growth. Most coal seams
are concentrated in the northern and north-eastern parts of the country.
The coal sector is largely nationalized. Current coal production is about
100 Mmt and is expected to increase substantially in the future to reach about
135 Mmt by the end of 1978, and about 350 Mmt by 1990.  The total investment
required to bring about this level of production is estimated at US$7 billion,
spread over a period of 15 years. Most of the coal is used in power genera-
tionr (35%), steel industry (20%), other industry (15%) and railways (10%).
(ii) Hydropower and Nuclear Fuels
2.05      India's hydroelectric power potential has been estimated at 41,000
Megawatts (MW) based on a 60% load factor, of which 8,000 MW will have been
developed at the end of the Fifth Plan period (March 1979). The current
share of hydroelectric generation in total generation is 40% and is expected
to decrease to about 35% by 1990. India's resources of nuclear fuels consist
mainly of uranium and thorium, the former being used for the generation of
electric power. On the basis of current reserves, uranium supplies would meet
the demand for only a limited time, depending on the rate at which nuclear
facilities are built. Currently nuclear power generation accounts for only 2%
of total generation but is expected to reach about 10% by 1990.
(iii) Hydrocarbons
2.06      India has a large prospective area onshore (1.7 million sq. km)
which has only been partly explored. Its offshore prospective area (.3 mil-
lion sq. km) is currently under active exploration. By the end of 1974 a
total of about 330 Mmt of hydrocarbon reserves had been discovered onshore,
of which 70% were crude oil and 30% gas. Cumulative production to date is
about 100 MToe. In 1974 and 1976 the Bombay High and Bassein fields were
discovered. Proven reserves to date are estimated to be about 280 MToe
of which 90% are crude oil and 10% gas. Other hydrocarbon-bearing structures
in the same area are still under evaluation (Annex 5 and para. 4.01). Crude
oil production in FY77 was 8.9 Mmt of which about .5 Mmt was offshore; it
covered about 38% of total in ernal demand (Annex y); natural gas production
is about 2,300 million m (Mm ), of which 1,300 Mm are used in fertilizer and



-4-
other industries; the remainder is used on the fields or is flared because
there is no accessible market. Onshore production is concentrated in two
States: Assam in the northeast and Gujarat in the northwest. Petroleum is
mainly used in transportation (49%), the residential sector (28%) and industry
(11%) .
2.07      Despite the preferential use of coal, the share of oil and natural
gas in total commercial energy supply grew steadily from 21% in 1965 to about
32% in 1973. It has remained constant since, as a result of the increase in
the domestic price of refined products and of the steps taken to increase coal
production and to substitute coal for liquid fuels, wherever feasible.
Domestic production of petroleum has not kept pace with requirements, and
India's petroleum imports grew from 9.3 Mmt in 1965 to 15.4 Mmt in 1975 at a
cost of US$1.6 billion, equivalent to 24.5% and 34.5% of total merchandise
imports and exports, respectively. It is projected 1/ that the share of
petroleum products will be contained to about 20 to 30% of total primary
energy requirements, which appears reasonable.  On this basis petroleum demand
in India (for fuel and non-energy use) should reach about 50 Mmt by 1985. At
that time, the combined production of existing onshore fields and of BH and BN
should peak at about 26.5 Mmt, thus covering about 53% of total requirements
compared to 38% at present. Unless other fields are discovered and brought
into production, India's imports requirements would then be about 23.5 Mmt at
a cost of US$2.3 billion at present oil prices.
(iv)   Non-conventional energy prospects in India
2.08      Recently the Indian Government has shown considerable interest in
developing the use of bio-gas (methane produced from organic waste) as a source
of energy in rural areas. Even large-scale development would have little effect
on the demand for commercial energy since it would substitute principally for
non-commercial fuels. The potential for the use of solar water heaters for
domestic and small-scale commercial use exists but has not yet been developed.
In the future solar energy may substitute for commercial fuels to some extent,
but is more likely to meet an energy demand which would otherwise remain un-
fulfilled. Investigations of the geothermal potential are being carried on
in the Himalayan foothills, but the scope for large-scale geothermal develop-
ment in India is limited by unsuitable geological conditions in most of the
sub-continent, and its overall effect on the energy situation is likely to be
marginal at best.

III. THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR
A. Historical Development
3.01      According to the GOI's Industrial Policy Resolutions of 1948 and
1956, the development of the oil and gas sector is the responsibility of the
Central Government, and private firms are given a secondary role except when
their intervention is deemed to be in the national interest. Over time,
India's policies regarding the development of the oil and gas sector have
changed from an almost total reliance on foreign oil companies after Inde-
pendence to a strong emphasis on self-reliance until 1973/74. Recently,
India has followed a policy of compromise between national autonomy and
cooperation with foreign oil companies. (Annex 7 provides a historical over-
view of India's policies regarding the development of the oil and gas sector.)
3.02      Today the oil and gas sector consists mainly of public and semi-
public enterprises under the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals. Over the
past 30 years, the relative importance of these enterprises has varied accord-
ing to the resources that were available to them or to the role that they
could play in India's petroleum supplies.
(i) Refining and Marketing
3.03      In 1948 India was almost totally dependent on imports of refined
products. However, the GOI soon realized that future economic growth would
lead to ever-increasing demand for petroleum and that the reliance on imports
of refined products would be costly. The GOI therefore approved the con-
struction of domestic refineries, owned, supplied and operated by foreign com-
panies. This decision was a departure from the Industrial Policy Resolution
(1948); however it was expected that it would save foreign exchange 1/, pro-
vide expertise in the petroleum field and encourage oil companies to explore
for oil in India. This policy was followed until the early 1960's when the
GOI realized that existing supply contracts with foreign companies prevented
India from taking full advantage of the overall decrease in oil prices that
was taking place at that time. The GOI then decided to take over the pro-
curement of part of its crude oil requirements, to limit the expansion of
private refineries and to create sufficient public refining capacity to use
whatever crude oil it could obtain at lower cost. This led to the construc-
tion of several public refineries, with the assistance of Eastern European
countries, which were integrated into the Indian Oil Corporation in 1964.
By 1970 public refineries accounted for about 60% of the total crude oil
throughput.
3.04      Following the increase in world oil prices of 1973/74, the GOI
decided to limit domestic consumption of petroleum to the minimum compati-
ble with the projected economic growth. Among other things, this policy
1/   Several studies indicate that from 1955 to 1960 India saved some
US$150 million by refining imported crude oil rather than import-
ing petroleum products.



- 6 -
included drastic increases in the prices of refined products and a plan to
maximize the production of middle distillates (kerosene, diesel and gas oil)
which are in short supply. At the same time the GOI entered into a series
of negotiations to acquire part or all the assets of foreign companies.
These negotiations have been completed successfully and the GOI now owns
more than 85% of total refining capacity and has controlling interest in the
remainder.
(ii) Exploration and Development
3.05      Oil was first discovered in India by the Assam Oil Company (AOC) in
the 1880's. AOC produces very small quantities of oil from a virtually de-
pleted field in Assam. It is not active in exploration, and the GOI is cur-
rently negotiating its takeover.
3.06      The first major steps towards the exploration for and development
of hydrocarbon resources in India were taken in the early 1950's when the
GOI entered into joint ventures with Standard Vacuum Oil Company and with
Burmah Oil. The former, known as the Indo-Stanvac Project, was terminated in
1960 without positive results. The latter was successful in discovering oil
in the north-east and led to the creation of Oil India Ltd. (OIL), in which
the GOI had a participation of 33% initially which was increased to 50% in
1960. OIL's production started in 1959 and reached 3 Mmt in 1970; it has re-
mained constant since.
3.07      In the late 1950's, the GOI decided to increase exploration.
This decision was based upon the conclusions of Indian geologists, con-
firmed by a panel of international experts, that India's prospective area
was under-explored and that the potential for oil discovery was good. In
1959 the GOI created the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), which was
given the task of exploring for and developing petroleum resources in India,
outside the areas being prospected by OIL. ONGC started operations with the
assistance of experts from the USSR, and soon after (January 1961) discovered
oil and gas in Gujarat. ONGC's production started in 1961, reached 1.1 Mmt
in 1965, 3 Mmt in 1970 and 5.7 Mmt in 1976.  ONGC-'s initial success was not
followed by the discovery of any significant oil and/or gas reserves onshore.
The increase in world oil prices, however, led the GOI to intensify its
search for domestic oil and to promote exploration offshore. This effort
was successful and resulted in the discovery of Bombay High in 1974 and of
Bassein North and South in 1976.
3.08      ONGC has become India's main organization for the exploration for
petroleum and natural gas.  It has exclusive rights to undertake and/or
supervise these activities onshore (except in the areas allocated to OIL) and
offshore.  ONGC is a large organization with considerable experience in on-
shore operations. Until recently ONGC's experience offshore was limited to
some shallow-water fields in Gujarat.



-7-
B. Recent Developments
3.09      The increase in the world oil prices of 1973/74 led to a drastic
increase in the cost of petroleum imports and introduced the need for a
reappraisal of earlier programs for exploration and development and for
long-term supply of petroleum. The Report of the Fuel Policy Committee (1974)
analyzes the consequences of higher petroleum prices and makes the following
policy recommendations:
(i) steps should be taken to reduce the cost of production of
petroleum products;
(ii)  steps should be taken to improve the long-term security
of supply; and
(iii) imports of petroleum should be reduced by substituting
other fuels (coal) for petroleum and by increasing the
indigenous production of crude oil.
To achieve these objectives, the Fuel Policy Committee recommended inter alia
an optimization of the refining pattern to meet the projected product demand
mix at least cost, the negotiation of long-term supply agreements with OPEC
countries and the possibility of developing oil resources in the Middle East,
and an intensification of exploration in India, particularly offshore where
the most promising prospects were located.
3.10      The policy followed by the GOI since 1974, which is analyzed in
detail in World Bank Report 1172-IN 1/ and summarized below, is generally
in line with the Fuel Policy Committee's recommendations. The GOI has taken
steps to increase petroleum product prices and rationalize refinery operations
and expansion. It has also negotiated supply contracts with Iraq and Iran, and
ONGC has entered into joint venture and service contracts in Iraq, Iran and
Tanzania; The contract with Iran should provide about .7 Mmt per annum of
participation crude oil. Other foreign ventures may be considered in the
future. The most dramatic steps, however, were taken in exploration for and
development of domestic hydrocarbon resources and particularly in the explora-
tion and development of the offshore potential. ONGC's exploration program
onshore was expanded considerably. Offshore, first priority was given to the
development of the Bombay High and Bassein North fields which mark a turning
point in India's oil industry. In addition, the GOI decided to open ten
offshore areas to foreign exploration under production-sharing contracts.
Three contracts, in which ONGC has a working interest, were signed with
Reading and Bates (U.S.), Natomas (U.S.) and Asamera (Canada) to explore
in the Kutch Basin, the Bay of Bengal and the Cauvery Basin, respectively.
The first exploratory wells were sunk in 1975 and 1976 but no commercial
discovery has yet been made.

-8-
3.11      This increase in domestic exploration and development activities,
which will be carried out almost entirely by ONGC, is reflected in the suc-
cessive increases in the Plan allocation to the oil and gas sector. The
revised Fifth Plan target for exploration, development and refining during
the Plan period is Rs. 16,913 million (US$1,879 million), or 4.3% of total
Plan outlay. ONGC's allocation, which was originally Rs. 6,940 million
(US$771 million), is currently estimated at Rs. 10,561 million (US$1,173
million), equivalent to 62% of the sector's total expenditures excluding
petrochemicals. But even this amount, which is greatly increased over the
draft Fifth Plan, both in real and relative terms, is likely to be exceeded.
From a total FY75 Plan outlay of over Rs. 800 million, ONGC's Plan expendi-
tures rose to over Rs. 1,800 million and Rs. 2,800 million in FY76 and FY77,
respectively.
3.12      ONGC's current Five-Year Plan provides for the expansion of its
onshore activities to reach a production of about 33.3 Mmt over the Fifth
Plan period compared to 19.4 Mmt in the previous one. This will be achieved
mainly by introducing secondary recovery wherever feasible. In addition,
survey work, exploratory and development drilling will be intensified.
Modern digital equipment and computer facilities are being introduced, and
by March 1979, the number of drilling rigs will be increased by 19. Drill-
ing targets for FY78 are 294,000 meters compared to 191,000 in FY75. The
total cost of the onshore program through FY79 is estimated at about
Rs. 3,600 million (US$400 million).
3.13      Offshore, the emphasis will be on the completion of the development
of Bombay High and of North Bassein. The cost of this program, including
price contingencies, is estimated at US$1,774 million. The program, which is
described in Chapter IV, will be implemented by ONGC with the assistance of
outside consultants and contractors. The proposed project for which a Bank
loan of US$150 million is recommended consists of Phase III of the offshore
development program.
C. Longer-Term Perspectives
3.14      India has a large prospective offshore area which needs to be
explored and developed as soon as possible to offset future increases in
the cost of petroleum imports. However, the time frame in which this poten-
tial can be developed depends largely on the resources which are allocated
to the oil and gas sector and on ONGC's capability to manage a much larger
exploration and development program in the future. The GOI is aware of this
and has taken steps to secure a reliable resource base for the oil and gas
sector. Crude oil prices have been set at a level which will ensure that ONGC
will generate sufficient resources internally to finance a reasonable share of
the Bombay High and North Bassein development. In addition the GOI has given
high priority to the financing of the offshore program from Central Budget
resources and from the Oil Industry Development Board, created in 1974 to
assist in the financing of oil and gas projects, and is also mobilizing
alternative sources of financing (bilateral aid and commercial bank loans)
(para. 7.07).



D. The Role of the Bank
3.15      The discovery and development of Bombay High has presented the
GOI and the Commission with technical and managerial challenges to which
they have responded in a pragmatic way. However, further developments will
require further improvement in ONGC's managerial and technical capabilities,
particularly in long-term planning and budgeting. The Bank has been involved
in the preparation of the Bombay High Development Project (BHDP) and, can
continue to assist ONGC by providing advice on project evaluation methods
currently used in the oil industry. ONGC is instituting managerial and
financial improvements in offshore operations, and Bank involvement in the
proposed project can also be useful in this regard.
IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Main Characteristics of the Bombay High Area
4.01      The Bombay High and Bassein fields are located some 160 km and
100 km, respectively, offshore Bombay. They are part of a number of struc-
tures which were identified during a seismic survey in 1966 and which are
currently under-exploration. The Bombay High field was discovered in 1974
and the Bassein field in 1976. -Map 12775 shows the location of these
fields.
4.02      Total proven recoverable reserves of oil are currently estimated at
about 250 Mmt, using primary and secondary recovery techniques (depletion, gas
lift and water injection). In addition it is estimated that the Bombay High
and Bassein North fields could yield an additional 85 Mmt of oil when probable
reserves currently under evaluation have been confirmed. For the purpose
of this report, only proven reserves have been considered. Reserves esti-
mates are based on studies made by ONGC, the Indian Institute of Petroleum
Exploration and foreign consultants (Geoman, U.S., and Compagnie Francaise
des Petroles, France) and on an independent evaluation carried out by DeGolyer
and MacNaughton (consultants, U.S.) at the request of the Bank. The results
of these studies are summarized in Annex 8.
4.03      According to these studies, Bombay High maximum production should
reach about 225,000 barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil and about 3.4 Mm3/day
of associated gas by 1982. These projections are based on a production ex-
perience of about 12 months and are considered reasonable. The maximum
production of Bassein North is currently estimated at about 40,000 b/d which
is considered conservative. Continuous review of reservoir behavior will be



- 10 -
required during the life of the field, to optimize development and hydrocar-
bons recovery.  ONGC geologists have extensive experience in reservoir engi-
neering but are not familiar with this type of reservoir (limestone forma-
tion).  ONGC has entered into a four-year contract with Compagnie Francaise''
des Petroles (CFP), whereby CFP will assist ONGC staff'in the interpretatiorn'    '
of seismic data, in mathematical reservoir modelling and in production optimi-
zation using primary and enhanced recovery techniques.  ONGC has agreed to
submit to the Bank an updated development plan of the Bombay High and North
Bassein fields by the end of each calendar year starting in 1977.
B.  The Development Program
4.04      On the basis of existing reserves studies ONGC, the potential'users
and their consultants have prepared plans for the development and utilization
of the crude oil and natural gas to be produced in the Bombay High area untt
1982.                      '"
4.05      ONGC's development program was approved by the Commission in January
1977, at a meeting attended by the Secretary (Economic Affairs),. Ministry- of
Finance and the Secretary (Petroleum), Ministry of Petroleum and chemicals.
These plans call for development in five phases.  Phases I and II; ..'  ch   ea.X
almost completed, consist of the construction of the production,f'acilitie       X
(wells, well and production platforms) required to reach a productlon.'cap''- 
ity of 80,000 b/d (4 Mmt/year) by the end of 1977 and of the constructionffof0
temporary tanker transport facilities to bring crude oil to shore.  Duing -
Phase I and II all the associated gas will be flared offshore.  Phase IIf-was
approved by the Government in May 1977 and consists of the drilling of a        
20 development wells and the construction of about five well platforms to-6~,t, 2_,
reach a production of 140,000 bld by the end of 1978, as wellt as the. const -
tion of three processing platforms, permanent pipeline transport faciilties~
and shore facilities.  Phase IV and V will consist of the constructione of
additional facilities to reach a production of 265,000 b/d by 1982, in
ing the drilling of about 60 to 70 development wells and about.30: waterin-
jection wells and the construction of the corresponding well platforms- andX i
processing facilities.  The entire program is expected to extend into ithe,i
early 1980's at a total cost estimated at US$1,774 million, of vhich DS204'
million will be for Phase I and II, US$571 million for Phase III I/:a  'iI
US$999 million for Phases IV and V.
4.06      The crude oil and natural gas produced at Bombay High and Bassein lW
North will be substituted for imported crude oil supplies to domestic 're'-2   + ';.2.';^
fineries and used in fertilizer and other industrial plants.  Because of-,'`.-

- 11 -
the characteristics of the Bombay High crude oil (high wax content, high
pour point), some modifications are required at existing refineries. The
Trombay refineries, which are the first concerned, have already completed
most of the revamping and other refineries are expected to carry out the
necessary adjustments during the execution of Phase III. Current plans are
to use the associated gas in the Trombay fertilizer complex of the Fertil-
izer Corporation of India (FCI). The decision to convert some units to
natural gas at FCI's Trombay plant has already been taken and further gas
utilization studies are being carried out with the assistance of Stone and
Webster (Consultants, U.S.). Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) will be used in
the residential and commercial market.
C. Status of Development
4.07      The first phase was completed in March 1977, three months behind
schedule because of unexpected problems in the driving of piles for one
platform. It consisted of the drilling of ten development wells and of-the
construction of three well platforms and one, production platform in the
northern part of the Bombay High field to achieve a production of 40,000 b/d.
It also included the construction of two Single Buoy Moorings to anchor a
storage tanker and a shuttle tanker. This temporary transportation system
permitted commercial production to start in May 1976, but had to be inter-
rupted during the monsoon. The second phase, which is essentially identical
to the first, is virtually completed and total production from Bombay High
will reach 80,000 b/d by the end of 1977 as planned. During Phase I and II
most of the exploratory and development drilling was carried out by contrac-
tors under the supervision of ONGC Offshore Operations Division (para. 4.19).
Construction of the well platforms and of two production platforms was carried
out by McDermott (Contractors, U.S.) under the supervision cf ONGC's Offshore
Construction Division (para. 4.19).
D. The Project
4.08      The project comprises Phase III of ONGC's development program and
includes the facilities listed below. Annex 9 gives a detailed description
of the project facilities and of the operations for which they are required.
(i)  Development drilling.  About 16 production wells will
be drilled at Bombay High North and 4 at Bassein along
with the necessary well platforms. Four deviated wells
draining an area of about 6 sq. km. will be drilled
from each platform. These will be connected by
subsea gathering lines to the main processing plat-
forms.



- 12 -
(ii)  Processing platforms.  A total of three processing platforms
will be installed, two in the northern part of the Bombay
High field and one at Bassein North. The BH platforms will
have a combined capacity of 160,000 b/d and the capacity of
the BN platform will be 60,000 b/d.
(iii)  Subsea pipelines.  Two 209 km subsea pipelines, 30" and 26"
in diameter, will be laid to transport oil and gas, respec-
tively.
(iv)  Onshore terminal.  The two subsea pipelines will terminate
at Uran (in the Bay of Trombay), where a terminal will be
built, including a crude oil stabilization unit, a gas
processing plant and storage facilities, from which the
crude oil will be pumped to the Trombay refineries. Ex-
isting pipelines between Butcher Island and Trombay will
be used to load the crude aboard tankers for shipment to
coastal refineries or for export.
(v)  Supply lines.  Four different supply lines, 8" to 30" in
diameter, will cross the Bay of Trombay to connect the Uran
terminial to the various users.
(vi)  Supply base.  Berthing facilities for supply vessels,
repair shops, warehouses, administrative buildings and
offices will be built at Nhava Sheva, a site recently
acquired by ONGC.
(vii)  Telecommunications and control.  A telemetric communica-
tion and control system will be installed to cover the
entire Bombay High program.
(viii) Engineering and technical services. Consultants have been
or will be engaged to prepare detailed engineering designs,
supervise construction and assist ONGC in overall project
management.
E. Status of Engineering
4.09      The Phase III facilities are based on a feasibility study prepared
in 1976 by Pipe Line Technologists (PLT), Consultants, UK. This study defined
the main parameters of the pipelines, processing platforms and onshore facil-
ities. In addition ONGC retained Engineers India Limited (EIL) in collabora-
tion with Crest Engineering (U.S.) to carry out additional studies on the
Bombay High North and Bassein North processing platforms. These consulting
organizations were subsequently assigned to engineer, design and assist in
the supervision of the construction of the pipelines and interim platform
(para. 4.20) (PLT) and of the Bassein North and Bombay High processing plat-
forms (EIL/ Crest).



- 13 -
4.10      PLT have completed design and procurement documents for the two sub-
sea pipelines, the land and harbor supply pipelines and the interim processing
platform at Bombay High North. Contracts for pipe and related materials
have been awarded. Bids have been received for the interim platform and
are being evaluated. The pipe construction bid documents have been issued
and contract awards are scheduled for the latter part of July 1977.
4.11      EIL/Crest are designing the Bassein North process platform and are
scheduled to have bid documents ready for issue by July 1977. They will then
design and prepare bid documents for the Bombay High North platform for which
bid invitations are scheduled to be issued during August 1977.
4.12      Engineering consultants for the onshore terminal at Uran have been
selected. It is expected that the crude oil stabilization, oil storage and
pumping portion of the work will be assigned to Humphreys and Glasgow (Con-
sultants, U.K.) after the GOI has approved the contract. A consulting firm
must still be selected for the gas processing plant, but there is no immediate
urgency in starting this work.
4.13      Peter Fraenkel and Partners (Consultants, U.K.) have been given
engineering and design responsibility for the Nhava Sheva supply base. Tele-
communication and control facilities have been assigned to Burmah Oil Engi-
neering and the Defense Ministry. All engineering consultants engaged by
ONGC are experienced and qualified for the tasks assigned to them. ONGC
has agreed that they will continue to use consultants whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the
Bank, until the completion of the Project.
F. Cost Estimates
4.14      The Project cost is estimated at US$571.0 million, including con-
tingencies and customs duties (from which part of the offshore facilities are
exempted). The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$417.0 million
or 73%. Annex 10 gives details of the cost estimates which are summarized
below. Annex 12 indicates the phasing of expenditures over the period 1977-
1981.

Development drilling costs were derived from ONGC's historical costs and
reflect conditions likely to prevail in the next two years. However, an
overall physical contingency of 15% was applied to the cost of wells and
well platforms to account for non-productive wells. The costs of infra-
structure are based on PLT cost estimates and reflect conditions in early
1977. Physical contingencies of 57 and 25%, 1/ respectively, were applied
on the cost of materials and construction for the main offshore facilities
(pipelines and platforms). For the shore facilities and telecommunications
system, which have not yet been designed in detail, an overall physical
contingency of 20% was applied. Price contingencies amount to 8% of the
project cost (including physical contingencies) and are based on an annual
rate of escalation of 7% for material and equipment and of 9% for civil
works.
4.15      The cost of consultants' services was estimated on the basis
of actual contracts and of prevailing rates in India and abroad. 2/ Total
manpower requirements are estimated to be 11,000 man-months of which about
70% will be foreign. The average cost per man-month is estimated at
US$3,600 and US$1,800 for foreign and local consultants, respectively.
G. Items Proposed for Bank Financing
4.16      The proposed Bank Loan of US$150.0 million would finance the for-
eign exchange cost of the construction of the two subsea pipelines and the
equipment and installation of the Bassein North and Bombay High North pro-
cessing platforms, two well platforms and the gas processing plant. These
contracts are suitable for international competitive bidding and are likely
to attract a large number of suppliers and contractors. The proposed Bank
loan would finance about 26% of the total cost, and about 36% of the foreign
exchange cost of the project, including contingencies.
1/   The high physical contingencies reflect the difficulty of offshore
construction which depends on unpredictable weather conditions.
2/   These costs do not include the cost of CFP's services which will extend
beyond the scope of the proposed project and will not be limited to
Bombay High.

H. Financing Plan
4.17      ONGC's total financial requirements from FY78 to FY80 for Bombay
High and Bassein North development expenditures, are currently estimated at
Rs 8,438 million (US$937.6 million), of which Rs 5,147 million (US$571 mil-
lion) is for the project and Rs 3,291 million (US$366.6 million) is for
Phases IV and V. ONGC's financial projections show that Rs 3,486 million
(US$387.3 million) will be financed from internal cash generation. The
balance will be financed, in equal ratios, by equity contributions from
the GOI and loans from the GOI and the Oil Industry Development Board, as
indicated below:

lion) and commercial banks (US$50 million).
4.18      The GOI has agreed that it would relend the proceeds of the Bank
loan to ONGC at an interest rate of 10-1/4% per annum for a period not exceed-
ing 20 years including three years of grace. The GOI has further agreed that
it would provide sufficient funds to meet ONGC's financial requirements for
the project and other investments.
I. Project Execution, Supervision and Reporting
Execution
4.19      The Offshore Operations and Construction Divisions will be respon-
sible for project implementation and supervision with the assistance of out-
side consultants (para. 4.w9-4.13) and of ONGC's advisory services. The



- 17 -
Operations Division, which will supervise and coordinate development drilling,
is qualified and sufficiently staffed to supervise drilling contractors. The
staff of the Construction Division is competent and is currently being in-
creased to meet the additional work load generated by the project. ONGC
has already transferred experienced personnel from its onshore operations
to the project staff and has appointed an offshore project manager who will
also be responsible for the entire Construction Division. Experienced sub-
project managers have been appointed for the pipelines, platforms and crude
oil stabilization plant. The selection of subproject managers for telecom-
munications and for the gas processing plant is underway. These arrangements
are satisfactory. However, there is a need to improve the Construction
Division's capability in project scheduling and in overall project management.
ONGC has agreed to hire management consultants to assist in the establishment
of adequate project management procedures and of an appropriate management
information system prior to December 31, 1977.
Construction Schedule
4.20      The project should be constructed over a period of two years with
most of the offshore facilities being completed by mid-1978 (Annex 11 shows
the proposed construction schedule). Because of the impossibility of under-
taking any major construction offshore during the monsoon (June to October),
ONGC has decided to complete the two subsea pipelines, the Bassein North
platform, the critical facilities of the onshore terminal and the supply line
by May 1978. The Bombay High North platform will be completed only at the end
of 1978 or early in 1979. However, in order to ensure that the two pipelines
can be used during the 1978 monsoon to transport oil and gas (the latter would
continue to be flared otherwise), ONGC has decided that an interim platform
will be installed at Bombay High by May 1978. This platform, will be built
adjacent to the location of, and will be subsequently connected to, the Bombay
High North platform. Although the construction schedule is tight, it is
achievable and the fact that there is a temporary worldwide lull in offshore
construction activity should help ONGC achieve its objectives.
Supervision and Reporting
4.21      ONGC is competent to supervise the execution of the project with the
assistance of management consultants (para. 4.19) and of the consultants
referred to in paras 4.09 to 4.13. ONGC's internal reporting procedures
will be improved under the provision of para. 6.08. ONGC has agreed to send
copies of quarterly progress reports to the Bank.



- 18 -
J. Procurement and Disbursement
4.22      International competitive bidding procedures, in accordance with
Bank guidelines, will be followed for the Bank-financed items. No local
suppliers or contractors are expected to bid on these terms; however, for the
purpose of bid evaluation, a preference of 15% or the custom duty, whichever
is less, will be applied to any local bid. Bid invitation and evaluation will
be the responsibility of ONGC with assistance from consultants as required.
ONGC's normal procurement procedure for foreign supplies requires worldwide
bidding similar to the Bank's ICB.  It is expected that this procedure will be
applied for all imported equipment and services not financed by the proceeds
of the Bank loan. ONGC has indicated that, in order to save time, it was
their intention to call for lump sum bids for the Bassein North and Bombay
High North platforms; since this procedure will not restrict competition, it
is acceptable to the Bank. Bid invitations for critical items with limited
availability, which are essential to efficient execution of the project and
estimated to cost less than US$2 million, may be sent directly to the quali-
fied available suppliers, provided that the Bank's prior approval is obtained
for these items and the list of suppliers and that the aggregate amount
procured under this procedure does not exceed US$7.5 million.
4.23      Disbursement will cover 100% of the foreign cost of Bank financed
contracts. Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected to be completed in
three years. (Annex 13 gives the estimated schedule of disbursement of
the Bank loan.) The closing date of the proposed loan would be December 31,
1980.
K. Right-of-Way and Land Acquisition
4.24      No right-of-way problem is expected offshore, since ONGC's proposed
pipeline route does not cross any shipping channel. Onshore, ONGC is in the
process of acquiring the land required for the Uran terminal and the supply
base. Negotiations are at an advanced stage and no difficulties are expected.
The onshore supply lines have to be routed so as to minimize right-of-way
problems and negotiations with the Port Authority and other State Government
agencies are progressing satisfactorily. Obtaining formal title may take
time but is not expected to delay project execution.  ONGC has agreed to
take all actions necessary to acquire as and when needed the land and rights-
of-way required for construction of the project facilities.
L. Operations and Training
4.25      ONGC's staff is adequately trained to carry on its present off-
shore operations, but operating and maintaining the new and more complex
facilities of the Bombay High project will require additional operational
and supervisory staff training. (See Annex 9 for a description of ONGC's
operations and facilities.) ONGC's management recognizes the need for



- 19 -
this training and has budgeted the equivalent of US$700,000 to fund a train-
ing program. A detailed program is being formulated. It will comprise local
and on-the-job training, training abroad at equipment manufacturers' plants
and foreign installations, and various special training related to offshore
operations, safety, pollution control and related subjects. As part of its
program, ONGC plans to accept offers of offshore training by the British and
Norwegian governments. These arrangements are satisfactory.
M.  Ecology and Safety
4.26      Pipelines properly protected, maintained and operated pose no
serious environmental hazards. Accordingly, all necessary precautions will
be taken during design and construction of the oil and gas pipelines to
minimize the chances of overpressurization, corrosion and third-party
damage. The offshore and terminal facilities will not cause noticeable
atmospheric pollution, and effluents, essentially oily water and human
waste, will be adequately treated before disposal. ONGC is procuring a
vessel outfitted for offshore fire-fighting and oil spill clean-up. In
addition the GOI is activating a National Coast Guard service, which will
be assigned responsibility to assist in offshore oil emergencies. All
manned platforms will be equipped for fire-fighting and will be provided
with proper emergency escape and survival systems (Annex 14). In addition,
ONGC plans to adopt the North Sea safety regulations during construction,
and has commissioned an in depth study of the environmental and safety
aspects of the project. The study will be financed by UNDP.
N.  Project Risks
4.27      The risks normally associated with hydrocarbon development projects
are compounded for offshore ventures by weather conditions. However, over
the years the industry has developed techniques and technologies which, if
they do not eliminate risks, reduce them to an acceptable level. The tech-
nical solutions selected by ONGC have been proved reliable, ONGC's con-
sultants have considerable experience in the design and construction of
offshore and onshore facilities, and experienced contractors will be selected
for project implementation. ONGC's staff is qualified and experienced in all
the facets of oil and gas production, processing and utilization and, there-
fore, the risk of errors in design and/or operation is minimal. Weather
conditions, however, are not predictable and may cause delays despite the
precautions taken to avoid major construction work offshore during the monsoon.
4.28      9'ere is a risk that the fields will not live up to ONGC's expecta-
tions. It is impossible to fully predict the behavior of a reservoir, and
fields have been known to "dry up" much sooner than expected. ONGC has been
careful and conservative in its approach to the evaluation of the fields and



- 20 -
has used experienced consultants to assess both the reserves and the produc-
tion mechanisms. All estimates are consistent and show that the fields
should eventually produce more than was anticipated originally. During the
early years of production, ONGC staff and CFP will monitor the behavior of
the reservoirs and provide sufficiently advanced warning of any problems for
ONGC to take remedial actions.
0. Further Expansion of the Bombay High Area
4.29      The two main structures, Bombay High and Bassein North, are under
intensive development. Another structure, Bassein South, has been identified,
and is a gas field. Other structures at the periphery of BH are still under
exploration; several wells have been drilled which have indicated the pres-
ence of hydrocarbons but not of commercial quantity. There are several un-
explored structures in the area which, on the basis of seismic data, appear
to be as promising as the two Bassein fields. It is likely that the total oil
and gas recovery from this area will exceed what is currently planned for BH
and BN. For this reason the pipeline and platforms have been designed for a
higher ultimate capacity so as to avoid costly capacity expansion if more oil
and/or gas is discovered. This is standard practice in offshore development,
and the impact on the project cost is minimal as the costs of the pipeline and
of the platforms are not very sensitive to size.
4.30      The Bassein South field will not be developed in the near future
since there is no immediate outlet for the gas. Several alternatives are
being considered for the future utilization of this gas, the most likely
being to use the gas in the Trombay area or in Gujarat.
V. JUSTIFICATION-
A. General
5.01      The discovery and development of Bombay High and Bassein represents
a significant step towards India's self-sufficiency in petroleum. Until
recently, it was expected that the share of onshore production in total
petroleum requirements would decrease in relative terms, although production
would continue to increase at about 4% per annum. The development of offshore
fields will reverse this trend and total domestic production from onshore and
offshore fields is now expected to reach about 50% and 36% of total internal
requirements in 1985 and 1990, respectively, thus saving India about US$16.0
billion over the next 20 years.



- 21 -
B. Sector Objectives
5.02      ONGC is, and will continue to be, the main oil exploration and
development agency in India, either on its own, as in the case of Bombay
High, or in association with foreign oil companies which are currently
operating under production-sharing contracts. In spite of its lack of
experience offshore, ONG has managed the development of a giant field 1/
very efficiently . The Commission has used outside consultants and contrac-
tors to assist their staff in the design of the program and in the construc-
tion of the first stage, while training their staff in offshore development
techniques. Faced with the single largest development program in the history
of India's oil and gas sector, the Government has taken steps to make foreign
exchange available in time and to eliminate bureaucratic procedures, which
might have delayed the program. India's offshore potential remains, how-
ever, largely unexplored, and Bombay High is only the first step in a long
process which could eventually lead to self-sufficiency in oil. It is
currently estimated that about US$1.5 to 2 billion would have to be invested,
in exploration alone, over the next 10 years to fully evaluate India's poten-
tial. Part of the resources required may be provided by foreign oil companies
under production-sharing contracts. However, the GOI and ONGC will have to
allocate a substantial part of the income generated by Bombay High to finance
their own share of exploration and to develop any new resources that may be
discovered, if the current offshore momentum is to be maintained in the
future.
5.03      For the first time, the Bank has been directly involved in the oil
and gas sector. Its initial involvement, in the preparation of terms of
reference for the utilization of natural gas, was extended to the preparation
of terms of reference for the initial feasibility studies of Phase III of the
development program and the review of consultants' proposals. During the
preparation of the Project, the GOI, ONGC and the Bank have identified and
discussed a number of institutional issues which have been or are in the
process of being resolved satisfactorily, i.e., long-term planning and budget-
ing (paras. 6.06 and 6.07), ONGC's management information system (para. 6.08)
and the need for external consultants in project management (para. 4.19) and
reservoir engineering (para. 4.03). But these are only the first steps in the
strengthening of ONGC's managerial and operational capabilities, which is
required to manage the much larger and complex exploration and development
program that lies ahead. The role of the Bank should therefore be viewed in a
somewhat broader perspective, which is to assist ONGC in building up an
organization which will help India become self-sufficient in petroleum in the
1/   By industry standards, a giant field is a field that would yield more
than 500 million barrels (about 70 million tons) of recoverable oil
reserves.



- 22 -
minimum possible time at least cost. One of the areas in which the Bank has
been and will continue to be of immediate assistance is in providing advice
on how the methods used by oil companies to evaluate the feasibility of oil
development projects (para. 5.05) can be used in ONGC's context.
C.   Justification of the Bombay High Offshore Development Program
5.05      Oil companies have developed financial analysis procedures to
assist management in deciding which projects should be developed and in which
order, and how limited capital funds can be allocated in the most efficient
way. To do this two levels of analysis are required. First, each project
must yield a discounted cash flow (DCF) rate of return and payout time which
satisfy the profitability and cash flow objectives of the enterprise. Second,
since there are several ways in which a field can be produced, the rate of re-
turn on incremental capital outlays for different alternatives must be eval-
uated. While these procedures were originally developed for private
oil companies, they also apply to national oil companies such as ONGC.
5.06      The evaluation of the Bombay High Offshore Development Program
(BHDP), including Phases Ito V, has been carried out on the basis of the
production schedule-derived from the De Golyer and MacNaughton studies (para.
4.02) and under two different price assumptions (US$13 per barrel, which
is the present international price and US$5 per barrel which is the price
set by the GOI for offshore crude oil). The results of the analysis are
in Annex 22 and are summarized below. The purpose of this evaluation is
to determine the impact of the entire program, as opposed to the Project,
on the economy of India (US$13/barrel, excluding income tax) and on ONGC's
current and future financial viability (US$5/barrel, including income tax).

5.07      At US$13/barrel, excluding income tax, the development of Bombay
High and North Bassein would yield a DCF return of 66.2%. The Net Present
Value (NPV) of the savings generated by the Program at the opportunity cost
of capital (estimated at 10%) would be Rs 60,138 million (US$6,682 million)
over the life of the fields, reflecting a discounted production cost per
barrel of about US$3.15 per barrel.
5.08      At US$5/barrel, the Program would yield a DCF return after taxes
of 19.8% to ONGC. This return is comparable to what international oil com-
panies normally require for their domestic operations and is considered
satisfactory. The following table summarizes the breakdown of the cost of
oil per barrel calculated on the basis of annual depreciation:

This shows that the current price of US$5/per barrel to ONGC is adequate to
cover production and exploration costs, and generate a reasonable profit
after tax. Each discovery should, however, be considered as a separate
project and it would therefore be appropriate for the GOI to reconsider the
price paid to ONGC for oil and natural gas so that, within the limits set by
international prices, prices are set at a level which would permit an effi-
ciently operated ONGC to earn an acceptable DCF return and to finance a
reasonable portion of its exploration and development.  Since ONGC's market
for crude oil and natural gas is a captive market and since ONGC does not
incur any political risk in its domestic operations, a DCF rate of return
of 15% over the life of the project would be considered satisfactory.
D. Economic Justification
Market
5.09      The production of Bombay High and Bassein North will consist of
crude oil and associated gas. After treatment, the latter will yield lean
gas, consisting mainly of methane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consisting
of butane, propane and heavier fractions. The estimated production schedule
for these products is given in Annex 24. The three products -- crude oil,
associated gas and LPG -- have different markets which have been investigated
separately. Bombay High and North Bassein crude oil will be substituted for
imports, lean gas will be used as feedstock in the fertilizer industry and
LPG will be used initially in the residential and commercial sector. The
cost of the facilities required to utilize these products is estimated at
US$32.3 million of which US$10 million would be required to carry out minor
modifications to existing refineries, US$18 million would be required for
the conversion of the Trombay fertilizer plant and US$4.3 million for LPG
storage and distribution facilities (Annex 24).
Cost/Benefit Analysis
5.10      Several production schedules for the Bombay High Field, involving
different drilling and investment programs, were investigated by De Golyer
and MacNaughton in their studies. Two cases were selected on technical
grounds and a cost/benefit analysis was carried out to compare their eco-
nomic merits. Details of the analysis are given in Annex 23 and summarized
below.

ONGC current development plans are based on the first case which maximize
oil recovery and avoid the construction of peak facilities which would be
used for a short period of time.
5.11      Annex 23 provides the assumptions used in the economic evaluation
of the development program. On the basis of present international prices
for crude oil (US$13/barrel) and-of the prices at which ONGC will sell
natural gas and LPG (US$55,000 m  and US$90/T) the program would yield an
economic return of 165% if sunk costs are excluded. If sunk costs are in-
cluded the economic return would be 66%. Since sunk costs are essentially
exploration and early development drilling expenditures, the latter pro-
vides a better appreciation of the economic feasibility of the entire pro-
gram. The economic return is not very sensitive to variations in the pro-
gram costs; an increase in the program cost of 20% would bring the economic



- 26 -
return to 56%. It is more sensitive to delays in production; a delay of one
year in the production schedule would bring the return to about 50%, which,
however, would still be satisfactory. No attempt has been made to calculate
an incremental return for the project since the facilities included in Phase
III cannot be dissociated from those already constructed under Phases I and
II and those planned for Phases IV and V.
VI. THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION
A. General
6.01      The Oil and Natural Gas Commission is a Government owned statutory
body created in 1959 by an Act of Parliament to "plan, promote and imple-
ment the development of petroleum resources and the production and sale of
petroleum products produced by it." ONGC's statutes provide that it is a
corporate body with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property and to
contract. ONGC has authority to borrow. The Commission consists of a
Chairman, and not less than two and no more than eight Members appointed by
the Government for a period of five years.
6.02      At present, the Commission consists of the Chairman, four full-time
Members (Finance, Materials, Production and Exploration) and of two part-time
Members representing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Petroleum.
All decisions of the Commission must be approved by the majority of the mem-
bers. ONGC owns Hydrocarbons India Ltd., a subsidiary which is in charge
of the Commission's ventures abroad (Iran, Iraq and Tanzania).
B. Organization and Management
6.03      The Commission acts very much as a Board of Directors and is
responsible for setting ONGC's policies. Its development plan has to be
approved by the Planning Commission and its annual budget for current and
capital expenditures has to be approved by the Ministry of Petroleum and the
Ministry of Finance before it is sanctioned by Parliament. Over time, the
Commission, which was originally part of the Geological Survey of India,
has evolved into a full fledged oil company which is still governed by the
financial practices of an advisory commission. However, since the discov-
ery of Bombay High, the GOI and the Commission have taken actions to ensure
that these practices would not be an obstacle to efficient project implemen-
tation. Recent decisions regarding the approval of ONGC's expenditures
and the financing of the Bombay High Offshore Development Program reflect
their intention to introduce more adequate practices into ONGC's financial
management (paras 6.07 and 7.07).



- 27 -
6.04      The administrative and financial functions (planning, procurement
and stores, accounting, personnel, computer activities, etc.) are centralized
in the corporate headquarters at Dehra Dun, along with the main research and
development and training facilities. Operational staff is divided among three
Regional Offices (Central, Western and Eastern Regions) and the Bombay High
Development Project (BHDP), whose headquarters are in Bombay. Prior to 1974
most of the operational decisions were taken centrally from Dehra Dun and the
Regional Managers had little, if any, authority. Over the past three years
the decision-making process has been decentralized to the regions, which now
have operational responsibility and the authority to commit funds within their
approved budget. As of January 1977 ONGC's total staff was 23,000 of which
1,500 were engineers and technicians. Annex 15 shows ONGC's current organiza-
tion. ONGC's onshore staff is large compared to its current production. Man-
agement is conscious of this fact and is implementing a policy whereby only
key personnel are replaced.
6.05      BHDP was created in FY74 to deal with exploration and development
in the Bombay High area. Over the past three years, its staff grew from 20 to
600, and consists mostly of engineers and technicians. Because of the size of
the Bombay High Development Program, its economic importance to India and the
need for rapid decisions, ONGC's senior management and, more particularly, the
Chairman, the Member (Finance) and the Member (Offshore) have been directly
involved in BHDP management. At present, most of the decisions concerning the
Program are referred directly to the Chairman. While this procedure has had
the advantage of speeding up decisions in the early stages of the program, it
is not adequate for the purpose of the project, which will require that a
large number of decisions be taken at the field level. ONGC's senior manage-
ment is conscious of this problem and has decided to appoint a managing direc-
tor for the offshore development program. This manager will be assisted by
two directors (finance and material) and would be responsible for the imple-
mentation of the program, while ONGC's headquarters would be responsible
for long term financial planning and overall offshore development policies.
In addition ONGC has already taken steps to improve its planning, budgeting
and reporting procedures (paras. 6.06 to 6.08) and to train additional staff
(para. 4.25).
Planning and Budgeting
6.06      ONGC's current five-year plan covers the period FY75-FY79, and
coincides with India's Five-Year Plan. The original targets of the Com-
mission's plan have been revised several times to take into account the
development of Bombay High and North Bassein. These modifications have been
done piecemeal and do not fully integrate the financial, technical and eco-
nomic implications of the Program. The dynamic nature of the oil industry, in
which a new discovery may justify a complete reassessment of priorities, calls
for a flexible planning framework in which the relative merits of potential
projects can be continuously evaluated. The Ccmmission is conscious of this
and has created a Perspective Planning Section in Dehra Dun to review its
current five-year plan and more generally be responsible for long-term plan-
ning. The main functions of this section are to analyze the data produced



- 28 -
by ONGC's technical and financial departments and to continuously update
ONGC's five-year plan in the light of new developments. It is the Commis-
sion's intention to periodically review the staffing of this section and
to introduce more sophisticated project evaluation techniques.
6.07      In October of each year, the Commission submits separate budgets
for its onshore and offshore operations for approval by the Government.   Each
budget includes ONGC's projected capital and current expenditures for the fol-
lowing fiscal year and revised estimates for the current year. If ONGC's re-
sources are not sufficient to cover its future financial requirements, the
annual budget also includes a request for support from the Central Budget
which has to be approved by Parliament. Central Budget resources are nor-
mally allocated either as GOI contribution to equity (exploration expendi-
tures) or as loans (development expenditures). Within the approved budget
the Commission has to obtain Government approval for the implementation of
any scheme which involves a capital expenditure in excess of Rs. 50 million
(US$5.6 million). To expedite procurement decisions, the GOI has created a
Committee consisting of two representatives of the Ministry of Petroleum,
a representative of the Ministry of Finance and of three Members of the Com-
mission (Finance, Materials and Offshore) for the approval of expenditures
under Phase III of the development program. Since Phase III has been
approved by the Government, this Committee can decide on the expenditure
sanction on the basis of bid evaluation without requiring any further proj-
ect justification.
Performance Monitoring
6.08      The Commission's management information system is weak, due partly
to the dispersion of onshore activities and to communication problems with
headquarters and partly to the lack of adequate reporting procedures. During
negotiations, ONGC agreed to establish an adequate management information
system prior to December 31, 1977, with the assistance of the management
consultants referred to in para. 4.19.
C. Operations
6.09      The Commission is primarily involved in exploration, develop-
ment, transportation and treatment of hydrocarbons. It is not currently
involved in down-stream activities (refining, processing, utilization and
distribution). As a result of the project the Commission's operations will
be widened offshore but are not expected to undergo any substantial change
in scope.



- 29 -
D. Insurance
6.10      ONGC has adequate insurance coverage with several insurance com-
panies in India which are re-insured in the International Market (Annex 17).
Insurance of offshore equipment follows the international practice, whereby
designs are certified by independent agencies. ONGC's insurance coverage is
satisfactory.
E. Finances
6.11      ONGC's accounting system provides for a segregation of project
activities. The Commission's financial organization is adequate and account-
ing practices are effective. However current procedures and formats are still
manually compiled and could be improved by better use of ONGC's existing
computing facilities. This will be reviewed in the formulation of the Manage-
ment Information System (para. 6.08). ONGC's main source of revenue is its
sales of crude oil and natural gas to domestic refineries and industries at a
price fixed by the Government. The Commission pays royalties to the State in
which it operates and pays income tax to the Government at a rate of 57.75%.
According to the statutes, ONGC should pay dividends to the Government, but
is exempted from doing so when it declares a loss or borrows from the OIDB
and/or the GOI. So far ONGC has not declared any dividend payment. Over the
past three years the Commission has made an operational surplus but has had
to borrow from OIDB and the GOI to finance an increasing part of its offshore
development program (para. 7.04). Current financial projections show that
this situation will continue in the future.
F. Audit
6.12      Each project unit has a Finance and Accounts Section reporting to
the Project Manager and to the Member (Finance) at ONGC's headquarters.
Internal audit is satisfactory. ONGC's accounts are audited by the Comptroller
and Auditor General which is acceptable to the Bank. While ONGC's accounts
are generally available, at the latest, four months after the close of the
accounting exercise, ONGCGs rules and regulations provide that audited
accounts cannot be made public before they have been approved by Parliament.
ONGC has agreed that the Commission's audited accounts will be submitted to
the Bank not later than twelve months after the end of the fiscal year.
Provisional accounts will be available for review by Bank supervision missions
not later than four months after the end of the fiscal year.



- 30 -
G. Prices
6.13      Crude oil and natural gas prices are controlled by the GOI.  Crude
oil and natural gas prices are revised every three years upon the recommenda-
tions of the Oil Pricing Committee. Until i373/74 prices to producers of
domestic crude oil were based on import parity. After the increase in
world prices, the GOI decided to abandon this principle and to set crude oil
prices at a much lower level than international prices. The current price for
domestic crude oil produced onshore is US$3.58 per barrel (i.e. 27.5% of the
international price). On the basis of this price, ONGC's operating surplus
was Rs. 520 million in FY75 and Rs. 240 million in FY76.
6.14      The prices of offshore crude oil and natural gas have been set at
US$5/barrel and US$551000 m , respectively. These prices have been deter-
mined on the basis of ONGC's anticipated cash flow for the development of
Bombay High and are considered adequate to ensure the financial viability
of the project (para. 5.08).
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Introduction
7.01      Prior to the development of Bombay High, ONGC's operations were
limited to the production of onshore fields in Assam and Gujarat. The pros-
pects arising out of India's first offshore discovery, and possible subse-
quent ones, open up a new era for ONGC. Crude oil production will almost
triple in the next five years and operations will be on a much larger scale,
particularly offshore, thus requiring much larger capital expenditures result-
ing in increased cash flows. It is therefore, in the light of ONGC's future
development, rather than its past performance, that one should analyze its
financial situation. ONGC, which was originally set up as an advisory body,
has begun an evolutionary process which should turn it into a large national
oil company. The Government, while retaining all the necessary controls over
ONGC's investment programs and development policies (para. 6.03), has in prac-
tice created a framework in which ONGC can operate in a financially responsi-
ble and reasonably autonomous way.  The Government has set prices of crude
oil and natural gas to ONGC at a level which enables the Commission to meet
its operational requirements, service its debt and self-finance a reasonable
share of its development.  In addition, the Government has provided funds
to meet ONGC's requirements which could not be met from internal cash gene-
ration; in this respect, exploration expenditures have been financed by equity
and development expenditures from loans. These policies are sound and the
GOI has indicated that they will be continued in the future. ONGC management
will be more involved in the making of the financial policy of the enterprise,
and its financial performance, as reflected in its accounts, can be compared
with that of other oil companies.

mary of ONGC's estimated financial position as of March 31, 1977 is given
below:

Long-term debt                         1,737          193        34
7.03      As of March 31, 1977, ONGC had a satisfactory financial position.
Investments of US$52 million represent ONGC's contribution to Hydrocarbon
India Ltd., its subsidiary (para 6.02). ONGC's debt/equity ratio of 34/66
was satisfactory and left a margin for further borrowing. ONGC's long-term
debt relates to loans from GOI and the Oil Industry Development Board; the
latter derives its funds from an excise tax of Rs 60 (US$7) per metric ton of
crude oil. Loans from 0IDB to ONGC have generally been made at 4.5% per year
for 15 years with a two year grace period; GOI loans are currently made at
10-1/4% per year for 10 years including 4 years of grace.
7.04      Operating results for recent years relate mainly to onshore oper-
ations since the development of Bombay High has only been in its initial
drilling stage and production from the project has been minimal. ONGC has
derived all its revenues from the production and sale of crude oil and natural
gas.  From FY74 to FY77 crude oil production increased from 4 Mmt to 5.7 Mmt
at a rate of 12.5% p.a. This and the 1974 increase in the price of on-shore
crude oil from US$1.48/barrel to US$3.58/barrel have enabled ONGC to increase
its revenues from Rs 816 million (US$90.6 million) in FY74 to an estimated



- 32 -
Rs 1,450 million (US$161 million) in FY77. However, owing to several changes
in depreciation and depletion accounting policy, ONGC's net income has been
erratic, with rates of return on invested capital varying between 2% and 28%
(para 7.05). During the four year period ONGC's cash generation has been
satisfactory; ONGC was able to finance about 49% of its capital investment
requirements, including those of Bombay High, after meeting debt service and
additional working capital; 29% has been financed by loans (GOI and OIDB)
and 22% from GOI equity contributions.
7.05      Until recently, ONGC's depreciation policy provided for all devel-
opment drilling expenditures to be charged against income in the year they
occur. The purpose was to increase operating expenses and thereby reduce
ONGC's tax liability and increase internal cash generation.  However, this
practice introduced wide variations in ONGC's operating income and rate of
return which make historical analysis and inter-industry comparisons diffi-
cult. This practice has now been discontinued and while ONGC will still
use high depreciation rates for tax purposes, they have introduced deprecia-
tion rates related to the economic-life of the assets for the purpose of
financial reporting.  These arrangements are satisfactory.  ONGC have indi-
cated that they intend to introduce replacement accounting procedures on a
trial basis when the offshore operation is firmly established.
C. Financing Plan
7.06      ONGC's overall capital investment requirements for the period
FY78 through FY82, along with the sources from which they would be met, are

7.07      Over the period FY78 through FY82 ONGC's capital investment is
estimated at US$1.7 billion of which US$1.0 billion would be foreign exchange.
The financing plan is based on the Government decisions made in May 1977 re-
garding the implementation of Phase III. It assumes that the GOI will finance
a share of the exploration program from equity, as it has done in the past.
After taking into account ONGC's internal cash generation, the remaining gap
of Rs 7,832 million (US$869 million) will be met by equity and borrowings
in about equal ratios. In addition to the proceeds of the Bank loan which
will be relent to ONGC, it is expected that the GOI will mobilize about
US$50 million from bilateral aid (Japan, France, U.K., Germany) and will
raise a loan of about US$50 million from commercial banks.

D. Future Finances
7.08      Forecast Income Statements and Balance Sheets for FY78 through
FY82 are given in Annexes 19 and 20 with explanatory notes in Annex 18. On
the basis of present prices (paras. 6.13 and 6.14), net income after taxes is
expected to grow at a satisfactory rate; annual rates of return on average
invested capital (after income tax) are expected to average about 12% -
after completion of the project - and ONGC would be able to provide about
57% of its required capital investment from internal cash generation. The
debt/equity ratio would leave an adequate margin for further borrowing; annual
debt service coverage would be satisfactory. Salient features from the fore-
cast financial statements are as follows:
Years ending March 31                  FY78    FY79    FY80    FY81    FY82
Crude oil production (Mmt)                  7.3    10.2    13.3    16.5    18.5

Rate of return on average net
fixed assets - %                            4.7      9.3    11.4    18.8    15.5
Debt/Equity ratio                         42/58   42/58   41/59   34/66   29/71

/1   Defined as the ratio of net income before interest and after taxes (ex-
cluding subsidiary) to the average, long-term debt and equity, includ-
ing retained earnings but excluding work in progress and investment in
subsidiary.
These forecasts are based on ONGC's production estimates. They do not take
into account any further discovery onshore and offshore or any increase in
the price of crude oil to reflect inflation and/or changes in international
prices.
7.09      These projections show that ONGC's performance will be satisfac-
tory in the future, and that the policies followed by the GOI towards the
financing of the project are sound and will enable ONGC to remain finan-
cially viable. In this context the producer price set by the GOI for crude
oil and natural gas will be the main parameter affecting ONGC's profitability
and cash flow objectives, for the project and subsequent major developments.

The GOI has agreed that it will from time to time carry out a review of the
prices of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, which will determine the level of
price required to enable ONGC to meet its operating expenses and earn a return
on its invested capital sufficient to cover its debt service requirements,
maintain adequate working capital and finance a substantial portion of its
proposed capital expansion. ONGC has agreed that it will prepare and furnish
each year to the GOI an economic and financial evaluation of the project and
of any subsequent major development, which will indicate the level of price
which would be required for ONGC to earn a DCF return of at least 15%, for the
project and any subsequent major development. In the light of ONGC's past and
projected performance, it is understood that ONGC's financial viability should
be reflected in a capability to finance about 30 to 50% of the cost of new
development projects from internally generated funds, in rates of return on
invested capital of 10% to 14% and in an annual debt service coverage of 2 to
2.5 times. It is expected that prices which would ensure a DCF return of 15%
after taxes to ONGC, for the project and subsequent developments, would bring
about at least such results.
VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with ONGC and
satisfactory assurances were obtained:
(a)  ONGC would submit to the Bank an updated development plan
of the Bombay High and North Bassein fields, by the end
of each calendar year starting in 1977 (para 4.03);
(b)  ONGC will employ qualified and experienced consultants
for the design and supervision of construction of the
project (para 4.13), and ONGC will employ qualified
management consultants (para 4.19);
(c)  ONGC would submit to the Bank copies of quarterly progress
reports in a format acceptable to the Bank (para 4.21);
(d)  ONGC would establish a satisfactory management information
system for the Bombay High Development Project by December 31,
1977 (para 6.08);
(e)  ONGC would submit audited accounts to the Bank not later than
twelve months after the end of each fiscal year (para 6.12);
(f)  ONGC would prepare and furnish each year to the GOI an eco-
nomic and financial evaluation of the project and of any sub-
sequent development, which will indicate the level of price
which would be required for ONGC to earn a DCF return of
at least 15%, for the project and any subsequent major
development (para 7.09).

8.02      Assurances were obtained from GOI during negotiations that:
(a) GOI would cover ONGC's financing requirements including
working capital (para 4.18); and
(b) GOI would carry out from time to time a review of the
prices of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, which will
determine on the level of price required for ONGC to
continue to be financially viable (para 7.09).
8.03      With the above assurances and agreements, the Project would be
suitable for a loan of US$150 million to GOI for a term of 20 years includ-
ing three years of grace.

INDIA
BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Development of Energy Resources of India 1/
1.        The energy resources of a country are not immutably or precisely
given. They can be assessed only at a particular time in relation to what
is known or believed about how they can be developed and put to use and about
the expected cost and benefits that will result from their exploitation.
2.        In the present state of knowledge, India's energy resources can be
divided into three main headings: commercial energy which would include
coal, hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas), hydro-power and nuclear fuels; non-
commercial energy which consists mainly of forest resources and animal and
vegetable wastes; and prospective energy resources including solar energy,
geothermal and tidal energy and wind power for which no commercial technology
is yet available in India or elsewhere..
A.   Commercial Energy
(i) Coal
3.        Recent estimates by the Geological Survey of India indicate that
total reserves (proved and others) could be as high as 83,000 million metric
tons (Mmt) equivalent to about 23,000 million tons of oil equivalent (MToe)
of which about 25% would be coking coal of various quality and 75% non-coking
and lignite (Table 1). Various studies have estimated that the reserves of
coking and non-coking coal could satisfy the projected coal demand of the
steel industry for about 40-50 years and of other sectors for about 50-75
years under current assumptions of economic growth.
4.        Coal basins in India are geographically concentrated within the
area located in the eastern and north-eastern part of the country. The four
major fields (Ramiganj, Tharia, North Karanpura and Singrauli) account for
more than 60% of the total production of coking and non-coking coal. There
are no significant coal fields in the north-western, western and southern
region. Therefore long haulages are necessary if coal is to be supplied
to these regions. Over the past 20 years a deliberate attempt has been
made, with some success, to develop coal production in other areas to reduce
transport costs. Most of the coal mined in India has a high ash content.
1/   In this annex we have relied on information supplied by P.D. Henderson
in his book: India: the Energy Sector and on study of the energy sec-
tor by Kirit Parikh of the Ford Foundation in India.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 7
As better quality coal was mined and had to be replaced by lower grade, the
average ash content of Indian coal has increased from about 14% to over 20%.
5.        After eight years of semi-stagnation up to 1973/74, coal production
increased by 13.7% in 1974/75 from 78.2 to 88.9 Mmt. This momentum was main-
tained in 1975/76, the first six months showing an increase of 11.5% over the
same period in the previous year and it now appears that the target of 135 Mmt
production for the current five-year plan could be achieved. Most of the re-
cent increase in production was achieved by improving the efficiency of ex-
isting mines and of rail transport. The Government has now finalized a pro-
spective plan which aims at raising coal output to 184 Mmt by 1985/86 - 41%
of the increase being required for power generation, 18% for steel making and
another 41% for other sectors.
6.        The coal sector is largely nationalized, with only two captive
mines of steel producers remaining outside the public sector. The public
sector is controlled by Coal India Limited a public company created in 1975
by consolidating the Coal Mine Authority Ltd., Bharat Coking Coal Ltd.
and the Singareni Collieries Ltd.
7.        Various studies by public and private agencies show that coal will
continue to play a very significant role in India's future energy supply. It
is currently estimated that coal production should reach 184 Mmt. by 1985 and
about 340-370 Mmt by 1990 compared to a target of 135 million tons at the end
of the Fifth Plan. According to the K. Parikh study this would require the
following investments (the figures indicated below are the average between
the minimum and maximum requirements).

ANNEX 5
The large investment in several sectors (mining, industry- and transport)
will require considerable planning and coordination. The steps taken after
1973-74 to improve the availability of spares, and to impro.:: the produc-
tivity of existing mines and of rail transport appear to be in the right
direction. However some difficulties remains in the financing of coal
expansion and in coal pricing.
(ii) Hydroelectric Power
8.        India's hydroelectric power potential has been conservatively
estimated at 41,000 MW (based on a 60% load factor) by the Central Water and
Power Commission of which about 20% has been or is currently being developed.
The north-eastern and northern regions, which include the Brahmaputra and
Ganga rivers, account for 30% and 26% of the total potential, respectively
the balance being located in the eastern (6.5%), western (17.5%) and south-
ern regions (19.6%). To some extent the availability of hydropower redress
the differences which arise from the very uneven distribution of coal re-
serves.
9.        Although India's hydroelectric power generating capabilities are
substantial, the date by which they might be put to use is remote in most
cases as the hydropower sites are located far from the main demand centers.
For example, it is unlikely that power consumption in the north-east will
require more than the development of a small part of the identified Doten-
tial. A possibility for a larger role of hydropower could be a more
coordinated approach towards multipurpose projects which would combine
irrigation, water supply and power generation.
10.       In the long run the share of hydroelectric power is expected to
decrease from its current 41% of total power generation to about 35% in
1990/91, and thereafter. Total investments in hydropower plant are pro-
jected at Rs 52.0 billion (US$5.8 billion) between 1975 and 1990.
(iii) Nuclear Fuels
11.       Resources of nuclear fuels in India consist of uranium and
thorium.  The first of these is already in use for the generation of electric
power in India, and it is planned that future facilities will use domestic-
ally produced uranium as a fuel. The main concentration of uranium is in
Bihar and is exploited in two mines; some other deposits, of a lower con-
centration, may be worth developing in Udaipur and Rajasthan. The Depart-
ment of Atomic Energy is responsible for uranium exploration in collabora-
tion with other Government agencies.
12.       On the basis of current reserves, and with the technology which is
currently in use, uranium supplies would meet the demand for a limited time,
depending on the rate at which new nuclear facilities are built. This
period could be extended by improvement in technology and the use of fast
breeder reactors which are not yet commercially exploitable.



ANNEX 5
Page 4 of 7
13.       The future development of nuclear fuels will to a large extent
depend on the development of other fuels, mainly coal.   It is estimated
that nuclear generation will increase from the current level of 600 MW to
about 8,500 MW by 1990. In view of the cost of nuclear power and of the
time involved this objective appears optimistic.
(iv) Hydrocarbons
14.       Current hydrocarbon recoverable reserves onshore are estimated at
about 203 million tons of oil equivalent (Mmtoe) of which petroleum reserves
account for 65% and gas reserves for 35%. Most of the onshore reserves are
located in two states, Assam in the northeast where oil was first discovered,
and Gujarat in the northwest which was developed in the 1960's by the Oil
and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC). The current ratio of reserves to produc-
tion is currently of 19 and 41 years for petroleum and natural gas, respect-
ively.
15.       The total sedimentary area in India is about 1.7 million sq. km of
which 1.4 million sq. km are onshore and .3 million sq. km. offshore within
the 200 m water depth (Continental Shelf). A total of 27 sedimentary basins
have been identified, with prospects ranking from good to poor, of these nine
have been explored and three (Assam, Gujarat and Bombay High) have yield oil,
exploratory drilling in the other six basins has not resulted in any notable
discovery. Work in the remaining 18 basins is either in progress or will be
commenced in the near future. The most promising areas are:
-    the Cambay (Gujarat) and Assam-Arakan areas which are
known to contain commercial deposits of oil and natural
gas;
-    the Cauvery, West Bengal, Jaisalmer Teipura, Cachar and
Andaman Nicobar areas which have good prospects but so
far have no known commercial deposits.
16.       Until 1972/73 most of the survey and exploration effort of inter-
national and domestic oil companies was concentrated onshore with the ex-
ception of a geological-geophysical survey carried out by Soviet experts in
the mid-1960's. Although three companies are producing petroleum and gas
in India - the Assam Oil Company (AOC), Oil India Ltd. (OIL) in which the
GOI has a 50% participation and ONGC which is a fully government-owned
agency - only OIL and mostly ONGC were involved in onshore exploration.
At the end of 1975 ONGC had drilled about 1,235 exploration and develop-
ment well onshore of which 250 and 950 were located in Assam and Gujarat
respectively. These efforts have resulted in the discovery and development
of about 25 oil and gas fields. The survey of the offshore potential car-
ried out by Soviet experts identified 12 potential structures mainly in the
Arabian Sea. The exploration of those located in the Bombay area has re-
sulted in the discovery of Bombay High and of North and South Bassein.

17.       While ONGC's and OIL's exploration programs onshore have been
reasonably successful, it is the opinion of many experts that their past
and current exploration programs are not commensurate with the size and
prospects of the prospective areas particularly offshore. GOI and ONGC
officials share this opinion and have decided to step up exploration programs
in the most promising areas onshore, to build up ONGC's offshore exploration
capacity and to cooperate with international oil companies in exploration
for and development of hydrocarbon reserves offshore. This program which
was initiated in 1972/73 has already brought about significant results:
(a) onshore reserves which had been declining since 1961,
have increasSd by about 17 million tons of oil and about
27 billion m of natural gas;
(b) offshore ONGC has discovered the Bombay High field and the
adjacent North and South Bassein fields which are expected
to have initial rscoverable reserves of over 250 /1 Mmt of
oil and 30,000 Mm of natural gas (Annex 3). In addition,
India has entered into production-sharing/participation
agreements with three oil companies which are currently
exploring in the Gulf of Kutch and off Bengal (Reading and
Bates Asamera and Natomas).
18.       In the future ONGC will have a leading role in onshore exploration,
although it is expected that OIL will step up exploratory drilling. ONGC's
current plans onshore call for:
(a) a review of all geological and geophysical data collected
so far, with more powerful analytical tools. For this
purpose the computer facilities of ONGC headquarters in
Dhera Dua have been modernized and geologists and geo-
physists are being trained in modern interpretation
techniques;
(b) the concentration of effort on a limited number of
potential areas where ONGC personnel and foreign con-
tractors will apply geological and geophysical techniques
and will drill in deeper structures where the prospects
appear to be more promising; and
(c) the exploration of areas which have not been explored
previously because of the technical and geographical
problems involved (infrastructure, access, etc.).
Although ONGC plans appear reasonable, they have not yet been formulated in
great detail and there appears to be considerable room for improvement of
ONGC's approach to onshore explorations, particularly in the deployment of
crews and in the selection of priorities among projects.
i/   These reserves could be increased by 85 YMmt of oil if probable
reserves under evaluation are confirmed.



ANNEX 5
Page 6 of 7
19.       As indicated in para. 17 the responsibility for exploration off-
shore is shared among ONGC and foreign oil companies operating under pro-
duction sharing contracts. Prior to 1976 ONGC had practically no experience
offshore. In the course of three years ONGC succeeded in discovering a
giant oil/gas field and two other fields of lesser importance and to bring
these fields under production while continuing exploration. To achieve these
remarkable results, ONGC has followed a pragmatic policy of "owner assisted
development" 1/ whereby ONGC would hire knowledgeable contractors to carry
out development work, while ONGC staff, assisted by consultants, retained the
decision-make responsibility, and acquire the expertise. This approach has
enabled ONGC to minimize the acquisition of heavy equipment (drilling rigs,
barges and supply boats) to what was justified by proven fields and required
to train their own personnel.
20.       The main objective of ONGC's offshore policy is first to complete
exploration in the Bombay offshore areas (some structures at the limit of
the continental slope remain to be drilled) and to move south of Bombay
where other projects have been identified. Although no definite program has
yet been decided upon (outside of the Bombay offshore area) it appears that
ONGC's program for the next two years will include about 20 exploratory/
delineation well offshore. This program appears consistent with the pros-
pects that have been identified so far and with ONGC's resources.
21.       Future investment in offshore exploration and development asso-
ciated with the development of Bombay High and North Bassein is described in
Annex 12.
B.   Non-Commercial Energy
22.       Non-commercial energy consists chiefly of fuel wood and animal
wastes, mainly cow-dung, used in the domestic sector.
(i) Fuel Wood
23.       Total consumption of fuel wood is not known precisely, but is
estimated at about 130 million tons per year, thus exceeding by more than
50% the output of the coal industry. Fuel wood is used predominantly in
the domestic sector and its utilization has been a source of concern to the
GOI. India has a forest area which accounts for about 23% of the total geo-
graphical area, which is well below the world average. Of this about 60%
is considered exploitable and about 20% potentially exportable. Efforts
have been made to increase the forest area and to control the use of fuel
wood. These efforts appear to have brought about some results and between
1960 and 1970 the forest area increased by about 8.7% from 69 million
hectares to 75 million hectares. However, the increase in oil prices of
1973/74 has had a detrimental effect on the demand for fuel wood, which
appears to have increased as the price of kerosene went up. The GOI is
1/   As opposed to the concept of "operator" whereby the owner of the field
entrusts the full responsibility of its development to a contractor.



ANNEX 5
Page 7 of 7
considering the creation of plantations of fast growing trees to meet future
demand and the implementation of tighter controls on fuel wood utilization to
prevent deforestration. However, in the absence of data, it is impossible to
quantify the impact of higher kerosene prices accuratly.
(ii)  Vegetable Wastes and Cow-dung
24.       Together these two fuels account for about one-third of total con-
sumption of non-commercial energy, according to estimates of various Agencies
in India. Cow-dung and vegetable wastes are cheap sources of energy, however,
their use as fuels has been very controversial since they could possibly be
used more efficiently as fertilizers. The strength of this argument depends
on what it is reasonable to assume for the cost of alternative fuels and on
the effectiveness with which cow-dung could be used as fertilizers. In this
connection India has launched an experimental program for the construction
of small biogas plants.
C.   Prospective Energy Sources
25.       So far little is know about geothermal energy and/or solar, wind and
tidal energy potential. Although there are a large number of hot springs in
India, the total exploitable potential of geothermal energy appears very
small. Despite a long coast line, there are very few sites which have tidal
ranges which would permit commercial exploitation and the total potential is
estimated at less than 1,000 NW. Wind could be a potential source of energy
provided the technology exists. Solar energy appears to be the most promising
source of prospective energy, as the annual solar intensity averages 600
calories per sq. cm. Although India has been conducting some experiments,
particularly in rural areas, it does not appear that solar energy will play
a substantial role in total energy supply in the near future.

Development of Hydrocarbon Resources in India
Policies and Constraints
A.   Introduction
1.        Two different approaches can be followed by a developing country
in the exploration for and development of its hydrocarbon resources. It can
enter into an agreement with a foreign oil company whereby the latter would
explore for and develop hydrocarbon resources and/or it can entrust respons-
ibility for development to a national agency. These two approaches are not
mutually exclusive, and several countries have been using both of them
simultaneously or in sequence. The rationale for preferring one approach
to the other, or for using both does not solely depend on economic and tech-
nical criteria. In most developing countries the choice between foreign
and national companies carries considerable social, political and philosophi-
cal implications. In India policies regarding the development of hydrocarbon
resources changed over time from an almost total dependence on foreign compa-
nies to a strong emphasis on self-reliance. Recently, however, India has
followed a policy of compromise between foreign participation and national
autonomy. The following sections are an attempt to summarize the main
policies followed by the Government of India (GOI) at various stages and
to highlight the constraints, issues and problems which underlined these
policies.
B.   India's Policies in the Petroleum Sector
(i) The Early Years after Independence
2.        In the wake of independence, India was almost totally dependent
on the import of refined petroleum products. In 1948 the Assam Oil Com-
pany (AOC) a subsidiary of Burmah Oil produced about .25 MmT of crude oil
which was refined in a small plant near Digboi whose production of .19 Mmt
was less than 7% of total petroleum consumption in India that year. The
balance was met by imports of refined products which were controlled by
three foreign companies Burmah-Shell which accounted for over 50% of the
market, Standard Vacuum Oil Company (Stanvac) and Caltex a joint venture
of Standard Oil of California and Texaco.
3.        In the early 1950's, the GOI realized that future economic growth
would necewssarily lead to an ever-increasing demand for liquid fuels, even
if domestic coal reserves were developed to the maximum possible extent. It



ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 7
also realized that a continuing reliance on imports of refined products
would prove to be less reliable and more costly, in terms of foreign ex-
change, than the import of crude oil which could be refined locally. Be-
tween 1948 and 1951, t'-e GOI approached foreign oil companies and proposed
the establishment of domestic refineries based on imported crude. This
decision, however, was a departure from the principles of the Industrial
Policy Resolution of 1948 which stated inter alia that the Government should
be responsible for the future development of the petroleum sector. The main
reasons for the GOI decision were:
(i) the difficulty in mobilizing foreign exchange and local
currency resources to finance Government-owned refineries;
(ii) the lack of expertise in petroleum refining, which at that
time was very strongly dominated by international oil com-
panies;
(iii) the lack of expertise in the distribution and marketing of
refined products and the potential conflict with foreign
companies who might have refused to market the products
of Government-owned refineries; and
(iv) the hope that after having invested in refineries, foreign
companies would also invest in exploration for and develop-
ment of petroleum resources in India.
4.        Agreements were signed in late 1951, whereby Stanvac and Burmah-
Shell would each build a refineries with a capacity of about 1.0 and 1.5 Mmt,
respectively. A third agreement was entered into with Caltex in 1953 for the
construction of a third refinery.
5.        At about the same time, the GOI entered into a joint venture agree-
ment with Stanvac, known as the Indo-Stanvac Project, for exploration in the
Bengal Basin. According to this agreement, the GOI was to provide 25% of the
funds required for the operation of the project; Stanvac was to provide 75%
and was entitled to 75% of the production. Stanvac retained responsibility
of the overall management of the project. If oil was found, it was to be
priced at import parity. In addition, the agreement included a number of tax
exemption clauses which reflected the GOI's opinion that it was in the na-
tional interest to attract international companies to invest in petroleum ex-
ploration and development in India. This project was, however, abandoned in
1960 without producing any positive results.
6.        After long negotiations, the GOI also entered into a joint venture
agreement with Burmah Oil which resulted, in 1959, in the creation of Oil
India Limited (OIL) a private company in which the GOI had initially a one-
third interest. OIL's prospective area was limited to the north-east of
India. The GOI participation was subsequently increased to 50% in1961,
when OIL's prospective area was enlarged to some areas in the North-East
Frontier Area and Assam. OIL agreed to sell all its oil to the GOI, and



ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 7
agreed that crude oil would be priced so as to allow a return of 9-13% on the
paid-up share capital. In this the GOI was departing from the import parity
price concept of the Indo-Stanvac Project and was moving toward a cost-plus
pricing policies.
7.         While the Indo-Stanvac Project did not bring about any discovery,
OIL was more successful, at least in the early years of operation; and pro-
duction increased from about .25 Mmt in 1959 to 1.4 Mmt in 1964 and reached
a peak of about 3 Mmt in 1970, which it has maintained since. However, OIL
has not made any significant new discovery in the recent past and its produc-
tion is expected to decline sharply in the early 1980's as its fields are
depleted.
8.         One of the major clauses of the agreement signed with foreign com-
panies in setting up- refineries in India provided that they would have the
freedom to choose their sources of supply and that crude oil prices would
be determined on the basis of world market prices (posted prices) at the
time and place of shipment. Within the framework of integrated companies,
this really meant that India's domestic refineries were a captive market for
the purpose of selling the companies' own crude oil. Retrospectively, these
clauses and other clauses governing equity participation, duties and taxes
appear somewhat inflexible, but one has to remember that at the time the
"maj ors" dominated the market and would not have agreed to anything else.
Also the GOI had no alternative other than to continue importing products,
at a higher-cost than crude oil.
9.         As a result of this policy, domestic production of refined pro-
ducts increased from less than .2 Mmt in 1952 to over 4.5 Mmt in 1957/58
thus meeting about 80% of total domestic requirements. The domestic pro-
duction of crude oil, however, remained stagnant throughout the 1950's at
less than .5 Mmt.
10.        The GOI's decision to invite foreign companies to build and operate
domestic refineries rather than continue importing refined products or trying
to procure the expertise from consultants appears to have been justified.
Foreign exchange savings (compared to imports of products) have been estimated
at about US$150 million between 1955 and 1960. 1/   However, the changes which
occurred in the late 1950's and 1960's in the world oil market led the GOI to
reconsider its policy.

(ii) The Changes of the Late 1950's and the 1960's
11.       The early 1950's had been characterized by a monopoly of the major
oil companies on oil supplies and a balance between supply and demand. In
late 1950's and in the 1960's several factors contributed to change this
situation. Large volumes of oil were discovered by so called "independent"
companies and by national companies sponsored by European governments (France,
Italy) in countries which were not yet producers; surplus oil from the USSR
became available on the market; and the U.S. introduced import quotas to pro-
tect their own industry. This resulted in excess supplies and rapidly dec-
lining prices. While posted prices did not change substantially, a number of
companies introduced a system of rebates which greatly reduced the real cost
of oil supplies to a number of importing countries. This, however, was not
the case in India, where crude supplies to domestic refineries were procured
by foreign companies at internal transfer prices which were based on posted
prices. Until 1960 India was unaware of this situation, and it is only
after the USSR offered crude at discount prices to India that the GOI started
putting pressure on the companies to reduce their prices and investigating
alternative ways of taking advantage of the favorable market conditions.
Concurrently the GOI was still trying to attract foreign companies to par-
ticipate in oil exploration. In the late 1950's the GOI convened a panel
of international experts from Eastern and Western countries which recom-
mended a strong impetus from privately financed exploration and development.
The GOI invited companies to make proposals by early 1960. Fourteen com-
panies responded but were unable to come to terms with the GOI, the only
agreement reached was a modification to the GOIt's participation in Oil (1961).
12.       Faced with an ever-increasing oil import bill, the GOI had several
policy options:
(i) finding oil in India to substitute domestic production
for imports of crude oil. As we have seen, the GOI had
been trying successfully to attract foreign oil companies
to explore in India. The failure to obtain foreign com-
panies' cooperation led to the creation in 1956, 1/ of the
Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), which was given the
task of exploring for and developing oil resources in India
outside the areas being prospected by Oil. At about the same
time the GOI turned to the USSR and Eastern European Countries
for technical and financial assistance in setting up an explo-
ration group and in building the first state-owned refineries.
by 1965 ONGC had discovered a significant amount of oil and
Gas in Gujarat;
(ii) Reducing the cost of imports of crude oil. This could be
achieved in two ways; by obtaining cheaper crude supplies
1/   ONGC became an independent statutory Commission in 1959, prior to this
date, it was operating within the Geological Survey of India.



ANNEX 7
Page  5 of 7
on the world market through discount and/or barter deals,
and by putting pressure on the companies owning the existing
refineries to match the terms offered by their competitors.
However, it implied that the GOI would own sufficient refinery
capacity to refine whatever crude it could obtain at lower cost,
since the companies refused to refine oil that they had not procured.
From 1956 to 1970 the GOI followed a policy which included these
three components. Various committees were appointed to look into
the crude oil pricing practices of oil companies. The GOI under-
took to create a public refining sector, with the assistance of
the USSR and other eastern European countries, which resulted in
the creation of Indian Refineries Limited - IRL - in 1958 to
construct and operate the refineries of Gauhati, Barauni and
Haldia. The main purpose of these steps was to break up the
monopoly of the foreign companies, which were denied the right
to expand or to process domestic crude yielded by the discoveries
made by OIL in Assam and by ONGC in Gujarat.  In 1964 IRL was
merged with the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which had been
created for the purpose of importing and exporting products;
and
(iii)   The two remaining possibilities were to obtain foreign assistance
to finance the rising cost of oil imports and/or to discourage
the growth of demand for petroleum products. The former was
not available until the oil crisis of 1973/74, and the latter did
not offer substantial possibilities for savings since the con-
sumption of petroleum in India is comparatively low and since
there is very little "fat" to eliminate.
13.       The results of the GOI policies in the late 1950's and 1960's can
be summarized as follows. On the one hand, the GOI and the various agencies
dealing with petroleum at any stage of its production/utilization gained con-
siderable experience in all fundamental aspects of the industry. In par-
ticular knowledge of the country's geological potential improved substan-
tially.
14.       By the end of the 1960's ON C and OIL had proved oil reserves of
about 175 MMmt of oil and of 75,000 Mm of gas (Annex 1). Their combined pro-
duction covered about 37% of total crude consumption in India. Total refin-
ing capacity was about 17 Mmt, covering more than 90% of the country's total
product requirements. There was a body of trained technicians in almost all
facets of the industry. This compared to the situation twenty years pre-
viously was certainly an achievement India could be proud of and which
proved economically justified. Most analysts estimate that the return of
OIL and ONGC's investments has been 13-19% at pre-1973 prices. However,
only a small portion of the potential oil bearing structures had been
fully explored and no significant discovery had been made since ONGC struck
oil in Gujurat in the early 60's.

C.   The Early 1970's - The Move Offshore
15.       While the early part of the 1960's had witnessed a decrease in the
price of oil in real terms, this trend was reversed in the late 1960's and
early 1970's until the chaotic increase in world oil prices in 1973/74. The
main reasons for this change were: the increased demand of Western Europe,
Japan and eventually the US in the early 1970's; the drastic modifications
in the agreements linking host countries and international oil companies,
which decreased the availability of low cost crude oil to the latter; and
the growing awareness that petroleum reserves were finite, and that producing
countries, which relied solely on their exploitation to earn foreign exchange,
should have a deciding voice as to what the optimum rate of depletion should
be. This resulted between the end of the 1960's and 1973/74 in a steady'
increase in oil prices which severely affected the balance of payments of
oil importing countries, particularly India. At the same time these changes
in the world market for oil created a renewed interest in having foreign com-
panies to explore in areas which were not believed attractive previously, to
secure low cost supplies. This new exploration effort was accompanied by the
introduction of new types of agreements with host govern- ents (production-
sharing), whereby the foreign companies were willing to invest in explora-
tion (risk capital) and to participate in development expenditures provided
that, in the event of a commercial discovery, they could (a) recover their
initial expenditures and (b) dispose of a share in the total production.
Most of these new ventures took place outside OPEC countries and were
directed to the exploration and development of offshore potential areas.
16.       Previously, the world market conditions had not been favorable to
foreign investment in oil exploration in India. However, by the late 1960's
the situation had changed somewhat, the surveys conducted by the USSR tech-
nical assistance team had identified a number of prospective areas off-
shore and oil companies were willing to move in the area to explore and
subsequently develop oil potential provided that they could reach an agree-
ment with the GOI. The GOI was not adverse to such cooperation and negotia-
tions were initiated in the late 1960's with Tenneco (US) for the exploration
and possible development of the Bombay High structure. The Tenneco proposal
was a typical production sharing agreement. Tenneco would bear the full cost
of exploration and, if oil was discovered, a joint company would be created
in which the GOI would have a majority interest (51%), after five years man-
agement would be transferred to the GOI and Tenneco would retain 49% of the
production. In many respects this proposal was attractive, it provided ade-
quate financing for risk capital, and additional financing for development
expenditures, it also had a substantial training component in offshore opera-
tion in which ONGC had no practical experience. AfLter long negotiations, the
GOI rejected Tenneco's offer, apparently on the 'ground that the share of pro-
duction to be allocated to the foreign partner was too high. The GOI further
decided that ONGC would explore and develop the BH structure. At almost the
same time the GOI decided to open 10 offshore areas to foreign oil companies
and three production sharing contracts were signed with Reading and Bates
(U.S.), Natomas (U.S.) and Asamera (Canada) to explore in the Kutch Basin,
in the Cauvery Basin and in the Bay of Bengal.



ANNEX 7
Page 7 of 7
17.       In many ways a historical overview of India's past development
policies in the petroleum sector reflects the traditional problems of nego-
tiations between unequal partners. In the early years, the oil companies
were extremely powerful and the GOI had no experience in the oil industry.
This resulted in agreements which in the light of later developments appear
to have been in favor of the foreign partners, although most analysts agree
that these agreements had a positive effect on India's balance of payments.
In the 1950's, when India had acquired some expertise and tried to attract
foreign companies to develop its potential, the latter were not interested
because of unfavorable world market conditions, and this led to the creation
development of OIL and ONGC, which have both been successful. In the recent
past India has been trying to find a reasonable balance between foreign and
national investment. However, despite the opening of offshore areas to for-
eign companies, relatively few have applied for licenses.
18.       In the wake of the price increases of 1973/74 the GOI made some
drastic changes in its policy towards development of petroleum resources:
(i) steps were taken to increase production from existing
fields from about 7.5 Mmt/yr to 9.0 Mmt/yr within 3
years by using enhanced recovery techniques whenever
feasible;
(ii) first priority was given to the exploration and rapid
development of the Bombay High and adjacent structures.
The execution of this project was assigned to ONGC,
which benefited from ad hoc procedures to by-pass the
usual red tape involved in getting import licenses
and foreign exchange allocations; and
(iii) ten offshore areas were opened to foreign companies and
three production sharing type agreements were signed
with three foreign companies.
It appears that in the future ONGC will be the main Government agency in
exploration for and development of petroleum resources onshore and offshore.
In the Bombay High area, ONGC has developed so called "owner assisted pro-
cedures" which enable them to use foreign consultants and contracts while
retaining the responsibility of the development and training of their own
staff in offshore techniques. These procedures have been successful. How
ONGC will proceed in the future depends largely on its further success in
discovering oil offshore and of the results of exploration by foreign com-
panies.

BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Evaluation of Bombay High and Bassein Reserves 1/
A.   Geology
1.        The main hydrocarbon accumulations in the Bombay High field are
found in a Miocene carbonate section referred to as the LIII Zone. Lesser
accumulations of gas are present in the overlying LII Zone which is not
included in the initial development plans. The LII Zone is a multi-layered
structure consisting of several carbonate stringers separated by shale and
marle beds. These carbon stringers are referred to as the A and A Zones.
There are other hydrocarbon bearing beds in this field: the i Zone hich is
sometimes developed between the A  and A  Zones and the B, C and D Zones
1      2
which underlie the A2 Zone. Present development plans do not include exploi-
tation of these other zones (see Maps).
2.        The hydrocarbon accumulations in the Bassein and South Bassein
fields are found in a carbonate reservoir lithiologically similar to the
Bombay High field but of Oligocene rather than Miocene. The Bassein struc-
ture contains both oil and gas, but the South Bassein structure is a gas-
condensate reservoir with no oil column.
B.   Reserves
3.        During the course of exploration and initial development, ONGC
has had various organizations evaluate the potential oil reserves of the
Bombay High field. The findings are tabulated below:

4.   To obtain an updated and independent assessment the Bank in agreement
with the ONGC hired D&M to appraise the Bombay High and Bassein reserves.
1/   This annex is based on the conclusions of an independent evaluation made
by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) in December 1976 and January 1977, at
the request of the Bank.

Page 2 of 4
The results of D&M's appraisal were reported in January 1977 and are sum-
marized in the following table. The "proved" and "probable" classifications
are defined as follows:
(i)  Proved - These reserves have been proved to a high degree
of certainty by reason of actual completion, successful testing,
or in certain cases by adequate core analyses and are defined
really by reasonable geological interpretation of structure
and known continuity of an oil - or gas-saturated reservoir.
These reserves are limited by the lowest contour closing on
established productivity.
(ii)  Probable - These reserves, susceptible of being proved, are
defined by less direct well control but are based upon evidence
of producible gas or oil within the limits of a structure or
reservoir above known or inferred water saturation. These
reserves are limited by the lowermost perforation in the
productive interval or by the base of the productive interval
when there is not evidence of a hydrocarbon-water contact.

5.        Because of natural pressure decline during depletion of the reser-
voirs, at some point in the future it will become necessary to maintain well
flow through gas lift and other pumping devices. Also, introduction of appro-
priate secondary recovery methods will enhance the quantity of recoverable oil.
These optimization measures have not yet been studied, but D&M estimate that
gas life and water injection could raise recoverable oil reserves from A
and A2 Zones to 41.9 and 258.6 million cubic meters respectively.
6.        No evaluation has been made of the natural gas deposits in the
Bassein South structure. The quantity of gas dissolved in the Bombay High
and Bassein oil reservoirs will yield approximately 100 cubic meters of
natural gas for every cubic meter of oil produced. As reservoir pressures
decline this ratio will increase, that is, the production of gas per unit
volume of oil will become greater as time goes on during the production life
of the reservoirs.
C.   Production
7.        At the request of the Bank, DeGolyer and MacNaughton have carried
out a two dimension study of the Bombay High reservoir (Bassein North was
not included since not enough production history was available). The results
show that the most likely development plan would include about 80 development
wells at peak production of about 225,000 b/d. Peak production could be
reached in the early eighties, depending on ONGC's drilling programme and
could be maintained fo5 8 years, using water injection. Total recovery
would be 202 million m of oil or 21% of the total active oil in place. The
life of the field would be about 30 years. D & X production program is
given in Table 1. Sensitivity analysis shows that other development plans
would lead either to lower recovery or to the same recovery at higher costs.

BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DETAILS OF ENGINEERING EVALUATION
A. General
1.        The Bombay High development program, which started in 1974 under the
responsibility of ONGC, is the first large scale offshore project undertaken
in India. Stages I and II of the project, consisting of the facilities
required to produce about 80,000 b/d of crude oil and temporary tanker tran-
sport facilities to bring the crude oil to shore, are substantially completed.
The project consists of Stage III, which will pr9vide the facilities required
to produce 140,000 b/d of oil and up to 2,500 Mm /d of gas by May 1979. The
project includes: drilling of development wells and construction of well
platforms, three production platforms and permanent pipLline facilities to
shore, a shore terminal and supporting facilities, and supply lines across the
Bay of Trombay to connect the terminal to the users.
B.  Main Components of the Project
(i) Development wells and well platforms
2.        It is estimated that the full development of Bombay High and of
Bassein North will require a total of about 100 development wells of which
about 20 will be drilled by the end of 1977. The remainder will be drilled
over the next four years in step with the construction of production/proces-
sing facilities offshore and onshore. The project includes 20 production
wells: 16 in Bombay High North and 4 in Bassein North. ONGC has been using
deviated wells with a step out of about 1.2 km on average. Since the reser-
voir is relatively shallow (lowest oil/water contact is - 1,395 meters at
Bombay High) no more than four wells can be drilled from a single platform,
if interference in the drainage area is to be avoided. The cost of each well
has been estimated at US$2.4 million on the basis of ONGC's historical drill-
ing costs.  It has been further assumed that about 15% of the wells will not
be productive.
3.        After completion of drilling, the wells are connected to the
platform, and well completion manifolds (Christmas trees) are installed on
each well.  In the first stage program, two of the well platforms, Plat-
forms A and C, are equipped to process the crude oil for shipment ashore
and are known as well-cum-production platforms. The crude oil from the var-
ious wells flows under well-head pressure to the well-cum-production plat-
forms where dissolved associated gas is separated and flared and the crude
oil pumped to the storage tanker and shipped ashore through the single buoy

mooring system. In the second stage, flow lines (8" to 18" in diameter) will
connect directly the well platforms to the production platforms where the oil
and gas will be separated and treated for pipeline transport.
(ii) Offshore processing platform
4.        When the project facilities are installed, there will be three off-
shore platforms. These platforms will be equipped with all the necessary
pumping, compressing, treating and ancillary facilities necessary to transport
the oil and gas ashore to the Uran Terminal by way of the pipelines. Two
platforms will be located in the northern part of Bombay High and the third
in Bassein North.
5.        ONGC's production plans require that the crude oil and natural gas
pipelines be installed before the start of the monsoon in May 1978. However,
it appears doubtful that the Bombay High North platform can be installed and
equipped by that time. ONGC has, therefore, decided to build an interim plat-
form, utilizing a well jacket already on order, alongside Platform A and
to provide it with a new deck and equipment to pump the crude oil to shore
until the main platform is available. During this same period high pressure
gas from the gas-oil separator will be piped to shore under separator pressure
and the low pressure gas, about 15% of the total, will continue to be flared.
The main Bombay High North platform will be set adjacent to the interim plat-
form.
6.        The Bombay High North platform will be typical of the other two
offshore production platforms. (Table 1 provides a description of the Bombay
North platform). Oil (and water produced with the oil) from Platforms A and
C gas-oil separators will first go to the settling section of the platform.
A de-emulsifying agent well injected by metering pumps, and the oil-water
mixture will enter a coalescing section of pipe and the water settling drum.
The drum will be provided with an electric field generator to promote more
rapid coalescence of the water droplets. Water will be continuously removed
and the oil will be treated with pour point depressants or other flow
improvers before being continuously pumped into the crude oil trunkline
to the Uran Terminal.
7.        Gas from Platforms A and C will be piped to a compressor suction
scrubber where water and hydrocarbon condensate are removed prior to compres-
sion. The gas will be compressed in three stages with cooling and condensate
removal between stages. After the final stage of cooling and condensate
knockout, the gas will be routed through a glycol dehydration unit and dis-
charged into the gas trunkline to ths Uran Terminal. Dehydration will reduce
the dewpoint of the gas to about -50 C. It is not expected that hydrate
formation will be a problem in piping the gas ashore, but the gas does have
sufficiently high carbon dioxide content which in the presence of water poses
a serious corrosion threat to carbon steel. Since dehydration would be
required in any event prior to gas fractionation, by performing this opera-
tion offshore a serious pipeline corrosion hazard is eliminated at relatively
little extra cost.

8.        All the platforms will be of the "piled steel type".  The floating
steel frame or "jacket" will be towed in an horizontal position from the
fabrication yard out to the field where buoyancy tanks will be flooded and
the jacket iiprighted with the assistance of derrick barges. The jacket
will be secured on the bottom by massive piles driven into the seabed. A
multi-cellar deck will be fitted on the jacket, and prefabricated equipment
modules will be installed. Because of the weight of the deck and of the
module, installation can only take place under good weather conditions and
it is, therefore, expected that no major offshore construction work will
take place during the monsoon (June to October).
(iii) Subsea pipelines
9.        The production platforms will be connected to shore by two 209 km
long subsea pipelines for oil and gas, respectively. The crude oil line will
be 30" in diameter and the natural gas3line 26" in diameter, with an initial
capacity of about 260,000 b/d and 9 Mm /d, respeitively; this capacity could
eventually be increased to 460,000 b/d and 18 Mm /d by the addition of pump-
ing and compressing facilities. The size of the line has been selected on the
basis of Pipeline Technologists' (PLT) feasibility study, which shows that the
cost of the pipeline is not very sensititve to size as shown below.

An incremental investment of 22.8% will enable ONGC to almost double the
capacity of the lines and therefore to transport any incremental volume of oil
and/or gas which may be discovered in the structures surrounding Bombay High.
ONGC's decision to go for the higher diameter is justified and is in accordance
with industry practice in offshore development.
10.       The two subsea pipelines will be weight coated (average specific
gravity varying between 1.2 and 1.6 depending on the depth of water) and will
be laid on the sea bottom where it is expected that they will sink in the mud.



ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 5
No trenching is considered except for the shore approach. The pipelines
will be connected by risers to the platforms and will be provided with
scrapers and launching and receiving devices. Table II provides summary
specifications of the trunk lines.
11.       The construction of the two pipelines wil be carried out by expe-
rienced contractors having adequate lay barges available.
(iv) Onshore terminal
12.       The two subsea pipelines will terminate at Uran, in the Bay of
Trombay, where a shore terminal will be built including a crude stabilization
unit, a gas processing plant and storage facilities. The crude oil, after
it arrives at the Uran Terminal, will be routed through a crude oil stabiliza-
tion process which will remove the dissolved gases to produce a 10 Dsi RVP
(Reid vapor pressure) crude suitable for storage and refinery processing.
This will be accomplished by heating the crude oil to a predetermined temper-
ature and flashing off gas in two stages, the last under vacuum. The stabil-
ized crude is sent to storage and the gas compressed to join the gas stream
from offshore. From storage the crude oil will be pumped to the Trombay
refineries and to Butcher Island for shipment to other refineries or for
export. Table III includes a detailed list of the equipment and facilities
to be built at Uran.
13.       The gas stream arriving by trunkline from off shore and produced
at the crude stabilization plant will go to the gas fractionation plant at
Uran. The plant will initially be a simple LPG recovery unit, but it will
be designed so that additional fractionation can be added at a future date
when a demand develops for petrochemical feedstock. The LPG recovered from
the natural gas will be stored in pressurized tanks from which it will be
pumped to the Trombay refineries for additional processing or bottling and
distribution. All residual gas will initially be piped to FCI for feedstock
in ammonia production. Any excess gas not utilized by FCI or others will be
used for fuel at the Trombay power station.
(v) Supply lines
14.       From the Uran Terminal, crude oil will be shipped by pipeline across
the Bay of Trombay to the refineries and through existing loading lines from
Trombay to the Butcher Island Terminal where coastal tankers will be loaded
for supply of domestic refineries.  Natural gas and LPG will also be shipped
by pipeline across the Bay to the Trombay fertilizer plant of FCI, to a
power plant and to the refineries.
15.       The crossing of the Bay of Trombay presents some technical problems
as the supply lines cross the navigational channels of the Port Authority
and routes have to keep clear of existing and planned dredging areas. ONGC



ANNEX 9
Page 5 of 5
has been working with the Port Authority and a final route has been agreed
upon. (Summary specifications of the supply lines are in Table II).
(iv) Supply base and telecommunications
16.       So far ONGC has been operating from facilities leased from the
Bombay Port Authority. These facilities have been adequate but they are
scattered over a wide area and will not be sufficient in the future, par-
ticularly if Bombay becomes one of the major centers of offshore operations
in the west coast of India. ONGC has therefore decided on the construction
of a supply base which will include:
-    Berthing facilities for supply vessels;
-    Repair facilities for offshore drilling rigs and
associated equipment;
-    Storage facilities for the offshore operations;
-    Warehouses, offices and communicatino center;
-    Helicopter base;
-    Housing for employees;
The supply base will be built at Nhava Sheva, a site recently acquired by
ONGC. Originally ONGC planned to operate only the above facilities and to
lease out additional space to offshore contractors. In the future, ONG.C may
decide on the construction of a fabrication yard depending on the development
of offshore projects.
17.       A telecommunications and telecontrol system will be built to
provide adequate operational control over the production and transport
facilities.

BOMBAY HIGH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Environmental Impact
A.   General
1.        The GOI and its agencies are aware of the importance of protecting
the marine and coastal environment from depredation by man. Existing omnibus
legislation authorizes the appropriate ministries to promulgate regulations
governing activities in their areas of responsibility within the 200 mile
economic zone. The British North Sea regulations are being used as a guide
in the case of hydrocarbon exploration, production and transportation. In
this connection, the Norwegian government has also offered assistance in
drafting such offshore regulations as marine pipeline construction and oper-
ation, pollution control, diving and fire safety. ONGC, for its part, has
formulated a contingency plan, still in draft form, for coping with oil
spills and has issued tenders for a vessel outfitted for fire fighting and
oil spill clean-up. In addition the GOI is establishing a Coast Guard Ser-
vice which became operative on February 1, 1977 when the Indian navy turned
over four vessels to the new organization. Among its other duties the Coast
Guard will enforce maritime pollution control regulations and come to the aid
of ONGC in such emergencies as well blowouts, fires and spills.
2.        The following is a discussion of the various ecological considera-
tions related to the Bombay High project.
B.   Pipelines
3.        Transportation of crude oil by pipelines reduces the potential
for sea pollution over movement by tankers. The pipelines from the offshore
platforms to the onshore terminal at Uran, Butcher Island and the Trombay
area will be closed systems in which the oil and gas will be contained under
pressure at all times. Potentially polluting operations such as loading and
unloading tankers and releasing oily tanker ballast water will be eliminated.
The possibility of leakage due to corrosion, third party damage or excessive
internal pressure will be minimized to the fullest extent practical by the
following pipeline design provisions:
(a)  automatic pump and compressor shutdown when
pipeline pressures or flow rates exceed safe
preset limits;



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 3
(b) constant monitoring by computer aided equipment
of all pump and compressor station operations
with automatic shutdown under unsafe conditions;
(c) sacrificial anodes and impressed current corrosion
prevention systems;
(d) coating of the pipelines with coal tar enamel for
corrosion protection;
(e) burying of the pipelines below sea bottom under
ship channels and other areas of marine activity;
(f) burying of the onshore pipelines except within
battery limits of the terminal; and
(g) routing of the pipelines away from ship anchoring
areas at sea and built-up areas on land.
C.   Offshore Platforms
(a) Oil and Gas Streams
4.        The movement and processing of the oil and gas will take place
in closed systems which will prevent loss to the air. Water separated from
the oil and gas streams will be treated in oily water separation and treat-
ing facilities which will reduce the oil content to about 20 parts per mil-
lion (PPM) before dispersal. All vapors will be released to the flare, and
liquid spills will be contained and directed to the oily water facilities.
(b) Chemical Additives and Reagents
5.        De-emulsifying agents:  These are organic surface active com-
pounds used to promote separation of the water in the crude oil. They will
be mostly retained in the oil. The portion in the effluent water will be
extremely dilute and will not be harmful to marine life.
6.        Glycol compounds:  These chemicals will be used in gas dehydration
and will be contained in a closed regenerative system. There will be minor
losses to the gas pipeline. Accidental spills or leaks will be contained
and directed to the oily water facilities where the glycols will be largely
neutralized and disbursed without harmful effect.
7.        Pour point depressants:  The type of viscosity modifier has not
yet been determined. However, these compounds are used in very low con-
centrations (about 200-300 PPM) and will be retained in the oil. The
normal preventions against leaks and spills will be taken.



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 3
8.        Corrosion inhibitors:  These are also added in very low concen-
trations and will be retained in the oil and gas.
(c) Life Support Systems
9.        Provisions will be made to treat human waste and refuse to a stan-
dard equivalent to present practices in the North Sea.
(d) Products of Combustion
10.       Combustion gases from turbines driving compressors, pumps and elec-
tric generators will be exhausted to the atmosphere. However, this will not
cause an atmospheric pollution problem in view of the remote location and
the fact that the gas is essentially free of hydrogen sulfide and combustion
temperatures are too low for nitrogen oxides formation. This will also apply
to the flares which will normally only have pilot burners lighted. During
plant upsets when large quantities of gas might have to be flared there may
be smoke-and soot production, but proper adjustments can eliminate this con-
dition.
D.   Onshore Facilities
11.       All oil and gas handling and processing onshore will take place
in closed systems from which normal losses will be minimal. Effluent water
from the facilities will undergo oily water separation and treatment to limit
oil content to 20 PPM before disposal. Gas leakage will be vented to a remote
flare which will also dispose of combustible gases during a process upset.
Liquid leaks and spills will be contained and washed to the oily water sewer.
The process areas will be paved to prevent seepage into the soil. The chemi-
cals, gas combustion and life support considerations discussed for the off-
shore facilities above also apply onshore and should not cause any notice-
able pollution problems. Crude oil storage tanks will have floating roofs
which ride on the liquid surface as the tank fills and empties thus elimi-
nating the vapor losses due to "breathing."  The tanks will be erected within
dikes to contain spills; spills and water drawoff will go to the oily water
sewer.

ANNEX 18
Page 1 of 4
INDIA
BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions to Financial Statements and Projections
A. Producing Properties and Depletion Policies
1.        Producing Properties account may be defined as the value assigned
to the development of natural resources. Depletion is defined as prorated
value assigned to the extinction of natural resources.  The unit of account-
ing for producing property is an area covered by a license or lease. All
expenditure incurred on exploration and development (other than survey as it
is not possible to identify survey expenditure to a particular area) of the
area under the mining lease is capitalized under Producing Properties which
represents the total effort in monetary terms expended to locate and develop
the hydrocarbons for exploitation.
2.        There had been several changes in ONGC's policy in charging deple-
tion of producing properties and amortization of exploration expenditure with
retrospective effect from FY 1972. These changes are described as follows:
(a) In FY 1975 ONGC adopted the amended provisions of the
Agreement under Section 42 of the Income Tax Act,
1961, and charged all producing properties equally
over three years instead of fifteen years commencing
from the accounting year when the properties are de-
clared as commercially productive.
(b)  Up to fY 1974 ONGC treated an area as commercially
productive when it attained 25% of its peak antici-
pated annual production. Since the adoption of the
amended provision of the Income Tax Act, ONGC began
to treat an area as commercially productive from the
date the regular production started.
(c) Under the new Agreement, all expenditure on geological
or geophysical surveys, exploration, and drilling in-
curred before the date of commencement of the regular
production is capitalized as Producing Properties.
The expenditure after the date of regular production
is charged against current income.
3.        The main effect of these changes is to accelerate the increase
of operating expenses, and thereby reduce operating income for tax purposes.
As shown below, this policy introduces wide variations in the operating in-
come computation. As a consequence, the financial accounts do not reflect
the actual position of the producing assets of the company.

B. Financial Statements
4.        The financial statements in this report cover ONGC's operations
onshore and offshore for the period FY 1973 through FY 1982. Separate projec-
tions have been prepared for each of the two operations. The results are con-
solidated to show ONGC's overall position. The following paragraphs describe
the basis and assumptions to the projections.
Production
5.        The production volume estimates for BHDP were prepared by additional
Director (Finance and Accounts) on December 1976 (Table 1). The projection
for onshore activities is based on ONGC's revised Five-Year Plan (December
1975) and the estimates made by the Ministry of Petroleum. The onshore
production is constrained by the producing capability of existing oil fields.
The production rate depends mostly on the availability of surface facilities.
It is assumed that the necessary transportation facilities and refining
capacities will, become available by FY 1981. The gas production is esti-
mated according to the projected crude oil production and average historical
gas/oil ratio. The following table shows ONGC's onshore production volume and
number of rigs for the period FY 1976 to FY 1979:

Excise Tax and Sales Tax
6.        Since August 1975 GOI has levied an excise tax on the sale of
crude oil by ONGC at Rs 60 per ton. In the projection, an equivalent amount
of the excise tax has been taken out of the operating costs for FYs 1975 and
1976, and the average price per ton of crude oil has been adjusted accord-
ingly. Since no royalty and state sales tax is levied on BHDP offshore crude
oil, the sales tax is calculated as 4.0%, and royalty is calculated at Rs 45
per ton on ONGC's onshore crude oil only.
Operating Costs
7.        The operating costs consist of drilling and engineering services,
production and transportation services, repair and maintenance expenditure,
and other miscellaneous expenses. It is ONGC's accounting practice to col-
lect and allocate all expenditure and depreciation on service basis to each
activity/area, which the mission was not able to breakout at the aggregate
level. Direct opetating costs are projected at Rs 35 per ton of crude oil
production for onshore reflecting past history. For BHDP the estimates pre-
pared by Addition Director (F&A) are used. Since ONGC is to have a more re-
stricted employment policy to limit its present oversize staff, and the BHDP
expansion will have a minimum effect on ONGC in terms of staff, wages are in-
cluded in the direct operating costs, and are not projected separately.
Exploration Costs
8.        From statistics on exploration expenditures in the US petroleum
industry compiled by the Chase Manhattan Bank, on an average the exploration
expenditure is about 25% of the fixed asset budgets. The same ratio is used
for ONGC's exploration costs as part of the capital expenditure which includes
fixed assets, development drilling and exploration expenditure. These expen-
ditures include only the cost of dry holes as any successful well would be
charged against a new project.
Depreciation
9.        Depreciation is calculated at an average composite rate of 7% on the
average fixed assets of two consecutive years for onshore. Depreciation
for the BHDP project is calculated on the basis of ONGC depreciation schedule
(Table 2). The expenditure for development drilling and exploration are
deleted in ten equal installaments. Exploratory expenditures are amortized
equally over 15 years after they are commercially producing.
Borrowings
10.       In the past, the proceeds collected by GOI from the excise tax on the
sale of crude oil have been transferred to OIDB for its financing of the oil-
related industries. It is assumed in the forecast that the GOI and OIDB will
provide all necessary funds to ONGC besides the Bank's proposed loan at the
average cost of borrowing to ONGC (para. 11).

Interests and Dividends
11.       The interest rate for the 15 year loans from OIDB is 4.5% per annum
with a two year grace period and 13 equal yearly repayments. Government loans
bear interest at an average rate of 10.25% per annum with a four year grace
period and six equal yearly repayments. In the absence of a definite financ-
ing plan, the forecast assumes the average cost of capital to ONGC, which is
6.5% with 2 year grace period and 8 equal yearly repayments. The interest
rate for commercial borrowing is assumed at 8.3% with a two-year grace period
and five equal yearly repayments. As in the past, dividend on government
capital is waived as long as ONGC borrows from the GOI and/or OIDB.
Other
12.       In the past ONGC's accounts receivable had been two to three months
of total revenue. In the projection, it is assumed that bill collections
will be improved to within five weeks of total annual revenues. Inventories
and materials are estimated on the basis of average operational and construc-
tion requirements. Cash has been projected on the basis of debt service, cash
operating costs, and local cost of construction requirements.
13.       Accounts payable and provisions are estimated on the basis of inven-
tory level, operating costs including taxes, and local construction cost pay-
ments.

BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Financial Viability of the Bombay High Development Project
A. General
1.        On the basis of production volumes, unit price assumptions, operat-
ing expenses, and capital investments derived from De Golyer and MacNaughton
studies and agreed upon by ONGC, a discounted cash flow analysis has been
developed for the BHDP. The analysis which includes the entire development
program including water injection covers a twenty-four year period 1973/74 to
1966/97.
2.        The analysis follows the practice in the petroleum industry, and
uses such yardsticks as internal discounted cash flow (DCF) rate of return
and payout period essentially to rank vaious alternatives in the investment
decision process.
3.        The analysis is based on the actual domestic price to ONGC as of
January 1977. The US dollar equivalent of these unit prices are $5.00lbl
for crude oil, $55.50/1,000/cubic meters for natural gas, and $90.00/metric
ton for LPG. The analysis also includes a study on the basis of $13.00/bl
for crude oil which is closer to the import parity of a similar quality crude
oil landed at Bombay.
B. Summary and Conclusion
4.        The Bombay High field is a giant field, which, with the addition
of North Bassein, would produce over a billion barrels over the next 30
years under conservative assumptions. According to industry standards,
these fields are extremely profitable and would yield oil at an average
cost of about US$1.35 per barrel, or about one-tenth of the international
price of oil as of January 1977. On the basis of US$13 per barrel, the
overall net foreign exchange savings are of about US$16.0 billion over the
period considered in the analysis (1977/78 - 1996/97). The discounted cash
flow return (DCF) is 66.2%. This shows that nothing short of a complete
collapse of international prices or a drastic reduction of output could
jeopardize the financial viability of the proposed project. The former is
not likely to occur and, in fact it is more likely that oil prices will in-
crease in real terms in the future, thus improving the feasibility of the
project. The latter is a risk that exists in any oil development project.
However, as explained in Annex 8, the studies carried out by ONGC and their
consultants, including the independent experts hired by the Bank, indicated
that ONGC's production targets are reasonable.  The production schedule
for crude oil, natural gas and LPG is given in Annex 18.



ANNEX 22
Page 2 of 2
4.        At US$ 5/barrel the development program would yield a DCF
return of 19.8% after taxes to ONGC. This return is somewhat lower than
what an international oil company would require for a foreign venture
but it is comparable to what is normally required for domestic ventures.
5.        The net present value of the savings, calculated on the basis
of US$13 (barrel, over the life of the project (20 years) is as follows:
discount rate (%)
10%        20%         40%
Net Present Value
(US$ million)            6,682       3,362       1,030
The payout time is about 1.7 years at US$13/66 and 4.8 years at US$5/barrel.
C. Sensitivity Analysis
6.        The main risk in this project is a delay in the production.
The sensitivity analysis shows that a delay of one full year, which is
unlikely to occur would bring the DCF return to about 50% at US$13/barrel.
7.        Table I and 2 provide the discounted cash flow under the two
price assumptions.

INDIA
BOMBAY HIGH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumptions Used in the Economic Evaluation
A.  Future supply/demand of petroleum in India
1.        Petroleum demand projections were derived from the Fuel Policy Com-
mittee Report of 1974 and from the Second India Studies: Energy (K. Parikh -
1976). These studies show that india will require about 40-50 tmint of oil by
1983/84 and about 57-77.5 Mmt by 1990. In establishing India's future demand
the higher assumption was used until 1985, as it was assumed that coal substi-
tution would not have had its full impact. Beyond 1985 it was assumed that
coal substitution will be more significant and petroleum demand was estimated
as the average between the higher and lower bracket (Chart II).
2.        Future onshore production was estimated using linear regression over
a period of 17 years. The results show that it would reach about 11.75 Mmt in
1980, 14.5 Mmt in 1985 and 17 Mmt by 1990 (Chart I).  These projections assume
the continuation of past trends (the discovery of small to medium fields).
Offshore production is based on ONGC's projections and on DeGolyer and
MacNaughton Report (Chart II). The results are summarized below:

8.   Selection of the Optimum Development Program for Bombay High
3.        At the initiative of the Bank, De Golyer and Mac Naughion (consult-
-ants, U.S.) have carried out two reservoir engineering studies. The first one
to assess the reserves of the Bombay High and North Bassein fields (Annex 8),
the second one to optimize the production program of the Bombay High field.



ANNEX 23
Page 2 of 3
No optimization was carried out for the North Bassein field as production
history was too short. The second study led to the selection of two possible
production schedules. The first one is based on achieving maximum production
as soon as technically feasible, the second one aims at maintaining a steady
level of production (plateau) for several years and at maximizing ultimate
recovery. A summary of the technical characteristics of the two schemes
and of their relative economic feasibility is given below.
Case I                       Case II

Rate of return %                      93.2                         91.4
Net present value over 15
years at discount rates of
- 10% (US$ million)              4,787                        4,585
- 20% (US$ million)              2,527                        2,456
- 40% (US$ million)                866                          845
4.        ONGC development program is predicated on maintaining a steady
production over an 8 to 10 years period and on maximizing recovery, which
according to the above results in the technical solution which would maximize
benefits. Since reservoir studies are still being carried out for the North
Bassein field, a flat production rate of 40,000 bd, which can be achieved
from existing wells, has been assumed over the life of the project.
C. Cost/Benefit Analysis
5.        The cost of the project is estimated at US$1,620 million, it ex-
cludes cutoms duties and taxes but includes provision of US$350 million for



ANNEX 23
Page 3 of 3
the further exploration of the Bombay High area and US$32.3 million for
the facilities required to use the crude oil and the gas (Annex 24).
Operating costs are based on ONGC's projections adjusted on the basis of
historical costs in similar projects.
6.        Benefits are the saving derived from the substitution of domestic
crude oil, natural gas and LPG for imports. The value of these products was
estimated on the basis of international prices (CIF India) for crude oil and
LPG and of domestic prices, which are comparable to international prices, for
natural gas.
Crude oil            US$13.00/bl
Natural gas          US$55.00/000 m
LPG                  US$90.000/Mt
7.        The rate of discount which equalizes the costs and benefits streams
over a period of 20 years is 165% if sunk costs are not included and 66% if
they are included. Since sunk costs are essentially the cost of exploration
and early development drilling, the latter provides a better appreciation
of the economic feasibility of the entire program. No attempt has been
made to calculate an incremental return for the project as the facilities
to be built under Phase III cannot be dissociated from those already cons-
tructed and from those planned under Phase IV and V.
D. Sensitivity Analysis
8.        An increase of 20% in the program cost would bring the economic
return of the entire program (including sunk costs) to 56%. A delay of
one year in production would bring it to 50%.

BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Utilization of the Crude Oil, Natural Gas
and Natural Gas Liquids
A. General
1.        The question of the utilization of the crude oil, associated natural
gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) to be produced at the Bombay High field and
associated structures was raised quite early after the first productive wells
had been drilled. At that time a Working Group (the Bombay High Working
Group) had been created under the chairmanship of the General Manager of
Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) to study:
(i)  what design modifications would be required in
the two Trombay refineries to use the Bombay High
(BH) crude;
(ii)   what markets existed for natural gas, liquified
getroleum gas (LPG) and other NGL in the Trombay
area; and
(iii)  what would be required to make maximum use of the
associated gas which otherwise would have to be
flared.
From February to July 1976 the Working Group did some considerable work by
itself and hired consultants to carry out a comprehensive market survey of
the potential utilization of gas and associated products in the Trombay area.
A contract was signed in mid-September 1976 with Stone and Webster India
Corporation (SWIC) a subsidiary of Stone and Webster (consultants, U.S.).
The final report of Stone and Webster would be available by mid-1977. The
following is based on their preliminary conclusions, and from data supplied
by the Working Group and HPCL.

B. Plans for the Utilization of the Bombay High Crude Oil
2.        There are at present two refineries in the Trombay area with a
capacity of 3.75 tfmt/yr and 2.75 Mmt/yr respectively. These two refineries
are located in the same area and are supplied by a single marine terminal
located on Butcher Island in the Bay of Trombay. Both are relatively simple
refineries with a high yield in middle distillates and white products. Until
recently they were supplied by Persian Gulf crude imported by tanker. The
Working Group has already studied the problems arising from a switch from
imported crude-oil to Bombay High supplies. Their conclusions are that the
two refineries could use a BR crude feedstock provided that some minor modi-
fications are made to the process design. These modifications would include
the installation of additional heating and desalting equipment. The current
program calls for an input of Bombay High crude of 2 Mmt by the end of 1977,
which will be processed with Middle East crude and of 4.6 Mmt by the end of
1978 which will be processed neat.
3.        Other refineries are making modifications to absorb BE crude by
1980/81 (Koyali 3 Mmt, Cochin 1 Mmt, and Coril 1.2 Mmt).  Thus by the end of
1980 the volume of Bombay High crude which could be refined in Indian refin-
eries should be close to 10 Mmt/yr (200,000 b/d) which is consistent with-
ONGC's production schedule. The cost of these modifications should not exceed
US$10 million equivalent which should be financed from internal cash genera-
tion or loans from OIDB or domestic commercial banks.
4.        Even after the above modifications have been carried out, the two
Trombay refineries will not absorb the entire crude production of the BH field
(para. 3). Excess crude oil will therefore be shipped by coastal tankers to
other coastal refineries in the south and north-western part of the country,
or exported abroad if the existing process of these refineries cannot absorb
the full production of Bombay High. It is not expected that there would be
any problem in marketing Bombay High crude which, despite its high pour point
and wax content, is very attractive because of its high yield in light and
middle distillates.
C. Potential Market for Natural Gas and Natural
Gas Liquids in the Trombay Area
K   5.    The natural gas produced in association with Bombay High crude oil
contains several components which can be divided into three main categories
of products:
(a) lean gas consisting mainly of methane which can either
be used as a high quality fuel or as feedstock for the
fertilizer industry;
(b) liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which consists mainly of
propane and butane and can be used in cylinders of about
15 to 45 kg to supply the residential market or in bulk
to supply some commercial and small industrial users; and



ANNEX 24
Page 3 of 5
(c) ethane which is a feedstock for the petrochemical
industry.
It should be pointed out that while associated gas is a valuable by-product
of the oil production, its relative value compared to crude is low. At a
crude production level of 200,000 b/d, assuming present international prices
for crude oil and a price based on heat content equivalence for the gas, the
total value of the gas produced in association with BH crude oil would be
about US$85 million/yr equivalent to about 1/10 of the value of the crude.
It is therefore obvious that any project should be designed to maximize crude
production and utlization in the shortest possible time, even if it implies
that some gas has to be flared in the early stage of production.
(a) Potential Markets for Methane
6.        The Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI) owns a large plant in the
Trombay area. Part of this plant currently produces fertilizers using naphtha
as feedstock and refinery gas as fuel for steam raising and utilities. FCI
estimates that these facilities 5ould be converted to the use of natural gas
and could absorb about 700,000 m /day by mid-1978 when the gas will be first
available. FCI is in the process of studying the conversion of its facilities
from naphtha to gas. In addition, it is planned that an additional fertilizer
unit (ammonia/urea plant) will be added by the end of 31979. It has already
been decided that it could absorb about 1.2 million m /day.
(b) Potential Market for LPG
7.        The main use of LPG in the Trombay/Bombay area will be for residen-
tial purposes as a substitute for kerosene or charcoal currently used for
cooking and water heating. As in most cities where a large number of poten-
tial consumers do not have access to an organized distribution of energy
(large gas and/or electricity distribution grid), the demand for LPG has been
growing fast in the area and had to be limited because of inadequate supplies
from the refineries. After processing, associated gas should yield about
200,000 tons of LPG which will be marketed in the Trombay/Bombay area.
Current plans are that about 50% of the total LPG productio7 will be marketed
in cylinders and the other half in bulk, within the Bombay/Trombay area or
will be shipped by rail tankers to other areas where there is already a
shortage.
(c) The Market for Petrochemical Feedstocks
8.        A substantial part of the Indian petrochemical industry iS
in the Trombay area, and could use the ethane fraction obtained frow :T
processing of the associated gas as feedstock for the production of StLuyIer,_
and other petrochemicals.  The Working Group has already carried out a stud-
which shows that over the years it would be possible to absorb about iO0 tons
per day of petrochemical feedstock. However, these estimates are baess on a



ANNEX 24
Page 4 of 5
market survey which is now somewhat outdated and should be revised in the
light of the studies currently being carried out by the Working Group and
their consultants.
9.        It is likely that the utilization of petrochemical feedstock will
not start before the early 1980's and therefore the value of these products
has not been taken into account in the financial and economic evaluations of
the project as it was considered that any further project will have to be
economically justified and financially viable.
D. Plans for the Utilization of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
10.       As explained in Annex 9 dealing with the description of the
projects, it has now been decided that the primary separation of crude oil
and gas will take place offshore. The main reason for this is that a two-
phase flow pipeline (oil and gas in solution) would present some serious
operational problems.
(i) Proposed Plans for the Utilization of Methane
11.       The facilities required to use the methane fraction would include
subtransmission lines from the gas treating plant (or the shore terminal)
to the main users and delivery stations at the users' plants. At present
two main users are being considered: FCI and possibily a power plant which
will be used as a load balancing factor.  With the continuous3supply of gas
and the storage capacity of the line (estimated at about 2 Mm ) no storage is
being considered.
12.       The required conversion from liquid fuels will be carried out by the
enterprises themselves with the assistance of the process designers and/or
consultants. It is planned that FCI and the power plant will be ready to take
gas from mid-1978 onwards. The cost of conversion of existing facilities is
estimated at US$15 million and the cost of the sub-transmission facilities at
about US$3 million.
(ii) Proposed Plans for the Utilization of LPG
13.       LPG will be available at the refineries where facilities exist for
handling and storing. It is planned that these facilities will be expanded
to include additional storage of about 5% of total annual production and
cylinder filling facilities at the refinery and outside Bombay with a
capacity of 80,000 t/y and 40,000 t/y respectively. In addition it is
planned to procure additional rail tank cars to supplement existing ones
and ship LPG to other cities in India, principally Delhi.



ANNEX 24
Page 5 of 5
14.       The total cost of these facilities is estimated at about US$4.3 mil-
lion of which about 70% will be for the purchase of about 1.2 million cylinders.
15.       It is expected that the procurement and construction of the above
facilities would be carried out by the staff of the two refineries which are
quite experienced in this field.
