INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA FOR THE BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan,
in an amount equivalent to US$150 million, to the Government of India (GOI),
to help finance the construction of facilities required to produce up to
140,000 barrels per day of oil and 2.2 million cubic meters per day of natural
gas from the Bombay High and North Bassein oil and gas fields, and the con-
struction of facilities to process, transport, store and deliver to users the
oil and natural gas expected to be available from these fields at full pro-
duction. Amortization would be over 20 years, including three years' grace,
at an interest rate of 8.2% per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be on-
lent by the GOI to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission for a period of not more
than 20 years, including three years' grace, at an interest rate of 10.25% per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(1529-IN dated April 25, 1977), was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 3, 1977. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size and diversity; the country is divided into more than 20 States with
a population of some 630 million speaking over 60 languages. Since Independ-
ence the trend in growth of GNP has been about 3.5% per annum, or a little
over 1% per annum in per capita terms, while over the five years 1971/72 -
1975/76 it fell to as low as 2.5% per annum, in spite of the record harvest
of 1975/76. This unsatisfactory performance is in part the result of the low
availability of investable resources: the net transfer of resources from
abroad has never been above 3% of GNP, and fell to as little as 0.8% between
1969/70 and 1973/74; similarly, while India's domestic savings effort compares
well with other countries at the same average income levels, the rate has very
rarely exceeded 17% of GNP. The investment rate puts India in the lower third
of all developing countries. More significant perhaps is the fact that in
spite of a marked rise in the: investment rate from about 10% in the early 1950's
to about 18% over the past fifteen years, the trend in GNP growth has remained
about the same. This indicates a marked decline in the efficiency of capital
use, as a result of increasing capacity underutilization, long project gesta-
tion, and increased emphasis on relatively capital-intensive projects and
sectors.
4.        Since Independence the growth of the socio-economic infrastructure
(transport, education, health services, etc.) has been impressive, but has
1/   Parts I and II of this report are the same as those in the President's
Report on the Periyar Vaigai Irrigation Project (P-2045-IN, dated
May 19, 1977).



often been achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality.
Many industrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly success-
ful, but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and struc-
tural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many
other parts of the world; in other regions there has been stagnation, and in
some, decline. Although national income has increased in most years, there
has been no rise in the living standards of the vast mass of rural and urban
poor, conservatively estimated at 200 million people with per capita incomes
of US$70 per annum (converted at the official exchange rate) and US$250 on a
purchasing power parity basis.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.    Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, with its share of national product declining
only gradually from about 50% to 42% over the last twenty years. The share
of manufacturing industry has increased only slowly and, since the late 1960's,
has remained approximately constant at about 16%. There has, however, been
a shift in the composition of manufacturing production, with consumer, inter-
mediate, and capital goods now contributing about one-third each, compared
with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods 25 years ago.
Recent Trends
6.        In March, 1977, a party other than Congress formed a Government for
the first time since Independence. Undoubtedly, changes in economic policies
and emphasis will be formulated in the course of the next few months. The
state of the economy was not a prominent election issue; in fact the economy
was generally stronger than at any time in the last six years. Although the
growth of GDP in 1976/77 is not expected to have exceeded 2%, this was on top
of the very good growth of 8.8% in 1975/76. Agricultural production is ex-
pected to have fallen by about 3%, but only because of the return to a more
normal harvest of 110-114 million tons of foodgrains after the record 121
million tons of the previous year. Industrial growth was around 10% in 1976/77,
which is significantly above the rates achieved in the late 1960's and early
1970's. Exports continued their bright performance, rising by 18% in US dol-
lars and 12% in volume terms. The overall resource position, with record
foreign exchange and foodgrain reserves, is exceptionally strong, and gives
the Government considerable room for maneuver.
7.        In agriculture the bumper crop of 1975/76 was largely due to
remarkably good weather conditions; the good crop in 1976/77 - a foodgrain
harvest in the region of 110 million tons would be the second largest on
record - was produced under generally normal weather. A conspicuous change
was the increase in fertilizer use, which rose by more than 20% over 1975/76,
following marked declines in fertilizer prices. Industrial production bene-
fited from fewer labor disputes, fuller utilization of installed capacity
in both private and public sectors, a more liberal import policy, relatively
good power availability, and increased demand because of higher consumer
incomes, expanded exports and higher public expenditures. However, whole-
sale prices,-which had fallen 14% from September 1974 through March 1976,



- 3 -
rose 11% from the end of March to December 1976 and continued rising into
1977. It is not yet clear whether this upsurge indicates a new inflationary
trend or merely a correction of the previous sharp decline in the relative
prices of a range of agricultural commodities.
8.        The balance of payments situation has improved dramatically since
the 1973-1975 period. In 1975/76 the trade deficit was $1,530 million, which
was more than covered by US$1,560 million in net aid, US$205 million in net
purchases of currency from the IMF, and US$559 million in net miscellaneous
capital and invisibles (mostly private remittances); indeed, this large
aggregate net resource inflow led to a US$794 million increase in foreign ex-
change reserves, to a level of US$2.2 billion. In 1976/77, the trade deficit
is estimated to have fallen by US$1,080 million, due to a rise of US$845
million in exports and also to a fall of US$235 million in imports, primarily
because of lower prices and volumes of foodgrains and fertilizer imports. The
decreased trade deficit, along with a further increase in the net inflow of
miscellaneous capital and invisibles from abroad of US$540 million, more than
offset the fall of US$350 million in net aid and the substantial repurchases
of currency from the IMF, and allowed a US$1.5 billion addition to reserves,
which reached a level of US$3.7 billion at the end of March 1977.
Development Prospects
9.        The favorable economic situation gives the new Government the op-
portunity to address the longer-term constraints on growth. The basic task
is to raise the overall rate of growth from its historic range of 3-4%. In
the long run this will require raising more resources for investment. But it
will also be important to achieve significantly better utilization of avail-
able resources, partly through an immediate boost to industrial demand.
10.       In agriculture, the basic problem remains that, despite the record
foodgrain crop in 1975/76 and the good crop in 1976/77, the long-term growth
rate of foodgrain production has been unacceptably low, at about 2.5% per
annum over the last seventeen years, and only 2% in the last ten. This has
meant that only in good years has there been any margin of production to
cater to per capita growth in food consumption, and in normal years it has
been necessary to import food. There is considerable scope for stepping up
growth both by increasing the use of inputs and by raising the productivity
of existing capacity. Three promising developments in regard to the first
are the sharply higher outlays on irrigation in the Fifth Plan period along
with a renewed determination to complete projects expeditiously; the indica-
tions that private investment in tubewells is picking up again after a slow-
down in the early 1970's; and the recent recovery of fertilizer demand. With
regard to-more productive use of existing capacity, there is increased aware-
ness in the Government that the benefits of irrigation projects can be much
increased not only through command area development but also through more
efficient design and operation of major surface irrigation infrastructure.
Also, hopes have been generated for increasing productivity on both irrigated
and rainfed farms through a reorganized and improved extension and research
system, which has been recently introduced in several States in northern and
eastern India.



- 4 -
11.       A strong effort to raise agricultural growth is essential, not only
to meet food requirements, but also because of the pervasive influence of
agriculture on the levels of activity in other sectors of the economy. This
effort must also be so structured as to increase the incomes of small and
marginal farmers, in order to increase production, since they operate 25% of
the cultivated land and account for somewhat more than 25% of production,
and for welfare reasons, since they make up about 70% of rural population
and constitute the majority of those living below the poverty level.
12.       The industrial sector is poised for rapid growth, as the most serious
constraints on the supply side have been removed by the improved situation
with respect to power, coal and imported raw materials and components. There
has been a progressive liberalization of controls and the 1976/77 Central
Budget announced a reduction of some taxes on private industry. In many
cases management of public enterprises has improved, as is reflected in their
markedly higher production and profitability as a group. In the medium
term it is the demand for industrial output that will determine industrial
growth. In certain industries, export demand will provide a strong pull on
production; this is true, for example, for iron and steel, certain chemicals,
some electrical equipment, processed agricultural products, and vehicles.
But the impact of increased exports on overall industrial demand will grow
only slowly given the current low share of exports in sales. If the higher
growth and productivity in agriculture discussed earlier were to materialize,
it would provide a significant stimulus to industry. It is difficult to
specify the linkages explicitly; but because of the large share that agri-
culture holds in GNP, the coefficients do not have to be large for agricul-
tural growth and the concomitant growth in demand for industrially produced
inputs and mass consumption goods to boost overall industrial demand signi-
ficantly. A higher public deficit and increased public investments are
the instruments most directly under Government control, and also those that
can increase demand for industrial products most immediately. The interim
budget of the new Government moves strongly in this direction with a 240%
increase in the planned budget deficit over 1976/77.
13.       Improvement in the supply of energy augurs well for India's
ability to meet the needs of a more rapidly growing economy. Organization-
al and transportation problems in the coal industry have largely been over-
come; production is sufficient to meet demand, stocks are comfortable, and
the industry has good prospects for meeting both domestic and export demand.
Supply of electricity continues to be a concern, because of the vulnerability
of hydro power to variations in the monsoon and the continued existence of
local shortages, even when the overall power situation is satisfactory. But
the severe power supply constraints of the past have been relaxed for the
moment at least, and several institutional improvements promise to reduce
the future incidence of shortages: underutilization of capacity has been
virtually eliminated in well-established power stations; progress has been
made in the organized exchange of power between States thus relieving local-
ized power shortages; and the problems of slow implementation of power invest-
ment due to delayed delivery of materials and equipment have virtually dis-
appeared. In addition, the delays caused by the inability of State Electricity



Boards to finance projects expeditiously have been eased by their improved
financial position following tariff increases, and by increased Plan outlays
by the Central Government. The medium-term prospects for the oil and gas
sector have been further improved by major new finds of oil and gas near the
large offshore Bombay High field. Crude oil from Bombay High was brought to
shore for the first time in May 1976; production reached an annual rate of 2
million tons by March 1977, and will rise to a level of 12-13 million tons by
1982/83. Although India will continue to import crude at or somewhat above
the current level, much of the foreign exchange burden of rapidly rising
imports will be avoided by the development of these resources. Prospects are
also bright for further discoveries offshore, given the current high level of
exploration activity.
14.       Underlying all other development issues is that of population.    Al-
though India's population growth rate of a little over 2% is not high in com-
parison with most LDCs, the size of the absolute increment - 13 million
annually - is daunting. It appears, however, that population growth may have
passed its peak in the 1960's, and it is expected to continue to slow down,
both because the birth rate will continue to decline and because the death
rate will not fall as steeply as in the past. With a sustained family planning
effort, it should be possible to lower the population growth rate to 1.1% per
annum by the end of the century. Our "best guess" projection of India's
population by 2000 is 880 million. Many of the benefits of family planning
policy will only be felt beyond the turn of the century, but the decline in
fertility will bring about an early change in the age structure of the popu-
lation. The school age group will grow more slowly or not at all after 1981,
thereby reducing the pressures on the primary and secondary education system.
The labor force, however, will continue to grow at a fast rate until the end
of the century.
15.       India's balance of payments position should be comfortable for the
next few years. The combination of past global inflation and increased ex-
ports have reduced the proportion of export earnings needed for debt service
from 30% in 1970/71 to 16% in 1976/77. The ratio is not likely to rise above
this level in the next few years. Given continuing favorable policies, the
volume of exports should continue to grow by 7% to 10% annually in the near
future; and import needs for fertilizer, POL and foodgrains will continue to
require a diminishing propor,tion of available foreign exchange. The large
inflow of private remittances shows no immediate signs of declining and should
continue to bolster the foreign exchange position in the medium term. Imports,
including a variety of capital goods, have already been liberalized signifi-
cantly. Increased public investment and a revival of the domestic economy is
likely to generate substantial additional import demand. However, this should
be quite manageable, given the currently comfortable foreign exchange position,
bright export prospects, and continuation of the current real level of net aid.
The present situation presents an opportunity to raise the level of investment
and, consequently, reach a more satisfactory level of long-term growth.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
16.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 50 loans and 85 development
credits to India totalling US$1,762 million and US$4,338 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$816 million has been
repaid, and US$1,432 million was still undisbursed as of May 31, 1977.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of May 31, 1977,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totalling US$58.4
million, of which US$13.0 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.9 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$30.9 million, US$24.4 mil-
lion represents loans and US$6.5 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of May 31, 1977 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
18.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit opera-
tions. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank Group
has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer sector
and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institutions, in
a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components for
selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better capa-
city utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active in sippor-
ting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and railways.
Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban investments
have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
19.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, urban development and water
supply remains highly relevant. Projects designed to foster agricultural
production through the provision of essential inputs such as credit for
on-farm investments, command area development of existing irrigation schemes,
intensification and streamlining of extension systems, and seed production
form an important aspect of the Bank Group's program for the next several
years. Special emphasis will be given to projects benefiting small farmers.
Projects supporting water supply, sewerage, and urban development also form
an integral part of the Bank's lending strategy to India for the next several
years. Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments will
focus on agriculture-, export- and energy-related projects.
20.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. Thanks in large
part to the response of the aid community, India has successfully adjusted
to the changed world price situation. However, the basic need for readily



- 7 -
usable foreign exchange assistance, to augment domestic resources, assure
effective utilization of existing capacity, stimulate investment and accele-
rate economic growth, remains. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors, it
is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
21.       It is clear from the review of the Indian economy that as much as
possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided on con-
cessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to
India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the
amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small
in relation to India's needs for external support, and some Bank lending
to India, for which the country is creditworthy, is appropriate. As of
May 31, 1977, outstanding loans to India totaled US$973 million, of which
US$494 million remained to be disbursed, leaving a net amount outstanding
of US$479 million.
22.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 58%, 24% and 29%,
respectively, in 1975/76. On March 31, 1976, India's outstanding and disbursed
external public debt was US$13.1 billion, of which the Bank Group's 'share
was 25%. The Bank Group's share is expected to remain around this level in
the future. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the
form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly. In
1975/76, about 15% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group.
PART III - THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR 1/
23.       India's total demand for commercial primary energy has grown at an
average annual rate of 6% over the past ten years, but per capita consumption
remains very low; it was only 11% of the world average in 1975. India's energy
policy is predicated on the maximum economic use of domestic resources, mainly
coal. India's total coal reserves are estimated at 83,000 million metric tons,
which should be sufficient to cover the country's coal needs for the next 50
years. These reserves are being developed very rapidly; production is projected
to increase from the current level of about 100 million tons to 350 million
tons by 1990, with a total investment estimated at US$7 billion over 15 years.
1/   India's energy sector was reviewed by the World Bank in 1974 (Volume II
of Report No. 402-IN, dated May 7, 1974) and the oil and gas sector in
1976 (Report No. 1172-IN, dated May 11, 1976).



- 8 -
24.       The share of oil and natural gas in total commercial energy supply
grew from 21% in 1965 to 32% in 1973; it has remained constant since, as a
result of steps taken to limit consumption after the price increases of 1973-
74. India's petroleum consumption is low and limited for the most part to
sectors where other sources of energy cannot be substituted economically, with
the result that there is little scope for further reducing demand without
constraining economic growth. Thus hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) are of
critical importance to India's development efforts, accounting for about one-
third of the total commercial energy supply and for about 25% of the country's
import bill. The performance and prospects of the oil and gas sector are a
highlight of the Indian economy over the past two years. Major new offshore
strikes west of Bombay in the Arabian Sea have led to the delineation of fields
with proven and probable recoverable reserves estimated at about 250 million
tons of crude oil and about 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas. These
fields have more than doubled India's known reserves of crude oil and in-
creased the potential availability of natural gas by over 50%.
25.       The potential oil-bearing structures offshore Bombay were first
identified by seismic survey in 1966, but no exploration took place for
almost eight years, since offshore oil was not thought to be competitive
with imported supplies at pre-1973 prices. Since 1974, these finds have been
developed with striking rapidity. Commercial production from Bombay High,
a structure located about 160 km west of Bombay, began in May 1976, slightly
over two years from the sinking of the first exploratory well, and reached
a level of 40,000 barrels per day (2 million tons per year) by March 1977.
In 1976, two more major fields were discovered at Bassein, about 60 km east
of Bombay High and virtually on the direct pipeline route to Bombay; produc-
tion from the Bassein North field is expected to begin in December 1978, when
pipeline transportation facilities are available and the production platform
is completed.
26.       Responsibility for exploration and development in the Bombay High
area has been assigned by the Government to the Oil and Natural Gas Commis-
sion (ONGC), a statutory body which was established in 1959. Three other
offshore areas are being explored under production-sharing contracts in which
ONGC has a working interest: the Kutch Basin by Reading and Bates (U.S.), the
Bay of Bengal by Natomas (U.S.), and the Cauvery Basin by Asamera (Canada).
ONGC is also responsible for the major share of onshore exploration and deve-
lopment. Of the 8.4 million tons of oil produced onshore in 1976/77 (all in
the States of Assam and Gujarat), ONGC was responsible for about 63%; Oil
India Limited, a joint sector company, for 36%; and Assam Oil Company, a sub-
sidiary of the Burmah Oil Company, for about 1%.
27.       The development plans for Bombay High and Bassein North call for
increasing production from the current level of 2 million metric tons per
year (Mmt/y) to 4 Mmt/y by December 1977, and to 10 Mmt/y by December 1981.
Onshore, production from known oil fields is expected to increase from 8.4
million tons in 1976/77 to 9.4 million tons in 1980/81. Thus, total avail-
ability of domestic crude oil from known fields should increase from almost



- 9 -
9 Mmt/y at present to about 19.4 Mmt/y by the end of 1981. Current explora-
tion efforts, both offshore and onshore, may well result in the discovery of
new fields which could be brought into production in the 1980's. Although
another field at Bassein South is expected to contain large amounts of free
gas, the development of this field will await the completion of detailed
reservoir engineering studies and the construction of facilities to utilize
profitably this valuable resource.
28.       As a result of the slow growth of the economy and of Government
measures to limit consumption of refined products, which was growing at a
trend rate of 8-9% in the period before the oil crisis, consumption of petro-
leum products declined from 22.5 million tons in 1973 to 21.8 million tons in
1974. It grew by about 3% in 1975/76 and by 6-7% in 1976/77 to about 24 mil-
lion tons. The volume of petroleum imports declined from almost 18 million
tons of crude equivalent 1/ in 1973/74 to about 17.4 million tons in 1974/75,
16.2 million tons in 1975/76, and 16.9 million tons in 1976/77. The import
bill rose from US$719 million in 1973/74 (compared with US$265 million in
1972/73) to US$1,451 million in 1974/75 and an estimated US$1,627 million
in 1976/77.
29.       Even with a low rate of overall economic growth in India, consump-
tion of petroleum products will exceed the combined production of existing
onshore fields, Bombay High, and Bassein North, which is expected to peak at
about 26.5 million tons in 1985. If overall growth were to increase to, say,
6% per annum, the annual growth in consumption of petroleum products could
easily rise again to 9%; this would involve the consumption of about 50 mil-
lion tons of crude equivalent by 1985, with imports of some 23.5 million tons
(valued at US$2.3 billion at present oil prices), in spite of the projected
rapid increase in domestic production.
30.       As warranted by the highly profitable investment opportunities and
large unexplored prospective areas which currently exist, exploration and
development programs have been sharply stepped up, and the oil and gas sector
has taken an increasing proportion of Plan outlays. Total expenditures for
exploration, development and refining included in the Fifth Five-Year Plan
(1974/75 - 1978/79) are Rs 16.9 billion, or 4.3% of total Plan outlay. Of
this amount, ONGC was to get Rs 10.6 billion, or 62%, but this is very likely
to be exceeded -- perhaps by 50% or more. It is too early to determine the
extent to which the Bombay High project will affect the share of ONGC, or of
the oil and gas sector as a whole, in total Plan expenditures, since this
depends on evolving needs in the sector as well as other developments in the
economy. However, it is likely that the proportion of total Plan expenditure
allocated to ONGC alone will rise from under 2% in 1974/75 to over 5% in the
last two years of the Plan period.
31.       India's policies with respect to the development of the oil and gas
sector changed from an almost total reliance on foreign oil companies after
1/   Crude oil imported as such and refined products expressed in the
quantity of crude required to produce them.



- 10 -
Independence to a strong emphasis on self-reliance until the oil crisis of
1973-74. Recently, India has followed a policy which, while it continues to
stress national autonomy, has increased cooperation with foreign oil companies.
Negotiations with a view to acquiring the assets of foreign companies in India
have been successful, and settlements have been reached in all cases. The
Government now owns more than 85% of total refining capacity in India and has
a controlling interest in the remainder. Although ONGC has become India's
principal organization for exploration for and development of hydrocarbons,
its pragmatic attitude toward foreign expertise is indicated by the production-
sharing contracts mentioned in para 26 above and by its regular use of foreign
consultants (para 41).
32.       The proposed project would be the Bank Group's first lending opera-
tion in the Indian petroleum sector. However, the Bank Group has been in-
volved in the energy sector since 1950. The Bank Group has made 17 loans and
credits totalling US$749.1 million for power generation and transmission and
two loans totalling US$47.4 million for coal production. At the request of
ONGC, the Bank's initial involvement in this sector -- in the preparation of
terms of reference for studies of the utilization of natural gas -- has been
extended to an association with every critical step in the preparation of the
proposed project. ONGC's field for further expansion, particularly offshore,
is wide open, and, through the proposed project, the Bank will continue to
advise ONGC regarding its expansion program, including project evaluation
methods and the marshalling of the large financial resources required for
the future development of the sector.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project was appraised by a mission which visited
India in January/February 1977. The appraisal report (No. P-1569a-IN, dated
June 10, 1977) is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Negotiations were held in Washington in May 1977. The Borrower was represented
by Mr. B.B. Vohra of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mr. Vineet Nayyar of the
Ministry of Finance, and ONGC by Mr. N.B. Prasad, Chairman, and Mr. P.T.
Venugopal, Member (Finance).
Project Description
34.       The proposed project is the third phase of ONGC's development pro-
gram for the Bombay High offshore area (including Bassein North) and consists
of the construction of facilities required to produce up to 140,000 barrels
per3day (b/d) (7 Mmt/y) of crude oil and 2.2 million cubic meters per day
(Mm Id) of associated natural gas, and to process, transport, store and deliver
to users the oil and natural gas expected to be available from these fields at
full production (240-260,000 b/d). The principal components include: about 20
additional development wells, about 5 well platforms, three production plat-
forms equipped with processing and pumping facilities, two subsea pipelines
to shore, an onshore terminal including gas and oil processing and storage
facilities, supply lines to the users of the oil and gas, a supply base for



- 11 -
ONGC's offshore operations, a telecommunications system, and consulting
services. The project is expected to begin in the Fall of 1977 and to be
completed by May 1979. The pipelines and supply lines are scheduled for
completion by May 1978, before the start of the monsoon. This schedule
is tight but manageable.
35.       Bombay High crude is temporarily being transported to shore by
tanker, using a single-buoy mooring system. Although this system is capable
of transporting up to 80,000 barrels per day of oil, it has two major draw-
backs: the associated natural gas must be flared offshore, and the system
cannot operate during the extreme weather conditions which prevail during
the monsoon period (June - October), requiring shut-down of the entire field.
Moreover, production capability is expected to exceed the capacity of the
existing transportation system after December 1977.
36.       The crude oil produced by Bombay High and Bassein North will be
substituted for imported supplies to domestic refineries. Because of the
technical characteristics of the Bombay High crude, some modifications are
required at existing refineries. The two major refineries at Trombay, which
are the first concerned, have already completed most of the necessary adjust-
ments, and other refineries will complete them during the project implementa-
tion period. Any delay in refinery modification would not have adverse effects
on the project, as the crude oil could be easily exported at international
prices. The associated gas will be used as feedstock in the Trombay fertilizer
complex of the Fertilizer Corporation of India, where the necessary modifica-
tions are being undertaken. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will be bottled at
the Trombay refineries, where facilities exist for handling and storage, and
sold for domestic and commercial use. Studies concerning the possible utili-
zation of additional associated gas which may become available and free gas
at Bassein South are underway with the assistance of consultants (Stone and
Webster, U.S.).
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The project cost, including contingencies (US$112 million), is
estimated at US$571 million, of which US$417 million, or 73%, represents
foreign exchange costs. Taxes and duties account for about US$12 million
of the total.
38.       The proposed loan would provide 26% of the total project cost and
36% of the foreign exchange costs. In addition, the Government has indicated
its intention to borrow about US$50 million from commercial banks toward the
financing of the project and to utilize official bilateral aid to the extent
it is available for use in a manner consistent with optimal project implemen-
tation. GOI representatives estimate that US$50-100 million in bilateral aid
may be available for the project from countries including Japan, France,
Germany and the U.K. About US$100 million is expected to be available from
ONGC's internal resources and about US$70 million in loans from India's Oil
Industry Development Board over the next two years; The balance would be made
available by the Government from its own resources. The Government has under-
taken to cover promptly all of ONGC's financing requirements, including its
working capital requirements (Section 3.02 of Loan Agreement).



- 12 -
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       The goods and services financed under the proposed loan would be
procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. All contracts would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, except that, sub-
ject to prior approval of the Bank, items with limited sources of availability,
whose timely supply is critical to efficient project execution and which are
estimated to cost US$2 million or less, may be procured on the basis of quo-
tations from short lists of suppliers, provided that the aggregate value of
such contracts does not exceed US$7.5 million. The proceeds of the loan would
be disbursed against 100% of the c.i.f. cost of construction of the subsea
pipelines (US$70 million) fabrication and erection of two well platforms and
one processing platform at Bassein North and of one processing platform in the
northern part of the Bombay High field (US$65 million), and construction and
equipment of the gas fractionating plant (US$10 million). US$5 million would
be unallocated. The contracts against which the loan proceeds would be dis-
bursed were selected on the basis of their suitability for international compe-
titive bidding and their timing (i.e., items for which tenders had been issued
without prior Bank review were excluded). ONGC's normal procurement procedure
for foreign supplies requires worldwide bidding similar to the Bank's proce-
dures; it is expected that this procedure will be applied for imported equip-
ment and services not financed from the proceeds of the Bank loan.
Project Implementation
40.       ONGC is responsible for project implementation.   The Commission,
which was established by an Act of Parliament in 1959, consists of a Chair-
man and not less than two nor more than eight members appointed by the Gov-
ernment. At the present time, there are four full-time members (Exploration,
Production, Finance and Materials), and two part-time members (Secretary
(Economic Affairs), Ministry of Finance, and Secretary (Petroleum), Ministry
of Petroleum). As of January 1977, ONGC's total staff was 23,000, including
1,500 engineers and technicians. ONGC's administrative and financial func-
tions are centralized in the corporate headquarters at Dehra Dun; its opera-
tional staff is divided among three Regional offices and the Bombay High
Development Project (BHDP), whose headquarters are in Bombay. The staff of
BHDP, which was created in 1973/74, is now about 600 people, mostly engineers
and technicians.
41.       The BHDP staff are experienced and technically competent in off-
shore oil and gas development. In addition, consultants have been employed
for the design and engineering of most of the project facilities: Pipeline
Technologists (U.K.) for the pipelines and supply lines; Engineers India Ltd.,
in collaboration with Crest Engineering (U.S.), for the production/processing
platforms; Peter Fraenkel and Partners (U.K.) for the supply base; and Burmah
Oil Engineering (U.K.), in collaboration with the Post and Telegraph Department
of the Ministry of Communications and the Telecommunications Branch of the
Ministry of Defense, for the telecommunication system. Engineering consul-
tants for design and supervision of construction of the onshore processing/
storage terminal have been nominated. ONGC has agreed to take all action



- 13 -
necessary to acquire as and when needed the land and rights of way required
for construction of the project facilities (Section 2.10 of Project Agreement);
the necessary legal formalities are well underway, and ONGC can begin con-
struction prior to the completion of these formalities.
42.       Although ONGC has been remarkably successful in developing the
Bombay High field, ONGC management recognizes the need to improve BHDP's
capabilities to handle a project which is far larger and more complex than
what has been done so far. Accordingly, ONGC is transferring experienced
personnel from onshore operations to the project staff and is hiring addi-
tional qualified engineers. The Commission has also appointed a Project
Manager and sub-project managers, and is in the process of appointing consul-
tants to assist in the establishment of appropriate management procedures for
the implementation of the project. ONGC has agreed to establish a satisfactory
management information system for the Bombay High project by December 31, 1977
(Section 2.06 of Project Agreement); this would be one of the first tasks of
the project management consultants. ONGC has undertaken a program to meet
additional staff training needs, which the Bank has reviewed and found satis-
factory.   ONGC has also agreed to submit to the Bank an updated development
plan of the Bombay High and North Bassein fields by the end of each calendar
year starting in 1977 (Section 2.05 of Project Agreement).
43.       All necessary precautions will be taken during design and construc-
tion of the project to minimize the ecological hazards associated with the
production facilities, pipelines and the offshore and terminal facilities.
ONGC is procuring a vessel outfitted for offshore fire-fighting and oil spill
clean-up, and the Indian Coast Guard service will assist in any offshore oil
emergency. All manned platforms will be equipped for fire-fighting and with
emergency escape and survival systems, and the North Sea safety regulations
will be adopted during construction.
ONGC Finances
44.       ONGC's financing requirements which are not met from internal cash
generation are provided as follows: exploration expenditures through equity
contributions from the Government, and development expenditures through loans,
primarily from the Government (at 10-1/4% interest for 10 years including 4
years' grace) and the Oil Industry Development Board (at 4.5% interest for
15 years including 2 years' grace). An exception to this rule is Bombay High
development, for which 50% of the financing required is provided in the form
of equity. The Government sets prices for crude oil and natural gas at a
level which enables ONGC to cover its operating costs, including depreciation,
to service its debt and to finance a reasonable share of its development
program.
45.       ONGC's production of crude oil increased at an average rate of
12.5% per annum over the period 1973/74 - 1976/77; together with an increase
in the price it received for crude oil, this led to an increase in revenues
from Rs 816 million (US$90.6 million) to an estimated Rs 1,450 million (US$161
million) over the same period. ONGC's cash generation enabled it to finance



- 14 -
about 49% of its capital investment requirements, including those of Bombay
High, after meeting its debt service and its need for additional working
capital, in the four-year period.
46.       The prospects arising out of India's first major offshore dis-
covery open a new era for ONGC in which its capital expenditures and cash
flow requirements will increase considerably. On the basis of present prices
and conservative estimates of production from existing onshore and offshore
fields, ONGC's revenues are also expected to rise as can be seen in the table
below, from Rs 1,941 million (US$216 million) in 1977/78 to Rs 6,082 million
(US$675 million) in 1981/82. The annual rate of return after taxes on average
invested capital is projected to average about 12% after completion of the
project, and ONGC is expected to be able to finance about 57% of its capital
investment requirements from internal cash generation. Over the period 1977/78
- 1981/82, ONGC's debt/equity ratio is projected to be not more than 42/58.
Thus, ONGC's overall financial situation, including its liquidity and its debt
management, has been and is expected to remain sound.

47.       Consumer prices for petroleum products in India have been set,
with few exceptions, above international prices and fully reflect the scarcity
value of petroleum. The producer price set by the Government is the main
parameter in ensuring that ONGC's profitability and cash flow objectives are
met. Accordingly, ONGC has agreed that it will prepare and furnish each year
to the Government an economic and financial evaluation of the project and of
any subsequent major development, which will indicate the price levels required
for ONGC to earn a discounted cash flow (DCF) financial return of at least 15%
after taxes on the project and on any subsequent major development. The GOI
has agreed that it will review, on the basis of this report, the price of oil
and gas produced by ONGC with a view to determine the price levels needed to
enable ONGC, under conditions of efficient operation, to meet its operating
expenses and earn a return on its invested capital sufficient to cover its
debt service requirements, maintain adequate working capital and finance a
substantial portion of its proposed capital expansion. (Section 4.03 of
Project Agreement and Section 4.02 of Loan Agreement). ONGC will have its
accounts and financial statements audited by an independent auditor and will
submit these to the Bank. (Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement).



- 15 -
48.       The Government has established well-head prices to ONGC of US$5/
barrel of offshore crude oil, US$55/thousand cubic meters for natural gas,
and US$90/ton for liquid petroleum gas (LPG). The DCF financial rate of
return of the project, at these prices, is projected to be 19.8%. Thus,
the current price of US$5/barrel is adequate to cover production and explora-
tion costs and to generate a reasonable profit to ONGC after taxes.
Project Benefits and Risks
49.       Using the prices established by the Government for gas, which are
comparable to international prices, and the present international price of
US$13/barrel for crude oil, the proposed Bombay High Development Program
yields an economic rate of return of about 66%. This result is less sensitive to
variations in costs than to delays in implementation; thus, a 20% cost in-
crease would bring the return to 56%, while a one-year delay would bring it
to 50%, which is still quite satisfactory.
50.       The risks normally associated with hydrocarbon development projects
are compounded for offshore ventures by weather conditions. However, over
the years the industry has developed techniques and technologies which, if
they do not eliminate risks, reduce them to an acceptable level. The tech-
nical solutions selected by ONGC have been proved reliable, and ONGC's con-
sultants and contractors have considerable experience in the design and
construction of offshore and onshore facilities. ONGC's staff is qualified
and experienced in all the facets of oil and gas production, processing and
utilization and, therefore, the risk of errors in design and/or operation
is minimal. Weather conditions, however, are not predictable and may cause
delays despite the precautions taken to avoid major construction work off-
shore during the monsoon.
51.       There is also a risk that the fields will not live up to ONGC's
expectations. It is impossible to fully predict the behavior of a reservoir,
and fields have been known to "dry up" much sooner than expected. ONGC has
been careful and conservative in its approach to the evaluation of the fields
and has used experienced consultants to assess both the reserves and the
production mechanisms. All estimates are consistent and show that the fields
should eventually produce more than was anticipated originally. Continuous
monitoring by ONGC, assisted by reservoir engineering consultants, of the
behavior of the reservoirs will provide sufficiently advanced warning of any
problems for ONGC to take remedial actions. As part of the appraisal, the
Bank engaged an independent firm of reservoir engineering consultants (De
Golyer and MacNaughton), whose opinion fully confirms ONGC's estimates of
reserves and proposed development program.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are
below. The level of disbursements was US$551 million in FY76 or 62%
of Bank Group commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline
of US$1,524 million as of March 31, 1977, corresponds roughly to com-
mitments over the preceding two-year period and reflects the leadtime
which would be expected given the mix of fast and slow-disbursing projects
in the India program.
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Effective
Date: August 16. 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097   Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India ProJect; US$100 million loan of April 2, 1975;
Effective Date: July 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. Loan 902-IN is fully committed
and commitments are progressing satisfactorily for Loan 1097-IN. Disburse-
ments under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule.
Ln. No. 614    Tarai Seeds Project; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Effective Date: September 12, 1969; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the production, processing and marketing of certified seeds of high yielding
varieties. The corporation is working effectively and has developed an ex-
cellent reputation for quality seed. Expansion of three processing plants
is well under way. Delivery of some equipment in damaged condition, and
retendering, because of poor response for some others, has delayed delivery
schedules necessitating an extension of the Closing Date by one year to
December 31, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken

standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of

Project; US$75.0 million credit of April 28, 1975;
Effective Date: August 5, 1975; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment only, all the above agricultural credit projects are similar in
structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term credit to farm-
ers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as tractors,
minor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of the minor irrigation
components are on schedule. Tractor procurement was delayed following
changes in both the supply and demand situations after the projects were
originally appraised, which prompted GOI to request that indigenous as well
as imported models should be eligible for IDA financing under these credits.
The Executive Directors approved this request in December 1973 and those
credits which have tractor components have been amended accordingly. Tractor
procurement is proceeding satisfactorily. Credit 540 is a continuation

The Food Corporation of India is making satisfactory progress
in the execution of this project. Piling and foundation work is nearly com-
pleted. Silo construction has begun and staff training is in progress.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apple Processing and Marketing Project;
US$13 million credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date:
September 26, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This project was designed to promote the development of apple
processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh, and comprises grading and
packing centers, cold storages, a juice processing plant, road improvements
and cableways. The project encountered initial delays due to managerial
and technical problems, however, remedial measures have been taken to over-
come these difficulties. A recent review mission found a satisfactory
improvement in the prospects for successful project implementation.
Cr. No. 403    Telecommunications V Project; US$80.0 million credit of
June 25, 1973; Effective Date: July 30, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
Material supply problems which delayed the start of this project
have been resolved and physical achievements were at record levels during
fiscal year 1976. However, to cover the delivery and installation of im-
ported transmission and switching equipment, the closing date was extended
by one year to December 31, 1977.

Cr. No. 598    Fertilizer Industry Project; US$105.0 million credit
of December 31. 1975; Effective Date: March 1. 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is being commisssioned, about 31
months behind the appraisal estimate. Progress on the Trombay IV project has
been good although project completion may be delayed by about four months
because of longer than expected delivery times for critical equipment. Under
the Sindri project plant construction and erection is proceeding generally
according to schedule except for a one-month delay due to anticipated delays
in receipt of some materials. Commencement of commercial production is ex-
pected by March 1978. The anticipated cost to complete the project is pre-
sently running within budget. The IFFCO project was delayed by about a year
as a result of a change in feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha and delays in
completion of engineering contracts. The project is now progressing satis-
factorily based on naphtha as feedstock. Site work has begun, process- and
time-critical equipment is being ordered, and engineering work is well under
way. Credit 598-IN is designed to increase the utilization of existing
fertilizer production capacity. The project has encountered delays in sub-
project preparation and investment approvals by the Government. Further,
some of the sub-projects identified earlier may not materialize because of
reconsideration by the Central and State governments. The Central Govern-
ment has submitted a list of sub-projects to replace the ones that are
likely to be dropped. Because of the above, the project is likely to be
delayed by 6-12 months.

Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 mil-
lion credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: September 7, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under
the Bihar project has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in
Bihar was delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's acqui-
sition of land for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satis-
factorily resolved. Construction of markets is well advanced and a number
have opened for business. Progress under the Karnataka project is much less
satisfactory, however, largely due to deficiencies in market planning, design
and construction. These problems and remedial actions have been brought to
the attention of the State and Central Government. The project is being mon-
itored closely to try and bring about the necessary improvements in implemen-
tation.
Cr. No. 312    Population Prolect; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972;
Effective Date: May 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This credit is designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings, equip-
ment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected districts
in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers, which will
design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning program,
are now functioning.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities Project; US$12.0 million credit of
November 10, 1972; Effective Date: June 8, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The project involves the development of the agricultural uni-
versities in Assam and Bihar. Initial lag in implementation on account
of late appointments of project staff has been overcome. Campus plans
have been approved, and construction has started in Assam and is scheduled
to start in Bihar by mid 1977. Disbursement which has been slow because
of initial delays should accelerate now that construction and equipment
procurement are under way.
Cr. No. 356    Industrial Development Bank of India Project; US$25.0 million

US$40.0 million loan of June 10, 1976; Effective Date:
August 10. 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The first IDBI Project (Cr. 356) had a slow start mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 12
However, the credit is now fully committed. In order to continue Bank
Group's involvement in assisting small and medium scale industries, the
second operation (Ln. 1260) was approved on June 10, 1976, and more than
10% of the loan amount had been authorized by mid-May 1977.
Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supplv and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date: March 13. 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
A substantial cost overrun on the project from US$158 million
equivalent to about US$375 million equivalent has been caused by inflation
and price increases resulting from delays in appointment of engineering con-
sultants and redesign of certain project components. The project has been
redefined and rephased to fit the financing available from the Credit, local
loans and bonds, and internal cash generation of the project entity. The
revised cost estimates for the implementation period 1975/76 to 1979/80
amount to US$266 million equivalent excluding interest during construction.
All major contracts for civil works, equipment and materials have been
awarded. This is expected to considerably speed up disbursements which
has been slow. Financial performance of the project entity during 1975/76
was satisfactory, and major rate increases from April 1, 1976 should ensure
continuing financial viability of the project entity.
Cr. No. 616    Eleventh Industrial Imports Project; US$200.0 million credit
of February 24, 1976; Effective Date: April 1, 1976; Closing

This credit was signed on February 24, 1976, and became effective
on April 1, 1976.
Cr. No. 427    Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit
of September 12, 1973; Effective Date: January 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Following considerable increases in project costs, GOI and IDA
finalized a project redefinition in April 1976, to accommodate the project
to funding available. It is now expected to be substantially completed by
March 1979. Agreements have been reached on consultants services and
technical assistance, as provided for under the project.

Cr. No. 522    Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Project; US$16.4 million
credit of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: July 23. 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
These three credits totalling US$74.1 million support dairy devel-
opment projects organized along the lines of the successful AMUL dairy coop-
erative scheme in Gujarat State. The Karnataka Project which got off to a
slow start has begun to show Improvement under new management appointed
recently. Farmer response has been good and about 250 dairy cooperatives
with small farmer participation are functioning effectively. Two Dairy
Unions have been established. Close supervision is being maintained. In
Madhya Pradesh good progress has been made. About 110 new dairy cooperatives
societies have been established. Detailed design studies for plant construc-
tion are complete. Technical services investments are being made. Contracts
have been placed for livestock imports. The Rajasthan project is also doing
well. Four milk unions have been formed and excellent progress has been made
in organizing the servicing of nearly 350 dairy cooperatives at the village
level. Plant-designs are ready, and procurement is to start soon. KDDC
decision to procure plant equipment jointly with RDDC and MPDDC on the same
tender should lead to a recovery of considerable time lost earlier.
Cr. No. 532    Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7,
1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing Date:

of June 10, 1976: Effective Date: September 7,1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
These projects, based on existing large irrigation systems, are
designed to improve the efficiency of water utilization and, where possible,
to use water savings for bringing additional areas under irrigation. Canal
lining and other irrigation infrastructures, drainage, and land shaping are

prominent components of these projects. In addition, provisions have been
made to increase agricultural production and marketing by reforming and
upgrading agricultural extension services and by providing processing and
storage facilities and village access roads. Progress of these projects
is generally satisfactory and particularly successful vith respect to
agricultural extension.
Cr. No. 541    West Bengal Agricultural Development Pro1ect: US$34 million
credit of April 28. 1975; Effective Date: August 28. 1975;
Closing Date: March 31. 1980
The project became effective on July 31, 1975. Successful reor-
ganization of agricultural extension services has been a major achievement,
but preparations for lending operations have been slow mainly due to poor
coordination of project agencies. IDA and the government of West Bengal
have agreed on measures to improve coordination and on a timetable covering
a range of project activities. Progress with preliminaries for procurement
of equipment, markets construction and riverlift completions are satis-
factory.
Cr. No. 526    Drought Prone Areas Project; US$35.0 million credit of
January 24. 1975; Effective Date: June 9. 1975; Closing
Date: June 30. 1980
Overall progress is satisfactory. Expenditure to date is less
than expected -- about 22Z of project cost estimates -- but is reasonable
because inflation has been much less than expected. The most successful
component of this multi-componented project is dairying, which has a sig-
nificant impact on rural incomes. Other components are, in general, meeting
appraisal targets in terms of physical achievements, although with some
time lag. There are, however, several technical problems which need to be
overcome. DPAP is largely innovative program and the emergence of such
problems was expected. The identification of these problems represents a
major first step to their resolution and subsequently to establishing pro-
grams which can be replicated throughout India's 72 drought prone districts.
Cr. No. 572    Rural Electrification Project; US$57.0 million credit of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: October 23. 1975: Closing
Date: December 31. 1979
Eleven states have now fulfilled the conditions of eligibility for
on-lending under this project [compared with six at the time of appraisal]
The project got off to a slow start, due principally to the need to adapt
specifications and tender documents to international competitive bidding
procedures, but these problems have been overcome. As of September 1976,
orders had been placed for 60 approved rural electrification schemes, and
tenders had been invited or were in the course of preparation for others.

Cr. No. 582    Railways XIII Project: US$110.0 million credit of August 26,
1975; Effective Date: October 10, 1975: Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The project is intended to cover most of the foreign exchange
requirements of Indian Railway's (IR) investment program from April 1, 1975,
through March 31, 1977. Since the approval of the project, increased pro-
duction in steel products in India and further developments in IR's indigen-
ization program have resulted in a less than anticipated foreign exchange
requirement. It is expected, therefore, that of a total Credit of US$110
million, some US$30-40 million may be undisbursed at the end of the current
project period. During the year 1975/76, IR carried 223 million tons of
freight traffic, 6% more than forecasted. The project is being implemented
satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 585    Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$40.0
million credit of September 25, 1975; Effective Date:
February 6. 1976: Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project had a slow start due to delays in preparation of techni-
cal reports for regional and local water authorities. The technical reports
for about a third of the project have now been finalized and construction
works started in October 1976, about one year behind schedule. All consul-
tants for engineering, organization, management and accounting services for
the Jal Nigam (Water Supply Development Corporation) and the Jal Sansthans
(water authorities) have been engaged. Significant institutional develop-
ment can be expected only after the consultants submit their final recommenda-
tions. The project is expected to be completed by March 1980, approximately
9 months behind schedule.
Cr. No. 609    Madhya Pradesh Forestry Technical Assistance Project;
US$4.0 million credit of February 26. 1976; Effective
Date: May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project will identify a sound resource base for pulp and paper
manufacture and related industries, develop suitable logging systems, and
undertake a feasibility study to determine optimal use of the existing wood
resources in the Bastar District of southern Madhya Pradesh. It also includes
a study of ways to integrate the area's tribal population with future develop-
ment. After initial delays due to difficulties in employing key personnel,
project implementation is now satisfactory. For the feasibility study, proj-
ect authorities have prepared a short list of three foreign consulting firms,
who are now being asked to prepare detailed proposals. On the basis of these
proposals, the final selection will be made shortly.
Cr. No. 610    Integrated Cotton Development Project; US$18.0 million

Good progress has been made since negotiations. The National
Seeds Corporation (NSC) has withdrawn from seeds production as planned, hav-
ing handed over to State Seeds Corporation (SSC). Detailed production pro-
grams, by variety and responsible institution, have been prepared for breeder,
foundation and certified generations. GOI and State Governments have made
