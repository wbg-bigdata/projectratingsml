                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Five of the six Group I sub-projects have been completed and the remaining one is expected to be completed shortly. One of the five sub-projects under Group II has been completed
                         ahead of the contractual end date. However some of the sub-projects have encountered challenges, thus their implementation has been slow. The remaining work for the sub-
                         projects whose completion will slip after the closing date of the project that is December 31, 2012, will be financed by TEDAS (Turkish Electricity Distribution Company). Due to very
                         limited time till loan closing date, and the uncertainties with regard to the on-going privatization process of the electricity distribution companies, the implementation activities in Group
                         III and Group IV sub-projects have not commenced and the loan associated with these sub-projects have been cancelled.

                         Project indicators show that sub-projects that have been implemented (Group I and Group II sub-projects) have a positive impact on the quality and the reliability of electricity supply
                         in their areas to achieve the project development objective. In all of the distribution regions (except for Uludag distribution region where the new load served and collection ratio are
                         slightly below the targets), the result indicators have surpassed the targets in terms of the new load served, reduction in interruptions and the collection ratios.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project will be closed at the scheduled date that is December 31, 2012.

                         The project is being restructured to recognize a cancellation in the amount of Euro 113 million from the undisbursed amount of the Loan, allocated to disbursement Category 1,
                         “Goods (including supply and installation)? for the implementation of Group 3 and 4 sub-projects; and to acknowledge a) the removal, after appraisal, of one sub-project due to the
                         transfer of the relevant regional distribution company (Menderes) to the private sector and the deletion of the three results indicators associated with this sub-project; b) the
                         introduction of a disbursements grace period of four months after the loan closing till April 30, 2013; and c) the need to continue following up on an issue of unanticipated land
                         acquisition that took place, specifically to ensure that no remedial action is required to achieve compliance with the World Bank principles regarding involuntary land acquisition.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
