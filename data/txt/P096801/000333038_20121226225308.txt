                               RESTRUCTING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

1. This Restructuring Paper for Turkey’s Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation Project
(P096801; Loan 4858-TU) recognizes a cancellation in the amount of Euro 113 million
from the undisbursed amount of the Loan, allocated to disbursement Category 1, “Goods
(including supply and installation)? for the implementation of Group 3 and 4 sub-
projects. The cancellation was made at the request of TEDAŞ (the Borrower) through a
letter dated July 27, 2012 and in accordance with its right under the applicable General
Conditions. The cancellation became effective as of the same date, on July 27, 2012.

2. This Restructuring Paper also acknowledges the removal of one sub-project due to the
transfer of the relevant regional distribution company (Menderes) to the private sector;
and the introduction of a disbursement grace period of four months after the loan closing
date, until April 30, 2013.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3. The Project was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on
April 19, 2007, and is scheduled to close on December 31, 2012. The Project’s
Development Objective is to help improve the reliability of power supply to consumers in
Turkey by supporting the implementation of the electricity distribution network
rehabilitation and expansion program.

4. The Project comprises four groups of sub-projects covering rehabilitation and
distribution network expansion works in different cities in Turkey. Groups 1 and 2 sub-
projects are under implementation. Due to the approaching loan closing date, persistent
delays in the implementation of Group 1 and Group 2 sub-projects, and uncertainties over
the on-going privatization process of regional distribution companies, the Borrower
indicated that Group 3 and Group 4 sub-projects would not be completed within the
Project’s time span. Procurement of Group 3 sub-projects had been initiated,
subsequently cancelled; Group 4 sub-projects’ procurement process has not been started.
As a result, the Borrower requested the Bank to cancel Euro 113 million, corresponding
to the entire amount allocated to Group 3 and Group 4 sub-projects.

C. PROPOSED CHANGE: CANCELLATION

5. In accordance with Paragraph 2 of BP 13.50, in a letter dated September 27, 2012, the
Bank acknowledged the Borrower’s request and cancelled Euro 113 million, effective on
July 27, 2012. Accordingly, loan category and component allocations have been revised
(please see Annex I). In the same acknowledgement, the Bank highlighted that the
procurement procedures followed by the Borrower with respect to Group 3 sub-projects

                                           4
were not in accordance with the Loan Agreement and the World Bank Procurement
Guidelines.

6. As Group 3 and Group 4 sub-projects are identified in the procurement plan but not in
the Loan Agreement, no amendment is required to the Loan Agreement.

D. OTHER ISSUES

7. A Group 2 sub-project that was planned to take place in the Menderes regional
distribution company was removed from the Project Appraisal Document dated March
26, 2007 due to the transfer of the regional distribution company Menderes to the private
sector just after the appraisal stage.

8. This restructuring would introduce a disbursement grace period of four months. In
accordance with the current practice of the Bank, further disbursements from the Loan
will be made for withdrawal applications received at the Bank's Zagreb Office by close of
business on April 30, 2013 in respect of eligible expenditures made before the Closing
Date (i.e., payments made or payments due for goods, works and services that have been
provided prior to the Closing Date).
