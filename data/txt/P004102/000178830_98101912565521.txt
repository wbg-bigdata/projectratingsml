I.   INTRODUCTIOY
1.01       The Government of the Republic of Korea has requested Bank
assistance to finance a project that would rromote and facilitate techno-
logical development of the country's industrial sector. The project consists
of: (i) assisting the institutional development of the Korea Technology
Development Corporation (KTDC), which was established in April 1981 to promote
and finance private industry's projects to upgrade technological capability,
broadly referred to as research, development and engineering (RD&E) projects:
and (ii) providing a line of credit to KTDC for its financing operations.
1.02       KTDC was set up with the strong support and participation of private
industry: 60% of its authorized share capital of Won 15 billion (US$21
million equivalent) comes from private industry, and 40% from the Government.
KTDC's legal framework provides it with the autonomy, flexibility and dynamism
of a private organization, which are most critical to its success. KTDC's
total financing requirement over 1981-84 is estimated at about Won 66 billion
(US$92 million equivalent) on a commitment basis, of which about Won 36
billion equivalent (US$50 million) would be in foreign exchange. The proposed
Bank loan of US$50 million equivalent would finance 100% of this foreign
exchange requirement; the balance of the financing requirement would be
met from KTDC's share capital of Won 15 billion (US$21 million equivalent),
Government loans of Won 6 billion (US$8.5 million equivalent) and Government
guaranteed bonds of Won 9 billion (US$12.5 million equivalent).
1.03       Since the mid-1960s, the Korean economy has progressed rapidly
based on the Government's export-led industralization strategy. During
the last fifteen years, real GNP grew by over 9% p.a., and exports by about
27% p.a. in volume. This outstanding performance has been spearheaded by a
robust manufacturing sector. Within this sector, light industry, includ-
ing textiles, clothing, footwear and plywood, has played a crucial role in
providing initial growth momentum through rapid export expansion of labor-
intensive products. Since the early 1970s, however, Korea's comparative
advantage has gradually shifted towards skill and technology-intensive
industries, due mainly to the rising domestiz real wage rate and increasing
competition from newly industrializing low wage countries. During 1977-79,
Korea spent about 80% of total manufacturing investment in heavy industry
whose output at the time represented only about 50% of total manufacturing.
In hindsight, investment in heavy industry might have exceeded, in some instances,
the levels dictated by market size, financing, and particularly technological
and managerial capability.
1.04       Korea has made important efforts in building up a technological
base to support its industrial reorientation. As a percentage of GNP, total
R&D spending doubled in the last decade, fromn 0.3% in 1970, to 0.6% in 1979,
which was among the highest in developing countries. During the same period,
industrial R&D spending increased rapidly, al: an annual rate of over 20% p.a.
Despite this impressive growth, the R&D sector in Korea is still faced with a
number of important weaknesses. First, R&D ,pending by industry accounted
for only 34% of the country's total in 1979 with the balance by public sector
research institutes; by contrast, in highly §.ndustrialized countries, the



-2-
industrial sector accounts for 60-70% of total R&D spending. Second, though
some 15 public research institutes have been established with a view to meet
industry's growing technological needs, their link with industry is tenuous.
Third, R&D manpower resources remain inadequate, dispersed over too many
institutes, and have insufficient funds to carry out RD&E work properly,
particularly at the development and engineering phases. Fourth, industry's
technological capability upgrading efforts are still considerably under-
financed, due to the absence of suitable financing instruments in the existing
capital market for such software-intensive and/or risky ventures.
1.05       The Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-86) continues to
place top priority in technology and manpower development to maintain a
high rate of economic growth, through the development and expansion of skill and
technology-intensive industries. By 1986, the Government plans to raise
total R&D expenditures to 2.0% of GNP; and by 1991, to 2.5%, 60% of which will
be for industry. Policies have been introduced to make industry, rather than the
Government, responsible for technology transfer and development, through fiscal
and financial incentives for in-house RD&E work, and liberalization of tech-
nology imports. Measures have also been taken to rationalize and improve the
efficiency of public research institutes. More funds will be allocated to
education investments to ensure an adequate supply of technical manpower
resources. Further, new financing mechanisms are being introduced - through
KTDC - to promote and finance industrial RD&E work as well as acquisition of
advanced foreign technologies.
1.06       The proposed project, through KTDC, will attempt to fill the
gap in the capital market (para. 1.04) to promote and support industrial
technology development in Korea. KTDC will complement the activities of
other industrial support organizations, especially financial institutions
and public research institutes. It will not compete with or duplicate their
functions. It will complement the work of existing financial institutions
by (i) focusing its financing on RD&E and other technological capability
upgrading activities where existing financial institutions have little
presence; and (ii) adopting a range of flexible financing instruments to meet
the peculiar needs of risky and/or software-intensive industrial technological
development activities, which are not available from existing financial
institutions. With respect to RD&E work, KTDC will not itself perform any
such activities, but will finance industrial RD&E projects, to be either
carried out by industrial firms themselves, or contracted out to public
research institutes of their choice. In so doing, KTDC will serve to correct
the imbalance in industry's R&D expenditure and to promote a closer link
between public research institutes and industry (para. 1.04).
1.07       The Bank has played an important role in the conceptualization
and realization of KTDC. In August 1979, the Bank acted as the Executing
Agency for a UNDP-financed project, carried out by the Center for Policy
Alternatives of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT/CPA) with the
Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) as local counterpart, to
assess the technological needs of key industrial subsectors and identify the
gaps that must be filled to foster the technological development of Korean



-3-
industry. Following a review of the findings of MIT/CPA/KIST, a Bank prepara-
tion mission, consisting of Messrs. M. Iskandar, N. Tin and S. Thomas, visited
Korea in May 1980, to discuss and reach consensus with the Government and
industry on the most effective type of institational arrangement, which was to
become KTDC. Subsequent Bank preparation missions visited Korea in October
1980 and March 1981 to further assist the Government, through the Ministry of
Science and Technology (MOST), and industry, led by the Association of Indus-
trial Research Institutes (AIRI) and the Federation of Korean Industries
(FKI), in defining KTDC's legal framework, articles of incorporation and
by-laws, financial structure, organization and management, and operating
policies and procedures, necessary for the establishment of KTDC. The project
was appraised in July 1981 by Messrs. N. Tin and Y.P. Lee and Miss V. Bates
(Industrial Projects Department), and Mr. I. Yaakov (consultant).
1.08       The Bank has assisted the Government's efforts to develop the
country's technological capability. The Electronics Technology Project,l/
approved in March 1979, provided the Korea Institute of Electronics Technology
(KIET) with sophisticated facilities to enable it to undertake production-
oriented development work, and financed an RD&E program that is directly linked
to the needs of the electronics industry. The Sector Program on Higher
Technical Education,2/ approved in January 1980, aimed at improving the
quality of higher technical education and increasing the supply of qualified
engineers, technicians and managers. Bank involvement in the proposed project,
together with Bank Group assistance currently under consideration for the Korea
Technology Advancement Corporation (KTAC) and the Korea Production Technology
Corporation (KOPTEC), would be a continuation of its efforts in promoting and
enhancing technological development of Korean industry. Through its involvement
in the proposed project, the Bank is also exyected to increase its knowledge
of the field and thus become better equipped to assist other countries that
may embark on a similar effort.
II.   INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING (RD&E) IN KOREA
A.     The Economic Setting:  Growth and StrtLetural Change
2.01       During the last two decades, Korea achieved remarkable economic
growth. At the beginning of the 1960s, Korea was one of the poorest developing
countries with heavy dependence on agriculture. By the late 1970s, it had
become a middle-income, semi-industrialized country. During this period, GNP
grew by 9% p.a., amounting to Won 27,000 billion (US$60 billion equivalent) in

1979, with per capita income tripled in real terms to US$1,600 (at 1979
prices), and employment doubled to 13.7 million employees in the same year.
As Korea lacks raw material inputs, this rapid expansion of the economy was
sustained by an outstanding export performance. Specifically, exports grew by
27% p.a. in real terms, from US$100 million, or 4% of GNP, in 1960 to over
US$13 billion, or 34% of GNP, in 1978.
2.02       This rapid growth brought about important changes in the structure
of the economy in terms of value added, employment and exports. As indicated
in the table below, the share of manufacturing value added doubled in less
than two decades, from 14% of GNP in 1963, to 27% of GNP in 1979. During
1963-79, the share of manufacturing employment increased from 8% to 23% of
total employment, and accounted for over 40%, or nearly 2.5 million jobs, of
the total additional employment created during this period. The manufacturing
sector-s export performance was even more remarkable; its share of total
commodity exports increased from 20% in 1961, to 93% in 1979. At the same
time, agriculture lost its dominance. During 1963-79, its share fell from 45%
to 22% of GNP; from 64% to 37% of total employment; and from 80% to 7% of
commodity exports.

2.03       Within the manufacturing sector, heavy industry expanded noticeably,
as its share of manufacturing value added increased from 30% in 1963, to 55% in
1979, as shown below:

2.04       Export Sector.  As a result of its outstanding export perfor-
mance (para. 2.01), Korea's share of the world market grew steadily and, in
1979, Korea accounted for 13% of aggregate manufactured exports from all
developing countries. Although this represented only 1% of the total volume
of world trade, Korea had managed to establish a dominant position in certain
product markets by concentrating its export efforts initially on the US and
Japanese markets, and on a limited number of labor-intensive products,
where it had the highest comparative advantage. For example, in 1973, Korea
accounted for 20-50% of Japanese imports of certain textile products, and its
share of US imports reached as much as 40% for plywood. Korea's heavy depen-
dence on US and Japanese markets was gradually reduced from 75% of total
exports in 1970, to about 50% in 1979, as it improved its ability to penetrate
other foreign markets.
2.05       Korea also made important progress in broadening its export product
base. Since 1970, the emphasis on export of light industry products has been
reduced considerably; heavy industry's share of total manufactured exports
increased from 22% in 1971, to 44% in 1979. The increase in the exports of
iron and steel products was most noticeable during the period, with their
share expanded from less than 2% of total manufactured exports in 1971, to 12%
in 1979.
2.06       The Government's development strategy during the Fifth Five-Year
Plan (1982-86) will continue to be outward looking but will involve further
opening up of the economy. Exports will continue to be a major engine of
growth, and are planned to increase at 11% p.a. in volume. To enhance the
competitiveness of Korean industry, emphasis will be placed on quality improve-
ment and preduct innovation. To this end, the Government will expose domestic
producers to foreign competition through import liberalization, encourage the
inflow of foreign investment and technologies, and upgrade both the techno-
logical capability of Korean industry and technical manpower.
2.07       Further, to encourage its industries to develop in line with the
shifting comparative advantages in the world market, the Government intends
to reduce excessive intervention in the private sector and to rely increas-
ingly on market mechanisms in the execution of investment and energy policies.
Also, to eliminate the potential bottlenecks to industrial growth in
Korea from the energy sector, the Government will attempt both to induce
investments in energy efficient industries, and to encourage investments for
energy conservation. Investment strategies planned for the manufacturing
sector are also expected to be changed. For light manufacturing industries,



-6-
a greater weight will be attached to investments in quality improvement
and the replacement of obsolete facilities. For heavy machinery industries,
the emphasis will be laid on complementary investments, and/or investments for
parts and components, to enhance the operating ratios of currently underutilized
plants and to improve the competitiveness of these industries.
2.08       Despite this change in the method of the Government's economic
management, the thrust of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-86) will be the
continuous transformation of Korea's industrial structure towards a skill
and technology-intensive one. The single most important factor to the success
of this transformation, and one of the keys to Korea's continuous pros-
perity during the next decade, will be how effectively it builds up its
technological capability.
B.     Korea's Pattern of R&D Spending
2.09       Here, the pattern of R&D spending in Korea is examined to assess
the priority of R&D activities within the economy, as well as within R&D
establishments; and to evaluate whether the structure of existing R&D establish-
ments is appropriate to Korea's stage of industrialization.
2.10       Total R&D spending increased during the last decade, from Won
10.5 billion in 1970, to Won 174.0 billion in 1979, as shown below:

As percent of GNP, total R&D spending outpaced GNP growth, from 0.3% of GNP in
1970, to 0.6% in 1979. Although this was among the highest in developing
countries, it was still considerably smaller than the R&D spending of 2-3% of
GNP in industrialized countries. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-86),
the Government plans to further increase investments in R&D to 2.0% of GNP in
1986, as shown in Annex 2-1.
2.11       The sharp increase in R&D spending, from about 0.4% of GNP in the
years prior to 1977, to 0.6% of GNP thereafter, is connected with the establish-
ment of some 15 new public research institutes (commonly referred to as "non-



-7-
profit research institutes" as shown in Anne:: 2-2) by the Government, and
several private research institutes by major industrial groups. Thus, a large
part of R&D spending during 1977-79 was for bricks and mortar. Further, it
should be noted that the definition of R&D in developing countries, including
Korea, often incorporates activities of rout:ine or minor nature, such as
product testing, quality control, market research, etc., which are not con-
sidered as proper R&D in industrialized count:ries. Consequently, Korea's R&D
spending, if measured as in industrialized countries, would be somewhat lower
than the 0.6% of GNP reported in 1979.
2.12       Despite the aforementioned impressive growth in the R&D sector,
Korea's R&D spending was not sufficiently focused on serving the growing
technological needs of industry. Though industry has made important progress,
its share of total R&D spending reached only 34% in 1979; the balance of 66%
was accounted for by the public sector research institute system (Government
institutes, public institutes and universities). This contrasts sharply to the
structure of the R&D sector in industrialize(d countries, where the increasing
complexity and cost of development work have led to industry-s dominance in
total R&D performance, to over 60%, as shown below:

2.13       The dominance of the public sector research institute system,
per se, is not necessarily undesirable. In Fact, in developing countries,
the public sector is often the only one with the resources needed to establish
and maintain the technological infrastructure, such as R&D institutes, required
to cater to the country's technological needs. The issue is whether public
sector institutes serve industry effectively. In Korea, the public sector
research institute system does not seem to have the inclination and capability
to supply industry with rapidly growing and increasingly complex industrial



technologies. As such, basic and applied research represented 53% of total
R&D spending in 1979, with development work accounting for only 47%. By
contrast, Japan and USA spent 40% on basic and applied research and about 60%
of the total R&D on development work, as shown below:

C.     Technological Manpower Resources
2.14       Technological manpower (scientists and engineers) is the most
critical element in RD&E. Both the allocation of scientists and engineers to
the R&D sector, and their deployment within the sector, determine the effective-
ness of a country's R&D effort. In recent years, Korea has dramatically
increased the technological manpower available for R&D, from 11,600 researchers
in 1976, to 15,700 in 1979, already exceeding the Fourth Five-Year Plan's
projection of 14,000 for 1981. But the manpower resources remain inadequate,
dispersed over too many research institutes (para. 2.11), and have little
resources to carry out proper R&D (para. 2.16), particularly at the development
and engineering phases, which require considerable knowledge of both theo-
retical principles and practical know-how in engineering and manufacturing.
Further, in terms of the number of scientists and engineers employed in R&D
per 1,000 people, Korea's R&D manpower increased from 0.3 in 1976, to 0.4 in
1979, but is still far below the comparable figures of 2-3 in industrialized
countries. The Government's recent decision to expand and upgrade science and
engineering programs in universities aims to increase the supply of tech-
nological manpower, as well as to improve the quality, to meet Korea's needs
during the next decade.

2.15       The pattern of deployment of technological manpower within the R&D
sector did not change during 1977-79, as illustrated in the following table:

Industry's share of total scientists and engineers in R&D remained less than
30% of the total; by contrast, in industrialized countries, industry employs
the largest number of scientists and engineers, almost 70% in the case of the
lJnited States.
2.16       The weakness of the R&D sector in Korea is also revealed by examining
the average annual R&D spending per researcher.  During 1976-79, industry's
average R&D spending per researcher increased from about US$10,000 equivalent
in 1976, to about US$16,000 equivalent in 1979, in constant 1976 prices, but
this amount was still too small, even accounl:ing for both the relatively low
salary cost and the less advanced stage of industry in Korea, to undertake
proper RD&E work.  It has been estimated thal: spending levels between US$20,000
and US$30,000, in constant 1976 prices, per ^.esearch scientist and engineer
would not be unreasonable for Korea.1/
I).    Industry's Technology Expenditures
2.17       Korea's initial industrialization was primarily directed and
controlled by nationals and was based on foreign technologies that were mature
and proven elsewhere. 2/  Those technologies were easily transferable with
minimal in-house RD&E efforts by local recipients and were acquired from
abroad primarily through means other than direct foreign investments.   The
predominant mode of technology transfer was l:hrough the import of capital

equipment and turnkey plant construction. Consequently, expenditures on
foreign technical assistance, as well as engineering services, constituted
a significant part of industry's technology expenditures.
2.18       Korean industry gradually acquired considerable technological
and manufacturing know-how, through decades of manufacturing experience,
reverse engineering, participation in turnkey plant construction, and numerous
contacts with foreign capital equipment suppliers. Industry's steady accumula-
tion of technological competence enabled companies not only to disassemble the
packaged foreign technologies, but also to select the most appropriate techno-
logies through licensing agreements. At the same time, as Korea gradually
expanded into more skill and technology-intensive industries, such as ship-
building, iron and steel manufacturing, electronics, and other machinery
industries, licensing arrangements were often the most cost effective and time
saving mode, if not the only mode feasible, for obtaining the necessary techno-
logical and manufacturing information.
2.19       With the growing technological sophistication of industry, and with
industry's ambitious expansion program into a number of import substituting,
technology-intensive heavy industries in recent years, royalty payments by
industry increased dramatically, from less than US$2 million a year during
the 1960's, to more than US$80 million a year during 1977-79 in current terms.
In 1979, royalty payments accounted for close to 40% of industry's technology
expenditures. The relative importance of in-house RD&E work was also gradually
recognized by industry, in line with its growing technological competence,
as well as the changing technological needs. Reported in-house R&D spending by
industry was about US$110 million or 52% of its total technology expenditures
in 1979. The growing importance of licensing arrangements and in-house RD&E
work in Korea is shown below:

/a Manufacturing sector accounts for 90% of the expenditures.
2.20       Despite the large increase in absolute terms in industrial tech-
nology expenditures over the past decade, Korea today still lags behind Japan
in technology expenditures compared to Japan at a similar stage of economic
development. When Japan's exports exceede(i US$10 billion, its royalty payments
were about 2.3% of the export value, as compared to 0.64% in 1979 in Korea.
When Japan's per capita income was about US$1,600 in constant 1979 prices, its
in-house R&D expenditures totalled about 0.66% of GNP, as compared to 0.2% of
GNP in 1979 in Korea.
E.     Government's R&D Policy
2.21       The Government's strategy to upgrade manufacturing sector's tech-
nological capability is basically a three-pronged approach: (i) promotion
of foreign technology imports; (ii) encouragement of industry's in-house
RD&E activities; and (iii) establishment of R&D infrastructure, specifi-
cally public research institutes, to serve industry. Further, to facilitate
the efficient execution of this strategy, the Government has increased educa-
tional sector investments to improve the quantity, as well as the quality of
the technical manpower supply (technicians, engineers, and scientists) to
industry.

1. Measures to Promote Foreign Technology Imports and RD&E
Work by Industry.
2.22       The measures that the Government has taken to promote foreign
technology imports and industry's in-house R&D efforts, generally fall under
three categories: (a) administrative measures to reduce Government control
on foreign technology acquisition; (b) fiscal incentives to reduce the cost
of in-house RD&E work; and (c) financial incentives to provide funds for RD&E
undertaking and technology imports by industry.
2.23       Administrative Measures.  Within a brief period (1978-80), the
Government virtually eliminated all restrictions on the importation of foreign
technologies. In addition, the Foreign Investment Inducement Act was amended in
1980 to increase the inflow of direct foreign investment and technology.
2.24       Fiscal Incentives.  The Technology Promotion Law (No. 2399), which
was promulgated in December 1972 and amended in December 1977, provides a
framework for various incentives to promote the development and upgrading of
industry's technological capability. These incentives are aimed at reducing
the costs of foreign technology imports and of industry's RD&E work, by allow-
ing reduced tariffs on the import of R&D equipment; deduction of annual non-
capital RD&E expenditures from taxable income; accelerated depreciation on
industrial RD&E facilities; and a tax credit (8-10%) for investment in facil-
ities for RD&E work or for commercialization of locally developed R&D results.
2.25       The Technology Promotion Law also introduced a tax reducing scheme,
called the Technology Development Reserve (TDR). Under this scheme, and as
provided in the Tax Reduction Act, a company can set aside up to 20% of profit
before tax, in any one year, if it submits to and obtains from MOST approval
of its RD&E program for the following two years. In effect, the TDR scheme
allows companies to write off RD&E expenditures as early as two years before
actual expenditures are incurred. However, if TDR funds so accumulated are
not used within two years, the company must pay back-tax on the unused balance,
as well as a penalty on the back-tax. Annual TDR accumulation by manufacturing
companies increased from about Won 3 billion in 1974, to Won 28 billion in
1979, and, the number of companies participating in this scheme doubled in six
years, from 60 companies in 1974, to 126 companies in 1979, as shown below:

2.26       Financial Incentives.  Since 1976, the Government has experimented
with the idea of expanding the scope of the Government-owned Korea Development
Bank (KDB) to provide funds for the commercialization of locally developed R&D
results, and purchase of R&D equipment, thrcugh "Technology Development
Loans." KDB normally accepts applications for Technology Development Loans
only for one month a year, in February, and after due consultations with MOST
regarding the technological aspects of the projects, KDB grants approval in
the following June. Despite the severe time constraint imposed on the submis-
sion of loan applications, the Technology Development Loan applications more
than doubled in less than two years, from US$12 million equivalent in 1977, to
US$29 million equivalent in 1979. However, actual loans made by KDB declined
from US$9.5 million equivalent in 1977, to US$8.5 million in 1980, as shown
below:

Source: Korea Development Bank (KDB), 1981.
2.27      KDB's Technology Development Loans, which have accounted for less
than 0.5% of its annual lending, can be made only for hardware and must have
collateral backing. Furthermore, KDB has limited capability in appraising
technology-intensive projects. Consequently, KDB's role in financing R&D and
the commercialization of locally developed R&D results has had, and is likely
to continue to have, limited impact on local R&D efforts.
2.   Public Research Institutes
2.28       In 1966, the Government established the Korea Institute of Science
and Technology (KIST), a multi-disciplinary research institute, to perform
industry-oriented RD&E activities. During 1976-78, in view of the expected
growing demand for technological services by industry in connection with its
gradual transformation into a higher skill- and technology-intensive one, the
Government established some 15 additional public research institutes (para.
2.11) to complement the functions of the existing institutes. These institutes,
many of which are spin-offs of KIST, specialize in individual target industrial
subsectors. Unlike KIST, which was under the responsibility of MOST, these
institutes were placed under relevant operating ministries with a view to
promoting a close link with the respective industries. As is shown in the
table in para. 2.12, public research institutes as a whole spent about Won 50
billion (US$105 million equivalent) or 29% of Korea's total R&D spending
in 1979; however, a good part of it is capital expenditures in connection with
establishment of new institutes. Further, because the expansion program was



- 14 -
hastily organized and implemented, they often competed for the same limited
technological manpower resources with industry, which was also building up
in-house technological capabilities. In retrospect, too many public research
institutes were established in too short a period of time.
2.29       Since these institutes recruited heavily from academic fields, they
are particularly weak in manufacturing know-how and the development of proto-
types, and could not compete with foreign licensors in supplying the detailed
blueprints and other manufacturing know-how as well as in assisting industry to
solve teething problems in the crucial initial production stage. As such,
their work tends to be too theoretical to serve industry effectively. The weak
link between industry and public research institutes is best illustrated by the
volume of industry-s contracts with these institutes. In 1978, out of indus-
try's total R&D expenditure of Won 55.8 billion (US$115 million equivalent),
only Won 2.3 billion (US$4.7 million equivalent), or 4% of the total, was
contracted out to these institutes.
2.30       In a major departure from the nature and activities of other public
research institutes, KIET was established as an RD&E-cum-service organization
to support the electronics industry. KIET was designed to provide industry
with services relating to: (i) acquisition and development of products or
processes to enable industry to advance to new areas; and (ii) provision of
production support and back-up services, such as product custom design, supply
of process inputs, testing and quality control, equipment services and train-
ing. Under the Electronics Technology Project (para. 1.08), which is nearing
completion, KIET is equipped with the facilities and capabilities to service
the electronics industry across the entire spectrum of the product life cycle,
from research and development to production, and is provided with funds to
finance RD&E projects sponsored by industry but carried out at KIET. Since
KIET's RD&E work is done on facilities that can also be used for production
purposes, the manufacturing know-how will be readily transferable to industry.
2.31       In December 1980, in order to form an effective critical mass,
and to avoid the pitfalls of spreading limited resources too thin, the Govern-
ment merged closely related public research institutes, reducing the number
from 19 to 13, and consolidated the administrative responsibilities under
MOST, as shown in Annex 2-2. This consolidation of public research institutes
under one ministry should improve the coordination among these institutes,
but, at the same time, may dilute their linkage to industry.
2.32       The Government is currently formulating policy measures to promote
closer cooperation between public research institutes and industry. Accord-
ing to the preliminary R&D sector program, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan
(1982-86), the Government (MOST) would commission the public research institutes
to carry out "national projects" (shown in Annex 2-3) to develop, jointly with
industry, technologies in areas of critical importance to future growth, such
as semiconductors, computers, fine chemicals, automobiles, nuclear engineering,
and industrial systems engineering.

2.33       Although it is too early at this sl:age to assess how successful
"national projects" will be in promoting a closer link between public research
institutes and industry, it is almost certain that other mechanisms will
be called for if the link between industry and public research institutes is
to be further developed. One such mechanism would be to channel a certain
percentage of research institutes' annual budgyets (shown in Annex 2-4) through
intermediaries such as KTDC, which would then use the funds to finance a part
of the cost of the RD&E projects from industrial companies to be contracted out
to research institutes. With this funding arrcangement, the research institutes
collectively would not only regain all their 1zudgetary funds diverted to KTDC,
but also would stand to receive additional funds by virtue of the cost sharing
required from industrial companies for their contract work. This arrangement
would then not only mobilize additional resou:-ces for research institutes as a
group, but would also introduce an element of competition among the various
research institutes, as well as among the various units within each institute,
and thus make them more responsive to the needls of industry. This arrangement
is under consideration by the Government. The Government has agreed that it
will exchange views with the Bank from time to time on the Government's
industrial RD&E policies, especially with regard to the progress made towards
a closer link between industry and the public research institutes and on the
national projects, as well as other policies aimed at promoting and supporting
the development of industry's RD&E capability.
F.     RD&E Financing:  An Institutional Gap in the Korean Capital Market
2.34       Industrial firms in Korea currently face unusual difficulty in
raising funds for their technological capability development from existing
financial institutions.  To understand this institutional gap in the capital
market, one needs to examine the various phasas of the product life cycle (or
product innovation cycle) and the range of financial support mechanisms for
each of these phases. As illustrated in the .:hart on page 16, the product
life cycle can be generally conceived as consisting of four phases: start-up;
pre-commercial; expansion; and maturity. The first phase -- start-up --
comprises feasibility studies and technical R&D. The second phase -- pre-
commercial -- involves construction of prototypes and pilot plants, preliminary
production and test marketing. The third phase -- expansion -- consists of
rapid expansion of production and sales if tha new product is successful. In
the fourth phase -- maturity -- sales grow in accordance with the state of the
economy and market conditions.
2.35       Each of the four phases of the proluct life cycle is associated with
a typical financing pattern. In the first phase, the newly launched entrepre-
neur usually draws on private funding sources, i.e., his own savings and
borrowings from family and friends; the ongoing firm draws on internally
generated funds, Government RD&E grants and lDng-term loans, venture capital,
etc. In the second phase, funds are drawn substantially from the same sources
as in the first phase, with greater emphasis Dn venture capital and less
concessionary Government financing or subsidies. The third and fourth phases
-- which constitute the market phase of the product life cycle -- are normally

financed by self-generated funds, investmeni: and commercial banks, supplemented
if necessary by Government incentives such as preferential interest rates and
tax incentives.
2.36       In the Korean situation, the focus of industrial development has
been on the market phase of the product life cycle. This has been appropriate
for a developing country which could rely oTn imported, fairly proven,
standard technologies that can be easily assimilated. Commercial, investment
and development banks (DFCs), and a fast developing securities market provide
the financial intermediary services useful at the expansion and maturity phases
of the product life-cycle. But these services are inadequate at the start-up
and pre-commercial phases, namely the pre-market phase, where Korea needs to
develop capacity, as a necessary condition of its accelerated technological
development. The risky character of projects at the pre-market phase (RD&E
projects) makes conventional loans unattractive both to lenders and borrowers:
lenders prefer less risky projects; and borrowers prefer to restrict their
activities to what could be self-financed so as not to incur debts that would
be difficult to discharge in the event of project failure.
2.37       The foregoing discussions (paras. 2.34 to 2.36) indicate that new
financing instruments of risk-sharing nature should be made available to
promote and accelerate industry's undertaking of RD&E activities.
G.     KTDC and Its Relationships With Other Industry Support Organizations
2.38       KTDC was established in 1981, as a private sector entity with strong
private sector support, to fill the institutional gap in the Korean capital
market (paras. 2.34 to 2.37). Thus, KTDC's objective is to accelerate advanced
foreign technology imports and in-house R&D work (para. 2.21) through the
provision of funds, that are not available from other financial institutions in
Korea, due to the software-intensive and/or risky nature of such projects.
Further, KTDC will also help strengthen the link between public research
institutes and industry through its financin; of RD&E projects sponsored by
industry but carried out by the institutes.
2 39       KTDC will complement the activities of existing financial institu-
tions, as well as those of other industry support organizations, including KTAC
and KOPTEC, which are being considered for Bank Group assistance (para. 1.08).
KTAC was incorporated in 1974 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of KIST, now (since
the December 1980 reorganization) the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology (KAIST), an institute of technology-cum-RD&E institution, with the
primary objective of commercializing production technologies (products and
processes) developed by KAIST. To this end, it was set up to prepare detailed
feasibility studies for selected projects with strong commercial potential
based on the results of KAIST's RD&E efforts, and to approach interested
parties to sell such projects for a commissioia. It will also make equity
investments in such projects. During the last 7 years, KTAC has made 11 sales
of know-how and 5 equity investments, with it, total assets amounting to



- 18 -
Won 0.9 billion (US$1.3 million equivalent) at the end of 1980. It is
currently seeking to increase its share capital by about Won 1.3 billion
(US$1.8 million equivalent), including a proposed equity investment of Won 500
million (US$690,000 equivalent) by the IFC, which would be needed for
initiating some 11 projects through the end of 1984.
2.40       In contrasting the areas of emphasis of KTAC and KTDC, it can be
seen from the foregoing discussions that (i) while the emphasis of KTAC's
operations lies in the production/prototype stage of the product life cycle,
which is generally characteristic of venture capital-type companies such as
SOFINNOVA (France) and SEFINNOVA (Spain) as illustrated by the chart on
page 16, the thrust of KTDC is much further upstream and covers practically the
entire range of the pre-market phase of the product cycle beginning at the
"idea evaluation" stage; and (ii) while KTAC primarily seeks to commercialize
RD&E results achieved by a public research institute (KAIST), KTDC will
attempt mainly to assist industry to commercialize the results of their RD&E
efforts. In fact, in some cases, it is expected that KTDC will participate in
the projects promoted by KTAC. Further, since only 10% of KTDC-s resources
are targeted for equity investment and, with a view to promote and broaden the
venture capital market in Korea, KTDC will eventually seek to assist in setting
up other venture capital companies such as KTAC. Such venture capital companies
would serve to commercialize primarily technologies developed by industry.
2.41       KOPTEC was created in January 1981 as an autonomous entity under
the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) to provide shop-floor advice and
guidance to upgrade technical capabilities and productivity of small and
medium machinery enterprises, as well as enterprises in other key export
subsectors. KOPTEC complements the activities and functions of the Small and
Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SMIPC) in the provision of extension
services, training and technical information to small and medium industries.
KOPTEC is a technical assistance organization, whose activities will be
concentrated primarily in the market phase of the product life cycle and where
the production technologies involved are relatively mature. It is expected
that, in the course of its operations, KOPTEC will refer those of its clients
with promising RD&E projects to KTDC, and that KTDC will reciprocate by
encouraging its clients to seek guidance from KOPTEC in improving their
production practices.
2.42       As discussed in the above paragraphs, although KTDC, KTAC, and
KOPTEC are all involved in promoting and supporting the enhancement of the
technical level of Korean industry, each organization has a different area of
emphasis, with KTDC at the upstream, KTAC at the midstream and KOPTEC at the
downstream of the product life cycle. Bank Group assistance to these organiza-
tions represents a major effort in promoting and advancing technological
development of industry in Korea.

III. THE KOREA TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (KTDC)
A.   Legal Framework and Ownership
3.01       KTDC was established under the Korea Technology Development Cor-
poration Act (Law No. 3312) promulgated on December 31, 1980, and the associated
Enforcement Decree (Presidential Decree No. 10292) issued on April 22, 1981.
This special KTDC Act and the associated Presidential Decree, which were framed
following extensive discussions with the Bank, will enable KTDC to operate in
an autonomous manner with the efficiency of a private company; to have a strong
and independent management; and to have the ability and means to attract and
retain staff of high caliber and entrepreneurship. All these factors are most
critical to the success of an operation of KTDC's type. Public interest in
KTDC, by way of Government financial support, such as equity contributions,
soft loans, loan guarantees, etc., as elaborated in section H below, will be
safeguarded principally through Government rapresentation on KTDC's Board of
Directors, exercising the usual right of a saareholder. Also, to prevent KTDC
from being dominated by any one private shareholder, the KTDC Act stipulates
that the ownership of any shareholder, with the exception of the Government
and official international development finanzing institutions, will be limited
to no more than 7% of the total shares issued, and that in case any such
shareholder's shares should exceed 7% of the total shares issued, his voting
rights would be limited to 7%.
3.02       KTDC has an authorized capital of Won 15 billion (US$21 million
equivalent), to be issued in 15 million shares with a par value of Won 1,000
each. To raise this authorized capital, it Ls intended that Won 9 billion
(60%) will be subscribed by the private sector, and the balance of Won 6
billion (40%) by the Government. The initiaL paid-in capital at the time of
incorporation of KTDC in April 1981 was Won 7.5 billion, or 50% of the
authorized capital. As shown by the list of shareholders given in Annex 3-1,
the ownership is broad-based, including the zarticipation of 13 industrial
groups, 83 individual firms, and 5 banking iistitutions.
3.03       The status with regard to the rai:3ing of KTDC-s share capital
is summarized below:
KTDC - Share Capital

- 20 -
3.04       It is noted from the table in para. 3.03 that:  (i) of the paid-in
capital of Won 7.5 billion as of April 28, 1981, the Government provided only
Won 1 billion, or 13.2%, while private firms and banking institutions together
contributed Won 6.5 billion, or 86.8% of the total; and (ii) with regard to
new subscriptions up through 1984, the Government is committed to provide Won
5 billion, and the private sector to raise about Won 2.5 billion. Since
these new subscriptions will be required for KTDC to finance its operations,
the Government has agreed to contribute the additional Won 5 billion during
1982-84. Also, KTDC has agreed to raise additional equity from the private
sector of at least Won 2.5 billion during 1982-84.
B.   Role of KTDC
3.05       The principal role of KTDC will be to promote and facilitate
the technological development of Korean industry. In this connection, it
will actively identify and appraise RD&E projects initiated by industry with
a view to providing financial support for such projects. KTDC will put strong
emphasis on sharing the risks with project sponsors and thereby will influence
and reinforce industry's attitude towards further undertaking of RD&E activi-
ties. The financial support provided by KTDC will basically serve as "seed
money", which should have a multiplier effect on industry-s RD&E investment
necessary for the accelerated development of industrial technological capabi-
lity. In addition, with its firsthand knowledge of the status of technological
development and needs of industry, through direct contact at firm level and
through periodic surveys by KTDC staff and consultants, KTDC will be in a good
position to assist industry to identify international technological trends and
areas in which it should focus its RD&E efforts. Also, through the process of
appraising and particularly supervising its RD&E projects, KTDC will induce a
measure of discipline, and hence increase the efficiency in industry's manage-
ment and implementation of RD&E activities. Finally, KTDC will promote a
closer link between industry and public research institutes, by encouraging
and financing projects sponsored by industry and carried out by these research
institutes.
C.   KTDC's Functions and Financing Instruments
3.06       KTDC will seek to promote, appraise and finance mainly the following
types of projects:
(a) Projects for RD&E through:
(i) industry's in-house RD&E facilities and
projects; and
(ii) industry-s RD&E contracts with public
research institutes;
(b)   Projects for the introduction and adaptation of
advanced technology in terms of:



- 21 -
(i) costs of technology search and selection;
(ii) technology transfer fees; and
(c) Projects for the improvement of manufacturing capabilities,
products and processes in the form of:
(i) technical assistance and consulting fees; and
(ii) costs of specialized training, domestic or overseas;
(d)  Projects for the commercial exploitation of RD&E results
where financing is not available frDm other financial
institutions; and
(e)  Projects for the development and im?rovement of the
capabilities of the technical consulting and engineering
services industry in Korea.
3.07      The types of projects assisted by KTDC, as enumerated in para.
3.06, will involve expenditures for hardware, such as equipment and machinery
for RD&E purposes, and software, such as technical know-how, expert consulting
services and manpower training, as well as consumable materials and supplies
for RD&E activities, such as for the development of prototypes and pilot
plants.
3.08       To promote the undertaking of RD&E projects by industry, which
inherently involve substantial risks coupled writh expected high returns, KTDC
will have to share both the risk of failure and the benefits of success. To
this end, KTDC will offer the following types of financial support:
(a)   Conventional loans:  regular loans to be repaid according to certain
predetermined conditions (interest rate, grace period, repayment
period);
(b)   Conditional loans:  financial instruments that allow profit and
risk sharing with project sponsors. Such "loans" will normally be
"repaid" through royalty payments from sales revenues if the
project is successful, including a reasonable return on the
loans. If the project does not result in sales revenues, KTDC will
recover only a portion of the principal from the sponsor. KTDC
has agreed that the stipulated royalty payments would be enough at
least to provide for repayment of the principal amount of the loan
plus interest and other charges at the same rate as applies to
conventional loans. It is expected that, through negotiations with
the prospective subborrower, the royalty payments will be set
higher than this minimum in order to compensate KTDC for the risk
associated with this type of operation; 1/
(c)   Equity investments:  equity participation in companies set up to
commercialize RD&E results; and
(d)   Mixtures of the above.
1/   For the purpose of financial projections, average expected royalties
equivalent to a 10% return in real terms 1have been assumed (para 3.32).



- 22 -
3.09       KTDC's conventional loans may be granted with or without collateral
requirement depending on the nature of the projects and sponsors. Conventional
loans without collateral security are particularly appropriate in the case of
software-intensive projects to be carried out by sponsors who can least afford
to provide security, such as small-scale industrial firms. Since KTDC's
financing is oriented towards the risk sharing, venture capital type, KTDC will
emphasize software loans without collateral, rather than hardware loans with
collateral security, as financing for the latter may be available from other
financial institutions.
3.10       With regard to conditional loans, KTDC intends to require sub-
borrowers to repay a certain portion, called a "minimum royalty payment", of
up to 30% of its contribution, regardless of the outcome of their projects.
The failure rate on conditional loans is not expected to be higher than 25-
30% 1/, because RD&E activities by Korean industry are mostly directed towards
development and engineering in relatively known fields. The minimum royalty
payment requirement, in addition to minimizing KTDC's risk exposure on
its conditional loan portfolio, should have the desired effect of encouraging
efficiency in project implementation by the sponsor. Although the exact
amount of the minimum royalty payment would have to be negotiated with project
sponsors on a case-by-case basis, KTDC will consider waiving this requirement
altogether for eligible projects from small scale industrial firms.
D.   Organization, Management and Staff
3.11       Under its Charter (Law No. 3312), the responsibility for the policy
and general direction of KTDC-s business is vested in a Board of Directors,
consisting of not more than 12 members elected for three-year terms by the
General Shareholders' Meeting. The Directors need not be shareholders of
KTDC. The Shareholders' Meeting for KTDC's inauguration in April 1981
elected 10 Board members, including a Vice-Minister of MOST, 7 prominent
industry and business leaders (including the Chairman of AIRI and the Chairman
of the Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB)), and 2 Directors who serve
as Representative Director and President (President) and Executive Vice-
President of KTDC. The President of KTDC reports directly to the Board, and
is responsible for the overall as well as day-to-day operations of the
Corporation.
3.12       The Chairman of the Board, Mr. J.Y. Chung, who is also Chairman of
FKI as well as the Hyundai Group, is a leading industrialist in Korea.
Mr. I.S. Kim, formerly the Executive Vice-Chairman of FKI, was elected as
President of KTDC. Mr. Kim is a dynamic and capable administrator with a
sense of mission. With his deep knowledge of Korean industry and business,
acquired during his ten-year tenure as Executive Vice-Chairman of FKI, Mr. Kim
is expected to provide the leadership necessary to launch and establish
KDTC successfully. Mr. C.D. Kim, a highly competent manager with extensive
banking experiences, was elected Executive Vice-President. The composition
of the Board of Directors is given in Annex 3-2.
3.13       As provided in the KTDC Act, the Shareholders' Meeting also appoin-
ted, with the required approval of the Minister of MOST, an Auditor for a
1/ Based on the experience in other countries, a failure rate of 30% (in
commercialization) has been assumed for the purpose of financial
projections (para. 3.32).



- 23 -
two-year term. The Auditor, who is responsible for auditing and examining the
operations of KTDC, is a non-voting participant at Board meetings. KTDC has
also appointed a Technology Review and Advisory Committee to advise on matters
related to its business activities. Members of this Committee have broad
knowledge and experience in the technology development field and are drawn
from various sectors, including Government, research institutes, industry and
universities. KTDC has also enlisted a high-level and prestigious group of
advisors (Annex 3-2) for consultation, on an ad hoc basis, on issues concerning
the overall direction and strategy for its operations.
3.14       While the Board has ultimate authority over all investment decisions,
it has delegated authority to the President to approve individual loans and
investments up to Won 300 million (US$0.42 million equivalent), and to an
Executive Directors Committee, which includes all executive directors 1/ and
is chaired by the President, to approve individual loans and investments up to
the ceiling of Won 500 million (US$0.7 million equivalent). Such an arrange-
ment strengthens the hands of the President and the management of KTDC, and
will make the decision process within KTDC mcre efficient.
3.15       In the management of KTDC, Mr. Kim, is also assisted by two capable
Directors in charge of four Departments of the Corporation. As shown in the
organization chart in Annex 3-3, KTDC's four departments are: Appraisal
Departments I and II, which are divided alonE subsectors and responsible for
project identification, appraisal and supervision; the Credit Department which
handles the administration of loans and investments; and the Planning and
Administration Department, which is responsible for planning and budgeting,
economic and market surveys, accounting and control, personnel and other
support services. At the time of appraisal, KTDC had recruited 30 profes-
sional staff, with various backgrounds, incltuding RD&E engineers, project
engineers, development banking officers and, investment officers, with 7-8
years of work experience on average.  This professional staff, which is drawn
mainly from the staff of leading industrial ELnd banking institutions in Korea,
is capable and eager, and should be able to acquire the additional skill and
expertise, peculiar to KTDC's type of operations within a reasonably short
period of time on the job.  KTDC is expected to recruit some 20 additional pro-
fessional staff during 1982-84, to handle its increasing volume of operations.
E.   Expert Advisory Services and Training
3.16       Although KTDC's professional staff is capable of handling conven-
tional loan operations, they will need from time to time coaching assistance
from advisory experts, especially in appraising and negotiating those projects
for which conditional loans are considered. In addition, such specialists
are also expected to assist KTDC, during its initial stage of operations, in
streamlining and fine-tuning its internal organization and procedures, as well
as in training appraisal officers. Provisions for such advisory services are
included in the proposed project. KTDC has agreed to contract experts for
such services on a retainer or ad hoc basis at least until December 31, 1984,
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.

- 24 -
3.17       In addition to the on-the-job training rendered by the experts
referred to in para. 3.16, KTDC plans to provide its staff with: (i) in-house
training, including lectures and seminars to be given by local and foreign
experts particularly those from institutions elsewhere in the world that
are of similar nature to KTDC 1/; (ii) training at Korean academic institutions
and professional associations through part-time courses; and (iii) overseas
training at the institutions referred to in (i) and elsewhere. KTDC is already
taking steps to contact its foreign counterparts with a view to exchanging
information and experience and arranging suitable training and expert invita-
tion programs with these institutions. KTDC has agreed that it will submit to
the Bank by September 1, 1982, details of its proposed training and expert
invitation program.
F.   Operating Policies and Procedures
1.   Operating Policies
3.18       KTDC's Statement of Investment and Operational Policies (Annex
3-4), which was approved by its Board of Directors on May 25, 1981, provides
appropriate guidelines for its operations including the scope of investment
activities, overall basis for investment decisions, assets diversification,
relationship with clients, profits and reserves, etc. With respect to assets
diversification, KTDC will not extend excessive investments and/or loans to
the same business group. KTDC will normally not extend loans and/or invest-
ments to a single project totalling more than Won 500 million (US$0.7 million
equivalent); assistance exceeding this amount will require a resolution of the
Board of Directors. Also, KTDC's equity investment in any single enterprise
will be limited to not more than 10% of its paid-in share capital and free
reserves. To further ensure widespread financial assistance from KTDC, KTDC
will limit its total financial commitment outstanding at any time to any
single enterprise or business group to not more than 7% of its long-term
portfolio or Won 4.2 billion (corresponding to about 7% of KTDC's capitaliza-
tion during 1981-84), whichever is larger. Details of the terms and conditions
of KTDC's loan and equity investments are given in the Statement of Rules on
Lending and Equity Participation, shown in Annex 3-5.
3.19       Although the Statement of Investment and Operational Policies
adequately defines the range of financing instruments that KTDC may provide,
it should be emphasized that KTDC will strive to gradually expand its condi-
tional lending and equity financing operations to promote and support risky
RD&E projects. The following financing targets have been discussed with
KTDC:
1/  Such as National Research and Development Corporation (NRDC)/UK; NRDC/India;
Japan Research and Development Corporation (JRDC)/Japan; Centro Para El
Desarrollo Technologico Industrial (CDTI)/Spain; the Office of the Chief
Scientist (OCS)/Israel; Agence Nationale de Valorisation de la Recherche
(ANVAR)/France; Deutsche Wagnisfinanzierungs-Gesellschaft (WFG)/Federal
Republic of Germany; the Finnish National Fund for Research and Development
(SITRA)/Finland; the National Swedish Board for Technical Development
(STU)/Sweden; the Agency for Financing Studies and Projects (FINEP)/Brazil.

Total                       100    100    100    100          100
It is noted from the above table that KTDC-s operations are directed towards
conventional and conditional lending, whereas organizations of similar nature
in other countries channeled their resources through conditional loans and
grants. This difference in emphasis can be explained mainly by the relatively
early stage of technological development of Korean industry, where acquisition
of R&D infrastructure and foreign technologies still plays a relatively more
important role than in more advanced countries. Furthermore, while organiza-
tions in other countries are funded almost entirely by governments, a consider-
able portion of KTDC-s resources come from the private sector (para. 3.03).
For these reasons, the above targets for the composition of KTDC financing
operations are considered reasonable. The targets during 1982-84 have been
specified in an amendment to the Policy Statement. It should be noted,
however, that these targets are indicative and that they would have to be
reviewed from time to time, taking into consideration the experience and
actual results of KTDC's operations. Consequently, KTDC has agreed to review
with the Bank by the end of each year beginning in 1982 the operational
targets to be met by KTDC during the following year, and, on the basis of such
reviews, adopt such targets as shall be mutually acceptable to KTDC and the
Bank.
3.20       Under its Charter, KTDC is required to give priority support
to Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMI) by allocating not less than a
certain prescribed portion of its total financial resources to such enter-
prises as decided upon by its Board of Directors. KTDC is already committed
to allocate to SMI at least 20% of its total financing in 1981, and plans to
increase the SMI-s share to 20% in 1982 and 30% in 1983-85. These targets for
SMI's share have been specified in an amendment to the Policy Statement.
SMI-s share of KTDC financing may eventually be higher, since the SMI sector
is expected to be the main beneficiary of KTDC-s conditional loans and equity
investments, for which a combined target of 40% has been set for 1984-85
(para. 3.19). KTDC has already taken major steps to promote its business and
attract project proposals from SMI through seminars and direct contact with
various SMI cooperatives, and is mounting a concerted plan for this purpose
with the assistance of other SMI-support institutions such as SMIB, SMIPC,
KOPTEC and KTAC.
2.   Operating Procedures
3.21       In preparing for the establishment of KTDC, UNDP-financed con-
sultants were employed during December 1980 - March 1981, with the Bank



- 26 -
acting as the Executing Agency, to assist in drafting detailed operating
procedures for KTDC, which include mainly the Procedures Manual and the
Appraisal Manual. The Procedures Manual gives details of the procedures and
forms to be followed and filled out from the first approach of a client to
KTDC, through the stages where the project is processed, appraised, and
considered by KTDC, to the follow-up stages. The Appraisal Manual provides
KTDC staff with a tool for project evaluation. KTDC's indicative guidelines
for sub-project financing and the procedures for processing of sub-projects are
shown in the charts in Annexes 3-6 and 3-7. These manuals, which are satis-
factory, are essential for KTDC to conduct its operations; nonetheless, it is
expected that modifications will be required from time to time as KTDC staff
becomes more familiar with the operating procedures of the Corporation.
G.   Accounts and Audit
3.22       KTDC will maintain its accounts in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and practices, including separate accounts for
expenditures for which withdrawals from the proposed Bank loan are requested
on the basis of statement of expenditures (para. 4.10). KTDC has agreed that
it will submit to the Bank its annual accounts, audited by external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank, together with the auditors' report within 4 months
after the close of each year, beginning with the 1981 accounts.
H.     Financial Aspects
1.   Financing Requirements
3.23       Based on various surveys of industry's RD&E capacity and project
pipelines made by KTDC in late 1980, and some 100 applications that KTDC
received during the first half-year of operations, as well as its anticipated
project processing capacity, KTDC expects to process about 25 sub-projects in
1981, 90 in 1982, 125 in 1983, and 150 in 1984. Thereafter, it expects to
increase its sub-project processing by about 10% annually. The aforementioned
surveys indicate also that the cost of individual sub-projects contemplated
by industry varies from about Won 7 million (US$10,000 equivalent) to more
than Won 2.7 billion (US$4 million equivalent), with an average of about Won
200 million (US$300,000 equivalent). Based on the assumptions that (i) the
average sub-project cost would increase annually by about 5% in real terms as
industry accumulates experience with RD&E ventures; and (ii) KTDC would
finance about 70% of sub-project cost, with the remaining 30% self-financed,
on the average, KTDC's sub-project approvals and financing requirements on a
commitment basis would be as follows:

lb US$ million equivalent.
3.24       The figures in the above table should be taken as indicative
of the order of magnitude of KTDC's operatio'as, since external financing
of RD&E subprojects originating from industry is a new phenomenon in Korea
and, therefore, there are many uncertainties surrounding these estimates.
Nevertheless, KTDC's estimates are based on the best information available
from questionnaires sent to a representative sample of industrial firms as
well as through direct interviews with industry during its aforementioned
surveys, and a realistic assessment of the Corporation's processing capacity.
According to these estimates, KTDC's financiag requirements for 1981-84 would
be about Won 64-66 billion (US$90-92 million equivalent) for about 390 sub-
projects, of which 50-60% (about US$50 million equivalent) is expected to be
in foreign exchange. This amount would represent about 15% of the total RD&E
investments by industry during this period, assuming that the 1979 level of
RD&E expenditures (para. 2.19) is maintained in real terms.
2.   KTDC-s Initial Capitalization
3.25       To meet this estimated financing requirement of about Won 66
billion (US$92 million equivalent) for 1981-84, KTDC would contract Government
loans totalling Won 6 billion and float Government guaranteed bonds totalling
Won 9 billion, for which the Government has committed to pay the differential
between the interest rates KTDC would pay on its bonds and the interest rates
of Government loans, in addition to the US$50 million loan (Won 36 billion
equivalent) requested from the Bank and its Won 15 billion (US$21 million
equivalent) equity funds to be raised during this period, (para. 3.03).
The initial financing plan, that has been adopted for KTDC, is as follows:

7b  Government guaranteed KTDC bonds.
/c Including 1.5% front end fee.
3.26      Of the total required local currency resources, other than equity
funds, of Won 15 billion (para. 3.25), the Government already provided KTDC
with a loan of Won 1.0 billion in 1981. The Government has agreed to provide
or cause to be provided to KTDC by way of further loans and/or the purchase by
the private sector of Government guaranteed KTDC bonds in aggregate amount of
not less than Won 14 billion by December 31, 1984. Thi3 Won 14 billion will
comprise Won 5 billion in direct Government loans and Won 9 billion in Govern-
ment guaranteed bonds, which will be made available to KTDC during 1982-84 in
accordance with the schedule shown in the above table. This schedule, which
also includes Government's equity contribution each year during 1982-84, is
satisfactory.
3.27       The terms and conditions of the Won 1 billion Government loan
(para. 3.26) are not entirely suitable for KTDC's purposes. Specifically, the
loan agreement: (i) imposes excessive restrictions and administrative burdens
on the use of the funds by KTDC; (ii) imposes collateral requirements which
imply that KTDC would not be able to use these funds for conditional loan
operations; (iii) does not allow KTDC a sufficient margin to cover its risk
(the maximum set at 2.5%); and (iv) does not provide for an adequately long
repayment period (only 10 years is allowed). It has been confirmed that
further Government funds would be lent to KTDC for 15 years including 5
years of grace to be on-lent by KTDC with a spread of 2.5% in the case of



- 29 -
conventional loans. In addition, the Government would not require that its
funds be on-lent only to sub-borrowers capable of providing collateral and
that the use of Government loan funds would involve only minimal administrative
requirements on the part of KTDC. Furthermore, the Government will allocate
budgetary resources, amounting to Won 250 million in 1982, Won 645 million in
1983 and Won 810 million in 1984, to pay the differential between the interest
rates KTDC is expected to pay on its bonds and the interest rate KTDC pays on
its loans from the Government. In addition, it has been confirmed that the
remaining loan and equity funds as well as the interest differential funds for
1983 and 1984 are already included in Government's medium term budget for
those years.
3.   Other Government Support
3.28       Aside from its financial contribution to KTDC, in the forms of
equity investments and loans, the Government also plans to provide KTDC with
other support, including: (i) funds to cover KTDC's annual losses pertaining
to its conditional loan operations during the initial years; (ii) revision of
relevant tax laws to encourage industrial firms to invest funds accumulated in
their Technology Development Reserve (para. 2.25) in KTDC; and (iii) tax
incentives. These supports are discussed further in the following paragraphs.
3.29       To ensure that excessive concern with profitability and self-
sufficiency would not prevent KTDC from fulfilling its promotional role
effectively, the KTDC Act stipulates that the Government may provide KTDC
with funds to cover losses on conditional loans on an annual basis. By
comparison, most of KTDC's counterparts in the industrialized world are
government-owned companies and, therefore, any losses that they incur are
financed from government budgets. The Government has agreed to provide such
supplemental financing for a limited period of time (5-7 years) in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank. Since KTDC most likely will not receive such
financial support until 4-5 years after KTDC's approval of such conditional
loans as the support can only be provided for conditional loan losses as they
are realized and because of the budgetary Frocedures for providing such funds
to KTDC, the Government intends, in case of any shortfall in KTDC-s cash flow
during the initial period (4-5 years) of its operations, to provide additional
funds as needed for KTDC to achieve its conditional lending targets.
3.30       With a view to encouraging RD&E activities undertaken by industry,
the Government allows, under the Tax Reduction Act, industrial firms to
reserve up to 20% of their profits before tax for utilization in such
activities. However, the reserved funds, if not utilized within two years,
would be subject to taxation at normal rates plus a penalty of 36.5% per annum
on the back tax. To help KTDC in mobilizing its future equity funds, the
Government has amended the Tax Reduction Act as of December 31, 1981, to waive
the penalty tax should the firms opt to invest such reserved funds in KTDC-s
equity.
3.31      Tax legislation prior to project appraisal restricted the maximum
tax allowance against bad debt to 1% of the loan portfolio outstanding at the
end of the year in question. Since KTDC will finance high risk ventures (with
a possible average failure rate as high as 25-30% for conditional loans as
mentioned in para. 3.10), such tax system would overstate KTDC's income for



- 30 -
tax purposes during the initial years, and so tend to discourage the pursuit
of risky activities by the Corporation. The Government has amended the Tax
Reduction Act as of December 31, 1981, to allow KTDC higher allowance for bad
debts in respect of its conditional loans (40% of conditional loans may be
reserved for 4 years).
4.   Financial Projections
3.32       KTDC's financial statements for 1981-90 have been projected based
on the estimated volume of operations described in para. 3.23; the initial
financing plan described in para. 3.25; and a gradual buildup of conditional
lending from 5% of total approvals in 1981 to 50% in 1990 (para. 3.19). They
are also based on the assumptions that: (i) conventional loans would be, on
average, lent at 15.5% p.a. and repaid over 7 years including a 3-year grace
period; (ii) conditional loans would earn average expected royalties totalling
twice the amount of the loan over a 7-year period (equivalent to about 10%
annual return in real terms), taking into account assumed sub-project failure
rate of 30% (para. 3.10); and (iii) the Government would compensate for 50% of
the losses on conditional loans, or 15% of the conditional loans granted by
KTDC, for a limited period of 7 years. Other assumptions are given in Annex
3-8. Detailed fund raising plan and debt service, income statement, cash
flow and balance sheet projections are given in Annexes 3-9, 3-10, 3-11, and
3-12. KTDC's projected financial performance and financial position are
summarized in the following tables:

3.33        The above tables indicate that KTDC would incur losses during
1982-85 totalling Won 5.7 billion, but would begin to earn profits there-
after, with net income after tax increasing from Won 0.5 billion in 1986
to Won 27.2 billion in 1990. Correspondingly, the return on equity would
be negative, ranging up to -17.0% during 1982-85, and would increase from 2.5%
in 1986 to 31.1% in 1990. The projected financial performance, although
tentative, is typical of a risk-sharing operation such as KTDC's, mainly due
to (i) the inherent risk of failure associated with RD&E projects; (ii) the
time of 4-5 years for KTDC to build up a sufficiently large size portfolio
of conditional loans and equity investments to diversify such risk; and (iii)
the long gestation period (4-5 years) of conditional loans and equity
investments, after which the successful ones would begin to yield profits.



- 33 -
3.34       To finance its operations beyond 1984 as indicated in para. 3.23,
it is projected that KTDC would have to raise additional resources, including
some Won 16 billion of equity and Won 73 billion in loans during 1985-88.
These figures are tentative and will necessarily depend on the results of
KTDC's operations during the initial three-year period. KTDC is not expected
to have difficulty in raising these additional resources given the continued
strong support of the private sector and the Government. Total assets would,
consequently, increase from Won 54 billion at end-1984, to Won 218 billion at
end-1990. As reflected by the financial perfDrmance set forth in para. 3.33,
and the need to contract additional loans for its operations, KTDC-s debt/
equity ratio would increase to 4.2:1 in 1985; thereafter, it would gradually
decline to 4.1:1 in 1986, 2.7:1 in 1988 and 1.5:1 in 1990. Although the pro-
jected debt-equity ratios are well within the 10:1 ceiling stated in KTDC's
Statement of Investment and Operational Policies (Annex 3-4), KTDC has agreed
that it would obtain the Bank's consent prior to contracting any long-term
debt(s), if such debt(s) would cause its debt-equity ratio to exceed 4 to 1.
IV.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND rHE BANK LOAN
A.   Project Objectives and Scope
4.01       The overall objective of the proposed project is to foster industrial
technology development in Korea in order to accelerate the transformation of
Korean industrial structure towards a technology-intensive one to achieve
long-term economic growth. The project, throigh the establishment and develop-
ment of KTDC, would promote and support the development of the technological
capability of Korean industry by providing filiancial assistance in the forms
that are suitable for typically risky and software-intensive industrial RD&E
projects not available in the existing financial market; and induce a closer
link between industry and public research ins:itutes by encouraging RD&E
projects sponsored by industry but carried ou: by those institutes. Further,
through the successful operations of KTDC, the project should demonstrate
not only the profitability of industrial RD&E undertakings, thereby stimulating
and broadening the interest of Korean industry in embarking on such activities,
but also the soundness of such a risk-sharing financing mechanism to the Korean
capital market.
4.02       The proposed project consists of two components:
(a) Institutional Development of KTDC: The project would finance:
(i) consulting services to strengthen KTDC's
capability in identifying, appraising,
negotiating and supervising industrial RD&E
projects, particularly those that qualify for
conditional loans;
(ii) consulting services to assist KTDC in carrying
out periodic studies and surveys of Korean
industry's RD&E programs and their progress of
implementation, as well as areas of potential
development;



- 34 -
(iii) invitation of experts especially from other institutions
in Bank member countries that are of similar nature to
KTDC, such as those mentioned in para. 3.17, to exchange
their working experience with KTDC;
(iv)  training of KTDC staff at the institutions referred to
in (iii) and elsewhere; and
(v) purchase of educational materials (books, periodicals,
other references) for use by KTDC staff; and
(b)  A line of credit to KTDC to finance industry-sponsored RD&E sub-
projects carried out by industry and/or public research institutes.
B.   Proposed Bank Loan
1.   Loan Amount
4.03       The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million equivalent, including the
capitalized front-end fee, would be made to KTDC and guaranteed by the Govern-
ment. The loan proceeds would be used to finance about US$650,000 1/ equivalent
of the foreign exchange cost of technical assistance, training and educational
materials for KTDC;- the balance of about US$49.35 million 2/ equivalent would
finance the estimated foreign exchange costs of RD&E projects that KTDC
expects to process during 1982-84. The cost of US$650,000 equivalent for the
development of KTDC during 1981-84 is estimated to include 30 man-months of
consulting and expert services (para. 3.16) at an average cost of US$12,000
per man-month including travel and subsistence allowance, for a total of
US$360,000; 100 man-months of training (para. 3.17) at an average cost of
US$2,500 per man-month, for a total of US$250,000; and US$ 40,000 worth of
educational materials. In order to preserve the momentum of the project as
KTDC had initiated its business operations and solicited sub-loan applications
on the basis of an original project implementation timetable which had subse-
quently been delayed, it is recommended that the proposed loan include retro-
active financing of US$1.5 million equivalent to cover KTDC approvals made
after January 1, 1982. KTDC has agreed that the sub-projects to be retroactively
financed will be subject to prior approval of the Bank before disbursement.
2.   Features of the Loan
a.   On-lending Rate
4.04       The proposed Bank loan would be lent to KTDC at the prevailing
rate of 11.6% p.a. For conventional loans, KTDC would on-lend Bank funds to
sub-borrowers for up to 10 years, including a grace period of up to 3 years,
at an interest rate that would allow KTDC a spread of at least 2.25% (with an
average spread of 2.5%) to cover its credit risk. Thus, sub-borrowers would
be charged an interest rate of at least 13.85% p.a. KTDC's minimum spread of
1/   KTDC has also obtained, through MOST, UNDP funds of US$350,000 mainly
for training.
2/   It is currently envisaged that this will also include the 1.5% front
end fee.



- 35 -
2.25% would be slightly higher than the spread of 2% that has been uniformly
applied to previous Bank loans to financial intermediaries in Korea, such as
KDB, KLB and SMIB. However, such a higher premium is justified and acceptable
in light of the fact that, while these DFCs concentrate their lending activities
in the market phase of the product life cycle (para. 2.34) with loans made
mainly for hardware with substantial collateral requirements, the thrust of
KTDC's operations belongs to the pre-market phase where a sizable portion of
KTDC's conventional lending would be for software items with less or little
collateral security and hence carry more risk. With regard to conditional
loans, interest charges and spread would be included implicitly in the royalty
payments negotiated with sub-borrowers on a case-by-case basis. KTDC will also
be charged a commitment fee of 0.75% on the undisbursed portion of the loan.
KTDC will pass on such commitment charges to its sub-borrowers.
b.   Amortization Schedule
4.05       Bank loans to financial intermediaries normally have flexible
amortization schedules which correspond to the expected aggregate amorti-
zation schedule of the sub-loans to be financed. KTDC, however, represents
a special case. Aside from granting conventional loans, KTDC will gradually
expand its conditional loan operations (para. 3.19). On such loans, not
only will there be no fixed repayment schedule, but in fact on some loans
KTDC may receive no repayment at all, as royalties would basically only be
due from those sub-projects which are successful. Further, those sub-projects
for which conditional loans are requested will necessarily be those for which
the greatest risk is perceived by the sponsor. As a result, the expected
returns from KTDC's conditional lending operations may not in fact materialize
in the first 5 to 7 years. For this reason, and at the request of the
Government and KTDC, the Bank loan would be made for 14 years, including 5
years of grace.
c.   Free Limit on Bank Loan
4.06       Sub-loans in excess of the proposed free limit of US$300,000
equivalent will be reviewed by the Bank before approval.  Sub-loans under this
free limit will be reviewed ex-post. It is roughly estimated that, with the
free limit of US$300,000, Bank review would be required for some 20-30% of the
number of RD&E projects prior to KTDC-s approval. Also, since KTDC is a new
organization, it has been agreed that the first 10 sub-projects for conditional
loans and the first 5 for conventional loans will be reviewed by the Bank
before approval by KTDC, regardless of the amount of Bank financing. The
level of the free limit will be reviewed from time to time to ensure that the
Bank review an appropriate number of sub-projects prior to KTDC's approval.
d.   Sub-loan Size
4.07       To ensure that the proceeds of the proposed loan are spread over a
large number of sub-projects, sub-loans will normally have a ceiling of US$1.5
million equivalent per project. However, in exceptional cases, Bank financing
could exceed this ceiling; in such cases, the Bank would reserve the option of
reviewing KTDC's appraisal of the sub-projects in the field.



- 36 -
e.   Foreign Exchange Risk
4.08       In the case of conventional lending, the foreign exchange risk
on the Bank loan will be passed on to the sub-borrowers. With regard to
conditional loans, the foreign exchange risk will be automatically passed on
to the sub-borrowers, since the loans will be "repaid" in the form of royalty
payments based on sales, rather than fixed repayments.
C.   Procurement
4.09       The proceeds of the Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange
cost of imported and locally procured equipment, materials, consulting services
and training. Since KTDC's sub-loans would typically be relatively small
(about US$0.3 million equivalent on average) and used to finance a sizable
number of hardware and software items available from a limited number of
suppliers, procurement would be made through international or local shopping
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Consulting service will
be engaged in accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants
(August 1981).
D.   Disbursement
4.10       The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against (i) 100% of
documented foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment, materials,
services and training, and (ii) 60% of local expenditures 1/ for imported
goods purchased off-the-shelf in Korea or locally manufactured equipment and
materials. All contracts for local procurement below US$100,000 equivalent
will be disbursed against statements of expenditures (SOE). Related documents
will be retained by KTDC and made available for inspection by Bank supervision
missions. Contracts above US$100,000 equivalent will require full documenta-
tion. The SOE procedure is justified taking into account the particular
nature of RD&E projects, which normally involve small and numerous expenditures,
and the capability of KTDC and its auditors to maintain SOE documentation and
accounts and its close supervision, as a matter of necessity, of its RD&E
sub-projects. The Bank loan is expected to be fully committed by end-1984 and
fully disbursed by end-1986 (closing date December 31, 1986). The estimated
quarterly disbursements are given in Annex 4. This disbursement schedule has
been based on the estimated number of sub-projects to be processed by KTDC
through 1984, as indicated in para. 3.23, and on the assumption that sub-
project expenditures would be incurred evenly during a two-year period follow-
ing KTDC approval.
E.   Benefits and Risks
4.11      The project will foster the technological development of Korean
industry and fill an important gap in the Korean capital market. In supporting
indttstry's RD&E ventures, KTDC will put strong emphasis on sharing the risks
with project sponsors and thereby will influence and reinforce industry's
attitude towards further undertaking of RD&E activities. The financial
support provided by KTDC will have a catalytic and multiplier effect on
1/   Estimated to represent the foreign exchange content.



- 37 -
industry's RD&E investment necessary for the accelerated development of
industrial technological capability. In addition, with its knowledge of the
technological status of industry and technological trends through surveys and
studies, KTDC will be capable of assisting inlustry in identifying areas in
which it should focus its RD&E efforts. Also, through the process of
appraising and particularly supervising its RD&E projects, KTDC will induce a
measure of discipline, and hence increase the efficiency in industry's manage-
ment and implementation of RD&E activities. Finally, KTDC will promote a
closer link between industry and public research institutes, by encouraging
and financing projects sponsored by industry and carried out by these research
institutes.
4.12       The most important lesson from other institutions in the world
that are of similar nature to KTDC is that, for this kind of risk-sharing
financing operation to be successful, the institution must have autonomy and
a strong, independent and entrepreneurial management, and the ability to
attract and retain a competent and high-caliber professional staff. This
condition has been met in the case of KTDC, as demonstrated by the strong
support from the private sector and the high quality of the management team
and professional staff that it has assembled, and the sound legal framework
and operating policies and procedures that provide KTDC with the autonomy and
flexibility of a private sector organization.
4.13       Another aspect, that is also of critical importance to KTDC, is
the financial support that it requires during its early stage of operation.
Unlike most of its counterparts in the world, which are government-owned and
financed through government's annual budgets, the majority (60%) of KTDC-s
share capital is owned by the private sector. Due to the nature of the
risk-sharing business, a new company, such as KTDC, is expected to experience
losses of income during its initial years (5-10 years) of operations before
earning profits when its risk-taking ventures begin to yield returns.
During this period, KTDC should be able not only to withstand these losses,
but also to mobilize additional funds from various sources including the
capital market to continue and expand its operations. As such, the Govern-
ment-s firm commitment to provide KTDC with the necessary financial assist-
ance, such as equity contribution and loans, as well as funds to cover a
portion of KTDC's losses pertaining to its ccnditional loans (para. 3.04,
3.26 and 3.29) during this 5-10 year period would be crucial. The Government's
continued financial support to KTDC during this institutional building period
will be vital to KTDC as a viable and growing company.
V. AGREEMENTS
5.01       Agreements have been reached with the Government and KTDC that:
(a) the Government will exchange views with the Bank from time to
time on its industrial RD&E policies (para. 2.33);



- 38 -
(b) the Government will provide KTDC, during 1982-84, with
additional equity of Won 5 billion (para. 3.04);
(c) KTDC will raise additional equity of at least Won 2.5 billion
from private sources during 1982-84 (para. 3.04);
(d) KTDC will require enough royalty payments from its conditional
loans at least to provide for repayment of the principal amount
of the loans plus interest and other charges at the same
rate as applies to conventional loans (para. 3.08);
(e) KTDC will employ advisory services on a retainer or ad hoc
basis up to December 31, 1984, on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.16);
(f) KTDC will submit to the Bank by September 1, 1982, a
detailed training and expert invitation program (para. 3.17);
(g) KTDC will review with the Bank by the end of each year beginning
in 1982 the operational targets (conditional loans, conventional
loans, equity investments) to be met by KTDC during the following
year, and on the basis of such reviews, adopt such targets as
shall be-mutually acceptable to KTDC and the Bank (para. 3.19);
(h) KTDC will submit to the Bank its annual accounts, audited
by external auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the
auditors report within 4 months after the close of each
year (para. 3.22);
(i) the Government will provide KTDC, during 1982-84, with additional
loan funds and Government guaranteed KTDC bonds totalling Won 14
billion on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.26);
(j) the Government will provide KTDC with supplemental financing
(to cover losses on conditional loan operations over a limited
period of time) in a manner acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.29);
and
(k) KTDC will obtain Bank-s consent prior to contracting
any long-term debt(s), if such debt(s) would cause KTDC's
debt/equity ratio to exceed 4 to 1 (para. 3.34).
5.02       Based on the above agreements, the proposed project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$50 million equivalent. The proposed loan would be made
to KTDC and guaranteed by the Government. Retroactive financing of US$1.5
million of KTDC's sub-projects is also recommended (para. 4.03).

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR KTDC, 1981-1990
1.         The following assumptions are based on KTDC's estimates of its
various business parameters and the results :Lts investigative surveys of
Korean industry-s loan demands for RD&E subprojects in late 1980.
A.     KTDC-s Business Plan
2.         In its surveys, the average sub-project costs were estimated to
be about Won 200 million and Won 224 million in 1981 and 82, respectively;
and, KTDC expects that average RD&E sub-projacts size, thereafter would grow
by about 5% per annum, as industry accumulates experience in RD&E ventures.
Further, it was assumed that KTDC would finance about 70% of total sub-project
cost on the average. Taking these into cons:ideration, KTDC-s average
sub-project financing would increase over timne, as indicated below.

3.         During 1981-90, KTDC would finance about 1,600-1,700 RD&E sub-
projects originating from industry, or Won 330 billion in constant 1981 Won.
Indicative annual financing program is given below:

4.         KTDC would offer the following types of financial support:
a)  Conventional loans:  Regular loans, to be repaid under
predetermined conditions (interest rate, grace period,
repayment period);
b)  Conditional loans:  Special loans that generally do not
have to be repaid if the sub-project does not result in
sales revenues, but that require royalty payments from
sales if the sub-project is successful;
c)  Equity investments:  Equity participation in companies
set up to commercialize RD&E results.

B.     Composition of KTDC's Financing Operations
5.         KTDC would gradually expand, and ultimately specialize, in
conditional lending, as indicated below:
Financing Instruments as a Percentage of Total Approvals
1981   1982   1983   1984   1985   1986-87   1988-89   1990

6.         Conventional loans would have the following terms and conditions on
average:
(i)  Loan rate of 15.5% p.a.;
(ii)  Commitment fee of 1% p.a.;
(iii) Term of 7 years repayment inclading 3 year grace period;
(iv)  Bad-debt rate of 2% of the approved amount;
(v)  Disbursement pattern of straight line disbursement over
two years, i.e., 50% of loan disbursed each year.
7.         Conditional loans do not have a fixed repayment schedule.  The
return on conditional loans is in the form of royalty payments (a predetermined
percent of sales revenue) from successful sub-projects. All conditional loans
are amortized over a nine year period as losses occur, or as royalties are
realized. The royalty revenue from conditional loans is estimated on the
basis of:
(i)  sub-project failure rate of 30%;
(ii)  royalty rate of 5% of sales;
(iii) a number of forecasted sales profiles; and
(iv)  a frequency distribution over the above mentioned
sales profiles.



- 68 -                           ANNEX 3-8
Page 4
And, the following expected royalty revenue pattern in real terms is used for
the purpose of financial projection:

(in multiples of

a/ Taking into account the failures.
b/ Years after sub-project implementation.
Based on these royalty payments, KTDC would earn an annual rate of return
of about 10% p.a. in real terms on its conditional loans, on the average.
8.         The disbursement pattern of conditional loans is same as convent-
ional loans, i.e., two year straight-line disbursement.
9.         It will take some time (say 5 to 7 years) before KTDC's conditional
loan portfolio produces income. To strenghthen KTDC's financial position
during the early phase of its operation, the Government of Korea is committed
to provide additional funds to support KTDC's conditional loan losses on an
annual basis over a limited period of time (about 7 years). For the purpose
of financial projection, the Government is assumed to provide 50% of con-
ditional loan failures, i.e., 15% of conditional loans approved, as they
occur, i.e., four years after sub-project approval.
10.        Equity Investment:  30% of companies set up jointly by KTDC and
industry to commercialize RD&E results are assumed to fail. However, KTDC
would sell its equity interest on successful companies after four years
at about five times its original investment. Further, KTDC is not expected
to receive any dividend from those companies. KTDC would then earn about
5% p.a. annual rate of return on its equity investments, on the average.
