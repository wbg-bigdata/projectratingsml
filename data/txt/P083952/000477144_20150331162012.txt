F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
From the PAD: The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of
Nicaragua's broad based economic growth and poverty reduction plan by relieving
transportation bottlenecks that currently hinder economic growth and private sector
investment. The specific objectives are to support economic growth by: (i) expanding and
complementing the previous focus on trunk roads by improving a connecting network of
secondary and rural roads; (ii) helping ensure the sustainability of the road improvements,
through strengthening of maintenance practices, and (iii) institution building and technical
development in the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) and the Road
Maintenance Fund (FOMAV).

From the Credit Agreement: The objectives of the project are: (a) to improve the
Recipient’s transport infrastructure along selected main road corridors; (b) to improve
access to productive zones and to rural communities; and (c) to ensure the sustainability of
the road improvements carried out under the project.

The objectives in the Credit Agreement will be the basis of evaluation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1. At appraisal, Nicaragua was the largest country in Central America in terms of land
area and a population of around 5.4 million. The population was growing at an annual rate
of 2.7 percent, concentrated mostly on the Pacific seaboard and in the Central highlands.
Nicaragua had a small, open economy that depended heavily on trade and transport,
considering that its exports represented around 20 percent of its Gross Domestic Product
(GDP), while imports amounted to 42 percent of GDP. The country’s principal exports
were coffee, shrimp, lobster, beef, and sugar, which made the country very vulnerable to
commodity price shocks. Non-traditional products represented around 40 percent of total
merchandise exports. Nicaragua’s most important trading partner was the United States
(accounting for about one-third of the country’s total exports and imports), followed by
other Central American countries. Europe absorbed around 25 percent of Nicaragua’s
exports and supplied 10 percent of its imports.

2. With a per capita GDP of US$790 in 2004, Nicaragua was one of the poorest countries
in Latin America. It was estimated in the 2003 Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) that some 46 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, while 15
percent lived in extreme poverty. The incidence of poverty was more than twice as high in
rural areas (68 percent) as in urban areas (31 percent). While Nicaragua’s social indicators
were generally comparable to those observed in other lower-income countries, it stood out
for its relatively high population growth rate and low educational attainment levels.
Additionally, in October 1998, Nicaragua was struck by Hurricane Mitch, which caused
major human and physical damages, especially to the road network.

3. At the time of project preparation, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) designated
poverty reduction as one of its priorities, and endorsed the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) drafted in 2001. In doing so,
it took on a great number of challenges in 2002 as it inherited a rather difficult economic
situation and was forced to apply a number of strict measures in order to arrive at an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

4. The quality of Nicaragua’s road infrastructure was the lowest in Central America.
According to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MTI), in 2006, more than
75 percent of the total road network in Nicaragua was in poor condition. This reflected the
use of inappropriate design and construction standards, coupled with the inadequate
maintenance regime that resulted in premature road deterioration. These findings suggested
that poor road quality was the principal bottleneck in the transport sector. Nicaragua also
had limited transport modality choices. Its seaports were run down, the domestic air
transport system was in a nascent state of development, and its railroad system had ceased
to exist. The most important transport bottlenecks in Nicaragua therefore lie in the roads
sector.

                                             1
5. The MTI’s assessment of road network quality showed that poor infrastructure
condition was a major impediment to the creation of a sound and attractive business
environment for entrepreneurs, particularly in rural areas. It also reduced the capacity to
export (predominantly overland). Finally, low infrastructure quality affected transport
safety, even though the accident rate in Nicaragua was lower than in other countries at the
time. 1'

6. At appraisal, Nicaragua’s road network was total of 19,036 km, of which only about
2,299 km were asphalt-paved primary roads, while the vast majority consisted largely of
rural secondary or tertiary roads that were surfaced with adoquines (concrete
cobblestones) 2 or gravel (3,362 km) or dirt (13,374 km). Traffic levels varied widely, but
were generally in excess of 5,000 vehicles per day (vpd) on the trunk roads, and upwards
of 150 vpd on the secondary roads. The roads in poor condition included extensive
segments of the north-south trunk road (Natural Corridor) between the Honduran and Costa
Rican borders, as well as the east-west road linking Managua to the port of Rama. The
inadequate and/or malfunctioning transport infrastructure created a bottleneck for external
as well as internal trade, thereby limiting the competitiveness of exports as well as
discouraging the development of areas with agricultural potential. Overall, Nicaragua
remained the least well-endowed country in the region in terms of infrastructure, given that
only 22 percent of the population at the time had access to a paved road, and only around
20 percent of the network was in good or fair condition.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

7. The World Bank’s long-term engagement in the transport sector in Nicaragua since
1997 had helped to deepen the understanding of transport issues in the country and allowed
for the strengthening of the transport sector across the board. During the course of this
continuous engagement, innovative and low-cost road stabilization programs applying
adoquines were introduced and mainstreamed, and sound periodic and routine maintenance
policies were implemented. To address the issue of inadequate road maintenance due to
the lack of structured and well-funded program, the World Bank advised the Government
of the importance of such a program and provided seed funding to support the
establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV) under the previous Second and
Third Rehabilitation and Maintenance Projects 3. The establishment of FOMAV was a
good example of the synergies that have been developed between the Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) and the transport projects. The Government approved a law that
ensured that the FOMAV was financially self-sustainable in the long term. The operation
of the FOMAV and the involvement of the private sector in periodic and routine
maintenance via a public bidding process represented the key elements for an efficient

  With 2,131 accidents in 2000, Nicaragua had a rate of 0.4 accidents per 1,000 people or 1.4% per vehicle.
The worst countries in Central America for road safety are Costa Rica (17 accidents per 1,000 people or 13%
per vehicle) and Panama (16 accidents per 1,000 people or 14% per vehicle).

  Cobblestones are concrete-like paving blocks that are precast in an offsite factory location, with the raw
materials being cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, filler, and water.

complement the two previous Bank financed road projects, which would have allowed the
MTI to complete 630 km, or just over 50 percent of the National Development Plan
(Programa Nacional de Desarrollo, PND) target of 1,200 km of trunk and adoquin-
stabilized roads by 2009. The remaining roads were planned to be completed at the time of
appraisal by the projects financed by Central American Bank for Economic Integration
(BCIE) - 175 km, Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) - 135 km, Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC)-200 km, and the GON - 60 km.

9. The World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 4 for Nicaragua was discussed
and approved by the Board on August 4, 2005. The main objective of the CAS was to
support the Government’s programs for sustaining growth and reducing poverty, as
expressed in the Nicaragua’s National Development Plan. The provision of adequate road
infrastructure continued to be of primary importance for poverty reduction; hence, the
Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project was included in the International
Development Association (IDA) lending program. The project was categorized under the
Productive and Social Public Infrastructure area, especially in the targets related to the
sustainability of maintenance and improving rural access.

10. An Additional Financing (AF) for the project was included under the Progress Report
on the World Bank Group’s 2009 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 5 under Pillar II (pro-
poor investment in delivery of basic services). The AF was approved by the Board on June
1, 2010.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

11. The Project Development Objectives (PDO) stated in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) differ slightly from the one in the Credit Agreement. Given this discrepancy, the
Credit Agreement PDO is treated as prevalent for the purposes of this Implementation
Completion and Results Report (ICR). The original PDO as stated in the Credit Agreement
was the following: (a) to improve the Recipient’s transport infrastructure along selected
main road corridors; (b) to improve access to productive zones and to rural communities;
and (c) to ensure the sustainability of the road improvements carried out under the project.

12. As stated in the PAD, the PDO was “to support the Government of Nicaragua's broad-
based economic growth and poverty reduction plan by relieving transportation bottlenecks
that currently hinder economic growth and private sector investment.” The specific
objectives were to support economic growth by: (i) expanding and complementing the
previous focus on trunk roads by improving a connecting network of secondary and rural
roads; (ii) helping ensure the sustainability of the road improvements, through
strengthening of maintenance practices;, and (iii) institution building and technical

development in the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) and the Road
Maintenance Fund (FOMAV).

13. The original outcome indicators as presented in Annex 3 of the PAD were the
following: (i) increase in traffic volume and reduction in vehicle operating costs; (ii)
increased mobility for residents of rural communities; (iii) increased share of road network
in good and fair condition; and (iv) incorporation of improved management and planning
procedures by MTI and FOMAV. The outcome indicators as presented in the main text of
the PAD were: (i) reductions in vehicle operating costs and time savings along the road
corridors linking the productive zones; (ii) qualitative improvements to the network in
terms of the km of roads assessed as being in good, fair or bad condition; (iii) extent of the
participation of the private sector in road rehabilitation and maintenance programs as
measured in terms of the numbers and value of the contracts awarded; (iv) share of the
budget allocated for road maintenance; and (v) number of rural communities provided with
improved road access and generation of employment in all the components. 6

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

14. There were no changes made to the PDO. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that
there were some discrepancies in the way the PDO was set forth in the PAD itself between
the main text and the results framework, and between the PAD and the Credit Agreement.
The PDO given in the AF Project Paper is aligned with that stated in the Credit Agreement.
As such, this ICR presents the analysis and assessment of outcomes based on the PDO as
stated in the Credit Agreement.

15. Revised Key Indicators: At the time of Additional Financing approved on June 1,
2010, the following revisions to the PDO outcome indicators were made:

a) New PDO outcome indicator was introduced (indicator 5) to measure “share of rural
   population with access to an all season road” to monitor the improvements in
   accessibility of target population to road infrastructure in the country. This was a core
   indicator required for all IDA operations, referring to the number of people living
   within 2 km of an all season road;

b) Traffic volumes target for the PDO indicator “increase in traffic volumes and reduction
   in vehicle operating costs” (indicator 1) was increased from 460 vehicles per day (vpd)
   to 480 vpd, as the project closing date was extended by one year and the traffic was
   expected to increase further; and

c) The target value for PDO indicator “increased mobility for residents of rural
   communities” (indicator 2) was reduced from 500 bicycle daily traffic (bdt) to 300 bdt


6
  There are inconsistencies in the PAD between the list of PDO indicators in the main text (paragraph 22)
and Annex 3. The project team used the PDO indicators presented in Annex 3 for implementation status
reporting throughout the course of implementation, and hence the ICR analysis is based on the indicators as
presented in Annex3 of the PAD.

                                                    4
    as a result of projections obtained based on a sample of rural roads rehabilitated with
    adoquines.

16. The other two PDO outcome indicators remained unchanged.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

17. The PAD identified as the main beneficiaries those people living (within two km of an
all-season road) due to increased availability of economic opportunities, and the generation
of better access to markets and employment opportunities. The latter was expected to be
generated through the: (i) rehabilitation of trunk roads; (ii) rural road improvement through
Adoquines Community Modules (MCA) 7; (iii) periodic maintenance of roads that had been
previously rehabilitated; and (iii) creation of routine maintenance microenterprises,
administered by the FOMAV. The implementation of all project components was expected
to provide year-round high-quality access and improve mobility to about 400,000 people.

1.5 Original Components

18. The original project comprises the following components (as defined in the PAD,
approved by the Board of Directors of the World Bank on June 8, 2006):

Component 1: Road Rehabilitation and Improvement (US$10.13 million). This component
financed the rehabilitation and improvement of the following road segments: Diriamba-La
Boquita-Casares (32 km) principal road network; La Virgen-San Juan del Sur (19 km)
secondary trunk road in Zones I, II, and IV.

Component 2: Rural Transport Improvement (US$41.87 million). This component
included an adoquin stabilization program for approximately 320 km of secondary and
tertiary rural roads located mainly in Production Zones I, III, and IV.

Component 3: Road Maintenance (US$7.64 million). This component included provisions
for periodic (US$3.05 million) and maintenance (US$4.59 million) contracts. It was
expected that four additional microenterprises would be formed, for a total of 37
microenterprises, in order to cover the maintenance of 2,400 km of secondary trunk and/or
tertiary roads.

Component 4: Studies, Goods, Technical Assistance, Training, and Consultancy Services
(US$7.75 million). This component included consultancy services for project supervision,
financial audits, feasibility studies, preparation and updating of detailed engineering. It
would provide training and institutional strengthening to various MTI units for planning,
road safety, environmental, and social aspects (DGA- Environmental Directorate); and to
FOMAV staff for microenterprise management. The component would contribute to

  MCA modules are local entities formed under the leadership of local mayors, with each MCA staffed by a
board of five directors to perform a specific road-upgrading task. MCAs join together and use economies of
scale to hire an earthworks contractor and a cobblestone supplier. Individually, each MCA hires its own local
labor in order to construct a specified stretch of road. The MCA personnel receive technical support and
training from MTI from inception, and have an MTI supervisor and promoter accompanying them throughout
the implementation process.

(Pavement Management System) developed by the MTI’s Planning Unit.

1.6 Revised Components

19. Components 2, 3, and 4 were revised at the time of Additional Financing (AF),
approved by the Board of Directors of the World Bank on June 1, 2010. As a result, the
amended components were as follows: 8

Component 2: Rural Transport Improvement (US$81.44 million). Implementation of
restoration works for gravel or adoquin (concrete cobblestone) stabilization standards on
approximately 320 kilometers of secondary and tertiary rural roads, all within the existing
right of way. Due to cost overruns, the cost of this component increased and only 198 km
could be stabilized with the financing allocated under the original project. Additional
resources were allocated under the AF to this component to complete the remaining roads
out of originally planned 320 km.

Component 3: Road Routine and Periodic Maintenance (US$13.84 million). 1.
Implementation of routine maintenance works on approximately 2,700 kilometers of trunk,
secondary, and/or tertiary roads; and 2. Implementation of periodic maintenance works on
an additional 47 kilometers of selected main roads, in order to meet the established periodic
maintenance target of 80 kilometers of selected main roads, all within the existing right of
way.

Component 4: Studies, Goods, Technical Assistance, Training, and Consultancy Services,
as needed (US$7.58 million):

a) Monitoring the performance of project components; the management and supervision
   of civil works contracts; the design and implementation of training programs, technical
   audits, surveys on traffic origin and destination, transport sector reviews; building of
   the MTI’s capacity for technical, social, and environmental analysis; holding of
   workshops on road network decentralization; design and implementation of reforms to
   vehicle overloading regulations; building the FOMAV’s capacity for road maintenance
   management; and preparation of the implementation completion report on the project.
b) Design and supervision of the overall road maintenance program by contractors,
   including, inter alia: (a) training for: (i) the staff of the MTI and FOMAV; and (ii) the
   microenterprises, as required; and (b) the operation of FOMAV, including the design
   of promotional activities.
c) The improvement of the MTI’s planning and programming capacity, including the
   integration of environmental and social practices into the planning cycle.
d) The preparation of feasibility studies and detailed engineering for road rehabilitation,
   improvement, and maintenance works to be carried out under the project, and
   supervision thereof.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

20. The project underwent eight restructurings and received Additional Financing. The
first restructuring took place on October 10, 2008, at the request of the GON to reflect the
use of Force Account as an additional procurement method for the implementation of civil
works under the Project.

21. Increase in construction costs in Nicaragua led to the second restructuring on April 7,
2010, as due to high costs the funds available under component 2 could only finance 198
km of rural roads stabilization with adoquines instead of 320 km originally planned. Thus,
the intermediate indicator target for “km of rural roads stabilized” under the Rural
Transport Improvement component 2 was reduced from 320 to 198 km. At the same time,
the Borrower was requesting additional financing to achieve the originally planned target
and cover the financing gap, and the Bank team was underway to prepare the Additional
Financing. However, the financing was not confirmed at the time and the restructuring to
reallocate proceeds among categories was going ahead anyway; therefore, the Bank team
made a decision to reduce the target to ensure that the PDO and implementation progress
ratings were not affected while the AF was being requested.

22. Shortly after the project was restructured the AF was confirmed, and on June 1, 2010,
the Bank Board of Directors approved US$39.3 million equivalent to cover the existing
project financing gap, given the increase in construction costs due to worldwide price
escalation in oil and commodities. This constituted an IDA grant for SDR 21 million
(US$31.8 million equivalent) and IDA credit for SDR 5 million (US$7.5 million
equivalent). The project results framework was revised 9 and the closing date was extended
to December 31, 2012. US$14.3 million equivalent of the AF IDA funds were financed
through the pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) resources, with the following
distribution: US$7.5 million credit and US$6.8 million grant. Nicaragua’s economy at the
time was severely impacted by the global economic crisis of 2009; therefore, given the
nature of this project was considered as a response to the crisis, the CRW resources
benefitted the project in order to address the impact on the poor.

23. The project closing date was further extended two more times: (i) due to the delays in
the procurement of contractor for the road construction works on the Nueva Guinea –
Naciones Unidas section financed under the AF, the closing date was extended from
December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2014 (extension approved on August 14, 2012); and (ii) to
allow three additional months for using uncommitted US$2.3 million to procure adoquines
(concrete cobblestones) to be used on existing project sites and to procure vehicles for
supervision of works, the project closing was extended from June 30, 2014 to September
30, 2014 (extension approved on April 30, 2014).

24. Other restructuring included reallocation of proceeds among various categories to
allow efficient completion of the project activities, carried out on May 25, 2011, and June
5, 2013. The last restructuring took place on September 29, 2014, to cancel the undisbursed
balance under IDA Credit H5710-NI in the amount of SDR 1.7 million due to lack of

sufficient time to receive any procured goods before project closing date and given that the
project achieved its PDO and all results targets.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

25. Soundness of the Background Analysis. The project responded to an analysis of the
national context and reflected the experiences of previous well-performing projects, the
Second and Third Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Projects (P053705 and P068673
respectively), both with highly satisfactory performance. These projects have also been
noted as a success in the country and the Government considers the Bank to be a key
development partner in its effort to meet the country’s infrastructure challenges in the road
sector.

26. Like its predecessors, the Fourth Roads project continued to focus on key sector areas,
including investments in improving and expanding the trunk and rural road network
(including investments in the now widespread and highly successful stabilization program
for adoquines, or concrete cobblestones, and routine microenterprise maintenance
programs, which are unprecedented in geographical scope and build on local labor for
construction and maintenance); ensuring funding and sustainability of maintenance
schemes; and strengthening the sector’s institutional arrangements. Furthermore, the
project design incorporated lessons learned from previous projects and experiences from
similar projects in Latin American countries.

27. Adequacy of Government Commitment. The project enjoyed the strong support of the
GON, since transport was a high priority among other sectors, as reflected in Nicaragua’s
National Development Plan (PND) and in the CAS (ISN 2005) at that time. The GON
made clear its commitment to a strategy that emphasizes poverty reduction through broad
based growth and stressed the importance of improving road infrastructure and
maintenance in its key strategy documents. The GON commitment was further evidenced
by the (i) establishment of the FOMAV and the approval of the law to assure its reliable
funding, (ii) MTI’s interest to pursue the road network improvement based on the more
balanced approach followed under preceding Bank-financed projects which focused on
both the maintenance and rehabilitation; and (iii) financing requests made at annual-donor
conferences.

28. Assessment of Risks: the overall risk of the project was rated as Modest at entry. In
general, the project’s potential risks and the measures to mitigate them were identified and
incorporated adequately in the project design, which facilitated smooth project
implementation as well as the achievement of the project outcome envisaged at appraisal.
Though many risks were rated substantial or modest at entry, they were either mitigated
successfully or did not arise during implementation: (i) the risk of inadequate and
unreliable provision of counterpart funds flagged as substantial didn’t emerge as the
allocation of funding by the Government and the Municipalities for the MCA modules was
continuous; (ii) the risk that local contractors would perform poorly in the implementation
of the adoquines road stabilization program was found modest at design, but turned out to

                                             8
be low as MCAs acted as local entities formed under the leadership of local mayors and
included local staff to manage, supervise, and implement the adoquines roads program
successfully; and (iii) the risk that the MTI/FOMAV had limitations in managing an
expanded program of road maintenance by private contractors was rated modest, but turned
to be low, since FOMAV not only continued with the program but also created a greater
number of microenterprises to maintain the 3,200 km of the road network.

29. Assessment of Project Design. The project PDO as designed was clear and reasonable
and its outcomes were adequately attributable to the operation. The project objectives were
important for the country and sector and furthered the CAS (ISN 2005) and NDP priorities
by addressing the deficiencies of road infrastructure. The most extensive and growth-
crippling infrastructure bottlenecks in Nicaragua were in the road sector. The project
design was responsive to these priorities and supported the following actions for removing
these bottlenecks: (i) expansion of rural road stabilization programs with adoquines to
improve and expand further the paved road network; (ii) emphasizing maintenance by
setting up comprehensive maintenance programs; and (iii) boosting the productivity of
public and private investments through improvement of connecting networks of collector,
secondary and rural roads in targeted areas with high productive potential, and that have
large numbers of poor residents. The PDO was also consistent with the GON’s poverty
reduction rationale, since the MCA modules contributed to generation of employment
opportunities by empowering local municipalities and beneficiary communities through
the implementation thereof and enhanced mobility and accessibility of rural population to
an all-season paved road.

2.2 Implementation

30. Project implementation, including compliance with both the original project and its
AF, was satisfactory. Implementation was also rated satisfactory in all of the
Implementation Status Reports (ISR), and highly satisfactory in the last ISR. In general,
the project was implemented smoothly and efficiently by the MIT’s Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU), with the support of the different Directorates of the MTI (DGA, Financial and
Administrative Directorate (DGAF), etc.). The PCU had amassed considerable experience
through the implementation of several transport projects and developed an adequate
technical capacity in project planning, procurement and safeguards. It also provided
technical advice and shared knowledge with the MCA’s beneficiary municipalities for the
implementation of Rural Transport Improvement (Component 2) in safeguards, financial,
and procurement procedures. It is worth mentioning that there were some events that
occurred during the project’s life and delayed the implementation. These were as follows:

Factors outside the Control of the Government

31. The increase in construction costs in Nicaragua led to a project restructuring. A
worldwide escalation of oil and commodity prices resulted in an increase in construction
costs in Nicaragua following the project start-up. The analysis undertaken during project
implementation showed that all key cost drivers under Component 2 suffered major
increases between 2004 and 2009: cement (99 percent), adoquines (cobblestones) (50
percent), and transport costs (150 percent), among other factors. For this reason, the project

                                              9
was restructured in March 25, 2010, allocating most of the funds to Category 1 “works,”
reducing allocation of funds to Component 4 (Technical Assistance and Consultancy
Services). With the AF, approved in June 2010, Component 4 was given back the funds
reallocated under the restructuring in order to achieve the proposed intermediate outcomes
established at appraisal. In the end, the reallocation of funds did not at all affect project
implementation or the intermediate outcome targets.

Factors generally subject to Government Control

32. Change in the procurement method for earthworks services and the supply of
adoquines under the MCA prolonged the Project implementation period. The
contracting of MCAs required a special procurement method, which was confirmed and
agreed at appraisal. The initial procurement method for the MCAs was through price
comparison or shopping for both earthworks and pavement with adoquines. At Additional
Financing, the Bank team recommended that the contracting of earthworks and the supply
of adoquines be subject to a National Competitive Bidding (NCB) process at the municipal
level, due to high contract amounts, which were less than US$1.5 million per contract, and
due to the high demand of MCA modules, totalling 272 in all. The operational guidelines
and bidding documents were thus adjusted in order to: (i) ensure transparency and
competitiveness; and (ii) benefit from economies of scale, contract prices, and
administrative effort. As a result, the MCA implementation period was increased by two
to three months, on average, per module.

33. The AF introduced several changes to the project structure. These were: (i) partial
adjustments to the road sections included under Component 2 to ensure the consistency of
the overall package of works, as well as their economic, procurement, financial, social, and
environmental viability; (ii) revision of the institutional strengthening and capacity-
building program, respecting the main components defined under the original project but
reviewing the overall scope of activities to ensure that these continue to be relevant, given
existing institutional needs; (iii) reallocation of funds between components and categories,
to compensate for prior reallocations under the original project; (iv) slight modifications to
the financing plan; (v) reestablishment of the original intermediate outcome under
Component 2 (MCA modules) of 320 km of rural secondary and tertiary roads (which had
been reduced to 198 km after restructuring); (vi) adjustments to existing institutional
arrangements, particularly with regard to procurement, financial management, and
safeguards; (vii) incorporation of the project’s core indicator (number of rural people with
access to an all-season road) into the project’s overall monitoring and evaluation
framework; and (viii) allocation of funds under Component 4 for a new survey to update
the original baseline measure taken in 2000 by the Living Standards Measurement
Household Survey. The AF included a revision of the operational guidelines and
procurement plans to complete all works. To ensure sustainability of the MCA modules,
the AF also introduced the microenterprise maintenance system implemented by FOMAV.

34. Effect of the Additional Financing on intermediate outcomes. As shown in Table
1, the AF was needed in order to achieve the project original target values, as the project
restructuring only permitted to rehabilitate 198 km of rural roads stabilized with adoquines
instead of 320 km, and to intervene in only 33 km of road periodic maintenance, out of the

                                             10
80 km envisaged at appraisal. Also, it was required to continue with the institutional
strengthening and capacity building of both MTI and FOMAV staff.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35. Design. Project M&E was planned against the project results framework (formerly the
logical framework) designed at appraisal. The PDO outcome and intermediate results
indicators were adequately and comprehensively designed at appraisal from a technical,
social, and sustainability standpoint. The indicators were properly aligned with the PDO
and components, as designed and presented in Annex 3 of the PAD. The WB was proactive
to recognize during implementation that results framework could be further improved and
took advantage of the Additional Financing approved on June 1, 2015, to revise some PDO
level targets. Specifically, the PDO target of increased mobility for resident of rural
communities was too optimistic, with expectation of 500 bicycle daily traffic (bdt) on the
adoquines rural roads at project completion. Therefore, the WB modified the target by
reducing it to 300 bdt. It is also important to note that this indicator is more of an impact
indicator and hence should be measured three years after project completion to allow more
time to be fully realized and reach a higher target. Additionally, the WB incorporated the
fifth PDO indicator (share of rural people with access to an all-season road) to measure the
project impact on accessibility of target population to year-round road infrastructure. This
was a core indicator required for all IDA operations, referring to the number of people
living within 2 km of an all season paved road. However, the indicator was not assigned a
target value, and the baseline for the indicator was taken from the 2000 Living Standards
Measurement Household Survey results for the entire country. Although the indicator
would have provided a stronger evidence if it were confined to the project areas of influence
rather the entire country, it still provides an adequate measure of impact, and the project’s
contribution towards this impact is direct with 361 km of roads paved in the populated rural
areas.

36. The WB also took advantage of the AF to adjust the target values for a few other
intermediate indicators to ensure that the results framework was more adequate to reflect
the rapid implementation progress than expected at appraisal and the allocation of
additional resources under the AF. These included: (i) target for “Km of roads being
maintained (routine with microenterprises)” was increased from 2,400 to 2,700 km (the
actual value in June 2010 was reported at 2,573 km, already exceeding); (ii) the target for
“number of FOMAV and MTI staff trained in planning and mgmt courses” was revised
from 6 to 40 staff (in 2010 the actual was already at 26, exceeding the original target); and
(iii) the target for “share of road network condition surveyed” was raised from 33 percent
to 35 percent (by 2010, the actual value already reached the target of 33 percent). Other
changes introduced during the AF were amendment in intermediate outcome indicators: (i)
“Km of roads being maintained (periodic maintenance)” was added as a new intermediate
indicator for component 3; (ii) intermediate indicator under component 4 on “dissemination
workshops on project monitoring and evaluation” was rephrased to “number of training
workshops attended by MTI/FOMAV staff road” and its target was reduced from 6 to 4
workshops; (iii) component 4 intermediate indicator on “share of road network transferred
to Departmental” was dropped due to being no longer relevant and applicable as the
maintenance of classified road network was under full responsibility of FOMAV, and the

                                             11
local roads were already under the municipal management; (iv) the intermediate indicator
under component 2 was revised slightly from “Km of roads stabilized each year” to “Km
of roads stabilized (total)”, and its original target of 320 km was reinstated (it was reduced
to 198 km after restructuring due to cost overruns approved on April 7, 2010).

37. Implementation and Use. The MTI’s planning division was in charge of collecting,
analyzing, and reporting project performance indicators. It had a team that collected project
data indicators and performed the ex-ante economic evaluation at appraisal. The WB had
access to the data necessary to analyze performance and detect issues. The Bank used this
information to satisfactorily carry out the project’s restructuring and prepare the AF. The
results framework matrix was adjusted accordingly, especially at the appraisal of the AF.

38. Nevertheless, at the stakeholder workshop, there was an evaluation of the M&E
framework and it was found that despite the technical merit of the indicators, the
complexity of the performance measurements required is not commensurate with the
capacity of the PCU and other MTI Directorates to collect data and calculate the indicators
on a periodic basis. The preparation of the ex-post evaluation using HDM-4 and Red
Models at project completion also experienced some delays in providing the necessary
inputs to finalize the ICR’s economic evaluation. Going forward, the MTI and its
Directorates will be strengthened in the implementation of the M&E system to ensure that
indicators are adequately measured and reported on a regular basis. The follow-up project
will provide technical assistance to the MTI in M&E.

39. The WB carried out a non-experimental Impact Evaluation of the Rural Roads Project
on welfare and education in September 2013 to evaluate the project’s impacts. The
objective of the impact evaluation was to measure the beneficiaries’ change in welfare
outcome attributable to the project (the findings of this study are summarized in Section
3.2 and in Annex 10).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

40. Safeguards. Project preparation with regards to safeguard aspects was carried out in
accordance with Bank guidelines and reflected in the Project’s Operational Manual. Two
safeguards—Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Physical Cultural Resources
(OP/BP 4.11)—were triggered under the original project and were maintained under the
AF. The project was rated as a Category B. At appraisal, the MTI had acceptable manuals
for ensuring compliance with Bank safeguard requirements.

41. Project performance was consistently rated satisfactory for compliance with these
safeguard policies for both the original project and its AF. Furthermore, the MTI’s PCU
and the DGA satisfactorily applied the guidelines for the Road Rehabilitation and
Improvement, the Rural Transport Improvement, and the Routine and Periodic
Maintenance components. During implementation, the project did not involve any major
negative environmental impacts because it rehabilitated and maintained existing road
infrastructure, thereby not expanding into previously untraversed areas of high ecological
importance. Occupational health and safety standards were generally observed to be
satisfactory, construction sites were well maintained and borrow pits were for the most

                                             12
part, well rehabilitated. It is worth noting that the Bank provided extensive institutional
strengthening in environmental management to the MTI, the FOMAV, and at a municipal
level for the implementation of the MCA modules.

42. Social safeguards, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. These
policies were not triggered because no new roads were being constructed and the existing
roads were rehabilitated and maintained within their right of way.

43. Procurement. The special procurement method for contracting the MCAs was
confirmed at appraisal. Performance in this area was generally adequate, except for some
delays in processing and contracting the earthworks and adoquin supply by MCA staff.
These procedures took longer than expected due to a change in the procurement method
from three quotes to an NCB process. The World Bank provided active supervision and
training to MCA community staff and addressed these delays. For the AF, the World Bank
carried out an Independent Procurement Review of the project, and its findings were
incorporated into the operational manual and the guidelines for MCAs. In general,
procurement supervision, including ex-post evaluations and field visits, found no
significant deviation from World Bank policies under the Road Rehabilitation and Rural
Transport Improvement components.

44. Financial management. The financial management performed by the MTI’s DGAF
was satisfactory, since the General Directorate maintained in general adequate financial
arrangements and applied sound financial management practices throughout the
implementation of both the original project and AF. These included adequate internal
controls and the use of the Integrated Financial Management System (SIGFAPRO) module
to perform the reconciliation of accounts, track transfers and performance of MCAs,
providing useful and timely information for monitoring purposes by the MTI’s PCU and
the Bank. The DGAF has maintained qualified and experienced key operational staff,
adequate processes and procedures, and a satisfactory information reporting system
generally on time or with small delays in the submission of the IFRs to the Bank. Project
interim financial reports and financial audits were submitted in a timely manner. External
project audits were carried out on an annual basis, determining the adequacy of the
accounting system and internal controls by the MTI-DGAF. Audits presented had
unqualified opinions, although some internal control issues were identified. These issues
were addressed by the PCU.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

45. The transition arrangements for the post-project operations have been put in place in
terms of ensuring sustainability of the roads rehabilitated under the project. Currently, the
FOMAV maintains 3,200 km of trunk, secondary, and tertiary roads through 52
microenterprises. FOMAV is self-sustainable with a steady flow of internal resources
generated from the diesel and gasoline levies. The roads rehabilitated under the project
have already been included in the FOMAV operational plan. The FOMAV hires private
contractors via public bidding processes, which also represents a key element of an efficient
strategy toward the adequate provision of road maintenance, especially the roads
rehabilitated under the project. This well-functioning arrangements have been set in

                                             13
motion through the continuous dialogue during this and previous Bank financed project in
the road sector, including the establishment and institutional strengthening of FOMAV.

46. In addition, the satisfactory performance of the currently ongoing Bank-financed Rural
Roads Infrastructure Improvement Project (P123441 – IDA-50280 and IDA-H7440) is an
important factor attesting to the efficient mechanisms in place for routine and periodic
maintenance and the well-established capacity of FOMAV to date. The ongoing project
has also been focusing on the sustainability of the MCAs after the construction works are
completed by supporting FOMAV in training and engaging them in maintenance works of
rural roads.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

Rating: High

47. The relevance of the PDOs is considered high. The PDOs have remained aligned
with the country’s goal to improve economic growth and reduce poverty and with current
priorities of the GON. In Nicaragua, most of the poor live in rural areas and many in remote
communities where access to basic services is still constrained by very limited
infrastructure, including rural roads. The project was consistent with the 2005 CAS under
the productive and social public infrastructure area of the results matrix, especially in
regards to targets on the sustainability of maintenance and improving rural access.
Furthermore, improving road access for rural areas continued to be part of the GON’s
poverty alleviation strategy and was aligned with the key pillars of the CPS (2009). The
PDO remain consistent with the current CPS (2012) for Nicaragua, which emphasizes the
need for rural road rehabilitation and sustainable road maintenance programs among the
priorities.

48. The relevance of project design is rated high. Besides being in line with the
country’s priorities at the time of appraisal, the project investment components were
directly linked to the PDO and the intermediate outcome indicators. The lending
instrument was the Specific Investment Credit (SIL) and was found appropriate given the
successful approach of previous projects. The implementation arrangements were adopted
using the same institutional setup up as in preceding projects, which had proven to be
effective, highly relevant and ensured the continuity. In addition, the Bank team took into
account the changed circumstances – the increase in construction costs – and responded
promptly by processing an AF in June 2010. This action was highly relevant as it permitted
not only closing the financing gap and achieving outcomes that had temporarily suffered
due to cost increases, but also improving the results framework to ensure that the indicators
and their targets were aligned with the PDO and the components even more strongly.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: High (original) and High (revised)

49. Overall, the project has benefited more than 785,000 people (direct beneficiaries) with
the improved road sections, providing access for local populations to markets and services,
and bettering transit conditions and the reliability on the road network that is being
maintained throughout the country. The MCAs model with the predominant use of local
labor, materials, and technology, has also been highly successful in generating short-term
employment opportunities, enhancing technical and entrepreneurial skills, and fostering
community ownership of rural roads.

PDO 1: Improve the Recipient’s Transport Infrastructure along Selected Main Road
Corridors – High (original) and High (revised)

50. The selected road corridor improvements had significant impacts on the economic
welfare of the beneficiaries: rural populations (poor and non-poor), agricultural producers,
and transporters, as evidenced further (see Impact Evaluation Results). This was achieved
through rehabilitation of a total of 52 km (target of 51 km) of trunk and secondary roads,
exceeding the originally targeted 51 km. Given that most of the works were undertaken
with a focus on the productive regions of the country, this output contributed towards
attaining economic development and poverty reduction. (Annex 2 provides details on
outputs by component.)

51. The rehabilitation of La Virgen-San Juan de Sur (19.25 km of secondary trunk road)
and Diriamba-Casares-La Boquita (32.32 km of trunk corridor road) benefited the Rivas
and Carazo Departments and the municipalities of Rivas, San Juan del Sur and Diriamba,
respectively. The implemented works in these road sections have extended the life of the
pavement for an estimate of 20 years and the average roughness (IRI-International Road
Roughness Index) has been reduced from 8 in 2006 to 2.6 in 2014, exceeding the target of
3.5. This is reflected in major benefits in terms of reduction in vehicle operating costs and
increased average daily traffic from 380 in 2006 to 480 vehicles per day (vpd) at closing,
exceeding the original target of 460 vpd and meeting the revised target of 480 vpd.

52. La Virgen-San Juan del Sur road is the main link between key agricultural areas and
the Pan-American Highway, while Diriamba-Casares-La Boquita road connects one of the
country most important tourism area. In general, these road corridors are now in conditions
to better support connectivity with the productive regions of the country, as envisaged at
appraisal.

53. Thus, the project contributed to PDO 1 – improving the Recipient’s transport
infrastructure along selected road corridors – to high extent against both the original and
revised targets.




                                             15
PDO 2: Improve Access to Productive Zones and to Rural Communities – Substantial
(original) and High (revised)

54. By project completion, a total of 361 km of rural roads paved with adoquines had been
rehabilitated, exceeding the target of 320 km and providing access to productive zones and
rural communities, including access to the infrastructure-deficient Atlantic Region with a
new 24 km road section between Nueva Guinea and Naciones Unidas. The completion of
these adoquin-paved roads contributes to improving the country’s competitiveness and
export capacity of productive zones (main agricultural products: coffee, milk, beans, and
sugar cane). Now, with a faster and reliable access the products are delivered in better
condition, which is a critical factor for cattle and motion-damage-sensitive agricultural
produce.

55. The rural road stabilization with adoquines played an important role towards
achievement of the World Bank’s shared prosperity goal by providing access to rural
communities to a year-round high-quality access to a paved road. As a result, the project
contributed directly to the overall increase of the paved roads in the populated rural areas
with 361 km of paved rural roads, and hence to the increase of share of population living
within two km from a paved road, which increased from 28 percent at the time of AF to 38
percent at project completion, constituting 989,162 people. Although the indicator would
have provided a stronger evidence if it were confined to the project areas of influence rather
the entire country, it still provides an adequate measure of impact, and the project’s
contribution towards this impact is direct with 361 km of roads paved in the populated rural
areas. Moreover, it is accurate to note that 100 percent of population who were living
within two km from the project financed rural roads gained access to an all-season paved
road after the project.

56. Construction of adoquin-paved roads using the MCA model 10, a community based
approach for rural road works implementation, has provided a number of direct social
benefits to local people, such as: (i) generation of short-term employment opportunities in
the road construction; (ii) promotion of entrepreneurial spirit and development of technical
capacity at the local level; (iii) engendering ownership through the participation of local
mayors and residents during the construction stage; (iv) creating sustainability during the
operation and maintenance stage through rural microenterprises; (v) using of
predominantly local labor; and (vi) stimulating an opportunity for mainstreaming gender
into the adoquin construction process. Total of 12 contractors, private contractors and the
MTI’s public agency the Regional Highway Construction Agency (COERCO), completed
pavement of 107 km of rural roads with adoquines, and a total of 272 MCAs were formed
to complete the remaining rural roads with adoquines, together exceeding the original
target of total of 12 MCA/contractors.

57. Increased mobility of residents in rural communities. The improved riding surface
of the roads with adoquines generated non-motorized transport by means of bicycles. The
MTI reports that community residents started using bicycles when the road stabilization
was completed, and hence the bicycle daily traffic (bdt) has grown from near zero before

10
     Annex 11 provides a detailed description of the MCA approach adopted by the project.

                                                 16
the project to over 320 bdt, exceeding the revised (reduced) target of 300 bdt. As mentioned
earlier, the original PDO target of 500 bdt was too optimistic and thus was reduced (see
section 2.3 above). Non-motorized transport facilitation (bicycle traffic) is another
advantage of the road stabilization with adoquines over the gravel roads, which enables a
cost-effective modality for improving the rural mobility. (Annex 2 provides details on
outputs by component).

58. The MCA model is now one of the key pillars in the transport sector in Nicaragua due
to the strong results on the ground in terms of benefits from improved mobility, promotion
of economic development and shared prosperity.

59. The project achieved PDO 2 to high extent against the revised target for the number of
bicycle daily traffic and in regards to share of population with access to an all-season road.
Against the original indicator targets, the project overwhelmingly exceeded all original
output targets and provided benefits discussed above. However, given the project’s modest
contribution towards achievement of an original target for bicycle traffic, which was too
optimistic and notionally set at appraisal, the achievement of PDO 2 against original targets
is rated lower, i.e. substantial.

Specific Objective 3: Ensure the Sustainability of the Road Improvements Carried Out
under the Project - High

60. At project completion, the FOMAV carried out routine maintenance on 3,200 km of
roads, exceeding the revised (increased) target of 2,700 km, which included the 413 km of
trunk, secondary, and tertiary roads rehabilitated under the project. Routine maintenance
was carried out by 52 routine maintenance microenterprises. Under the project FOMAV
established 19 additional routine maintenance microenterprises, bringing the total number
of microenterprises managed and supervised by FOMAV to 52, exceeding the target of 37.
These microenterprises are providing sustainability not only to the road improvements
carried out by the project but also to the whole road network administered by FOMAV. In
addition, 95 km of roads underwent periodic maintenance implemented by FOMAV,
exceeding the end target of 80 km.

61. It is worth noting that the project supported improving FOMAV’s planning, technical
and financial capacity. Initially at inception, the FOMAV depended mainly on a small
annual government budgetary allocation and some financing from multilateral banks, at
less than US$2.4 million per year. After the amendment was approved in December 13,
2005, with the support of the previous Third Roads project, allowing FOMAV to receive
funding from fuel surcharges, the maintenance budget grew considerably. With the support
and continued sector dialogue carried out under the Fourth Project, a total allocation to
FOMAV reached US$46 million per year by 2014. This increased funding for maintenance
allowed reaching the target of 23.3 percent or 4,435 km of total classified 19,036 km
network being in good and fair condition, exceeding the target of 4,187 km or 22 percent
of roads being in good and fair condition proposed at appraisal.

62. In summary, the following activities supported by the project also contributed to the
successful achievement of this objective: (i) the continued approval of legislation for

                                             17
FOMAV’s funding via the tax levy of a surcharge on fuels (16 cents per gallon on diesel
and gasoline); (ii) the priority given to performance of periodic road maintenance by
private contractors and routine road maintenance by local microenterprises; and (iii) the
training and capacity building of the FOMAV staff and specific trainings provided in
various areas to microentrepreneurs. Both MTI and FOMAV fully adopted the use of
HDM and RED models in their road maintenance and development program, which
contributed to improving technical, planning and management capacity of the institutions.

63. Thus, the project contributed to PDO 3 – ensuring the sustainability of the road
improvement investments – to high extent.

Impact Evaluation Results

64. An impact study was carried out to estimate the impacts of average income and school
enrolment using both the simple DID-PSM (Difference-in-Differences with Propensity
Score Matching) model and DID-PSM with covariates, resulting with similar conclusions.
It is important to note that the DID estimator measures how much greater (or smaller) was
the impact of the rural road project on the treatment group compared to that in the control
group. A 2005 baseline and a 2011 ex-post evaluation were used (see Annex 10).

65. The main findings for income are that the project had a strong positive impact on the
total average income of the intervened municipalities. The simple DID matching showed
that on average, and holding all else constant, being part of the rural roads project increases
by 26.5 percent the monthly average income of the population of the intervened
municipality. This finding proved to be significant at the 90 percent confidence level.
According to simple DID regression, rural roads improvement increases monthly average
income by around C$861.96 (equivalent to US$34.25). Similarly, when the covariates were
added to the simple DID model; the impact increases and becomes significant at the 95
percent confidence level. According to this model, on average participation in the rural
roads project had a 28.5 percent positive impact on the average income of the population
in the municipalities where the project was implemented. Moreover, this model found that
rural roads improvement increases monthly average income by around C$876.80
(US$34.84).

66. When the income was broken down by gender, it was found that the project had a more
significant and greater impact on women’s income than on men’s. On average women’s
income in the intervened municipalities is estimated to increase 77 percent (according to
the simple model) or 82 percent (under the DID with covariates) due to the implementation
of the rural road project. In other words, due to the rural roads implementation women’s
monthly average income in the targeted municipalities increased C$1,125 (equivalent to
US$44.7) under the simple model and C$1,160 (about US$46.1) according to DID-PSM
with covariates. These results proved to be very significant. The impact on men’s monthly
average income was unclear. Nevertheless, men’s overall average monthly income
remained higher than that of women.

67. The study found no evidence that the project had a positive impact on school
enrolment. This result is contrary to what was expected. The study suggested that richer

                                              18
ex-ante and ex-post data is needed to investigate in more depth the possible reasons for the
findings; for example, using more disaggregated observations of the community of
household units, including information on interventions by other institutions, and
evaluating much longer-term impacts.

Split Evaluation of Outcomes

68. At the time of AF approved in June 2010, a restructuring was carried out to introduce
a new PDO outcome indicator and to revise targets of two PDO indicators (target for
Indicator 1: “Increase in traffic volumes and reduction in vehicle operating costs” was
increased from 460 vpd to 480 vpd and target for Indicator 2: “Increased mobility for
residents of rural communities” was reduced from 500 bdt to 300 bdt). Thus, the
achievement of outcomes has been evaluated against the original and revised targets before
and after the changes were made for PDO 1 and PDO 2 respectively (Table 1 below
summarizes the analysis).

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: High

69. Major benefits to the population were realized from the Road Rehabilitation
component through improvement of road condition on 32.32 km Diriamba – La Boquita
road section and on 19.25 km La Virgen – San Juan del Sur road section. Specifically, the
International Roughness Index (IRI) on Diriamba – La Boquita road section was reduced
from 10 to 2.3 and on La Virgen – San Juan del Sur road from 8 to 2.8, associated with
significant travel time savings and reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) on both
roads. The actual capital costs were US$200,000 per kilometre for Diriamba – La Boquita
and US$236,500 per kilometre on La Virgen – San Juan del Sur, with only the latter
exceeding the appraisal estimate by 18 percent.

70. Despite the cost overruns, the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) still remains
positive for both the Diriamba – La Boquita road section at 27.8 percent, and the La Virgen
– San Juan del Sur section at 46.4 percent. The Net Present Value (NPV) at 12 percent
discount rate for the section Diriamba – La Boquita resulted in US$9.1 million (based on
VOC and time savings), which is 37.73 percent lower than was estimated at appraisal but
still significantly viable. For the section La Virgen – San Juan del Sur the NPV is estimated
at US$18.18 million (based on VOC and time savings), which is significantly higher than
expected at appraisal. The higher than expected return on the La Virgen – San Juan del
Sur road can be explained by the rise of tourist developments in the southern region where
the section is located.

71. The benefits to the population realized from the Rural Transport Improvement
component through stabilization with adoquines and improvement of road condition on
361 km of rural roads were significant. Specifically, the IRI on these roads was reduced
from about 16 to 6.7, associated with significant travel time savings and reduction in VOC.
The VOC savings were more significant for heavy vehicles, which contributes to reduction
in production costs, which is one of the main objectives of improving rural roads.

72. At appraisal, it was estimated that improvement of 320.2 km of rural roads would
require a total investment of US$41.256 million, which would yield a NPV of US$48
million and an EIRR of 34 percent. However, the cost overruns and the addition of new
road sections resulted in the need of additional financing. As a result, despite the cost
overruns, the investment on 198 km under the original project yielded a positive NPV of
US$129 million and a EIRR of 54 percent, while the for the road sections under the
Additional Financing the ex-post analysis yielded a NPV of US$53.38, and an EIRR of 34
percent.

73. Although there were cost overruns, the economic returns were significant for the major
infrastructure components and have all been completed. Therefore, the efficiency is rated
high.



                                             20
3.4 Justification for the Overall Rating

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

74. Relevance. The relevance of the project objectives and design remains high and is
supported by the similar follow-up operations in the transport sector. The GON’s
commitment has been high at appraisal, additional financing and completion, and the
project objectives have been aligned with the priorities in the CAS (both 2005 and 2009)
and the National Development Plan.

75. Efficacy. The overall efficacy is rated high against the revised targets as evidenced by
the achievement of all the PDO outcomes, given the project: (i) improved transport
infrastructure along selected road corridors evidenced by the significant reductions in VOC
(as a result IRI decreasing to 2.5) and the major increase of traffic to 480 vpd; (ii) improved
access to productive zones and to rural communities through provision of additional 361
km of rural adoquin roads and thus contributing to the increased share of populations living
within two km of an all-season paved road and increased rural mobility with bicycle usage
reaching 320 bdt; and (iii) ensured the sustainability of the road improvements carried out
under the project with share of roads in good and fair condition increasing to 23.3 percent,
and the MTI and FOMAV fully adopting the HDM and RED models for managing road
network maintenance and development. Against the original targets, the aggregated
efficacy is also rated high considering, given that the project achieved or overwhelmingly
exceeded all original PDO outcome and output targets, except the original target for bicycle
traffic, which did not have any adverse impact on the PDO achievement and overall project
outcome.

76. Efficiency. The project efficiency is rated high as the economic assessment of the
overall investments yield high returns and all activities and outputs included in the project
were fully implemented and achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Impacts on Poverty, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

78. Impacts on poverty through job creation in rural areas. Employment-intensive
construction and maintenance offers the opportunity for the absorption of low- or semi-
skilled individuals, bringing into the employment fold normally employment-marginalized
groups like women and youths. The MCA model used local community labor, and was
very successful in generating short-term employment, enhancing technical and
entrepreneurial skills, and engendering a sense of community ownership of the roads.

79. The MCA model created 648,000 temporary jobs. Under the model, women’s
participation increased from 10 to 34 percent in board membership positions; and to 15
percent of the total employed. Besides creating job opportunities in the short term, the
MCAs were found to have contributed to technology transfer, skill building, and ownership
creation (Muzira and Hernandez de Diaz 2013. Thus, the MCA model has a great impact
on poverty reduction in rural areas (see Annex 11: Community Adoquin Model (MCA)

80. Gender inclusion. Component 2 of the project—Rural Transport Improvement—
included a cobblestone (adoquines) stabilization program for approximately 361 km of
secondary and rural roads, out of which 272 km were performed by MCA modules. These
MCA promoted the participation of female engineers, accountants, traffic controllers, and
field workers. Additionally, as a response to the request from families headed by women,
training courses for MCA activities were designed to recruit women and mitigate and
counteract cultural resistance to women working in road construction and maintenance.
With the assistance of the Bank team, the MCA approach was improved from previous
projects and appropriate guidelines were designed in order to incorporate and promote
women’s participation.

81. The MTI made significant efforts to provide equal opportunities for women in the
field. This was evidenced by the fact that women were recruited to act as presidents of the
MCAs, supervise works, work as treasurers, act as a traffic controllers, work as pavement
fillers, and, in a few cases, install the adoquines. This MTI policy improved management,
transparency, and performance of the MCAs executed during project implementation. This
was done by delegating the management to the municipalities and to the beneficiary
communities, transferring the funds to local MCA staff, and providing continued technical
support and training by UCP staff. Despite encouragement from the MTI and the project,
current participation of women in MCA totals just 15 percent.

82. The Bank carried out a Road to Agency study under the Umbrella Facility for Gender
Equality, which looked at the effect of women’s participation in road construction and
maintenance and in the promotion of rural economic activities on a women’s agency11. The
main conclusion of the study was that women’s integration into rural road projects

     “Agency” here refers to self-esteem, the ability for a person, or agent, to act for herself or himself.


                                                         22
enhances their agency, and thus, that projects should capitalize on this. The key internal
and external enablers of agency that emerged from the qualitative research are also
presented in this study. The countries included in the study were Argentina, Nicaragua, and
Peru. The project was taken as the case study for Nicaragua and a summary of the key
findings is presented in Annex 12.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

83. The project made significant contributions to the institutional strengthening of the
transport sector in Nicaragua. In particular, the project:

(a) Provided a Master’s Degree in Roads to both MTI (24) and FOMAV (2) staff members.
(b) Provided technical assistance for the strengthening of procurement, planning,
    operations, and environment to MTI and FOMAV staff members.
(c) Assisted in the development of the MTI’s new website upgrade by training 5 staff
    members.
(d) Improved the capacity to resolve social and environmental safeguards issues by
    training MTI (22) and FOMAV (18) staff members from the environmental and social
    units.
(e) Strengthened the capacity of MTI staff through the provision of a graduate degree in
    “designs, evaluation, and management of investments projects, with an emphasis on
    transportation infrastructure” to MTI (13) and FOMAV (1) staff members.
(f) Strengthened FOMAV’s capacity to monitor rural maintenance microenterprises based
    on the results payment indicator model, through consultancy services for
    improvements in the microenterprise system.
(g) Carried out training sessions for microenterprise staff on issues of public health, gender,
    the environment, and cooperation.

84. It is worth mentioning that the capacity-building provided to the FOMAV has been
satisfactorily implemented and its staff has considerably improved its operational capacity
in several areas, including: financial management, planning, road asset management, social
and environmental safeguards, reporting and monitoring, and economic evaluation using
the HDM-4 and Red Models, especially related to periodic road maintenance. A South-to-
South visit was also provided for the maintenance staff team, who travelled to Peru to learn
and share experiences under the microenterprises model. The FOMAV now has the
capacity to administer, supervise, and make payments to microenterprises based on the
results indicators scheme financed with project funds.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

85. MCA beneficiaries’ experiences and perceptions. A focus group was organized to
document the experience and perceptions of beneficiaries of projects carried out under the
MCA modality. It was directed at members of the board of directors of various MCA

                                             23
modules and included interviews with members of the PCU of the MTI-World Bank
project, as well as information collected from field visits. The focus group was carried out
in November 2012 at the MTI’s facilities. A total of 41 boards of directors’ members from
MCA modules participated from several road samples. The participants had a positive
perception of the MCA modules, mentioning the following key aspects: knowledge
transfer; creation of direct and indirect jobs; capacity building in entrepreneurship;
leadership skills; and the participation of local population in the engagement and execution
of works.

86. Stakeholder workshop. The project team carried out a workshop with stakeholders
on November 26, 2014, in order to obtain their impressions and lessons learned, principally
with key staff from the MTI, FOMAV, and UCP. This workshop had excellent results,
seeking to transmit the lessons learned by the MTI staff. These lessons will improve the
design of future transport projects in Nicaragua. The findings of this workshop are
presented in Annex 6, and the lessons learned are reflected in this ICR. The Workshop
Report is available in the Bank’s project files.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

87. The risk to development outcome is “Moderate”. At the end of the Fourth
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, Bank involvement had been through the financing
and implementation of several transport projects and as a strategic partner of the
Nicaraguan Government for more than 17 years, benefiting public transport sector agencies
and raising the expectations of the local communities with regard to the quality of the
transportation system, especially with the innovative MCA modules. Moreover, the MTI
and FOMAV have gained significant experience in planning, project implementation,
safeguards, road asset management, and economic evaluation. The FOMAV is currently
self-sustainable, covering more than 3,200 km with 52 microenterprises funded by taxes
levied on gasoline and diesel.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

88. Overall, the Bank’s performance during preparation and appraisal was satisfactory.
The project benefited from experience and lessons learned from previous projects. The
technical approach was continued along the same lines as in the previous Bank financed
projects by: (i) ensuring and emphasizing the sustainability of all road improvements; (ii)
providing capacity-building and institutional support; and (iii) incorporating financing for
routine and periodic maintenance programs, through the FOMAV, via microenterprises
and private contractors. Discussions and consultations with project team members during

                                            24
preparation improved the design and procedures of the environmental and social aspects of
the Rural Transport Improvement component, especially the operational manuals and
safeguard guidelines for the MCA modules. The MCA’s procurement strategy for
contracting adoquines and earthworks was also revised and changed to NCB, ensuring
greater transparency and efficiency at the municipal level. This change, moving away from
the three quotes methodology, was a plus in the execution of the modules.

89. The project was also designed based on the government’s development strategy and in
the framework of the CAS (ISN 2005) and donor transport strategy. In this respect, there
was a strong Bank effort to coordinate its interventions in the transport sector with ongoing
efforts from other international financial organizations, particularly the MCC, DANIDA,
BCIE, and the IADB, in order to finalize important key road sections located in productive
zones. The project’s institutional setup was the same: the MTI’s PCU, which had managed
previous Bank financed projects in a highly satisfactory manner. Quality at entry of the
original project is therefore rated satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

90. The Bank provided constant support to the MTI’s PCU and the FOMAV, and to the
various MTI departments, such as DGA, DGAF, and the Procurement Unit, in the
safeguards and fiduciary areas. The Bank team carried out multiple workshops and visited
these directorates, units, and FOMAV to ensure adequate project implementation. The
Bank also provided special training on the use of the HDM4 and RED models for economic
analysis to the staff of the Transportation Directorate of the MTI, as well as the FOMAV.
The Bank team carried out at least two missions per year, in which it directly met with the
MTI’s PCU staff members and other directorates’ staff, providing technical advice and
sharing knowledge. When needed, the Bank deployed specialists, particularly in the
procurement, environmental, and social areas.

91. The Bank was proactive in undertaking project restructuring due to cost overruns and
evaluating the need for additional financing to meet the targets envisaged originally at
project appraisal. The Bank also monitored the project’s Civil Works component, enabling
it to satisfactorily achieve the outcomes and outputs, successfully attaining sustained
results on the ground.

92. The Bank took the excellent initiative of obtaining financing from the Umbrella
Facility for Gender Equality to carry out a Road to Agency Study (see Annex 12 for
summary of study findings). The study measured the impact of the project’s road
interventions on gender agency, and reported satisfactory results for the actions taken with
regard to gender through MCA modules in the transport sector of Nicaragua and other
countries. The results of this study showed just how successful gender policies were under
the MCA model, compared to other road projects.




                                             25
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

93. Rating is considered satisfactory due to the Bank’s solid performance in ensuring an
adequate design at entry and high quality of supervision, particularly in the following
aspects: (i) proactive response to project restructuring and preparation of AF; (ii)
continuous training and monitoring in safeguards and fiduciary areas; (iii) development
and improvement of the MCA model through the promotion of gender strategies and
generation of employment at the community level; and (iv) achieving project results on the
ground and carrying out project road investments via microenterprises.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

94. Government performance is rated satisfactory. GON showed a firm commitment to the
project and its Additional Financing throughout the design and implementation stages. It
allocated sufficient counterpart resources to credit/grants operations and maintained the
flow of funds to FOMAV, which provides road maintenance to the rehabilitated road
network.

95. The project was also well-received at the municipal level. Local mayors were highly
pleased with the MCA modules. The project also attracted strong interest from community
groups and the local population because of its benefits in terms of community participation,
direct and indirect job creation, and gender strategies. In many communities, beneficiary
demand for these modules has exceeded project resources. Communities and municipalities
also contributed toward covering the costs of the works.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

96. The performance of the Implementing Agency -the MTI’s PCU- is rated highly
satisfactory, both in terms of its general institutional capacity and its effective management
of the project (technical, fiduciary, and safeguards). The PCU was committed to achieving
the project development objectives. The staff of the PCU showed a high institutional
capacity to handle project implementation, as well as providing solid coordination with the
DGA, DGAF, Procurement Unit, and the municipalities responsible for executing the
MCA modules. As a result, the project was well managed, and implementation issues were
solved promptly and adequately, including procurement and fiduciary responsibilities,
which were carried out satisfactorily. Relationships between the different stakeholders,
including the local municipalities and communities in charge of the MCAs, were smooth,
and the PCU was able to play a coordinating role among the different stakeholders in the
implementation of MCAs, executing more than 320 km of roads.

                                             26
97. The PCU managed and supervised the myriad MCA agreements between the MTI and
local mayors and selected local participants living in the vicinity of the road (there are
approximately 30 MCA contracts per 28 km of roads with adoquines). The use of specific
operational manuals and guidelines ensured consistency in the solutions proposed and
procedures to be applied by the PCU and its staff in the field. The MCA manual established
guidelines, organization, and functions, project cycle implementation phases, obligations,
and procurement, safeguards, and environmental procedures.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

98. The satisfactory rating of the Borrower and its implementing agency is justified on the
basis of the following: (i) a satisfactory record in implementing the project and achieving
its PDOs; (ii) the endorsement of key features of the project, namely the participatory
approach in MCA modules; the use of community participation; job creation through
modules and microenterprises for road maintenance; and (iii) the GON’s keen interest in
ensuring the continuity of subsequent projects in the transport sector.

6. Lessons Learned

99. The long term track record of the Bank’s engagement and coordinated efforts in the
country’s road sub-sector provides robust platform for well performing performance of
projects. World Bank’s continued presence in the transport sector helped to strengthen and
enhance supervision effectiveness and deepen understanding of road sub-sector issues in
Nicaragua. The Bank has had an active presence in the sub-sector since 1997 with
consistent objectives. This continued presence has allowed for the strengthening of the
transport sector across the board through the introduction of innovative road stabilization
programs and sound periodic and routine road maintenance policies involving private
sector participation through the FOMAV.

100.A functional Road Maintenance Fund is a key pillar for long-term sustainability of
the road sector. The creation, strengthening and supervision of a mechanism to finance
periodic and routine road maintenance works through private contractors has had a strong
impact in promoting long-term sustainability of the road sector and preserving the World
Bank financed investments. This mechanism was implemented as follows: first, preparing
and approving a Road Maintenance Fund law; second, establishing an official agency;
third, using World Bank’s seed funding for the first years of operation. In addition, carrying
out institutional strengthening to enable the commencement of routine maintenance by
private contractors and the building of public support for the FOMAV. Forth, amending
the FOMAV’s law to incorporate a reliable funding mechanism such as the tax levy of a
surcharge on fuels (16 cents per gallon on diesel and gasoline); and finally, securing MTI
support to strengthen the capacity of the FOMAV with resources from each subsequent
credit/grant agreements since its inception, to have the FOMAV fully functional.

101.Application of the innovative adoquines and MCA model is highly appropriate for
rural road improvements with emphasis on the poor regions. The MCA model application
is cost-effective and generates social benefits. The economic return of this road
rehabilitation method using adoquines reduced maintenance costs and enhanced the
participation of local municipalities, communities and private local businesses. It also uses
local technology and materials, supports bicycle traffic, and has a very low environmental
impact. The model has proved to be a very effective instrument to generate productive
short-term employment for skilled and unskilled workers from the communities, through
the mobilization of local resources (material, labor, and technology), expansion of
community and local involvement in planning and decision making, and the organization
of the municipalities and communities in addressing local needs. Most of the adoquines
roads built with previous Bank financed projects are still in use and in fairly good
conditions, acting as main communication road to the beneficiary municipalities. Thus, the
application of the MCA model provides accessibility, generates job opportunities and
improves living standards in the beneficiary communities.

102.Projects that promote women’s participation generate important benefits to the
recipient population. The project encouraged the participation of women in the
community-run adoquines paving tasks with the main functions of MCA’s presidents,
works supervision, treasurers, traffic controllers, and pavement joint fillers. During the
course of the project, employment for women rose by 15 percent. Besides these short-term
employment opportunities for women, the project contributed towards increased income,
technology transfer, skills building and community ownership creation, and to the
enhancement of their agency’s ability to make effective choices and transform these
choices into desired outcomes. Women participants in roads work and rural productive
activities reported increased self-esteem, self-confidence, decision-making capacity,
leadership and assertiveness, as a result conquering new skills and know-how and
participating in public spheres of community engagement. This initiative highlights the
importance of promoting women‘s genuine and active participation in project activities.

103.To encourage impact evaluations in transport projects, significant support and
assistance should be incorporated in the project design. It has proven to be strenuous to
include impact evaluation studies in the projects financed either by the Countries
themselves or by the multilateral community. The Borrower Countries usually have
difficulties visualizing or explaining to society the benefits of investing time and money in
such learning. The World Bank could actively encourage the borrowers to include impact
evaluation in projects by offering meaningful technical guidance or non-reimbursable
technical assistance to cover totally or partially the cost of the study.

104.Detailed operational manual and guidelines for implementing MCAs. Operational
manuals and guidelines for MCAs were essential tools for the successful implementation
of the rural road stabilization component. These guidelines required updates from time to
time based on module development and implementation in situ. The procedures and
guidelines must be accompanied by specific training, especially in the procurement,
environmental, social, and financial management areas, when dealing with decentralized
execution and semi-skilled workers in rural areas. The MTI staff adequately carried out the


                                             28
training of local mayors and local MCA staff. These elements should be considered in the
project design.

105.The use of Modulos Comunitarios de Adoquinado (MCAs) is a technically feasible
method that also provides a number of employment and skills building benefits. Through
the Project, the MTI promoted MCA, which involve the use of local labor-based methods
and residents as an alternative aimed at guaranteeing employment and empowering
beneficiary communities. The MCA model proved to: (i) create job opportunities in the
short term; (ii) contribute toward technology transfer and the building of technical skills;
(iii) engender a sense of community and ownership of the roads, with participation from
local mayors and residents, thus increasing sustainability; and (iv) present cost control
advantages, since beneficiary communities may make extra contributions (mainly labor) to
the works in order to stay within budget. Labor-intensive methods implemented through
the MCAs have proven to be technically feasible for a wide range of activities in the
improvement works for adoquin roads, and generally produced the same quality of product
as alternative road rehabilitation methods.

106.Creation of rural road maintenance microenterprises based on trained staff of
MCAs can help ensure sustainability of the model after the construction. One of the main
concerns in regards to the MCAs is the sustainability of the model once construction works
are completed. While the MCA workers have gained new skills transferrable to new jobs,
they can also be used for the maintenance of the rehabilitated rural roads. Rural road
maintenance is the responsibility of the FOMAV, which currently uses local people to
create road maintenance microenterprises. The FOMAV can form microenterprises using
the same MCAs that constructed the adoquin roads for the road maintenance afterwards.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      At appraisal the economic analysis for the original project included two
components a) Road Rehabilitation and Improvement and b) Rural Transport Improvement.
For the Road Rehabilitation component the evaluation was carried out using Highway
Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-3), which simulated life cycle conditions and costs
and provided economic decision criteria for multiple road design and maintenance
alternatives. With regard to secondary and tertiary roads (rural roads), the economic
analysis was developed using the Road Economic Decision Model (RED), which simulated
life cycle conditions and costs, and provided economic decision criteria for low traffic road
construction and maintenance activities.

2.     In April 2010, the project received Additional Financing (AF) in the amount of
US$39.3 million to finance the remaining civil works, which had not been completed due
to cost overruns resulting from the significant escalation of worldwide construction
commodity and petroleum prices, and the civil works on new added rural road sections.
An updated economic analysis was carried out for the existing and newly added rural road
sections during appraisal of AF using the RED model.

3.      The ex-post economic evaluation follows the two methodologies used for the ex-
antes in the original project and the AF.

Road Rehabilitation Component

4.      Significant benefits to the population were realized from the Road Rehabilitation
component through improvement of road condition on 32.32 km Diriamba – La Boquita
road section and on 19.25 km La Virgen – San Juan del Sur road section. Specifically, the
International Roughness Index (IRI) on Diriamba – La Boquita road section was reduced
from 10 to 2.3 and on La Virgen – San Juan del Sur road from 8 to 2.8, associated with
significant travel time savings and reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) on both
roads. The actual capital costs were US$200,000 per kilometer for Diriamba – La Boquita
and US$236,500 per kilometer on La Virgen – San Juan del Sur, with only the latter
exceeding the appraisal estimate by 18 percent.

5.      The ex-post analysis for the component was carried out using actual construction
costs, estimated maintenance costs and vehicle count survey (3 days 12 hours and 2 day 24
hours, December 2014). Despite the cost overruns, the Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) still remains positive for both the Diriamba – La Boquita road section at 27.8
percent, and the La Virgen – San Juan del Sur section at 46.4 percent, which compared to
appraisal estimates are 8.12 percent and 14.6 percent lower respectively, as presented in
Table 1 below.

6.     The Net Present Value (NPV) at 12 percent discount rate for the section Diriamba
– La Boquita resulted in US$4.06 million (based only on VOC) and US$9.1 million (based
on VOC and time savings), with the latter 18.65 percent higher than expected at appraisal,
and the former 37.73 percent lower than expected. For the section La Virgen – San Juan
del Sur the NPV is estimated at US$11.94 million (based on VOC) and US$18.18 million
(based on VOC and time savings), both significantly higher than expected at appraisal.
                                             35
7.     Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out considering a 20
percent increase in costs, and the same percentage of reduction in benefits, yielding an
EIRR of 24.2 percent considering the increase of costs and 23.4 percent if benefits are
lower for the first road section; and 40.9 percent and 39.8 percent for the second section in
the same order.

8.     Traffic Volumes. By 2014, the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) has
increased by 15 percent since 2006 on the Diriamba – La Boquita and by 123 percent on
the La Virgen – San Juan de Sur, representing an annual growth of 1.88 percent and 15.3
percent respectively. The AADT growth rate on the road section Diriamba – La Boquita
was 2.12 percent lower than the 4 percent growth rate expected; but the traffic growth on
the La Virgen – San Juan del Sur section was 11.38 percent higher annually than expected.

9.     This can be explained by the rise of tourist developments taking place in the
southern region where the La Virgen – San Juan del Sur is located.




                                                     36
Rural Transport Improvement Component

10.    At appraisal, it was estimated that improvement of 320.20 km of rural roads would
require a total investment of US$41.256 million, which would yield a NPV of US$48
million and an EIRR of 34 percent. As explained above, cost overruns and the addition of
new road sections resulted in the need of additional financing. As a result, of the 320 km
planned, 198 km were completed under the original financing and 163 km were constructed
under the AF, resulting in completion of a total of 361 km under the Rural Road
Improvement component.

11.    Significant benefits to the population were realized from the Rural Transport
Improvement component through stabilization with adoquines and improvement of road
condition on 361 km of rural roads. Specifically, the IRI on these roads was reduced from
about 16 to 6.7, associated with significant travel time savings and reduction in VOC. The
VOC savings were more significant for heavy vehicles, which contributes to reduction in
production costs, which is one of the main objectives of improving rural roads. The VOC
was reduced by almost 50 percent for cars, 55 percent for buses, 52 percent for light trucks,
and 49 percent for medium and articulated trucks (see Table 2 below).

12.     The ex-post analysis was carried out considering actual construction costs,
maintenance costs and the vehicle count survey data collected during the months of
December 2014 and January 2015 (5 day counts of 12 hours, and for some selected road
sections a 2 day count of 24 hours were conducted). The counts included all road sections,
except the small road section on Corn Island.

13.    Due to increases in construction costs, only a total of 198 Km were constructed
under the original project, nonetheless the investment yielded a positive NPV of US$129
million and a EIRR of 54 percent as presented in Table 3 below.

15.     Explanation of cost overruns for the adoquines stabilization. A detailed analysis
of cost overrun reasons for the adoquines stabilization was undertaken during AF, revealing
that on average, the transport, provision and laying of the adoquines (at 51 percent)
constituted the biggest percentage of the total cost. The cement treated base is typically the
next highest cost component (17 percent) followed by earthworks (15 percent), concrete
kerbs and drains (10 percent), cross-drainage culverts and other drainage structures (5
percent) and others (2 percent). Therefore, the cement (used in the preparation of adoquines,
in the cement treated base, in the concrete kerbs and drains, and in the cross drainage and
other drainage structures) was a major cost driving element. A more detailed breakdown
in the cost components of the adoquines provision and laying indicated that the purchase
cost of the adoquines contributed 60 percent to their total price; transport costs (of the
adoquines and sand) contributed 15 percent; the sand itself 3 percent; and others 22 percent
                                                 39
(labor, other related works). For the cement treated base, cement contributed on average
some 53 percent of the cement treated base costs.

Summary of Ex-Post Economic Returns

16.     Overall, the project financed activities have resulted in improved condition of road
infrastructure translated into benefits to the users in terms of travel time savings and
reduced vehicle operating costs. The following table summarizes the economic analysis
of the two main components. The overall ex-post NPV for the project, using a 12 percent
discount rate, has been estimated at US$209.9 million with an average EIRR of 40.5
percent.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      Background: On November 27, 2014, a Stakeholder Workshop on Lessons
Learned from the IV Rehabilitation and Maintenance Road Project was carried out a part
of the ICR’s project preparation, and attended by the staff of the MTI, PCU and FOMAV,
and the Mayor of the Municipality of San Francisco Libre. The results of the workshop
were incorporated throughout the text of the ICR and a report of the workshop is in the
project files.

2.     Objective. The objective of the workshop was to: (i) identify the positive or
negative factors that affected the project during implementation and (ii) to draw lessons
learned for design and operation of future projects.

3.      Methodology developed. The workshop’s methodology was divided into two
sections, the first for the identification of the positive or negative factors and the second to
share knowledge on lessons learned among participants. Based on an agenda previously
agreed, the dialogue tackled the implementation aspects/issues by component: (i) road
rehabilitation, (ii) rural road improvement (MCAs), (iii) road periodic maintenance and
(iv) technical assistance.

4.       For the lessons learned, the following areas of analysis were established: (i)
institutional framework, (ii) technical design, (iii) results framework, (iv) procurement, (v)
management of environmental and social aspects, (vi) monitoring and evaluation and (vii)
sustainability.

5.      Participants. The workshop was organized with the MTI’s PCU. About 26
participants attended the workshop, (4) from UCP, (16) from MTI – Department of Road
Conservation, DGAF, Procurement Division, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, Social and
Environmental Division-, (3) FOMAV, (2) MCAs, and (1) the Mayor from the
Municipality of San Francisco Libre.

6.      Results. The workshop was very successful in terms of a very active participation,
discussion and knowledge sharing. Results to highlight are: (i) excellent dialogue and
coordination among different units, departments and division of MTI, (ii) establishment of
a good team at UCP with technical capacity and organized by components, (iii) capacity
building to MTI staff, especially to the MCA’s technical group and good guidelines, and
operational manual, (iv) continuous training and support from the Bank team in the
safeguard area and on environmental and social aspects, and (v) support and technical
assistance to FOMAV staff through the project funds and Bank team.

7.    Lessons learned. The main lessons learned from the project, as perceived by the
MTI team, were:
   (i)     Consultation to stakeholders in every stage of the project cycle.
   (ii)    Due to unexpected or unforeseen factors - cost overruns- related to the cost of
           civil works, carefully study the project design cost estimate and allocate a
           percentage for unallocated funds in the credit/grants.

                                              44
   (iii)  Strengthen project teams in environmental and social safeguards to reduce risks
          during implementation.
   (iv)   Maintain a good communications strategy with the technical areas with MTI’s
          Directorates that are involved in the project implementation cycle.
   (v)    Develop Social and Environmental guidelines and operational manuals for
          implementing MCAs and provide workshops and training to the beneficiary
          community personal for rural road empowerment and ownership.
   (vi)   Consider a gender approach during the design phase of the project to guide
          participation and define the role of women in the work of MCAs.
   (vii) Continue with MCA modules approach as provider of short-term employment
          in the rural areas.
   (viii) Build and develop sound bidding documents to ensure success of the
          procurement process and selection of good private contractors.
   (ix)   Continue with the promotion of creating local routine microenterprises to
          generate permanent employment.
   (x)    Encourage routine maintenance through the creation rural road microenterprise
          based on trained staff at MCAs modules.
8.  These were the key elements mentioned during the workshop with MTI and
FOMAV staff. The complete workshop’s report is available in the project files.

Annex 10. Impact Evaluation Study

   I.      Introduction

Investments in infrastructure, especially in rural roads, have been an important part of the
World Bank’s strategies of fighting against poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Some
suggest that transportation infrastructure triggers economic development through
reductions in transport and a trade cost, which leads to upgraded access to markets, and
social services. Van de Walle (2008) added that it also fosters and improves agricultural
production, alters production decisions, stimulates off-farm diversification and other
income-earning opportunities, and encourages migration.

It is clear to most experts the importance that transport and rural roads projects have to
boost economic and social development. Notwithstanding, there is little empirical studies
that estimate the magnitude of its benefits. Most studies focus in doing before and after
estimations on the treated (intervened) units, still without accurate counterfactuals it is
likely that the results are not trustworthy. The assumption behind this “Naïve comparisons”
is that without the project implementation the outcome wouldn’t have changed - which is
a questionably a hypothesis (Andres et al, 2013).

As mentioned by Rand (2011) “although there has been a substantial amount of work to
evaluate the impact of infrastructure improvements on different socio-economic indicators.
Most of these evaluations have been qualitative in nature, maybe due to the large data
requirements and methodological difficulties faced when carrying out solid quantitative
assessments of infrastructure investments”. Nonetheless, this paper as well as other
innovative impact evaluations, uses robust econometric models to assess the real impact
rural roads projects have on their beneficiaries.

The main objective of impact evaluation of a program is to identify the extent to which the
program has changed outcomes of its treated subjects. In other words, impact of the
program on participants is measured by the change in welfare outcome that is attributed
only to the program (Cuong, 2011). However, one of the main obstacles in estimating rural
roads impacts is the problem raised by the non-random placement (endogenous placement
and self-selection bias) of the targeted areas of the project. Some authors such as Van de
Walle and Mu 2011, Ravallion and Chen 2005, Lokshin and Yemtsov 2005 have
successfully used a difference-in-difference approach in combination with propensity score
matching technique to control for initial conditions and time variant factors that
simultaneously influence the placement of roads and it subsequent growth rates. Similarly,
Khandker et al. (2009) use a fixed-effects regression method, with regression controls for
initial conditions (Rand, 2011).

This study follows a similar methodology to evaluate the impact that the Fourth Roads
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project had on monthly average income and school
enrollment in the intervened municipalities of Nicaragua, using year 2005 as baseline
period and 2011 as ex-post. A combination of 2005 Population and Household Census,
2005 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) and the Trimestral Household
Survey (THS), as well as statistics from the Ministry of Education were used as main
sources of information for the study.
                                            58
Due to the lack of more recent data, this study is focuses on the project’s impact two years
after the rural roads were done. This imposes a certain amount of limitations because
impacts in the very short run might be deceiving. For instance, Van de Walle (2011) on her
study of rural roads rehabilitation in Vietnam finds no effect on market frequency, service
availability and employment rate two year after the program was completed. Conversely,
she does finds significant impacts when reproducing the study four years after the project
completion.

      II.        Data

The data used in this study has been selected from the 2005 Population and Household
Census, 2005 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) and the Trimestral
Household Survey (THS) of the trimester October/December 2011 12 from the National
Institute of Development Information (Instituto Nacional de Información de Desarrollo –
INIDE). Additionally, the study used enrollment data from the Nicaraguan Ministry of
Education (Ministerio de Educación – MINED) of 2004 and 2011.

The main purpose of the study is to observe the impact that the rural roads project had on
welfare and human capital of its beneficiary municipalities. To capture these two
dimensions, the variables average monthly income and school enrollment where selected
as key dependent variables. Given data availability, 2005 (as ex-ante) and 2011 (as ex-
post) are the periods this report is based on.

Response (dependent) variables
Y1. Average Monthly Real Income: LSMS 2005 and THS 2011 served to estimate the
monthly average income of municipalities. Although these surveys are designed to be
representative at the national level, this is the closest available estimate of municipal
income. The sample size of each survey is 36,642 and 30,845 individuals, respectively.
The monthly income was estimated for persons of 10 years and above and it was distributed
by sex. This variable is not only monetary income, but it also includes income in species 13.
Given that income of 2005 must be comparable to that of 2011, both incomes have been
put into values of 2006, using the Nicaraguan Central Bank’s deflator 14.

Y2. School Enrollment: this variable was obtained from the 2005 Population and Household
Census and MINED for enrollment of 2011. Additionally, the data was distributed by sex.
Given that the sources of enrollment data ex-ante and ex-post data were not the same (due
to data availability), regressions using enrollment of 2004 and enrollment of 2011, both
from MINED, were also ran to prove robustness of the estimations.

Explanatory (independent) variables
All of the independent variables for ex-ante were selected from the 2005 Population and
Household Census, and ex-post from the 2011 THS. These variables were: total population,

     By income in species the study refers to the opportunity cost of any subside or agricultural goods that were used for personal
     consumption. For instance, if the interviewee received breakfast, books or uniforms from the Ministry of Education, estimations
     are made on how much they would have expended and those “savings” are accounted as part of their income.

      III.       Methodology

Impact evaluation methods seek to state whether a specific project had effects on its
beneficiaries, and that those effects can be attributed to the project itself and not to other
surrounding conditions. Many specialists have come to the conclusion that infrastructure
impacts, and especially rural roads, have multiple difficulties inherent in estimating the
magnitude of the effects attributable to the project.

Problems arise due to the endogeneity of much infrastructural development and the many
other factors that are at work (Binswanger et al., 1993; Jalan and Ravallion, 1998). “Not
allowing for initial conditions ─ both time-invariant and time-varying ─ and the way in
which infrastructure is allocated to specific regions will tend to bias impact estimates, often
downwards in poor areas. The most common criticisms of past impact evaluations of roads
are that they did not have appropriate comparison groups; that the results were not likely
to be robust to unobserved factors influencing both program placement, subsequent growth,
and outcomes; and that they did not follow projects long enough to capture full impacts
“ 17(Walle, 2008).

Moreover, another problem that affects this kind of estimations is the spillover effects.
“Infrastructure projects may have positive or negative externalities to neighbors. For
example, road projects can affect relatively wide geographic areas making it difficult to
identify appropriate comparison units. Choosing comparison units geographically distant
from treated units can minimize the spillover effects; however, this may risk that groups
differ substantially on important covariates. Failure to account for such spillovers risks
producing biased impact estimates” (Andres et al, 2013).

Therefore, a reliable evaluation methodology needs to correct for the potential sources of
selection bias through a careful selection of control or counterfactual observations.
Furthermore, given that roads may have dispersed effects on many factors, rich information
on conditions prior to the intervention must be available (Walle, 2008).

This paper intends to evaluate the possible impacts of improved rural roads on monthly
average income of individuals in a determined municipality and school enrollment of boys
and girls in Nicaragua. To do so, selection of appropriate control and treatment groups is
extremely important.

     Currently there are 10 indigenous groups in Nicaragua: In the Autonomous Regions of the Caribbean Coast they are Miskito, Sumo
     or Mayagnas, Rama, Garifuna, Creoles and Mestizos. While in the Pacific, Central and North of Nicaragua the Chorotegas,
     Cacaoperas, Nahoas and Xiu-Sutiabas are established. According to 2005 Census, around 9% of the population was considered to
     be indigenous.

Selection of treatment group
The IV Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, as already stated, started in 2006
and finished in 2011. However, not all roads          Figure 1. Interventions timeline
were done simultaneously. By the end of 100%
2009, 89.19% of the roads initially targeted                    89.19%
in the project already started their 80%
operations, but only 51.35% of them the 60%
works already ended (see Figure 2). Given                              51.35%
that the latest data available was the 2011  40%
THS, this study only focuses on
                                             20%
municipalities in which road works were
finished by the end of 2009. The idea         0%
behind, is to leave at least two years to        2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012

measure any possible impact that the project
might have on average income and school enrollment.

Selection of counterfactual (control group)
As mention before, selection of an accurate control group is essential in determining
robustness of the estimation results. To identify the municipalities that will be part of the
counterfactual, it is important to understand how the process of prioritization of the roads
to be intervened is done; given that such are not randomly selected. According to MTI, the
selection is done following three main factors: i) high poverty level, ii) dense population
and iii) high agricultural and economic potential.

Propensity score matching (PSM) 18 technique including the above mentioned factors as
well as other general variables was used to identify the municipalities that would serve as
control groups. The reasoning behind this technique is to find, from a large group of
nonparticipants, individuals (municipalities in this case) that are observationally similar to
participants in terms of initial characteristics not affected by the program. What this method
does is to create a probability model, in which given a set of observable characteristics it
will attribute a probability of each individual (municipality) to be selected as part of the
intervention (rural roads project). Participants are then matched, following different criteria,
with non-participant on the basis of these probabilities or propensity scores. For the
purpose of this study stratification or interval matching were used (refer to Box 1).

According to the findings of PSM model, 35 municipalities were selected as potential
counterfactuals and the balancing property was satisfied in all cases. Poverty rate,
percentage of people dedicated to agricultural production, and the dummy variable to
assess if the major of a municipality was from the same party as the Nicaraguan President
at the time, proved to be significant determinants of whether the municipality was going to
be beneficiary of the rural road project.

However, due to lack of follow-up data for all of these 52 municipalities (35 control and
17 treatment), impacts of rural roads on income where estimated on a subsample of 43
municipalities (dropping 4 treatment and 5 control municipalities. As for the estimation of

                                                             61
the impacts on school enrollment a subsample of 47 were kept (drooping 2 treatment and
3 control municipalities.

Nonetheless the balancing proprieties were met, and the difference in means in control and
treatment group was not statically significant (table 1, 2 and 3 shows the difference in
means of the main variables in the baseline period) 19 . Thus, confirming that the
counterfactual municipalities are relatively similar to those that were intervened.
Additionally, to prove consistency, the PSM was performed in different ways by excluding
one or more of the baseline characteristics, or exchanging variables to measure similar
aspects (population vs. population density). In all cases the results remained the same, and
the control municipalities remained constant.


     Box 1: Matching Participants to Nonparticipants – Propensity Score Matching

     Different matching criteria can be used to assign participants to non-participants on the basis of the propensity
     score. Doing so entails calculating a weight for each matched participant- nonparticipant set. As discussed
     below, the choice of a particular matching technique may therefore affect the resulting program estimate
     through the weights assigned:

     ■ Nearest-neighbor matching. One of the most frequently used matching techniques is NN matching, where
     each treatment unit is matched to the comparison unit with the closest propensity score. One can also choose
     n nearest neighbors and do matching (usually n = 5 is used). Matching can be done with or without
     replacement. Matching with replacement, for example, means that the same nonparticipant can be used as a
     match for different participants.

     ■ Caliper or radius matching. One problem with NN matching is that the difference in propensity scores for
     a participant and its closest nonparticipant neighbor may still be very high. This situation results in poor
     matches and can be avoided by imposing a threshold or “tolerance” on the maximum propensity score distance
     (caliper). This procedure therefore involves matching with replacement, only among propensity scores within
     a certain range. A higher number of dropped nonparticipants is likely, however, potentially increasing the
     chance of sampling bias.

     ■ Stratification or interval matching. This procedure partitions the common support into different strata (or
     intervals) and calculates the program’s impact within each interval. Specifically, within each interval, the
     program effect is the mean difference in outcomes between treated and control observations. A weighted
     average of these interval impact estimates yields the overall program impact, taking the share of participants
     in each interval as the weights.

     ■ Kernel and local linear matching. One risk with the methods just described is that only a small subset of
     nonparticipants will ultimately satisfy the criteria to fall within the common support and thus construct the
     counterfactual outcome. Nonparametric matching estimators such as kernel matching and LLM use a weighted
     average of all nonparticipants to construct the counterfactual match for each participant. LLM, in contrast,
     estimates a nonparametric locally weighted (lowest) regression of the comparison group outcome in the
     neighborhood of each treatment observation (Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd 1997). Kernel matching is
     analogous to regression on a constant term, whereas LLM uses a constant and a slope term, so it is “linear.”
     LLM can include a faster rate of convergence near boundary points (see Fan 1992, 1993).

Estimation models
For this quasi-experimental evaluation, two estimation methods were used: i) difference-
in-differences with propensity score matching (DID-PSM) and ii) DID-PSM with
covariates. The latter is one the most popular methods in impact evaluation designs 20.

The DID model assume that without the project’s intervention final outcomes of the
treatment group would have changed by the same amount as the control group. Therefore,
any deviation in the treatment group from the trend followed by the comparison group is
estimated as the projects impact. This model combined with PSM has proved to perform
well in comparison to an experimental benchmark (Cuong, 2011; Van de Walle, 2008;
Smith and Todd, 2005; Van de Walle and Cratty, 2002; Dehejia and Wabha, 1999).

According to Cuong, this method has two main advantages: i) it allows correcting for the
selection of the program based on unobservable time invariant variables (unobserved
heterogeneity), while at the same time controls for the observable characteristics of the
observations; ii) difference-in-differences with PSM can be regarded as nonparametric
method, which avoid the functional form assumptions invoked by parametric methods.

As previously mentioned, the first model is a simple DID-PSM estimator; that is given by
the following expression:

In this equation,  = 0 refers to period before the program was implemented and  = 1
period after the program execution. Similarly,  and  represent the respective
outcomes for the program participant and nonparticipants in period ; 1 = 1 denotes
presence of the program and 1 = 0 identifies the control municipalities at  = 1 .
However, before the DID estimator is calculated, the PSM is ran beforehand and the
municipalities that are out of the common support area are eliminated.

Thereafter, DID-PSM with covariates regression is executed. This model comes to
mitigate risks from the assumption that there are no time variant characteristics that affect
either the control or treatment group. The following equation shows how this model is
estimated:

                         = 0 + 1  + 2  +   ∙  +  Χ +  (2)

in the treatment group will be capture by β3.

To test for robustness, the study will include a difference in difference model with Fixed
Effects (FE). This design instead of using the ordinary OLS shown in equation (2) it adds
to control for unobserved and time invariant characteristics that may be influencing the
outcome variable. This model is particularly important given that the databases that are
being used do not include as many characteristics as they should and because the limited
number of observations that are being studied. (Box 2 shows a summary of other possible
impact evaluation designs).


  Box 2: Additional Methods to Impact Evaluations

  Instrumental Variable Method
  Instrumental variable (IV) methods allow for endogeneity in individual participation, program
  placement, or both. With panel data, IV methods can allow for time-varying selection bias. Measurement
  error that results in attenuation bias can also be resolved through this procedure. The IV approach
  involves finding a variable (or instrument) that is highly correlated with program placement or
  participation but that is not correlated with unobserved characteristics affecting outcomes. Instruments
  can be constructed from program design (Khandker et al, 2010). This method has been used jointly with
  DID proving to be very robust but at the same time very difficult to implement.
  Regression Discontinuity Method
  In a non-experimental setting, program eligibility rules can sometimes be used as instruments for
  exogenously identifying participants and nonparticipants. To establish comparability, one can use
  participants and nonparticipants within a certain neighborhood of the eligibility threshold as the relevant
  sample for estimating the treatment impact. Known as regression discontinuity (RD), this method allows
  observed as well as unobserved heterogeneity to be accounted for. Although the cut off or eligibility
  threshold can be defined non parametrically, the cut off has in practice traditionally been defined through
  an instrument. Concerns with the RD approach include the possibility that eligibility rules will not be
  adhered to consistently, as well as the potential for eligibility rules to change over time. (Khandker et al,
  2010).
  Pipeline Method
  Pipeline comparisons exploit variation in the timing of program implementation, using as a comparison
  group eligible participants who have not yet received the program. One additional empirical strategy
  considered by program evaluators is to exploit data on program expansion along a given route (for
  example, an infrastructure project such as water, transport, or communication networks) to compare
  outcomes for eligible participants at different sides of the project boundary as the program is phased in.
  This method involves a combination of pipeline and RD approaches that could yield interesting
  comparisons over time. (Khandker et al, 2010).
  Dynamic panel data
  In a situation where longitudinal data on households or communities is available for at least three periods,
  it may be possible to implement a dynamic panel data growth model to estimate the impacts of roads on
  income or consumption growth. It is more difficult to explore impacts of policy changes as it clearly
  raises the further concern that the changes in program placement are endogenous to outcome changes
  even when it is plausible that the initial assignment is exogenous (conditional on observable controls).
  Moreover, it is not common to find longitudinal data with at least three points in time and information
  on road access for a particular road project area that one wants to evaluate. (Van de Walle, 2008).

       IV.       Findings

To estimate the impacts of average income and school enrollment both the simple DID-
PSM model and DID PSM with covariates were performed, resulting with similar
conclusions. It is important to note that the DID estimator measures how much greater (or
smaller) was the impact of the rural road project on the treatment group compared to that
in the control group.

The main findings are summarized below:

Income
As expected, the project had a strong positive impact on the total average income of the
intervened municipalities. The simple DID matching found that on average and holding all
else constant, being part of the rural roads project increases by 26.5% the monthly average
income of the population of the intervened municipality. This finding proved to be
significant at the 90% confidence level. According to simple DD regression, rural roads
improvement increases monthly average income by around C$ 21 861.96 (equivalent to
US$34.25).

Similarly, when the covariates were added to the simple DID model, the impact increases
and becomes significant at the 95% confidence level. According to this model, on average
participation in the rural roads project had a 28.5% positive impact on the average income
of the population in the municipalities were the project was implemented. Moreover, this
model found that rural roads improvement increases monthly average income by around
C$ 876.80 (US$ 34.84).

When the income is broken down by sex, it is found that the Fourth Roads Rehabilitation
and Maintenance Project had a greater and more significant impact on women’s income
than those in men. As shown in table 4, on average women’s income in the intervened
municipalities is estimated to increase 77% (according the simple model) or 82% (under
the DID with covariates) due to the implementation of the rural road project. In other words,
due to the rural roads implementation women’s monthly average income in the targeted
municipalities increased C$ 1,125 (equivalent to US$ 44.7) under the simple model and
C$ 1,159.9 (about US$ 46.08) according to DID-PSM with covariates. These results
proved to be very significant. It should be noted that income on 2005 and 2011 are adjusted
to reflect those of 2006.

On the other hand, impacts on men’s monthly average income where unclear, thus the
results fail to reject the hypothesis that change on men’s income in the intervened
municipalities was the same as the change in the municipalities used as counterfactual.
Nonetheless, men average monthly income remained being higher before and after the
project, as well as in the treatment and control groups. In general, real income did follow
an uprising trend in all municipalities studied, according to Nicaragua’s economy grew
22% from 2005 to 2011. Figure 2 shows the difference among treatment and control groups
average real monthly income.

School Enrollment
As mentioned earlier, theory suggests that improved roads would have a positive impact in
school enrollment. This mainly because it is expected that transportation cost and time will
be reduced, facilitating access to social services such as education. Other authors suggest
that improvements of roads conditions and accessibility to education can lead to
enhancements in human capital, which then, in turn could translate into increases in
productivity and income (Broegaard et al., 2011).

However, both the simple DID-PSM model and with covariate showed ambiguous results.
In both models, the project seemed to have no clear impact among the treatment and control
groups (Table 5). Similar findings were obtained Cuong (2011), using the same DD with
PSM design for a rural roads project in Vietnam. Cuong’s study finds no statically
significant average effect of rural road access on the proportion of children attending to
primary school (Andres et al. 2012)

When comparing 2005 with 2011, it is found that enrollment among girls in both control
and treatment groups decreased. Initially, enrollment among the municipalities of the
counterfactual was greater than in the targeted municipalities. Although the gap between
                                            68
these two groups contracted, the change in enrollment attributable to the improvement of
road was not statistically different from the change that the counterfactual municipalities
experienced.

On the contrary, boys’ school enrollment in the municipalities intervened increased by 5%,
and in the control municipalities decreased 3%. Despite of that, impacts on boys’ school
enrollment remained not statistically significant. Similar to what was found in girls’
enrollment, the control group had a much higher enrollment rate than the treatment group
ex-ante. Although, this indicator experienced an increase, the gap remains high. Figure 3
shows the difference among treatment and control groups on school enrollment.

   V.      Robustness

To verify the consistency of these results, fixed effects (FE) model was added to the DID
with PSM design. Income and school enrollment are variables that are affected by a wide
range of factor, thus there is a high chance of omitted variable bias in the above presented
regression outputs. However, under the assumption that the variables that could not be
included in this study remain constant over the two periods, the fixed effect model helps to
correct for this bias .The assumption behind these models is to control not only for
unobserved time invariant heterogeneity but also for heterogeneity in observed
characteristics in a two-period setting.

As shown in table 6 the result of running fixed effect to the DID model were quite similar
from the ones shown in section V. In most of the cases in the (FE) with covariates, the
coefficients presented a slight increase. For instance, according to the previous model on
average, and holding other factors constant, the rural road improvement had a positive
impact, by increasing the average monthly income around C$ 1,270.5 of the people in the
treated municipalities. However, in the FE this impact was greater, around C$1362
(equivalent to US$ 54.11). Note that the difference relatively small, confirming the results
of the estimated impacts of the DID –PSM with covariates.

As previously mentioned, to prove robustness of school enrollment, the simple DID-PSM,
the model including covariates and the FE was run with the 2004 and 2011 enrollment data,
both from the MINED. It was found that the results were not statistically significant for all
cases, reaffirming the ambiguous effect the rural road project had on school enrollment for
boys and girls in Nicaragua.

    VI.     Conclusion and recommendations

Although, the majority of Nicaraguan household remain without access to paved roads,
this study finds that the Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance had a positive impact
on the welfare of its beneficiaries. Women’s income increased due to the effects of
improved rural roads, meanwhile, men’s income increased but the increase was not
statistically different from the increase in men’ monthly average income in the control
group. Nevertheless, the gap between men and women’s income remain high. On average,
men’s monthly income was 45% higher than that of women.

On the other hand the study found no evidence that the rural road project had positive
impacts on school enrollment. This result contradicts what theory suggests. However, most
of the impacts these kinds of projects have are likely to be heavily dependent on the
existence of complementary factors such as other social and physical infrastructure.
Physical distance to school is one of the major barriers to participation for children in rural
areas. However, although connectivity is improved by rehabilitation of rural roads, factors
such as efficient public transportation and number of school in the surroundings of the
intervened community play a key role in evidencing a real impact in school enrollment.
According to Van de Walle (2008), “in absence of such complementary factors, new or
improved roads may simply facilitate and hasten population out migration. That still
constitutes a benefit, but it is a qualitative different benefit and not (typically) the intended
one from a rural road project”.

After implementing a before and after methodology in the communities that were part of
the Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, Roughton International (2013)
found that in the intervened roads i) traffic increased on average 33%, ii) operation cost of
vehicles decreased 32.8%, and iii) travel time decreased 49.8%. Nonetheless, it was also
found that school infrastructure remained constant since 2006.

However, to investigate more in depth the possible reasons for this finding, richer ex-ante
and ex-post data is need. This paper was done having municipalities as observation units,
but more disaggregated observations – at community or household level – are needed to
enhance the robustness and credibility of the findings.

Although, using Living Standards Measurement Surveys result in a more economically
accessible option to elaborate impact evaluations. Geo- referential data is needed to identify
in a more precise matter the optimal counterfactual group. With the appropriate
methodology and rich datasets, more in-depth, detailed and credible conclusions of impact
evaluation may be reached and used by policy makers and donor organizations to design
the ideal development strategy that the country needs.

It is also important to evaluate the long run impacts that the Fourth Roads Rehabilitation
and Maintenance Project. As previously mentioned, this paper only evaluates the very short
run impacts (two years after the project was completed), however, it is crucial to estimate
whether these findings hold on a much longer term (four to five years after the project
completion). Some studies as such as Khandker and Koolwal (2011) and Van de Walle
(2011) found significant changes on the impact estimates, some were strengthen while
others attenuated.

Annex 11. Adoquines Community Modules (MCAs) 22

1. Community Adoquine Modules (MCAs)

The MCAs represent a community development approach for the construction of the
adoquine roads under a collaborative arrangement between a MTI, local mayors, and
selected local participants living in the vicinity of those roads. The MCAs are legally
constituted and accredited by the municipal authorities, which are co-responsible for work
execution. The Nicaraguan MTI and the World Bank started to implement this modality in
2004 through a pilot project with 32 MCAs contracted to pave 28 kilometers of roads with
adoquines.

MCAs under the Fourth Roads Project and its Additional Financing have paved a total of
over 361 kilometers. The length paved for individual road sections ranges from 1 to 27
kilometers with an average paved road section length of 7 kilometers. Execution with this
model is particularly fast once drainage and earthworks are completed, with a typical
implementation time of six months for a 5-kilometer section. There are no noted challenges
with paving long lengths, and the only restricting factor is the functional classification of
the road and extent of earthworks. All roads paved with adoquines under the project fall
into the secondary/collector road classification.

2. How the MCAs Approach Works in the Program

How the MCA approach works in the program was as follows:

First, the local authorities, in consultation with MTI, agree on the priority roads to be
evaluated at the national level for priority intervention. Once roads have been approved
into the project, a legally binding agreement is signed between MTI and the local mayor
describing the works to be undertaken and the modality to be followed in executing the
works. Afterward, the municipal authorities organize a meeting to call on community
members that meet the qualifications for particular posts to present themselves for grouping
into MCAs. The MCAs then duly undertake work in conjunction with the local mayors as
well as MTI. The ministry provides a promoter to carry out training of MCAs as well as a
supervisor who accompanies the MCAs throughout project implementation. Each
individual MCA attends to a road project with a maximum length of 3 kilometers
(originally 1.5 kilometers but ramped up to reduce administrative burden). Project size for
each MAC was established to mitigate fiduciary concerns, with each MCA having a
contractual ceiling of US$500,000. Also, the municipal authorities are jointly responsible
with the MCAs for the implementation of the works undertaken by the MCAs under their
jurisdiction. As such, the contract awarded to each MCA is signed jointly by MTI, as the
contracting party, and the mayor and the president of the MCA on the other hand (as the
contracted party). The MCAs in turn undertake their own contracting. For local labor, they
can contract workers directly or use subcontractors. However for earthworks and for the
supply of adoquines, MCAs working on the same road stretch jointly procure these services

group MCA contracts, the mayor(s) and presidents of all the contracting MCAs are the
contracting party and the earthworks contractor or adoquines supplier is the contracted
party. The contracting of the earthworks contractors and the adoquines suppliers follow
national competitive bidding procedures (contract amounts less than US$1.5 million) to
ensure transparency and competition. Any minor works (less than US$25,000) are
contracted on a shopping basis.

3. Organization and Functioning of the MCAs

a. Objectives of MCAs
The stated objectives of the MCA include the following: (i) to promote development at the
local level in different social sectors; (ii) to strengthen the organization and self-
management of the group; (iii) to develop projects with a social impact quickly and with
tangible benefits; (iv) to support the municipal administration for the benefit of the
community; and (v) to create temporary employment taking advantage of available local
labor.

The PCU developed together with Bank´s team the guidelines for the functioning of the
MCA are described in the Operational Manual of the IV Roads Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project of the MTI-World Bank MCA. The main contents of these guidelines
were the following: (i) structure of the MCA; (ii) contracting steps; (iii) standards and
procedures for financial management and reporting; (iv) guidelines for procurement
procedures; (v) internal regulations of the MCA; and (vi) functions of the board of directors
and accountant of the MCA.

b. Structure and Set-Up
Contractual commitments between the MTI and the Municipality are set out through a
signed agreement, wherein the responsibilities of each of the parties (MTI and
municipality) are defined, including an emphasis on the economic contribution expected
of the municipality to carry out the work.

The MCA, in coordination with MTI and the municipalities, is in charge of directing,
managing, and executing the adoquine pavement projects described in the agreement and
in the contract signed between MTI and the mayor’s office and the MCA legal
representative. The same states that the MCAs are responsible for execution, supervision,
contracting, and procurement of goods and services for the following pavement works: (i)
earthwork; (ii) pavement structure; (iii) minor drainage works; and (iv) signage (vertical
and horizontal).

c. Strengthening of the MCA
The PCU and MTI (UCP-WB-MTI), in coordination with the MTI General Directorate of
Financial Administration, is responsible for supporting the MCA and mayoral office
personnel involved in the project so that during project execution the personnel carry out
their work efficiently, transparently, and in an orderly manner.

Once the MCA is contracted, the PCU carries out training for the board of directors, the
MCA accountant, and mayoral office personnel involved in the project. The training is

                                             74
divided into three basic areas: (i) organizational aspects, (ii) physical implementation
aspects, and (iii) financial management aspects.

MCA Monitoring
The UCP-WB-MTI supervisors and project liaison monitor the MCA’s physical and
financial execution to ensure quality and compliance with established norms until MCA
completion.

4. Cost of Paving with the MCAs

Figure 1 shows a historical comparison of the costs of paving a road with adoquines in the
Nicaragua roads project depending on the modality of construction. All costs have been
adjusted to 2012 US dollar prices.

                                      Economic Cost/km (2012 US$)



At an average economic cost of about US$262,000 per kilometer, the MCA modality works
out to be the cheapest way to construct the adoquine roads. Not surprisingly, the modality
with private contractors at an average economic cost of US$386,000 per kilometer (47
percent more expensive than the MCA cost) works out to be the most expensive. The force
account option falls midway between the two. This may be surprising given that
traditionally a force account arrangement is more costly than outsourcing works to the
private sector. The difference arises from the fact that the force account in Nicaragua is
provided by COERCO, which is well organized throughout the Nicaragua region and
operates on commercial principles.

On a cautionary basis, these results should not be interpreted unreasonably. It is obvious
that the private contractors have higher overhead costs to factor into their costing including
all nominal salaries and benefits of staff, other administrative and home office support
overheads, and margin for profit to stay in business. These overheads do not feature in the
cost structure for the MCAs, except insofar as the MCAs need to provide compensation
and other mandatory legal benefits for workers during the project implementation phase.
According to MTI, one other mitigating circumstance in cost reduction through MCAs is
the saving in the waste/loss factor for handling of the adoquines, with private contractors
                                                  75
operating at 7 percent while MCAs operate at only 1 percent. The present discussion is
useful only to document that paving with MCAs is an economically viable alternative.
Project experience in Nicaragua has also shown that with the right due diligence in place,
quality and pace of execution are not compromised by opting for the MCA alternative.

5. Employment Opportunities Under the MCAs

Unemployment is a serious and growing problem in many developing countries. Paid work
has the potential to provide people with a route out of poverty. Even when temporary, the
opportunity for employment may provide workers with a boost that takes them out of their
previous unfavorable economic condition, leaving them with new skills, new self-belief,
and possibilities of further opportunity. The construction and maintenance of road
infrastructure has long been viewed as one of the most promising sectors for large-scale
pro-poor job creation. The International Labour Organization uses the term employment-
intensive for such scenarios, which it defines as the optimal use of labor to reach maximum
effect on employment, while paying due regard to cost and quality issues. Employment-
intensive construction and maintenance offers the opportunity for the absorption of low or
semi-skilled individuals, and bring into the employment fold normally employment-
marginalized groups like women and youth.

Through the Fourth Roads Project (and its AF), 8,922 temporary jobs were created during
the period 2007 to 2012 under the MCA model. Table 1 shows only the direct jobs created
for MCA board directors and direct workers for the MCA model. If the whole project
employment numbers are to be taken into consideration, the results would need to
incorporate the employment supported for private contractors on asphalt rehabilitation and
periodic maintenance road contracts, private contractors on adoquine roads, workers
supported under the force account, private earthworks contractors, adoquine manufacturers,
other suppliers, and transporters. If these numbers are taken into consideration, the number
of jobs created is estimated to be almost doubled (about 18,000 total direct jobs created).

  Note: AF = Additional Financing.

The total amount of money spent on the MCA roads only in the Fourth Roads Project and
its AF is about US$49 million. With this information, and assuming a conservative 10,000
jobs created for the MCA model in total (including ancillary jobs on earthworks contracts,
adoquine suppliers, and transporters), the employment generation effect of the MCA model
works out at 204 direct jobs per US$1 million of investment or 68 annualized direct jobs
per US$1 million investment. This is in line with the findings of Tuck, Schwartz, and
Andres (2009), which noted that about 40 jobs are created per US$1 million for
                                              76
infrastructure capital investment projects. However, as expected, it is short of the estimated
200 to 500 annualized direct jobs created for every US$1 million spent in rural road
maintenance projects.

Since the employment drastically falls upon road construction completion, the
sustainability of the employment effects can be sustained in one of three ways: (i) workers
use the skills gained to obtain similar construction work in the project area or other locality;
(ii) workers gain entrepreneurial spirit and skills and invest earnings in new business or
opportunity, either individually or as part of a group; and (iii) workers get assimilated into
routine maintenance microenterprises since the roads will need to be maintained after the
road construction. The last option is currently being explored by the maintenance agency
FOMAV in Nicaragua.

6. Mainstreaming Gender in the MCAs

In Nicaragua, management and labor in the infrastructure construction sector have
historically been predominantly a male domain with men particularly taking up the bulk of
the labor provision. This trend has been changing in recent years as women graduate with
civil engineering degrees and related qualifications. However, cultural barriers still prevent
the full incorporation of women in this sector, specifically in labor-intensive activities.

It is obvious that there are a number of gender-related issues and impacts surrounding rural
road projects. For one, the peculiarity of rural contexts lends itself to a situation where
women may not have a strong voice, especially in male-dominated cultures (Caballero and
Alcahausi 2007). Also, women have an unnecessarily heavier transport burden than men,
and are more likely than men to travel for health and education purposes. They spend
considerable time waiting for transportation and are unduly affected by delays or costs in
accessing emergency, obstetric, and postnatal care (World Bank 2010a). Being thus
affected by transport decisions and policy, women have an integral role to play in rural
infrastructure development. For the adoquine roads projects, their participation to date has
been integral to ongoing and completed project successes.

MTI has made significant efforts to provide equal opportunity for women in this field. This
can be evidenced by the fact that women are often recruited to be the presidents of the
MCAs, supervise the works, work as the treasurers, act as traffic controllers, work as
pavement joint fillers, and, in a few cases, place the adoquines. Also, as Table 4 shows,
women’s participation in total has been increasing from the 10 percent in the original
Fourth Roads Project to 15 percent in the AF (to September 2012), where 20 percent of the
labor forces was women.

On an even more positive note, over the course of the Fourth Roads Project, 33 percent of
the overall board positions for the MCAs—including both principal office holders and
members—were filled by women (See distribution by role in Figure 2).




                                              77
                 Figure 2: MCA Board of Directors Positions by Gender




    Source: Information provided by UCP and MTI.

For the board of directors, the post of president was split, with 72 percent men and 28
percent women. Men occupied 93 percent of board secretary positions; the secretaries act
as the site foremen of the construction work, a job historically dominated by men. A
majority—58 percent—of treasurers have been women. It is heartening to note that such a
high percentage of the sensitive treasurer positions have been occupied by women in the
absence of any quotas or mandates. For the post of board member one, responsible for field
oversight, the predominance is again men, with 76 percent. In the case of board member
two, who acts as the stock keeper, occupancy is more balanced, with 46 percent women.

Under the follow up project, actions are being undertaken on the following gender-related
themes of interest:

•   Gender impact evaluation: this reviews the impact that women have had on project
    design, implementation, and success (quality, cost, time).
•   Gender user satisfaction surveys: these will solicit the views of women in implemented
    projects to learn how they have benefited from project initiatives.
•   Gender monitoring: progress on women’s integration into projects is monitored and
    evaluated and deliberate efforts are made to increase this percentage.

7. MCA Beneficiaries Experiences and Perceptions

A focus group was organized to document the experiences and perceptions of beneficiaries
for projects carried out under the MCA modality. It was directed to members of the board
of directors of various MCA and includes interviews with members of the UCP of the MTI-
WB project as well as information collected from field visits. The focus group was carried
out on Wednesday, November 14, 2012, in MTI facilities. A total of 41 members of the
boards of directors of the MCAs participated from the following sample road sections:
Telpaneca–Quibuto; Camoapa–Boaco; Santa Lucia–Boaco; Santa Cruz–Balgue;
Moyogalpa–La Flor; Cuyalí–Abisinia, and Cuyalí–Las Cruces.

The participants in the focus group and the personnel interviewed have a positive
perception of the projects executed under the MCA modality. The main positive aspects
mentioned by the participants include the following:
                                           78
•   Knowledge transfer (the majority of MCA contracts were awarded to a recent
    engineering graduate or to university seniors who gained new skills and knowledge that
    will serve them in the working world).
•   Creation of direct and indirect employment, including inclusion of youth in formal
    labor.
•   Capacity building in entrepreneurship and leadership skills (more specifically, the
    presidents, and other members of the board of directors develop an interdisciplinary
    profile that allows them to enter into the labor market with an added value or create
    their own business).
•   High local population participation and engagement in the execution of the works.

8. Opinion of the Beneficiaries about the MCA Modality

In order to gather information on beneficiaries, various adoquine roads were visited.
During the visit to the road section Telpaneca–Quibuto, there were positive opinions of the
target population and the municipal authorities with regard to the adoquine MCA model.
Among the key benefits noted by the beneficiaries are the resolution of transportation
issues and the generation of both direct and indirect employment.

The visit to Telpaneca–Quibuto coincided with the inauguration of this road section, in
which the mayors of Telpaneca and San Juan del Río Coco Laguna participated, as did the
population of the neighboring communities: Los Lirios and El Pericón y Apaguique.
During the inauguration, satisfaction with the construction of the project road was
expressed by members of the community.

In a visit to the road sections of La Subasta–Camoapa, San Benito–Urban Area Camoapa,
and Rancho Rojo–La Calamidad (road section one), a meeting was held with municipal
councillors, who expressed their satisfaction with the adoquine program. These officials
were of the view that the MCAs should be used to execute urban projects that the Camoapa
Municipality is planning (MCAs should be constituted as microenterprises). They also
highlighted the importance of the adoquine road sections that have benefited the population
of Camoapa’s estimated 53,000 inhabitants. In particular, one beneficiary noted,
“Agricultural production has increased because various roads now join the productive areas
of the livestock sector, considerably reducing transport times to the two important milk
collectors in Masiguito and San Francisco.”

In separate user satisfaction work, a resident and beneficiary of one of the adoquine
pavement roads put the impacts more clearly on herself and on others related to her with
the following words: “I'm glad I got to see this project come to fruition. I normally travel
with fear on the bike with my husband, since the road gets very slippery with the rain.
However, now that you are working on the road, things are improving….My grandchildren
go to school. However, when the road is impassable, the bus cannot pick them up, and they
have to walk the long distance to school. Things will get better when the road is improved.
It will also be good to improve the quality of service of buses when the road is completed”.

Formation of MCAs is based on the selection of local labor, for which MTI works closely
with the mayors of each municipality, convening with the community and using records of
the unemployed in the area and in the communities surrounding the location where the
work is to be performed. The municipality must make an announcement to the community
to fill the Occupational Sheets, in order to assess availability of the existing workforce. The
people selected to form the Board, with the support of the Municipality and MTI will then
constitute a Board of Directors to serve as representative of the module for construction of
pavement in their municipality. The Board then subcontracts the remaining workers who
are going to be part of the MCA.
