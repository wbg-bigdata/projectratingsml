Section I.
Procurement of Goods and Works
 
Part A:
International Competitive Bidding

Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall be procured under 
contracts awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in 
Sections I and II of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" 
published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines), and in accordance with the 
following additional procedures:
(a)
When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity period, 
such period may be extended once, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph 2.59 of the Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to complete 
the evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and clearances and award the contract. The 
bid validity period may be extended a second time only if the bidding documents or the 
request for extension shall provide for appropriate adjustment of the bid price to 
reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of extension. 
Such an increase in the bid price shall not be taken into account in the bid 
evaluation. With respect to each contract made subject to the Bank's prior review in 
accordance with the provisions of Part D.1(a) of this Section, the Bank's prior 
approval will be required for: (i) a first extension of the bid validity period if the 
period of extension exceeds sixty (60) days; and (ii) any subsequent extension of the 
bid validity period.
(b)
In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with this Part A, the 
Borrower shall cause to be used the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the 
Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary 
for the purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have 
been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall cause to be used bidding documents based 
on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with the Bank.

For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish

shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only 
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts

to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account 
(or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount
