MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Argentine Republic for the equivalent of US$210 million to help finance
municipal development in 13 provinces of Argentina. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years including 5 years of grace. Proceeds of the
loan would be onlent to the participating provinces, who would in turn onlend to municipalities.
Background
2.    The municipal public sector in Argentina is large and growing rapidly. Municipal
expenditures currently represent about 3.5 percent of GDP, and transfers from the provinces to
the municipalities have doubled since 1991, increasing from US$1.4 billion to US$2.8 billion
in 1993. These provincial to municipal transfers represented about 1 percent of national GDP
and 11 percent of total provincial spending in 1993, ranking second only to salaries. Argentina's
current macroeconomic strategy ensures that the importance of the municipal public sector will
continue to grow.
3.   The Government of Argentina's macroeconomic strategy is founded on efficient,
equitable, and fiscally responsible federalism. Thus, responsibility for the provision of many
services has been decentralized to the provinces which, in turn, have decentralized services to
municipalities, if they can provide the service more efficiently. The growing responsibilities of
the municipalities mean that improvements in the efficiency, equity, and fiscal discipline of the
municipal public sector are increasingly urgent and important issues in the overall
macroeconomic strategy of the country.
4.    The municipal sector's development objectives are primarily linked to enhanced resource
mobilization for needed public investments and increased public sector efficiency to reduce
deficit financing and inflationary pressures. An effective way to meet these objectives is to
transfer, to the maximum extent possible, the full financing burden for public investments and
recurrent costs to their direct beneficiaries. By doing so, municipal governments may contribute
substantially to national macroeconomic objectives.
5.    To effectively mobilize resources, municipal governments must improve their capacity
to plan, program and budget for capital improvement programs, as well as for operation and
maintenance of facilities. The three key issues that must be addressed are how to: (a) achieve
greater predictability of, and control over, the volume of annual transfers to the provinces and
municipalities; (b) achieve better public responsibility for the resources transferred; and (c)
encourage provincial and local government efficiency reforms in areas such as planning,
budgeting and financial programming.



- 2 -
6.    The above issues and objectives are all linked to the issue of accountability. The
provincial-municipal transfer systems are often neither transparent nor predictable, and
sometimes have the effect of rewarding poor fiscal performance. The result is limited incentives
for provincial and municipal authorities to confront their citizens with the costs of their
preferences.
7.     Argentina suffers from a large infrastructure deficit, which has adversely affected the
quality of the urban environment and the productivity of economic activity. Estimated potential
demand for municipal infrastructure in the 13 proposed provinces is currently US$1.3 billion.
A pilot Municipal Development Project was approved in 1988 (Loan 2920-AR) and was designed
primarily to help municipalities mobilize resources to meet demands for municipal infrastructure
in a sustainable and fiscally sound manner. This first operation has been highly successful, and
is expected to be completed on schedule by mid-1995. The proposed project would be an
extension of the first project, with similar conditions and development objectives.
8.    As requested by the Government, the proposed project would be carried out in 13
provinces (Buenos Aires, Catamarca, C6rdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, La Rioja, La Pampa,
Mendoza, Misiones, Neuquen, Santa Cruz, Santa Fe and Tierra del Fuego). A similar project
would be implemented simultaneously in the remaining provinces with IDB financing. In the
four largest provinces (Buenos Aires, Mendoza, C6rdoba and Santa Fe), the Bank and the IDB
would have complementary municipal infrastructure financing, with the Bank financing
subprojects costing up to US$2.0 million and the IDB financing those costing more. Both
programs have been closely coordinated and would be consistent in their respective terms and
conditions.
Project Objectives
9.    The project's general objective would be to contribute to more effective public sector
management at the provincial and municipal levels through improved financing mechanisms for
municipal investments. It is also designed to achieve more effective fiscal federalism by
strengthening the municipalities' capacity to assume the responsibilities being transferred to
them. Specific objectives would be to: (a) mobilize external and internal resources in a fiscally
responsible and non-inflationary manner to financejustified municipal investments - particularly
those contributing to productive activities; (b) strengthen municipalities' capacity to plan, finance
and execute cost-effective capital improvements; and (c) strengthen the institutional capacity of
municipalities and provinces to manage their resources more effectively and to increase the
efficiency of service delivery.
Project Description
10.   The project would consist of three main components:
(a)   the provision of basic municipal infrastructure (81 percent of total project cost),
primarily small and simple investments designed to achieve an adequate and
efficient level of municipal services;



- 3 -
(b)   a program  of institutional strengthening (6 percent of total project cost),
primarily in key areas such as municipal finance, management, planning,
administration, and the quality of municipal service delivery; and
(c)   project administration, monitoring and auditing (13 percent of total project
cost), including semi-annual project performance reviews and annual financial
audits.
11.   Eligibility criteria for provinces, municipalities, and subprojects would assure that the
above components contribute to the project's objectives. Provinces would have to be in
compliance with the fiscal conditionality established in the Provincial Development Project (Loan
3280-AR) and have a transparent revenue sharing (coparticipaci6n) law, satisfactory to the Bank,
that transfers sufficient funds from provinces to municipalities to guarantee municipal loans. All
municipalities would be eligible to participate in the institutional strengthening component of the
project. In order to receive credit for financing municipal infrastructure investments, however,
municipalities would have to meet creditworthiness criteria (current account equilibrium and
debt capacity). These criteria reward municipalities in provinces with better transfer systems,
since municipalities in these provinces could have higher current revenues (own-source plus
automatic revenue sharing) and higher debt service capacity, hence, greater access to project
funds.  Given the potential demand for basic infrastructure financing, this could induce
municipalities to work with provincial governments to improve the municipalities' share in the
provincial revenue-sharing systems.
12.   Subproject eligibility criteria would be defined in the Project Operations Manual (POM)
so as to ensure that: (a) incremental resources mobilized through the project would be used in
a fiscally responsible and non-inflationary way; (b) participating municipalities would be
financially strengthened; and (c) subprojects would technically, economically, financially, and
environmentally sound. Cost recovery is essential to all three of these criteria. A fundamental
condition would therefore be that at least 65 percent of the total cost of the aggregate
investments in a municipality in a given year be recovered from payments to the municipality
by direct beneficiaries (e.g., betterment levies, connection fees, user charges, sales, concessions
and rents).
13.   In order to maintain effective implementation, the bulk of the Basic Municipal
Infrastructure component would be for relatively small municipal investments, such as street
paving, public lighting, and small extensions of water and sewerage systems. Preference would
be given to such smaller investments, the processing of which would follow simplified evaluation
and review procedures.
Project Implementation
14.   Implementation arrangements would essentially follow those used for the first project,
with responsibilities for execution concentrated in each of the provinces' Provincial Executing
Units (PEUs). The PEUs would be supported by a Central Coordinating Unit (CCU) with
limited control functions. The main functions of the CCU would be to facilitate (but not control)
the work of the PEUs, to manage the Special Account, to handle prior review request, and to
act as a focal point for the necessary interaction with the Bank (e.g., disbursement requests,



- 4 -
prior review requests, audit reports and progress reports). It would also review, and provide
an independent opinion on, the semi-annual performance reports provided by each participating
province. The only "regulatory' function of the CCU would be to review the processing of
larger and more complex investments, and oversee the provincial institutional strengthening (IS)
programs.
15.   Bank funds would be onlent by the Borrower to municipalities (through the respective
provinces) according to conditions and procedures defined in provincial Subsidiary Loan and
municipal Subloan Agreements. There would be no Central Government counterpart funds
under the project. Municipalities would cover all costs of their infrastructure and most IS
expenditures, and provinces would cover their own IS programs and a portion of the
municipalities' IS programs if necessary. The vast majority of the contracting procured under
the project would be from the private sector.
Project Sustainability
16.   Based on the experiences of the first municipal development project, municipalities are
expected to be fully capable of repaying the borrowed funds. Nevertheless, repayment would
be guaranteed through the revenue-sharing (coparticipaci6n) funds to municipalities controlled
by provinces. Strict eligibility criteria would be applied regarding cost recovery, and only
subprojects with a reasonable probability of success would be accepted. In the five provinces
which participated in the first Municipal Development Project, these criteria have been
incorporated into institutional practices. The recovered monies would flow into revolving
municipal development funds for future expansions of this program as an interim means of
providing for capital investments until municipalities are able to access capital markets on a
competitive basis.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement
17.   The first Municipal Development Project for Argentina was a pilot project covering five
provinces. To make it operational in the economically and financially unstable environment
prevailing at the time of approval (1988), it was designed with only a few, simple yet effective
fiscal conditions. Despite a slow start caused by the macroeconomic conditions of 1988-1990,
the project is now expected to be completed within the original time frame and to accomplish
its objectives. The project has been successful in contributing to the fiscal performance of the
participating municipalities, in providing useful operational experiences, in introducing Bank
policies and procedures, and in building a strong pipeline of subprojects in the participating
provinces. The experiences and the lessons learned in these five provinces were used to design
the new project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
18.   As shown in the last Country Assistance Strategy (presented on March 1, 1994, Report
P-6161-AR), the Bank has been, and remains, a strong supporter of the ambitious Argentine
reform  program.  The Bank's strategy is to continue to assist in consolidating the
macroeconomic reforms and deepening their impact by strengthening institutions, as well as
providing for investment in infrastructure that has deteriorated due to long periods of



underinvestment. The Second Municipal Development project is fully consistent with this
strategy. First, it would strengthen institutions in the municipal public sector. Second, by
encouraging municipalities to invest wisely with increased cost recovery from final beneficiaries,
the project would mobilize urgently needed municipal infrastructure in an efficient and non-
inflationary manner that supports the macroeconomic reforms.
19.   The project would build on the success of the first Municipal Development Project and
complement the ongoing Provincial Development Project, which provides assistance to the
Government in provincial fiscal matters. The project would also complement the objectives of
the pending Provincial Reform Loan by providing stronger municipal infrastructure and
institutions. The Bank's involvement in these projects has added a degree of rigor and discipline
not achieved before in the management of public expenditures at provincial and municipal levels.
The Bank has also become a clearinghouse for best practices and lessons learned in the sector.
The Government now wishes to expand the municipal development project to additional
provinces and municipalities, extending to them the economic and fiscal stability which has, in
large part, been restored at the national level and in some provinces. At the same time, it
wishes to continue meeting urgent municipal infrastructure needs.
Agreed Actions
20.   During negotiations, assurances were obtained as follows: (a) from  the Central
Government that: (i) all of the proceeds of the Bank loan would be onlent to eligible provinces
in accordance with allocation criteria acceptable to the Bank under terms and conditions
equivalent to the Bank loan, with each participating province's revenue sharing serving as a
guarantee for repayment of subloans; (ii) it would establish and provide adequate support and
staffing to the CCU to provide overall project implementation supervision; and (b) that the
Central Government would cause the provincial governments to: (i) establish, adequately staff
and otherwise support the PEUs; (ii) contribute to the financial support of the CCU; (iii) submit
timely, annual investment program proposals for Bank review and approval; (iv) approve and
carry out the program in accordance with the POM; (v) furnish semi-annual performance
evaluations, reporting on the compliance with all agreements under the project; and (vi) carry
out all environmental protection measures.
21.   Prior to loan effectiveness: (a) the Bank would have accepted: (i) the POM; (ii) terms
of reference for semi-annual performance reviews; and (iii) the CCU staffing plans; (b) the
Central Government would have entered into a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with at least one
province; and (c) the province referred to in (b) above would have also: (i) established and
adequately staffed its PEU; (ii) agreed to adhere to international procurement criteria; and (iii)
present the environmental procedures and responsibilities to be followed in accordance with the
POM.
Environmental Aspects
22.   The proposed project is classified as category B for environmental purposes. In the
majority of subprojects, especially given that preference would be given to small and simple
investments, the environmental impact is expected to be neutral or positive. However,
irrespective of their size, all investments would comply fully and be consistent with Bank



- 6 -
policies and conditions on the environment, including the preparation of environmental impact
statements whenever required. Explicit conditions would be defined in the POM.
Program Objective Categories
23.   Municipalities play a key role in providing infrastructure that is vital to environmental
quality and social services that benefit lower-income groups. Thus, increasing municipal
managerial capacity and basic infrastructure would contribute indirectly to the improvement of
the environment and the reduction of poverty.
Participatory Approach
24.   The project was designed with input from  the provinces and municipalities that
participated in the first Municipal Development project, and has a high degree of participation.
Each municipality (the project's beneficiaries) would be responsible for creating its own
priorities for local infrastructure development within the scope of the project. Municipalities
could participate as much or as little as they like.
Project Benefits
25.   The project would strengthen the fiscal discipline introduced at the national and provincial
levels, and extend it to the municipal level, while providing urgently needed municipal
infrastructure. Furthermore, the project would introduce more effective procurement and
implementation procedures to a large number of municipalities. While not explicitly designed
to do so, the project would also provide substantial benefits to the poor since the infrastructure
to be provided would mostly benefit the poor.
Risks
26.   Risks in this operation would be limited because of the experience gained in the first
project and the similarity between the two operations. The main identified risk is the possibility
that some provinces may prove ineffective or not continue their interest in the project. To
safeguard against this risk, the project would be spread among 13 provinces, five of which
(Buenos Aires, C6rdoba, La Pampa, Neuquen and Santa Fe) participated in the first operation
and were the main promoters of the new project. Thus, should there be some provinces not
interested or capable of fully participating in the project, the large demand for municipal
infrastructure and the flexibility built into the design of the procedure for allocating funds would
permit shifting loan funds to the provinces with more capacity and interest. No special risks
have been identified with regard to financial or technical matters, since most of the investments
to be financed - as in the first project - would be small and simple and limited to eligible
municipalities. A minor risk is the inclusion in the project of municipalities in areas affected
by possible floods. To reduce this risk, municipalities would have to provide, as a prior
condition, certifications from the corresponding PEUs that the proposed investments would be
in safe areas and were designed in accordance with appropriate standards. (A study is being
completed for the Subunidad de Control Contra Emergencias of the Ministry of Interior that will
provide guidelines for these areas).
