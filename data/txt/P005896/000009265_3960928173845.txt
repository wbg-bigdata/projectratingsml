MEMORANDUM AND RECOOEEUDATION O- THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IZTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TH  ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S DEMORATIC REPUBLIC OF YENEN
FOR A TARIM WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) for SDR 9.2 million
(USS 12.00 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would finance the
foreign exchange cost of a Tarim Water Supply Project.
2.    Background.   Water is a scarce natural resource in PDRY.   The rugged
topography and scattered population distribution throughout the country pose
major constraints to the development of the water supply sector. About two-
thirds of the country's 2.3 million inhabitants (or about 1.6 million people)
have access to piped water supply, while the remaining population relies on
individual wells or public outlets. Sewerage systems are limited to the major
districts in the capital of Aden and Al Mukalla, the two largest cities in PDRY,
where service to about 350,000 inhabitants is provided.
3.    The Government's development strategy has focussed mainly on satisfying
the basic needs of the population, developing the productive base of the economy,
strengthening basic infrastructure in transport and public utilities, improving
the efficiency of public sector institutions, and manpower training.  In the
water supply sector, the Government's objectives have been to provide water
supply to major urban centers, followed by improving access to water in secondary
towns and rural areas. About $130 million equivalent, or 8.5 percent of the
investment program in the Third Five-Year Plan (1986-90) was allocated to the
water sector, and the same proportion of investment for the sector is envisaged
under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Though the development of sewerage sector has
not kept pace with investments for water supply, the Government is currently
placing increased emphasis on development of the sector in order to improve
health and environmental conditions.
4.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.   IDA has supported the Government' s
development strategy in the water supply sector through five water supply
projects aimed at providing adequate quantities of potable water to major urban
centers and rural growth areas. Tarim is the fourth largest urban center in the
country, where the quantity of water is insufficient to meet existing demand and
the quality of water is poor. IDA has played an important role in strengthening
PWC's organizational and operational capabilities through promoting sound
technical,  financial and operational policies.   The experience gained from
ongoing projects has been taken into account in the design of the proposed
project. In particular, adequate investigation of groundwater resources has been
undertaken and technical assistance has been included to further improve PWC's
managerial capabilities.
5.    Over the next decade, PWC plans to expand its water supply systems in
growing urban and rural centers in order to provide service to more than 400,000
new customers. This amounts to about a 60X increase over its current consumer



2
base of 650,000 customers. During this period of rapid expansion, continued IDA
involvement would assist PWC to modernize and streamline management and
administrative capabilities, strengthen operation and maintenance procedures
and devise a manpower development plan in order to improve PWC's overall
efficiency, while ensuring that prudent financial policies are maintained.
6.    The proposed project represents IDA's first involvement in the sewerage
sector, thus providing an opportunity to initiate a dialogue on sectoral
finarcial and organizational policies.  In addition, for the first time, IDA
woul, provide technical assistance to the Central Organization for Control and
Auditing (COCA) with a view to strengthen the Government's accounting and
auditing practices.
7.    Project Objectives.  The primary objective of the proposed project is to
increase the quantity and improve the quality of the water supply in the town
of Tarim and adjacent villages. Other objectives are to: (i) improve PWC's
managerial capabilities through establishing management information and inventory
control systems and devising a manpower development program; (ii) implement an
intensive water metering program in order to monitor and control unaccounted-
for-water and promote water conservation; (iii) enhance environmental and public
health conditions through improving wastewater management; (iv) assess and
recommend financing options and institutional arrangments for the sewerage
sector; and (v) strengthen government accounting and auditing procedures which
would benefit PWC and other public agencies.
8.    Project Description.  The project consists of three main components.  PWC
would be the implementing agency for the water supply component which includes:
(i) the drilling and equipping of a new borefield near Tarim; (ii) the
construction of water storage reservoirs and a distribution system in Tarim and
adjacent villages; (iii) the provision of water meters, tools, and operational
equipment; and (iv) technical assistance for construction supervision, the
establishment of management information and inventory control systems, devising
a manpower development program and training. The Directorate General of Local
Government (DGLG) would be responsible for implementing the sewerage sector
component which includes: (i) a pilot wastewater demonstration project; (ii) a
financing and cost recovery study of the sewerage sector; (iii) updating of
sewerage designs; and (iv) training. The third component to be carried out by
COCA is a training program in accounting and auditing.
9.    Project Cost and Financina.  The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$ 15.15 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$
12.00 million which amounts to about 79 percent of total project costs. The
proposed IDA credit of US$ 12.0 million equivalent would finance the entire
foreign exchange component of the project; the balance of US$ 3.15 million
equivalent would be provided by PWC and the Government. Total project costs
include taxes amounting to 5 percent of the cost of civil works and engineering
services. Customs duties are not levied on imported equipment for development
projects in PDRY. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in PDRY are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively.   A map covering the project area is also

attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8362-YDR dated May 29, 1990 is being
distributed separately.
10.   Agreed Actions.   The following main agreements were reached with the
Government and PWC: (i) PWC would generate revenues before taxes sufficient to
cover operating expenses, debt service requirements, increases in net working
capital (excluding cash) and at least 10 of its annual average capital
expenditures for the current fiscal year art the next two following fiscal years
in 1990 and 1991, and 12% thereafter; (ii) PWC would not incur any additional
debt unless projected net revenues are at least 1.2 times its projected annual
debt service, without prior consultation with IDA; (iii) consultants to assist
PWC in construction supervision would be selected by March 31, 1991; (iv)
consultants to assist in implementing management information and inventory
control systems would be selected by June 30, 1991; (v) PWC would commence, by
December 31, 1990, a program to meter all water connections by December 31,
1993; and (vi) PWC would commence a training program, based on the five-year
manpower development plan, by December 31, 1991. Additional agreements reached
with the Governmert were: (i) DGLG would employ consultants, by June 30, 1991
to carry out the financing and cost recovery study of sewerage services, to
update sewerage designs and to assist in the execution of the wastewater disposal
demonstration project; and (ii) by March 30, 1991, COCA and DGLG would commence
their respective training programs. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and PWC for $11.2 million of the credit proceeds would
be a condition of credit effectiveness.
11.   Benefits. The proposed project would provide an adequate quantity of
potable water for about 53,000 people in Tarim and adjacent villages (including
22,000 inhabitants at or below the poverty level), thus eliminating current
health hazards caused from tne poor quality of water and intermittent water
supply service. The project would also improve PWC's operational efficiency
through implementing a comprehensive metering program aimed at reducing
unaccounted-for-water and instituting water conservation measures. The provision
of technical assistance for establishing management information and inventory
control systems and devising a manpower development program would help to
strengthen PWC's managerial and administrative capabilities.
12.   In the sewerage sector, the project would introduce low-cost technologies
for wastewater disposal, thus improving sanitary conditions at an affordable
price and reducing the risk of structural damage to traditional mud-brick
buildings. It would also postpone the need for installing expensive conventional
sewerage systems.   The cost recovery study for sewerage services would make
recommendations on the organizational structure and options for ensuring the
financial viability and sustainability of sewerage systems. The project also
aims to strengthen the accounting and auditing practices of the Central
Organization for Control and Auditing through the provision of training.
12.   Risks.   PWC's implementation performance under completed and ongoing
projects has been very satisfactory. In light of PWC's substantial capital
expansion program during the 1990s, continued support through the provision of
technical assistance in construction supervision and training has been included
under the project. In order to furth.er minimize the risk of implementation
delays, a more intensive level of IDA project supervision is envisaged during



4
the first three years of project execution.   There are no umsqual risks
associated with the DGW sewerage sector component and training to COCA. It
should be noted that the unification of PDRY with the Yemen Arab Republic was
officially announced on May 22, 1990. The implications of the unification, which
could result in a reorganization of the water supply and sewerage sector, are
not expected to have a significant impact on the scope or objectives of the
proposed project, or to adversely affect its execution.
13. Recommendations. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that it be approved
by the Executive Directors.
