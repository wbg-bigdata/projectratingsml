IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
EMERGENCY FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 2073-YDR)
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Emergency Flood
Reconstruction Project in the Republic of Yemen, for which Credit 2073-YDR in the amount
of SDR 7.9 million (US$10.0 million equivalent) was approved on December 12, 1989, and
was made effective on May 7, 1990. The Credit was made to the former People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen (PDRY).2
2.     The credit was closed on December 31, 1994, compared with the original closing date
of December 31, 1992. Final disbursement is expected to take place on July 13, 1995, at which
time a balance of SDRO.051 million (US$0.081 million equivalent) will be cancelled.
3.     The ICR was prepared by Suhail Jme'an (Task Manager) and Josephine Masanque
(Financial Analyst), Private Sector Development and Infrastructure Division of the Middle East
and North Africa Region and reviewed by Alastair J. McKechnie (Division Chief) and Gianni
Brizzi (Project Advisor). The beneficiary agencies were the Ministry of Construction, Housing
and Urban Planning, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources, and the Ministry of Health.  The implementing agency, the Emergency
Reconstruction Unit (ERU), contributed on behalf of the Borrower, the Governrment of Yemen,
to the preparation of the ICR by presenting its viewpoints on different matters and events,
preparing its own evaluation of project preparation and implementation (enclosed as Appendix
A), and commenting on the draft ICR.
4.        Preparation of this ICR began during IDA's April/May 1994 supervision/completion
mission, which was aborted by the civil strife. The next mission took place in March 1995.
The ICR is based on material in the project file and on information provided by ERU.
2/  In May 1990, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) and the Yemen Arab Republic
(YAR) united into the Republic of Yemen (ROY).

Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    Torrential rains resulting in catastrophic flash flooding occurred during the period from
March 18 to April 3, 1989, in the Republic of Yemen, severely affecting urban and rural
communities in various southern governorates. The flooding was unusually severe, having an
occurrence of once every 50 years. Apart from the loss of human life and ensuing suffering and
deprivation, the rains and flooding caused considerable physical damage and interrupted
economic activity in the affected areas. The total direct damages were estimated at US$162
million, or about 13 percent of gross domestic product of the former People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen.
2.    The project's principal focus was to provide for the emergency rehabilitation and
reconstruction of vital infrastructure in housing, education, agriculture and health sectors which
was damaged or destroyed by the torrential rains and flooding. The project was designed with
due consideration to the main lesson learned from a previous Roads Flood Rehabilitation project
in 1982, by ensuring that adequate institutional arrangements were in place at the outset. Before
appraisal, the groundwork was thoroughly prepared: a comprehensive damage assessment was
completed, a Flood Reconstruction Plan (FRP) was fornulated, and robust institutional
arrangements were already set up. These arrangements included the creation of the High
Committee for Flood Relief Coordination and the Emergency Reconstruction Unit, and national
and sectoral coordinators representing the ministries involved in project execution were also
appointed with clear responsibilities.
Project Objectives
3.    The project objectives supported the Government's FRP objectives and comprised of the
following:
(i)    to help restore the country's essential economic infrastructure destroyed or
damaged by the heavy rains and ensuing wide spread flooding;
(ii)    to reduce human deprivation and suffering of the flooding victims through
restoration of social services and shelter;
(iii)   to strengthen institutional capacity to manage disaster recovery programs and
develop future programs to mitigate the country's vulnerability to floods; and



Evaluation Summary                                                                iii
(iv)    to serve as a catalyst for donor financing and coordination of the flood-damage
reconstruction effort.
These objectives were clearly relevant given the extent and widespread damage sustained.
4.    The project financed a self-contained portion of the most urgent components of the
Government's FRP and consisted of providing materials, equipment and civil works for:
(i)     the construction of low-cost housing to replace totally destroyed housing;
(ii)    the rehabilitation and equipping of damaged schools, hospital and health centers;
(iii)   the rehabilitation of flood protection and irrigation structures.
Technical assistance .cluded improving flood preparedness and management operations.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.    During project implementation the country went through a series of difficult and often
overwhelming circumstances: starting with the unification of the People's Democratic Republic
of (the former South) Yemen and the Yemen Arab Republic (the former North) in May 1990
shortly after launching the project followed by the Gulf War in 1991 and its aftermath in 1992,
the severe flooding in February 1993 and finally the civil war in 1994. Because of these events
it was necessary to extend the project completion date by 24 months. Despite all the shocks,
the project was successfully implemented with good quality work largely because of the
perseverance and exceptional efforts of the ERU and continued Government support., The
project provides a testimony to strong project ownership. It should also be recorded that the
project implementation rating remained above average relative to the overall Yemeni Portfolio
during that period.
6.    Project cost (US$14.75) was very close to the appraisal estimate (US$15.36) but the
foreign cost component was rather higher than estimated due to greater expenditures on
additional equipment and materials (Tables 8A,B and D) to compensate for the damages causee
by the February 1993 floods.
7.    The overall assessment of the project is considered to be highly satisfactory. There is
no doubt that considerable benefits have accrued from the restoration of the basic essential
services destroyed or damaged by the floods.

The essential lessons that come out from the successful experience of this project are:
(i)     Principally, the strength and competence of the project implementation unit,
ERU, coupled with continued Government support were able to surmount
difficult conditions.
(ii)    Adequate front-end arrangements and preparation --including a thorough damage
assessment and robust institutional arrangements-- ensured that project objective
were very relevant to the Government needs.
(iii)    Clarity and simplicity of project design assured that all parties involved had a
crystal-clear understanding of objectives and selection criteria.
(iv)    Flexibility and responsiveness of IDA to Borrower needs during project
implementation maintained a high level of goodwill between the two sides.

PART I
Project Implementation Assessment
1.    Introduction
1.1   Torrential rains resulting in catastrophic flash flooding occurred during the period from
March 18 to April 3, 1989, in the Republic of Yemen. The flooding was unusually severe,
having an occurrence of once every 50 years in key urban and agricultural areas. The flash
flooding resulted in significant human suffering and caused physical damage to basic
infrastructure. The most severely affected areas were the urban and rural communities in the
Hadramout, Shabwa and Al-Mahara Governorates. Areas affected to a lesser extent were
located in the Governorates of Abyan, Lahij, and Aden.
1.2   The total direct damages were estimated at about US$162 million, or about 13 percent
of gross domestic product.3 In monetary terms, most of the damage affected the housing sector,
accounting for US$90 million or about 56 percent of total damages. The flooding caused the
death of at least 23 persons and damaged or destroyed 4,200 houses, leaving around 30,000
people homeless. Ten schools were completely destroyed, 443 others sustained damage, and
many were occupied by homeless families. As a result many students were deprived of normal
school attendance. Essential health services were also interrupted and portions of the highway
system were damaged. An estimated US$24 million of damages occurred in the irrigation sub-
sector. Many flood control structures were destroyed endangering rural communities and
jeopardizing crop production.  In addition, about 6 percent of total annual agricultural
production4 was destroyed, 5,500 animals were lost, and about 20,000 hectares of arable iand
in the country suffered serious erosion.
1.3   Emergency relief efforts began almost immediately after the flooding with assistance from
the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO) and coordinated by UNDP. Many
other donors, including international, regional, governmental and non-governmental
organizations, provided assistance towards the immediate relief needs of the flood victims
through the provision of food, medicines, blankets and temporary shelter, as well as emergency
medical relief, amounting to US$6 million. Those efforts were successful and prevented the
potential outbreak of epidemics.

Republic of Yemen prior to the May 1990 unification of the Republic of Yemen.



2                                                   Implementation Completion Report
1.4   The Government, in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
the UNDP and IDA, undertook an assessment of overall flood damage, and subsequently
formulated a Flood Reconstruction Program (FRP) with objectives to reduce human deprivation
and suffering through restoration of social services and shelter restore the country's agricultural
productive capacity and essential economic infrastructure destroyed by the flood.  The
Government's approach to the FRP was pragmatic. In March 1989, the Government created a
High Committee for Flood Relief Coordination (HCFRC) headed by the Deputy Prime Minister
to coordinated with donors all flood disaster relief activities and oversee general execution of
the reconstruction program.
2.    Project Objectives
2.1   The objectives of the project were articulated to reinforce the Government's above stated
objectives. The project objectives, in the order of priority, were outlined as the following:
(i)     to help restore the country's essential economic infrastructure destroyed or
damaged by the heavy rains and ensuing wide spread flooding;
(ii)    to reduce human deprivation and suffering of the flooding victims through
restoration of social services and shelter;
(iii)   to strengthen institutional capacity to manage disaster recovery programs and
develop future programs to mitigate the country's vulnerability to floods; and
(iv)    to serve as a catalyst for donor financing and coordination of the flood-damage
reconstruction effort.
2.2   These objectives were clearly relevant given the extent and widespread damage sustained.
In support of the above objectives, the project called for financing the provision of materials,
equipment and civil works for a self-contained portion of the most urgent components of the
Government's overall FRP estimated at about US$105 million in 1989.
2.3   These urgent components were broadly identified as the following:
(i)     construction of low-cost basic-housing units to replace totally destroyed
housing;
(ii)    rehabilitation and equipping of damaged schools;
(iii)    rehabilitation of flood protection and irrigation structures in Wadi Hassan;



Implementation Completion Report                                                           3
(iv)     rehabilitation of damaged regional hospitals, health centers, health units and
replacement of destroyed medical equipment; and,
(v)     technical assistance for: (a) a flood emergency preparedness and mitigation
program (FEPMP) study; and (b) the provision of technical experts to assist the
Emergency Reconstruction Unit' (ERU) and the technical ministries in such
areas as contract management, construction supervision and monitoring of
project execution.
Details of the above components are listed in Table 7.
2.4    The prioritization and selection of specific rehabilitation and reconstruction works among
and within the various sector-components, mentioned above, to be financed under the project,
were systematically carried out on the basis of a comprehensive set of eligibility criteria'
negotiated and agreed with the Government. These criteria were stated unambiguously and were
clearly understood by all parties and remained unchanged through out project implementation.
This process insulated the selection process from undue external interference and proved to be
highly effective and efficient in allocating funds among competing components.
3.     Achievement of Objectives
Physical Implementation
3.1    All the physical components of the project, except for one contract', were successfully
completed with good quality despite a backdrop of a series of disruptive events (outlined in para.
4. 1). It is apparent that value has been received in relation to the costs incurred and that
strenuous efforts have been made under each individual contract to utilize the allocated resources
to maximum advantage, and to ensure that in every case value for money was obtained. The
following paragraphs summarize the activities carried out with respect to the urgent components
identified above:
5/  The ERU was set up as the implementation unit for the project. The head of the unit was also the
Project Director and National Emergency Project Coordinator who reported to the Ministry of Planning
and Development and the HCFRC.
6/ The selection criteria were outlined in Annex 11 of the Memorandum and Recommendation of the
President, Report No. P-5146-YDR, November 8, 1989.
7/ A contract for the rehabilitation of Aboud Secondary School. The contractor stopped work because of
financial problems. The work is about 60% complete. The Government has initiated legal proceedings
against the contractor to complete the remaining works.

Construction of Low-Cost Housing
3.2   A total of 300 low-cost units in three locations were completed and distributed to eligible
beneficiaries whose eligibility was determined according to agreed criteria (see footnote 6). All
units were designed so that they remain strictly affordable to eligible families that lost their
homes to the floods. The total cost of this component was about YR74.84 million (US$5.80
million).
Rehabilitation of and Equipping of Damaged Schools
3.3   A total of 12 schools serving 11 thousand students and spread over 3 southern
governorates were rehabilitated and were also equipped with furniture. The total costs of the
rehabilitation and furniture were US$3.01 million and US$0.37 million respectively. The UNDP
also financed additional school furniture for about US$0.54 million as part of the its support to
the Government's flood reconstruction efforts.
Rehabilitation of Flood Protection and Irrigation Structures in Wadi Hassan
3.4   The completed components comprised of civil works for rebuilding destroyed flood
controls in Wadi Hassan. These included:
(i)     the construction of earthworks embankments and gabion protection to train
flows within the Wadi bed, and prevent erosion of valuable agricultural land;
and,
(ii)    the reconstruction and other measures to improve conditions at canal heads.
All the civil works were financed by the Government at a cost of about US$0.28 million, while
the procurement of spare parts and gabions were financed under this Credit at a cost of US$0.60
million.
Rehabilitation of Damaged Health Facilities
3.5   A total of 13 health facilities were rehabilitated (5 major regional hospitals, 3 health
centers and 5 health units) and were also equipped with medical equipment. These health
facilities essentially formed the primary network that provided vital access to basic health care
for the residents of four southern governorates. The total costs of rehabilitation and medical
equipment were US$1.48 million and US$0.77 million respectively.

Technical Assistance
3.6   Although funds for the FEPMP study (US$0.83 million) were cancelled from the Credit,
on January 1, 1993, after drawn out deliberations (see para. 4.2), there were, however, positive
signs that the Government was able to secure grant funding from the Arab Fund to finance the
study. Unfortunately, the civil war delayed the start of the study. In preparation for the study,
a team of local experts started laying the groundwork towards identifying and collecting the
necessary data on areas prone to flooding. Unfortunately, the civil war delayed on the start of
the study.
3.7   The other component of the technical assistance was setting up the ERU whose main
tasks were to coordinate and manage current and future flood relief programs. This component
was financed by a UNDP grant with a total of US$1.1 million.8 During the first year the ERU
had one expatriate advisor, but later it was run entirely, and very competently, by local staff for
the remainder of the project.
Procurement of Additional Equipment
3.8   Given the urgent need to restore essential services disrupted by the February 1993
devastating floods, the Government requested, and IDA agreed, that the remaining funds under
the Credit, about US$1.20 million, be utilized to purchase equipment for this purpose. These
funds were essentially the result of about 10 percent depreciation of the US$ relative to the SDR9
during project implementation, between 1989 and 1993. Details of this equipment are listed in
Table 7.
4.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
4.1   The implementation record of this project was adversely influenced by a series of difficult
and often overwhelming circumstances: starting with the unification of the People's Democratic
Republic of (the former South) Yemen and the Yemen Arab Republic (the former North) in May
1990 shortly after launching the project followed by the Gulf War in 1991 and its aftermath in
1992, the severe flooding in February 1993 and finally the civil war in 1994. Because of these
events it was necessary to extend the project completion date by 24 months. By keeping the
Credit open, remaining funds (para. 3.8) were effectively used to mitigate the negative impacts
of these events. Despite all the odds, the project was successfully implemented through the
perseverance and exceptional efforts of the ERU and continued Government support. The
project provides a testimony to strong project ownership.
8/ Final amount was unavailable, however, ERU estimate was about US$1.06 million.
9/ In 1989, 1 SDR was equivalent to US$1.28, while in 1993, it was equivalent to US$1.42 (source:
International Financial Statistics, IMF).



6                                                   Implementation Completion Report
4.2   The unification had, by far, the largest and lasting delay-impact on project
implementation (refer Table 4).   Generally, delays were attributable to the resulting
organizational and administrative changes: widespread staff changes in the project management
teams --3 of the 4 sectoral coordinators for housing, health and agriculture-- were reassigned
new posts in the unified Government. Availability of local counterpart funds was also severely
strained by such staff reassignments and adoption of new procedural arrangements and
regulations. Furthermore, the dissolution of the Central Tender Board (CTB) in Aden, while
simultaneously compacting power with the CTB in Sana'a, left a backlog of unawarded
contracts that had to be rebid, adding further delays. Over-centralization of decision-making at
the newly consolidated CTB, proved to be unwieldy especially when the award of the FEPMP
study was dismissed at the last minute on the grounds that the study was not justified despite
earlier Government approval.
5.    Project Sustainability
5.1   Sustainability of the physical components implemented in relation to the major objectives
above, is considered very likely provided that sufficient annual budget allocations are
appropriated to maintain the rehabilitated facilities. The constructed low-cost houses are all
occupied and well-maintained by their owners. Loss of records during the civil war, however,
has delayed the process of cost recovery. Sustainability of institutional capacity gains also seem
likely. The institutional capacity of the Government to manage disaster recovery efforts has
benefited greatly from the experience gained under this project. The Government's swift
response to the February 1993 floods by mobilizing internal and external resources in aid of the
emergency efforts demonstrated the strengthened capacity to respond to such emergencies. The
ERU's Project Director, who is also the National Emergency Coordinator, continues to play a
major role in coordinating other ongoing emergency activities. Technical assistance, funded by
UNDP, had positive impact on building up and strengthening project management.
Furthermore, experience gained through this project has been transmitted to other sector
ministries through staff secondment to the ERU.
5.2   Overall sustainability would be further bolstered once a proper national framework for
flood emergency response is in place after completing the FEPMP study, whose start was
unfortunately delayed by the recent civil war (para. 3.6).
6.    IDA Performance
6.1   The performance of IDA throughout the project cycle is rated highly satisfactory. From
the onset of project identification, efforts by several Sector Operations Divisions10 (SOD) were
I0/ SODs involved were Infrastructure, Population and Human Resources and Agriculture.



Implementation Completion Report                                                   7
collaborative to ensure maximum effectiveness of their combined emergency-aid efforts. Such
efforts included joint missions, reallocation of about US$9 million in IDA proceeds from
ongoing operations to meet a portion of the total financial requirements of the Government's
FRP not included in this Credit (mainly highways and roads rehabilitation).
6.2   Praise for project design simplicity and flexibility is shared between IDA and the
Government. The organizational setup for the reconstruction effort proved very effective and
enduring. The ERU had the overall responsibility for coordinating and monitoring of project
implementation within the larger context of the FRP. The ERU reported directly to the Deputy
Minister of Planning and Development (MPD) and had direct access to the highest level of the
Government through the HCFRC (headed by the Deputy Prime Minister) (para. 1.4). This setup
proved invaluable on several occasions during difficult times.  Other specific day-to-day
activities were delegated to the sectoral coordinators within the respective sectoral ministries.
6.3   Moreover, IDA played a role by informally mobilizing potential donors to leverage the
funds from this Credit. Contributions made specifically towards this emergency-aid effort
included: (i) US$2.0 million grant from the Islamic Development Bank for the construction and
equipping of two schools and a health center including construction supervision; and (ii) US$1.1
million grant from UNDP for technical assistance to support the implementation of this Credit.
Other more general contributions included US$15 million from Saudi Arabia aimed at
rehabilitation and new construction of infrastructure in the southern governorates.
6.4   Overall, IDA demonstrated a good deal of goodwill, responsiveness and sufficient
flexibility in its actions and response to the Borrower's needs during the difficult circumstances
which the project went through. A highlight of such actions included: (i) reallocating funds from
the Credit for procurement of additional equipment (para. 3.8); (ii) extending the closing date
of the Credit by a total of 24 months because of difficult country conditions (para. 4.1); (iii)
authorizing the use of more expeditious procurement procedures such as Local Competitive
Bidding and International Shopping within prescribed ceilings; and (iv) keeping the Credit
accounts open six months beyond the closing date to accommodate difficulties encountered by
the Borrower in processing the necessary paper-work as a direct consequence of the recent civil
war.
7.    Borrower Performance
7.1   Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. The implementation record was also
satisfactory considering the difficult circumstances experienced and remained above average
relative to the overall Yemeni portfolio. Covenant compliance record was satisfactory, and all
reporting requirements and audits were complete, timely and of good quality.
7.2   The benefits of the Borrower's active participation during project preparation and design
enhanced sense of project ownership. Sponsorship and effective collaboration by the MPD were

instrumental to facilitate project implementation throughout the whole project cycle. It should
also be recorded that the dedication and high professional competence of the ERU leadership and
other sectoral ministries' staff involved were responsible for the satisfactory completion of the
project despite the tremendously difficult circumstances.
7.3   The Borrower extended all efforts to provide IDA with any necessary information
requested. It should also be recorded that IDA/Borrower relations were consistently good
throughout the project.
8.    Assessment of Outcome
8.1   The overall assessment of the project is considered to be highly satisfactory. There is
no doubt that considerable benefits have accrued from the restoration of the basic essential
services destroyed or damaged by the 1989 and 1993 floods. It is still early, though, to assess
the accrued economic benefits since any positive impact cannot be separated and may possibly
be overshadowed by damages from the civil war.
9.    Key Lessons Learned
9.1   Despite adverse country conditions during project implementation, the successful
completion of this project, in retrospect, hinged on the following key factors:
(i)     Collaborative participation between the Borrower's agencies and IDA at the
outset of project identification and design proved fruitful and also enhanced the
concept of ownership.
(ii)    Project design was simple and flexible. Objectives and selection criteria were
unambiguous, clearly stated and well understood by all.
(iii)    The strength and competence of the local team charged with managing and
coordinating project implementation was an essential ingredient to ensure a
successful project.
(iv)    Flexibility and responsiveness of IDA's actions to Borrower needs during
project implementation maintained a high level of goodwill between the two
sides.
(v)     IDA's comparative ability to mobilize other donor support proved invaluable.
Furthermore, coordination with other participating donors creates synergy and
cannot be more emphasized.

In order to assist the Government in its reconstruction
effon, an IDA credit of SDR6.3 million (US$7.0 million
equivalent) was approved in October 1982 for the Roads
Flood Reconstruction Project. The Project Performance
Audit Report No. 7311 dated June 24, 1988, noted that the
project objectives were met despite initial delays in
establishing the construction unit under the project. The
main lesson leamed was to ensure that adequate institutional
arrangements for project implementation are effectively put
in place at the outset.
2.  Taiz Flood Disaster (Credit      Provide the most needed flood control structures to protect  06/90    Scheduled

primary project focus is meeting immediate needs of
retumees in the areas of: essential social services,
agricultural production, housing sites and transportation
infrastructure. Further, the project provides a framework
for mobilizing bilateral and other multilateral support for the
ERP.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
EMERGENCY FLOOD RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 2073-YDR)
Aide Memoire
1.   This Aide Memoire provides a summary of the latest
implementation status of the Emergency Flood Reconstruction
Project (Credit 2073-YDR), and the findings and recommendations
of the IDA mission which supervised this project from March 27,
1995 to March 30, 1995 prior to drafting of the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR). IDA was represented by Mr. Suhail
Jme'an, Task Manager, and Ms. Josephine Masanque, who joined the
mission from Tarim on March 29, 1995. Mr. Alastair McKechnie,
Division Chief, joined the mission briefly while in Aden. The
mission wishes to express its gratitude to Mr. Abdulla Abaddan,
Deputy Minister for Planning and Development, the Ministry of
Planning, Aden Branch (MPDAB)and Dr. Kamal Abdul Rahim, National
Coordinator and Project Director, for his assistance and
hospitality extended to the mission. The IDA mission discussed
the findings and conclusions of this Aide Memoire with Messrs.
Abadda.  and Kamal Abdul Rahim.  Meetings also took place at the
conclusion of the mission in Sana'a with Dr. Jaffer Hamed, Deputy
Minister of Planning and Development, Sana'a, to review the
findings of the mission and proposed actions to be taken.
Phya4cal Implementation
2.   At the conclusion of the Credit, all the physical components
of the project were satisfactorily completed, handed-over to the
relevant government agencies before June 30, 1994, and since then
have been operational with the exception of rehabilitation of
Abboud Secondary School, Aden, where the contractor has not
performed due to financial dufficulty. This contract is about
58% complete. The mission was informed that the Project Unit
intends to terminate the contract for non-performance and peruse
the contractor through the legal channels.
Status of Disbursement and Procurement
3.   This project recently went through difficult circumstances;
soon after the previous supervision mission (November 1993) and
after the approval of the closing date of the Credit to 'June 30,
1994, the Project Director left after completing his contract
term at a time when most works contracts were at or nearing
completion. During that time final claims from contractors for
completed works were not processed and no arrangements for the
payment of retention monies against bank guarantees were made.
Shortly after the formal appointment of the new Project Director
(March 1994), the war broke out. Because of extensive looting
during the war, it took long time after for the Project Unit to
reassemble all the necessary documentation for the preparation of
withdrawal applications (WA) for disbursement against works that
were completed and handed-over prior to the closing date of June



Appendix                                                                 29
2/3                    Aide Memoire
March 30, 1995
30, 1994. Annex 1 attached describes in details the outstanding
balances owed (retention monies) to various contractors totalling
YR 4.9 million (US$ 0.27 million). IDA's share of this would be
YR 4.018 (US$ 0.223 million). The mission recommends that IDA
favorably consider disbursing against these contracts given the
preceding difficult circumstances.
4.   Regarding the additional procurement of: (i) electrical
equipment and materials; (ii) three sewage jetting tankers and
two cesspool emptier tankers; and, (iii) school furniture to
compensate for the damages inflicted by the February 1993 floods,
all the contracts were delivered prior to designated closing date
of December 31, 1994 and subsequently distributed and fully
operational, except for one contract (see Annex 2 for details).
The material under this contract (procurement of Low-Voltage
Cables) was delivered to Hodeidah Port on 'January 12, 1995, from
Jeddah Port, Saudi Arabia, after its designated closing date of
December 31, 1994. Although the goods were ready for shipment by
early -November 1994, but because of the deteriorating political
and military situation at the Yemeni-Saudi boarder there were no
vessels going to Yemen. The mission expressed understanding and
would recommend that management favorably consider disbursing
against this contract in view of the events.
5.   The other pending procurement issue includes the procurement
of two sewage jetting tankers, which arrived to the Port of
Hodeidah during the war and for which the Government of Yemen
agreed that the supplier receive direct payment from IDA for 90%
of the value of the goods against shipping documents and the
remaining 10% will be paid against delivery and acceptance
documents. The mission was informed that up till now the two
trucks have not been delivered to the proper authorities despite
clearance from Hodeidah Port. Several formal requests by the
Project Unit to the supplier to deliver the two trucks were not
successful. The mission expressed strong concern and raised the
matter with the MPD (both in Aden and Sana'a) and urged that they
instruct the supplier to live up to his contractual obligation.
Inability of the Government to force the supplier would otherwise
be considered in breach of Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement.
Other Matters
6. The mission was given a copy of the audited statement for
1993 the project accounts which were reviewed and deemed
satisfactory. The mission was also given supporting documents
needed for the preparation of the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR).
7. The preparation of the ICR was discussed with the Project
Director and a copy of recently completed ICR was also provided
The following action plan was agreed to:

Details of works contracts comRleted before June 30. 1994 with
remaining outstanding balances
1.   The following paragraphs describe details of various
contracts for which all works were completed prior to the closing
date of June 30, 1994, and for which the ERU is requesting
payments by IDA for the retention monies of 5% owed to the
contractors:
1. The contract for the construction of 180 houses at Al-
Shihir (by Messrs. Bakerman and Basibaa): all works were
completed and handed-over in December 1993. According to
the ERU records, the contractor was still owed YR 1,824,034
as a balance of the 5% retention money of YR 3,624,034 to be
financed by IDA. It is understood that the contractor was
al4ready partially paid YR 1,800,000 from the Special account
(chk #  049904).    However the ERU could not settle the
balance due still owed as the SA did not have enough funds.

It should be add here that for the Hashim School the amount
above includes, in addition to the retention money, an
amount of YR 84,594 for progress payment request f2 which
was not paid at the time as the SA did not have sufficient
funds.

It should also be mentioned that for the Modya Hospital, all
works were completed and handed-over to the relevant
government entity in September 1993. Subsequently, the
contractor was paid 30% of the 5% retention money of which
IDA's share was YR 78,667 for the SA. However, the
contractor is still owed by IDA a balance of YR 183,557.
2. Regarding the Special Commitment G00013 for the procurement
of Low-Voltage Cables from Saudi Arabia, the materials were ready
for shipment in late 1994 but the supplier was apparently unable
to ship, although material was stored in Jeddah Port, (evidenced
by extending the effectiveness of the LC) because of the
political and military skirmishes along the Saudi-Yemeni boarder.
