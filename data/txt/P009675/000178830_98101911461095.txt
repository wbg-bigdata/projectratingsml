APPRAISAL OF THE
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
SUMMAIY
i.        The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)
is now 18 years old. After a five-year period of consolidation, ICICI's
business has been expanding rapidly at a compound growth rate of about 16%
annually, reaching in 1972 a level of commitments of $50 million equivalent.
More than half of ICICI's operations are in the form of foreign currency
loans, rendering it the leading institutional source of finance for imports
of machinery and equipment by private industry in India.
ii.       This achievement would not have been possible without the conti-
nuous support of the Bank under whose auspices ICICI was created in 1955.
In following closely ICICI's developments, the Bank has provided ICICI with
nine lines of credit to ICICI over the years, the most recent being a $60
million loan in 1971. At the same time, funds from the Bank implied the
provision of finance untied as to procurement--an advantage that ICICI's
clients appreciate. In turn, the Bank has been able to extend its support
to medium- and large-scale industry in India through an effective interme-
diary, thus contributing to the expansion of the country's industrial base. 1/
iii.      The ownership of ICICI is dominated by public sector corporations
which altogether hold 64 percent of ICICI's capital. The balance is held
by foreign shareholders (25%) and Indian private investors (11%). The Bank
has been the most important source of ICICI's funds having provided, up to
the end of December 1972, 55 percent of its total resources and 84 percent
of its foreign currency resources. Other sources of foreign currency have
been USAID, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Overseas Develop-
ment Administration of the United Kingdom. Rupee funds have been mobilized
through public sector borrowings, initially from the Government and later from
the Industrial Development Bank of India, through share issues, internally
generated resources and recently primarily through debenture issues. In
March 1973 ICICI successfully floated its fourth and largest debenture issue,
for Rs 80 million.
iv.       In providing assistance in the form of term loans, underwritings
of and subscriptions to shares and debentures, and the guaranteeing of loans,
ICICI continues to finance essentially the modern and non-traditional
industries in India, particularly chemicals, ferrous metal products and
engineering goods. The corporation plays an important developmental function
in improving investment proposals when necessary and in arranging for tech-
nical and financial collaboration with enterprises abroad, particularly in
projects utilizing the latest technologies.
1/   Appendix I contains a review of ICICI's history and the Bank's role
in it.



- iv -
v.        ICICI-assisted projects account for substantial portions of the
country's manufacturing capacity in some leading industries like synthetic
rubber and electrical machinery. They have contributed significantly to
employment creation, and have generated satisfactory net benefits to the
Indian economy.  A detailed sample ana"Lysis of ICICI-assisted and completed
projects indicates that three-fourths of its projects yielded an internal
economic rate of return in excess of 12% and half of its projects in excess
of 20%.  This analysis constitutes a part of the Special Study on ICICI's
developmental impact currently being carried out jointly by ICICI and the
Bank.
vi.       ICICI continues to be well-managed and to operate effectively.
Mr. H. T. Parekh is now executive chairman.  Mr. S. S. Mehta, who had
previously been general manager, was promoted to managing director. A
number of other senior staff changes were also made and ICICI has been able
to fill all its top management positions by promoting from within. The
board of ICICI comprises 15 directors of which six are private industrialists.
Liaison with GOI is achieved through the Government directors on the board
and while ICICI has a close relationship with GOI in order to implement
industrial policy, ICICI retains operational autonomy.
vii.      ICICI's portfolio is in satisfactory condition, its liquidity is
good, its policies and practices remain sound. In December 1972, ICICI's
interest rate for foreign currency loans was raised from 9% to 9.5%. The
standard rate for rupee loans has been maintalined at 8.5% in view of local
money market conditions. ICICI has maintained good standards in its
appraisal and follow-up work and has sustained an adequate record of
profitability, enabling it both to pay a 10% dividend to its shareholders
and to add substantially to its reserves. In short, ICICI has maintained
its creditworthiness.
viii.     ICICI has considerably enhanced its economic appraisal expertise
as a result of its detailed project analysis in the Special Study mentioned
above. The corporation is now in a position to apply economic analytical
tools with a greater degree of confidence. In response to a suggestion by
the Bank earlier this year, ICICI has presented a proposal outlining both
the economic methodology it would apply for projects of different types and
sizes and the criteria it would follow in using economic analysis to help
decide on the acceptability of projects. Largely on the basis of this
proposal, agreement was reached during negotiations. In particular, ICICI
would apply the Little-Mirrlees method it had used in the Special Study to
gauge the economic merits of all its larger projects.
ix.       The sectoral distribution of ICICI't operations continues to be
wide. Recently, increased or new lending has taken place for synthetic fibers
well as pulp and paper. Operations still tend to be heavily concentrated
in the established industrial centers of Gujarat and Maharashtra and attempts
to achieve a more diversified geographical distribution have not proved very
successful despite Government incentive schemes. ICICI has made contribu-
tions in promoting the establishment of new enterprises and those in back-
ward areas. It has recently participated in the surveys of the industrial



v 
potential of several backward states and has already financed a few projects
which followed from these surveys. However, there is scope for increased
involvement by ICICI in promoting industrial enterprises. In particular,
ICICI can increase further its financial assistance to backward areas,
intensify its contacts with state level institutions and involve itself with
projects in the early stages of their formulation. During negotiations, an
understanding was reached with ICICI on these points.
x.        Over the last two years ICICI's operations have continued to expand
with an increase in loan approvals of 19 percent in 1971 and of a further
29 percent in 1972. The major share of approvals (63 percent in 1972) con-
tinues to be in foreign exchange for imports, but approvals for rupee lending
increased very sharply and in 1972 reached double the level of 1970. This
increased activity is a reflection of the confidence on the part of the
private sector in the longer term prospects of the economy. This confidence
is further reflected in the pronounced increase in actual disbursements of
foreign currency loans which went up from an average of US$30 million per
annum in 1970 and 1971 to US$36 million in 1972.
xi.       Although affected by some uncertainties, the outlook for
further industrial investment is satisfactory. ICICI's commitments forecast,
implying a growth rate of about 10% p.a. after 1973, appears realistic. To
carry out its operations until the end of 1975, ICICI will have to raise
more funds: about $107 million in foreign exchange to finance equipment
imports and about Rs 220 million (about $29 million equivalent) for local needs.
xii.      ICICI's achievements, as mentioned above, show its suitability
and creditworthiness as an intermediary through which the Bank can continue
to play an important role in providing assistance to Indian industry. To
finance its expanding volume of operations, ICICI needs resources from
abroad. It can count on limited amounts from bilateral sources (KfW and
UK) and, in addition, has good prospects of obtaining a $15 million equivalent
Euro-currency loan. Numerous advantages would accrue to ICICI from its
association with the international capital market. However, for the bulk of
its foreign currency resource needs over the next few years ICICI will still
depend on the Bank.
xiii.     To fill the corporation's incremental resource needs, a tenth
Bank loan of $70 million to ICICI is recommended. This amount, together
with the expected Euro-currency loans and finance from bilateral sources,
should cover ICICI's foreign currency commitments of $112 million through
the end of 1975. The loan would cover about 38% of ICICI's total commitments
in this period.
xiv.      The terms of the proposed loan should be similar to those of
recent Bank loans to development finance companies, including the standard
commitment charge. The use of the loan would be limited to foreign currency
expenditures for imports. As in the last loan, only those of ICICI's projects
which need more than $4 million of ICICI's resources, including Bank loan
funds, should require the approval of the Bank. ICICI's present contractual
9:1 borrowing limit in relation to its equity should be retained.






APPRAISAL OF THE
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI),
has been associated with the World Bank for almost 20 years. During that
period ICICI has received nine Bank loans totalling $265 million, including
a $60 million line of credit in 1971.
1.02      Recently ICICI approached the Bank for a tenth loan.  This report
updates the appraisal of ICICI in the President's Report of October 13, 1971,
and recommends a $70 million loan. The proposed tenth loan is an appro-
priate occasion to review ICICI's evolution and the role the Bank has been
playing in shaping its operations and policies. This review is contained
in Appendix I to this report.
II. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
Industrial Trends
2.01      The most recent study of India's economy is presented in "Economic
Situation and Prospects in India" dated April 11, 1973. The year 1972 was
marked by a widespread shortfall in agricultural output in many parts of
the country; for 1972/73, foodgrain production is estimated at only 100
million tons compared with the record output of 108 million tons in 1970/71.
2.02      Industrial production showed, on the other hand, an improved record.
After a deceleration in the rate of growth of industrial output from 7.1%
in 1969 to about 3% in 1971, industrial production increased again at roughly
7% in 1972 (Annex 1). This improvement in industrial production, however,
has not offset the decline in agricultural output and, as a result, GDP
growth is not expected to exceed 2% in 1972. This low growth has been
associated with budgetary and balance of payments difficulties. Moreover,
the cumulative effect on industrial investment and production in the next
two years resulting from lower agricultural incomes has not been determined,
but it can safely be assumed that demand for certain consumer goods will
decline in 1973.
2.03      Much of the improvement in industrial production in 1972 can be
attributed to the strong recovery of basic industries, intermediate and capital
goods as well as increases in cotton textiles. Due to a better utilization
of capacity, which in 1971 stood at only 65%, steel production rose by 4%
in 1972. Industries which are dependent on the steel industry, primarily
engineering and consumer durables, also showed improvements as a result.
2.04      Notwithstanding these developments, dampening influences in industry
still abound. Power shortages, transport bottlenecks and slack public sector
demand for industrial goods act as constraints on production.



-2-
2.05      The performance of non-traditional export items (mostly engineering)
did not reach targeted levels in 1972, largely because of the rise in domestic
demand for these commodities and, hence, reduced surpluses for exports. Despite
these temporary setbacks, industrial exports remain India's main hope for
overcoming the decline in traditional export items--tea, jute and cotton.
2.06      Problems in meeting demand have become typical since 1970.  Fertil-
izers and minerals (except coal) have been in short supply for some time.
Despite the recent increase in steel production and liberalized imports, steel
-emains a scarce commodity. The engineering industry has had a large backlog
of unfilled orders. Nevertheless, some of these shortages are being met
through liberalized import policies.  Also, investors are responding to these
opportunities and the growing stream of license applications points to a
revival of investors' interest in manufacturing. 1/

2.07      In February 1973, further changes occurred in the industrial
licensing policy, which had already been revised in 1970. The 1970 revi-
sions were designed to reduce the Government's control over smaller invest-
ments to promote manufacturing activities in the medium- and small-scale
sectors and in the backward regions of the country. Strict control, however,
was retained over key industries in the Government's highest priority or
"core" 2/ sector, investments by foreign firms and investments requiring
foreign exchange in excers of 10% of total capital cost. Furthermore, public
financial institutions were encouraged to make large rupee loans partially
convertible into equity.
2.08      To prevent the emergence of monopolistic tendencies in the private
sector, approval by the Monopolies Commission (in addition to the approvals
by the licensing authorities) was made a requirement for projects sponsored
by the "larger business houses" and foreign firms. In 1971, however, some
of the licensing requirements were liberalized. They applied to projects
designed to expand output and which required little foreign exchange,
especially if production was for exports, strategic items or substantial
import substitution. As a result, considerable increases in the number
of letters of intent issued for new industrial licenses have been recorded
since then.
2.09      The February 1973 revisions in the industrial policy changed the
definition of "larger houses" for the purposes of licensing restrictions and
1/   In 1971, 1,015 letters of intent for new investment were signed and 676
licenses were issued, compared with 438 and 363, respectively, in 1970.
In 1972 (January/July) 531 letters of intent and 252 licenses were
issued.
2/   Agricultural inputs, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, petroleum,
coking coal, certain heavy industrial machinery, shipbuilding, news-
rrint and electronics.

added some industries 1/ to the "core" sector in which these larger houses,
as well as foreign firms, can invest. Larger houses are now defined as
enterprises with total assets of not less than Rs 200 million as against
Rs 350 million previously. They are encouraged to engage in ventures with
share capital participation by the Central and State Governments. Nevertheless,
much confusion still surrounds this "joint sector" concept. Altogether,
these changes imply a partial reversal of the 1970 policy to curb the growth
of large enterprises.
Patterns of Industrial Finance
2.10      Based on the letters of intent for licensing purposes, gross in-
vestment in private industry in 1972/73 is estimated to be in excess of the
Rs 10 billion in 1971/72. Over 15% of this amount was provided by the major
term-financing institutions: Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI),
ICICI, Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), State Financial
Corporations (SFCs), and State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs).
2.11      The first three are term-lending institutions of national scope,
whose assistance has been directed mainly to medium and-large scale enter-
prises. IDBI, an affiliate of the Reserve Bank of India and to which IDA
recently made a credit of $25 million equivalent, acts as a lender of last
resort in its direct operations which have been concentrated in the modern
industrial sectors. Its indirect operations comprise refinancing of loans
and rediscounting of bills. IDBI is the largest source of term-loans for
the industrial sector. Its operations have been accelerating rapidly in
the last two years, with 1971/72 approvals reaching Rs 1.43 billion. ICICI
approvals totalled Rs 524 million in 1972, the majority of which were for
foreign currency loans (paragraph 5.01). IFCI (which is half-owned by
IDBI and half by other financial institutions) also provides foreign currency
loans but its resources are limited and its import financing operations
have been only about one-fifth of ICICI's level. IFCI's specialty is
financing cooperatives, mainly sugar and cotton; its approvals have totalled
about Rs 300 million p.a. over the last three years. Over the last nine
year, 140 companies have received joint financing from these institutions
with IDBI providing nearly 60 percent and ICICI and IFCI about 20 percent
each of the joint assistance for projects with a total cost of about Rs 13
billion.
2.12      At the state level, the SFCs and SIDCs are the most important
industrial financing institutions. Total loans approved by the SFCs have
increased sharply, reaching Rs 640 million in 1971/72. The bulk (about
70%) of the SFC's assistance has been to the small-scale sector. SIDCs
provided term loans also at an increasing rate, reaching a level of Rs 112
million in 1971/72. However, their main impact derives from their promotional
activities.
1/   Among the additions are steam generating plants, industrial turbines,
equipment for transmission and distribution of electricity, commercial
vehicles, earth-moving machinery, scientific instruments, drugs and
pharmaceuticals.



2.13      Commercial banks, the Life  nsurance Corporation (LIC), and the
Unit Trust of India (UTI), also provide long-term finance. The latter two
primarily underwrite new issues and invest in industrial shares and deben-
tures; LIC also has large portfolio holdings of public bonds and loans to
State Governments.
2.14      During 1971/72, term-lending institutions showed a continuing
substantial increase in both approvals and disbursements. Their total
share in the financing of fixed investment in the private corporate sector
is estimated to have risen from 17% in 1968/69 to 29% in 1971/72. Approvals
totalled Rs 3.07 billion and idisbursements were Rs 1.83 billion in 1971/72,
ropresenting increases of 36% and 25%, respectively, over the levels of the
previous year (Annex 2). Traditionally, the bulk of their assistance has
been in the form of loans. During 1971/72, only Rs 259 million or 8% of
total approvals were for underwriting of and subscription to industrial
securities.
III. ICICI'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY
ICICI as a Mobilizer of Resources
3.01      ICICI's resources stood at Rs 2,291.9 million at December 31, 1972.
Foreign sources supplied 65% of the total, while domestic sources provided
Rs 793.4 million or the remaining 35%. Foreign sources, mostly untied as
to procurement, have traditionally supplied the bulk of ICICI's resources.
(Annex 3).
3.02      ICICI's domestic resources have largely (64%) been mobilized from
the public sector, essentially through GOI (Rs 274.4 million outstanding)
and IDBI loans (Rs 151 million outstanding). Funds from the private sector
were raised primarily through share issues in 1955, 1967 and 1971, bringing
paid-up capital to Rs 100 million. 1/ Internal cash generation has allowed
ICICI to add substantially to reserves which stood at Rs 113.1 million at
the end of 1972. In addition, ICICI has made a contribution to the develop-
ment of India's capital market by floating four debenture issues which
netted Rs 260 million on terms favorable to ICICI (6%, 12 years maturity).
(Annex 4). Most of these debentures were taken up by LIC, UTI, IDBI and
commercial banks; however, individual and corporate investors also subscribed.
In March 1973, ICICI offered its fourth debenture issue, its largest ever,
for Rs 80 million. It was fully subscribed.
3.03      ICICI has been successful in mobilizing foreign resources.  It
has received nine World Bank lines of credit totalling $265 million, of which
$169.9 million (Rs 1,236.8 million) were outstanding at December 31, 1972.
The Bank is ICICI's most important source of finance, accounting for 54%
1/   However, ICICI's share capital is now predominantly (64%) held by
public sector institutions following the 1969 bank nationalization.



- 5 -
of its total resources and 84% of its foreign currency resources. Other lines
of credit have been obtained from USAID (Rs 10.0 million outstanding), the
German Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) (Rs 171.1 million outstanding)
and from the United Kingdom (Rs 56.9 million outstanding). (Details are
in Annex 5). An important development in ICICI's policy of diversifying its
foreign currency resources is the proposed $15 million equivalent borrowing
in the Euro-currency market (para 6.07).
ICICI as a Source of Industrial Finance
3.04      ICICI's important role in resource allocation stems from its
dominant position as an institutional source of loans for imports.  Of the
Rs 255 million in foreign currency loans extended by term-lending institutions
in 1971/72, ICICI provided Rs 225 million or 88%; IFCI provided the rest.
More than half of ICICI's commitments in the past three years have been in
the form of term loans for the import of capital goods. These have been
amounting to $20-30 million per year. Due to the time lag between approval
and disbursement of funds, disbursements were somewhat smaller, about $15-25
million p.a.; however, they represent a sizeable proportion of India's
equipment imports which amount to about $250 million annually. By contrast,
the total of ICICI's rupee loans is much smaller amounting to commitments
of about $12.0 million equivalent a year.
3.05      ICICI's investment operations are fairly balanced between under-
writing and direct subscriptions, following the increased emphasis on the
latter in the past two years. In 1970, underwritings amounted to Rs 37.1
million, and direct subscriptions to Rs 10.4 million. In 1972, underwritings
amounted to Rs 43.7 million and direct subscriptions totalled Rs 33.4 million.
3.06      ICICI's allocation of its resources to different industries and
geographical locations is discussed in paras 5.08 and 5.09.
ICICI's Developmental Impact
3.07      Contribution to GOI's Industrial Objectives.  The Government's
industrial licensing policy circumscribes the volume and type of business
available to financial institutions. Within the context of that policy,
ICICI aims at directing its assistance to non-traditional industries and it
has been successful in achieving this objective. ICICI has been able to
increase its volume of operations essentially by processing the continually
increasing number of applications submitted to it and appraising those
projects it wished to pursue. At the same time it has attempted to meet
specific objectives of GOI's industrial policy.
3.08      ICICI's contributions towards meeting these objectives may be
gauged from the following examples. ICICI finances joint sector companies
and, consistent with GOI's policy to broaden public sector ownership, nego-
tiates conversion rights into equity on large rupee loans. Some 66 small
companies have been extended technical and financial assistance in the past
three years. To encourage the development of backward areas, ICICI has
participated in industrial surveys, is actively seeking out projects from
these areas and, since 1970, has been providing concessional terms for



- 6 -
small- and medium-sized projects in backward areas. Projects which promise
export earnings are given priority by ICICI. Indeed, ICICI's client com-
panies continually fare better in exports than the national average for
their industries. Although most of the projects ICICI finances are relatively
capital intensive by Indian standards, it is estimated that direct employment
creation by ICICI-financed projects has totalled over 300,000 jobs or about
11% of employment created by industry since 1955. A more extensive review
of ICICI's activities in these fields is contained in Appendix II. In
addition, ICICI's future scope of assistance in the area of promotion is
discussed in para 4.16 and in Appendlix III.
3.09      Special Study.  A comprehensive analysis of ICICI's contribution
to economic development in India is being conducted through a joint ICICI-
World Bank Special Study. Complete results of this study -- in which ICICI
focuses on operational aspects and the Bank on ICICI's institutional environ-
ment -- are not yet available. However, a detailed analysis of a represent-
ative sample of 42 ICICI-financed and completed projects has already been
concluded which shows that three-fourths of them yielded an internal
economic rate of return in excess of 12%, and half in excess of 20%. Although
the sample includes a few marginal projects and one with a negative economic
rate of return, it can be stated overall that ICICI has performed efficiently
in allocating scarce resources.
3.10      A further interesting result which has emerged from the Special
Study is the profile of - typical project in ICICI's portfolio: the typical
or average project belongs to the modern industrial sector (e.g. chemicals,
electrical equipment). The total capital cost amounts to about Rs 10 million
of which ICICI has financed about 20% - about two-thirds of it in foreign
exchange. A high proportion (60%) of the cost has been financed by promoters'
contributions and internally generated funds, while the remaining 20% has
been provided by other institutional sources. The project involved some form
of foreign collaboration. One-fourth of the raw materials used during pro-
duction are imported; however, on the output side, it makes a significant
contribution to import replacement. It employs about 350 people; the
investment/employment ratio is around Rs 40,000. The financial performance
of the project is satisfactory with a return of 14% on capital employed.
Profits are about equally divided into retained earnings, taxes and dividend
distribution. Capacity utilization is 60% and although most of the output
of the project is sold in the domestic market, its export performance is
much better than the industry average.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Organization
4.01      Ownership.  Following ICICI's second rights issue of Rs 25 million
in August 1971, to which some of the foreign shareholders did not subscribe,
Indian public sector shareholdings increased to 64% of ICICI's capital
(ver3us 60% in mid-1971). The balance is held by foreign shareholders (25%)
and Indian private investors (11%). The total number of shareholders



increased from 1,665 in mid-1971 to 1,819 at the end of 1972 (Annex 6).
Foreign shareholdings are likely to diminish further as a proportion of ICICI's
capital as the latter increases.
4.02      Board.  ICICI's board presently comprises 15 directors:  six
directors are industrialists connected with leading business houses, three
are chief executives or senior officials of public financial institutions,
two (the chairman and the managing director) are full time officers of ICICI,
two represent foreign shareholders and two are GOI senior officers (one
appointed by GOI from the Ministry of Finance) (Annex 7). Of the fifteen,
seven have been associated with ICICI for more than five years. The composition
of ICICI's board does not entirely reflect the distribution of its ownership,
as individual directors are invited to join the board primarily on the basis
of their personal qualifications.
4.03      The board meets about once a month:  it approves all business
transactions, except small loans and investments up to Rs 1 million (which
are approved by the chairman within an aggregate limit of Rs 10 million per
month) and portfolio sales of ICICI's investments (which are decided upon
by a committee of the board). Over the years, a close relationship has been
established between board and management, enhanced by the fact that the
chairman exercises executive powers on a full-time basis. The present
chairman, Mr. H.T. Parekh, has been part of ICICI's management almost from
its inception and displays strong leadership in the board. The Government
directors provide useful liaison with GOI on general policy issues as well
as on specific project proposals.
4.04      Management and Staff.  During 1972, Mr. H. T. Parekh was both
chairman and managing director. Since January 1, 1973, he has led ICICI as
executive chairman. In his capacity as managing director he was succeeded
by Mr. S.S. Mehta (formerly general manager); Dr. P.B. Medhora (formerly
deputy general manager) was promoted to general manager, Mr. S. Kumarasundaram
(formerly assistant general manager) to deputy general manager and Mr. S.S.
Nadkarni (formerly chief of the Projects Department) to assistant general
manager. Although Mr. Parekh is likely to continue as the head of ICICI for
several more years, this series of promotions no doubt paves the way for a
gradual transfer of executive responsibility. It is reassuring that ICICI
has been able to fill all its top management positions by promotions from
within.
4.05      ICICI's staff organization is shown in the Chart attached to this
report. The staff now numbers 305 including 119 professionals (as against
253 and 94 respectively at the end of 1970). The main change, at the profes-
sional level, during the past two years, has been an increase from 62 to 80,
in the number of junior officers, spread evenly throughout the organization.
The academic qualificiations of these recruits are generally high.
4.06      In spite of this relatively large increase in professional staff,
ICICI is still understaffed, particularly in its appraisal and follow-up
work. To cope with the present and expected workload, it plans to recruit
five more officers for its Projects Department (now numbering 18) and three



- 8-
more for its Follow-up Department (now numbering 15). However, in view of
the increasing volume of operations, a larger recruitment program would be
required to deal thoroughly and expeditiously with the workload, to engage
in more promotional work and to cope with the added demands on senior staff
time arising from the new merchant ban.king activities (para 4.08). During
negotiations, ICICI's plans for staff expansion were discussed. ICICI has
already made arrangements to recruit the officers mentioned above. In
addition, ICICI plans to recruit three officers to help strengthen its
economic project analysis and several other officers to work in the Market
Research Department and the Development and Training Division. This
recruitment program was considered reasonable.
4./7      ICICI stresses staff training at all levels and has recently
established a separate unit for development and training activities. ICICI
supplements its own training by sending its officers to other institutions,
including the World Bank.
4.08      In July 1972, ICICI's board decided to establish a merchant banking
unit which will offer, against a fee, a range of services including market
studies, preparation of applications for loans from institutions in India
and abroad, and negotiations with brokers for underwriting arrangements.
These services will be available to ICICI's clients and to companies in
sufficiently good standing to be eligible for ICICI's assistance. To begin
with, two senior officers from the Projects Department and one from the
Legal Department have been designated on a part time basis to staff the
unit.
4.09      The regional offices in Calcutta and Madras which were opened in
1969 and have since relieved Bombay headquarters of follow-up functions, have
recently undertaken project appraisal work. Each office has a staff of six
professionals, including engineers, lawyers and financial analysts. Both
offices participate actively in the monthly meetings of the Inter-Institutional
Groups of their respective areas whose main task is to follow -p on the joint
studies of backward areas completed in 1971-72. The work of the two offices
has not yet led to an increase in the volume of ICICI's business in their
respective areas. To achieve this objective, a further strengthening of
their staffs will probably be required, partizularly for project appraisal
and promotional work. During negotiations, ICICI explained that it had
recently recruited an experienced officer to expand the Calcutta office's
promotional activities. In addition, ICICI plans to hire one officer each
for the Madras and Calcutta offices to strengthen their appraisal and
promotional work and one legal expert for the Calcutta office. This program
is likely to lead to an increase in ICICI's business in the areas serviced
by the two offices.
Policies and Practices
4.10      Loan Policies.  ICICI generally discourages rupee loans below
Rs 1 million but has no lower limits for foreign currency loans. It has no
fixed upper limits for loans or for overall commitments per enterprise, each
case being judged on its own merits. As of December 31, 1972, ICICI had



extended financial assistance in excess of 10% of its equity to 12 companies.
Of these, three companies received finance totalling the equivalent of about
90% of ICICI's equity. However, all 12 companies show a satisfactory per-
formance in their operations, profits and service of their debt to ICICI,
which indicates that ICICI has been following prudent policies before decid-
ing on relatively large commitments to a single enterprise.
4.11      In December 1972, ICICI raised its interest rate on foreign currency
loans from 9% to 9.5% in order to maintain its interest rate spread. The
standard rate for rupee loans was kept at 8.5% in view of current excess
liquidity in the banking system. ICICI also levies a commitment fee of 1%
on undrawn amounts, which starts accruing approximately two and a half months
after board approval. In addition, a 1% interest rate, contingent upon the
achievement of a specified level of profitability, is charged on loans to
private limited companies. 1/ ICICI's loans are usually secured by first
mortgages. It obtains bank or insurance company guarantees in cases where
ICICI's loan is small or a company's units are already mortgaged to another
institution.
4.12      ICICI's loan agreements contain covenants to protect its position,
including the requirement that clients assume the exchange risk. ICICI
also reserves the right to appoint a director on a borrower's board, and
has done so in 33 cases. In conformity with GOI guidelines, ICICI seeks
conversion rights for part of its rupee loans in cases where the total of
its rupee assistance exceeds Rs 5 million.
4.13      Equity Investment Policies.  ICICI continues its long standing
policy of not investing in equity for quick yields and marketability, but
rather for the longer-term prospects of a project. It is prepared to take
the risks of underwriting share issues for industrialists who would not
otherwise have been able to go to the market. Most equity investment
operations are executed in conjunction with a loan and, for big projects,
jointly with IDBI and other financial institutions. As of December 31, 1972,
ICICI's equity investment portfolio at cost was about 80% of its own net
worth.
4.14      Debenture Investment Policies.  Since its inception and increasingly
so in recent years, ICICI has invested in debentures, either by taking up
part of debentures issues which it had underwritten or by subscribing to
them directly. ICICI now holds debentures floated by 52 companies. Public
issues of debentures carry an interest rate of 8% and are redeemable in 10
to 12 years; ICICI charges a commission of 1.5% for its underwriting services.
As debentures are floated generally by only well-established companies, they
are readily marketable and the returns to ICICI are satisfactory. Some of
the issues underwritten in the past were convertible into equity and ICICI
has exercised this option in most cases. As a result of GOI policy, ICICI
has recently been negotiating the option to convert part of the debenture
issues into equity shares.
1/   ICICI introduced this feature because it cannot, in these companies,
obtain equity which could lead to capital appreciation.



- 10 -
4.15      Guarantee Policies.  ICICI assistance to companies by way of
deferred payments guarantees has not been a significant part of its operation;
through the end of 1972 it had provided guarantees amounting to Rs 73 million
to 8 companies for 9 projects, all of them large. In most of these projects,
ICICI provided substantial assistance in other forms as well. ICICI continues
to maintain its normal standards of appraisal for projects under consideration
for guarantees. As a matter of policy, ICICI also obtains adequate security
for the guaranteed amounts.
4.16      Promotion.  In judging ICICIfs promotional activities, the institu-
tional and industrial policy framework in which it is operating has to be
c-^nasidered. At the state level, there are specialized institutions (SIICs
and SIDCs) whose essential task comprises the setting up of industrial enter-
prises. Their work is complemented by the State Directorates of Industry
which, based on their familiarity with the resource endowments of their
areas, commission feasibility studies, build industrial estates and search
for entrepreneurial talent. From a national planning point of view, the
Government has increasingly paid attention to the fostering of industries
in backward States and is offering financial incentives to attract business
into these areas. This framework assigns an essentially complementary role
to ICICI in promoting enterprises. Appendix II highlights its recent efforts
in this regard. In addition, ICICI has been providing training for many
years to the staff of state level financing institutions. However, ICICI
can do more to strengthen its promotional Prole by increasing its financial
assistance to backward areas, by intensifying its working arrangement with
state level institutions and agencies and by fostering projects in their
early stages of formulation. These points were discussed with ICICI during
negotiations and an understanding on its future promotional activities was
reached. Appendix III which contains the details of this understanding also
describes ICICI's efforts to promote the establishment of a housing develop-
ment finance corporation.
Procedures
4.17      Appraisa1.  ICICI's investigations into projects continue to center
on the technical and financial aspects of appraisal. As before these aspects
are generally well handled. Management and market aspects are also adequately
covered although more attention is required on organizational arrangements
for successfully realizing sales prospects at home and abroad. In 1971 and
1972, an effort was made to improve appraisal work by introducing probability
analysis and by providing a better integration of the project into its wider
industrial context. Overall, ICICI's appraisal work continues to be of good
quality.
4.18      Economic Analysis.  Following negotiation of the Bank's Ninth
Loan, ICICI now includes a quantitative assessment of the economic merits
of projects in its appraisal reports. The effective rate of protection
calculation is the most commonly used method, complemented or sometimes
replaced by the domestic resource cost calculation. In a few cases, ICICI
has also attempted to assess internal economic rates of return. In addition
to evaluating the social cost of domestic production, ICICI probes into
other economic aspects of projects such as employment generation and multiplier



- 1 1 -
effects. Although these aspects shed additional light on the desirability of
projects, it seems that such economic analysis has had little impact on ICICI's
decisions on projects. ICICI's margin of maneuver in modifying project design
is limited by the existing policy setting which -- because of the licensing
system and price controls -- often determines production scales, location,
technology of the project, and costs of both investments and products.
However, in cases of excessive production scale, ICICI has been instrumental
in reducing the sizes of projects. On the other hand, as licensed capacities
are GOI-fixed maxima, ICICI's only choice in practice for low scale/high cost
projects is between approval and rejection. This is so, since it is a cum-
bersome process of uncertain outcome to obtain an increase in the capacity
specification from the licensing authority.
4.19      To ensure that economic analysis will have a greater impact on
ICICI's decisions in gauging the acceptability of projects, the Bank invited
ICICI earlier this year to present a proposal outlining the economic
methodology and the criteria it would use to assist in judging the merits
of projects. A constructive proposal was received before negotiations which
showed that ICICI has considerably enhanced its economic appraisal expertise
as a result of the Special Study (para 3.09). The corporation is now in a
position to apply economic analytical tools with a greater degree of
confidence.
4.20      Largely on the basis of ICICI's proposal, agreement was reached
during negotiations both on the methodology and the criteria ICICI would
follow in its economic project appraisals. In particular, ICICI would apply
the Little-Mirrlees method it had used in the Special Study to gauge the
economic merits of all its large projects involving a total capital cost of
more than Rs 25 million and ICICI assistance of more than Rs 5 million.
ICICI would thus be the first development bank associated with the Bank Group
to use systematically an advanced economic methodology such as Little-
Mirrlees for its project appraisals. For smaller projects ICICI would
calculate the domestic resource cost of foreign exchange earned or saved
and the effective rate of protection. Whenever these economic tests should
raise doubts about the economic priority of projects, ICICI would provide
special justification if it judged it appropriate to proceed with the
proposed financing. This justification would include an assessment of such
factors as external economies and income distribution effects.
4.21      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procedures in these areas continue
to be satisfactory. ICICI's clients have access to foreign machinery only
if comparable equipment is not available indigenously. In any case, ICICI
urges its borrowers to procure equipment from the most competitive sources.
It generally insists that its clients obtain quotations from at least three
different firms, whether for import or for local procurement.  When more
than nine months elapse between appraisal and disbursements, quotations are
requested again at the time of disbursements. In evaluating alternative
supply sources, ICICI takes into consideration not only quoted prices but
also the suppliers' reputation, service facilities, quality and delivery
period. Disbursements are competently effected by ICICI's Disbursement
Department.



- 12 -
4.22      Follow-up.  ICICI's follow-up procedures and the depth of its
project supervision are, by and large, satisfactory. However, the staff
strength of the Follow-up Department and the organization of its work have
not entirely kept up with the growth of ICICI's portfolio. ICICI's
management plans to deal with that problem by staff increases (para 4.05),
and an improved allocation of work whereby specialized groups (headed by
senior officers) would supervise all projects in a particular industry.
Problem projects have recently been assigned to a special cell within the
Follow-up Department. It coordinates its work with the directors ICICI
nominates on the boards of these companies. In view of the satisfactory
performance of its clients, ICICZ could accomplish adequate supervision by
visiting a relatively small number of its clients every year to supplement
its regular checks on progress reports. Recently, ICICI has further
streamlined its follow-up organization by assigning the supervision of
management and organizational aspects of client companies to a special unit
headed by an experienced officer.
4.23      Since 1970, ICICI has been issuing annual detailed progress
reports on its client industries in addition to the progress reports on its
client companies, also compiled yearly. These reports are especially useful
for the appraisal of new projects for existing clients and for comparisons
of performance data across industries.
Relations with the Goveriment and Financial Institutions
4.24      The Government, as a direct provider or guarantor of funds, as
an allocator of foreign exchange business, and as a setter of economic
policy, has always been important to ICICI. This is particularly true
today, given the Government's interest in public financing institutions
as tools of economic policy. Furthermore, ICICI has been particularly
important to the Government as a source of untied foreign exchange for
industrial investment. In these circumstances, a close relationship between
ICICI and Government is of particular relevance. Government authorities
have been pleased with ICICI's efficiency and progress in its operations.
At the same time, GOI would like ICICI to become active in promotion and to
redress the regional imbalance in its portfolio (para 5.09).
4.25      The connections of ICICI's chairman with decision makers in
New Delhi as well as the recently developed day-to-day contacts between
ICICI staff and Government staff at working levels have assured a generally
congenial and effective working relationship. These contacts have been
paticularly valuable in dealing with licensing problems. Despite the close
relationship ICICI has been able to retain a satisfactory degree of operation-
al autonomy.
4.26      Among public financial institutions, IDBI is of particular
importance to ICICI, as a source of capital, as a pacesetter on interest
rate policy, and as the maker of other policies in significant areas.
Relations are also close with IFCI, UTI and LIC, with which ICICI frequently
eng-;cs in joint loan and investment operations.  ICICI's contacts with
state level institutions, particularly the SIDCs and SIICs, are important



- 13 -
for promotional work and hold out promise for an increased engagement for
ICICI in this field.
4.27      ICICI's willingness to impart training at its facilities to staff
of both Indian and foreign development banks has been widely appreciated.
Although mostly foreign institutions avail themselves of this opportunity,
individual staff members of many Indian institutions receive training every
year at ICICI.
Relations with the Business Community
4.28      ICICI's image as a national institution still derives primarily
from its near-monopoly position in India in lending untied foreign exchange
for investment. Altogether, ICICI's relations with the business community
are good; this is borne out by the fact that half of its projects approved
in the past two years involved repeat operations. ICICI has been particularly
helpful in shaping investment proposals, advising clients on project cost
and in assisting them in negotiating technical and financial collaboration
arrangements with foreign partners. (About half of its clients have colla-
boration arrangements with foreign firms.) Businessmen also appreciate
its willingness to underwrite share and debenture issues, and its capacity
to decide faster than other development banks on applications for finance.
The recent creation of a merchant banking cell (para 4.08), should enable
ICICI to offer an even wider range of services to its clientele.
V. OPERATIONS, PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Trend of Operations
5.01      Annex 10 shows ICICI's operations since 1965.  In the last two
years, the momentum gained by ICICI's business further increased, reflecting
the higher number of industrial licenses issued in 1971 and the first months
of 1972. Net approvals increased by 19% in 1971 to Rs 405 million and by
29% in 1972 to Rs 523.5 million. As before, loans for import financing
accounted for the major share (63% in 1972) of total approvals.
5.02      Loans.  The following table summarizes ICICI's loan operations
in 1970-72:
--------------- -----(In Rs Million)- 
1970                  1971                 1972

Approvals        224.8   58.8  283.6  202.5  158.3  360.8  330.4  113.5  443.9

- 14 -
5.03      In 1971, foreign currency loan approvals were 10% below the record
volume reached in 1970, but a dramatic increase (63%) took place in 1972.
Commitments followed a different trend, with 1971 emerging as the peak year.
The difference in pattern is explained by the time lag between approvals
and commitments, the latter being dependent on GOI import licenses which
are often issued only after considerable delay from the time of approval.
Disbursements increased appreciably in 1972, with undisbursed commitments
decreasing from Rs 271.5 million at the end of 1971 to Rs 220.5 million at
the end of 1972.
5.n4      Financing of a few large projects caused rupee loan approvals
to increase to a record level in 1971. They decreased somewhat in 1972 but
were still about double the 1970 level and accounted for 22% of total
approvals. Rupee commitments and disbursements also increased in these
two years to about twice their 1970 level.
5.05      Other Operations.  The following table summarizes ICICI's approvals
of rupee finance in the form of underwritings and direct subscriptions in
the last three years:
--------------------------(In Rsmilo)------------
1970                    1971                     1972

Shares  tures   Total  Shares  tures   Total  Shares  tures   Total
Under-
writings  17.8   19.3    37.1    22.5    2.0    24.5    30.7   13.0    43.7

The changes in the volumes and types (shares and debentures) of both under-
writings and direct subscriptions during the past three years reflect more
variations in projects' needs than changes in ICICI's policy or market
conditions. ICICI's share in public issues where it participated in under-
writings was 6.4% in 1971 (as compared with 5.3% for IDBI, 3.6% for IFCI,
5.6% for UTI and 11.3% for LIC). As during the previous two years, ICICI
had to take up about 40% of its underwriting commitments in 1972.
5.06      ICICI occasionally guarantees domestic or foreign suppliers'
credits on behalf of its customers. In recent years, the guarantee business
has been small. Only six guarantees totalling Rs 47.8 million were out-
standing on December 31, 1972.
Characteristics of ICICI's Operations
5.07      Size and Maturity of Loans.  ICICI continues to serve principally
medium- and large-scale firms with loans normally ranging between Rs 1
million and Rs 10 million. The smaller loans are mainly for balancing
equipment or supplementary financing purposes but also include a few loans



- 15 -
to small enterprises. Foreign currency loans committed in 1972 had an
average size of Rs 1.3 million equivalent; rupee loans were Rs 2.8 million
on the average. The average maturity for both types of loans was 10 years.
Details are in Annex 11.
5.08      Sectoral Distribution.  Annex 12 shows details of the sectoral
distribution of ICICI's operations. ICICI continues to assist a wide
range of Indian industry, largely the non-traditional branches. Of the
Rs 3.86 billion net approvals made up to December 31, 1972, 22% had gone
to chemicals and petrochemicals, 15% to ferrous metal products, 9% to
machinery manufacture and 7% to electrical equipment. In recent years
increased emphasis has been given to chemicals and petrochemicals, shipping,
and pulp and paper products. ICICI's assistance to traditional industries
such as textiles is mostly for meeting balancing equipment needs. ICICI's
clients in certain industries account for an important part of India's
manufacturing capacities (100% in aluminium and automobiles, 70% in paper,
plastics, steel tubes and steel wire ropes, 68% in cement and 34% in
fertilizers).
5.09      Geographical Distribution.  ICICI's financing remains heavily
concentrated in West India (Maharashtra and Gujarat) where a large part
of India's non-traditional industries are located (Annex 13). As of
December 1972, West India had received about 50% of ICICI's assistance
(this compares with 46% for IDBI). In recent years, ICICI has had some
success in spreading its assistance to the North (Uttar Pradesh and Haryana),
reflecting rapid development of metal working and agro-industries in these
areas, and to Bihar, where operations with Tata enterprises (steel and
automobiles) have expanded. ICICI has also made some efforts to increase its
operations in other areas through its branch offices in Calcutta and Madras
and through its collaboration with IDBI and other term financing institutions
to identify projects in backward areas (para 4.09).
5.10      Project Execution.  Since inception, ICICI has approved assistance
to 1265 projects sponsored by 777 enterprises, among them 253 new enterprises
(of which 99 were established by new entrepreneurs). Of the 1,265 projects
approved, 868 were in operation, 252 were in the planning stage and 145 were
under construction at the end of 1972. Annex 14 illustrates how the 138
projects completed in 1971 and 1972 (including 57 for the provision of
balancing equipment) fared as to construct4on periods and costs. Nearly
half of them had costs overruns and more than two-thirds had overruns in
time. The main reasons for overruns were higher prices for imported equipment
because of exchange rate adjustments, import license delays, changes in
project design, and late delivery of machinery.
5.11      Clients' Financial Performance.  Annex 15 summarizes important
aspects of the recent financial performance of ICICI's clients in operation
during 1971 and 1972. On the average, ICICI's clients earned a return of
20% on long-term capital invested, a considerable improvement over the
situation two years ago (during 1969 and 1970, their average return on
investment was 12%). All sectors except shipping, food products and rubber
products have done better in the past two years. Shipping companies and



- 16 -
producers of electricity and gas remained the least profitable of ICICI's
clients, with returns on investments of 9 to 11%. Companies with the best
financial performance were producers of electrical equipment (35% return).
Manufacturers of ferrous metal products, of glass and construction materials,
of food products and of sugar showed a 27% return.
Quality of ICICI's Portfolio
5.12      Loan Portfolio.  Overall, the repayment performance of ICICI's
borrowers has improved in the last two years. Loans with principal or
interest payments in arrears, which amounted to Rs 121.7 million (12.4% of
the loan portfolio) at the end of 1970 had decreased to Rs 107.9 million
(8.2% of the loan portfolio) by the end of 1972 (Annex 16).
5.13      The improvement in the arrears situation is a reflection of the
recent rise in the profitability of ICICI's clients, but it is also due to
reschedulings of loans. Reschedulings of principal repayments were substan-
tial in 1971 and 1972 amounting to Rs 50 million, equivalent to 17% of total
repayment received in those years. Over half of the reschedulings concerned
companies whose operations generated insufficient cash to meet their debt
service obligations. Overall, the total amount of loans in arrears plus
loans with instalments rescheduled during the year declined from 17% of the
loan portfolio outstanding at the end of 1970 to 13% at the end of 1972.
5.14      It is interesting that about 70% of the loans in arrears at the
end of 1972 had previously been rescheduled. This is an indication of the
long standing nature of the problems of clients in difficulties, but it
also reflects ICICI's practice of keeping tight repayment periods when
rescheduling loans, in order to maintain pressure on its clients to clear
their accounts (most reschedulings are postponements of instalments without
prolongation of the total repayment period).
5.15      Annex 16 gives a breakdown of ICICI's loans in arrears as of
December 31, 1972 according to their age. ICICI's core of problem projects
consists of 19 companies (3.8% of loan portfolio) in arrears over one year,
including eleven (3% of loan portfolio) in arrears over two years. In
1972, following management changes (some with ICICI's help), adoption of
new technical processes and securing of new markets, the prospects of recovery
improved for 15 of these 19 companies.
5.16      ICICI's maximum possible losses on account of its loans to problem
projects amount to Rs 9.6 million, which are well covered by ICICI's reserves
earmarked for doubtful debts (para 5.22). Altogether, ICICI's loan portfolio
is in satisfactory condition.
5.17      Investments.  ICICI's investment portfolio as of December 31, 1972
showed the following distribution:



(In Rs Million)
Government securities and
debentures                           14.0
Securities of industrial
concerns:
Debentures              130.3
Preference shares        74.5
Ordinary shares          99.1       303.9
317.9
Of these investments, 91%, or Rs 288.9 million are quoted on the stock
exchange, with a market value equal to 105% of acquisition cost. ICICI may
incur some losses on parts of its unquoted securities which amount to Rs 29
million. However, these possible losses would be more than offset by the
overall capital appreciation of the other securities. On the whole, the
quality of ICICI's investment portfolio is satisfactory (see Annex 17).
5.18      All debentures are in first class companies.  In recent years,
their market value has remained slightly below their book value (97.8% as
at December 31, 1972) because of the weight of older debentures with low
interest rates. The debentures' average yield is 7.82%.
5.19       The condition of ICICI's equity investment portfolio is illustrated
in Annex 17, page 2, which shows that ICICI's common stock portfolio is of
a better quality than its preference share portfolio. This is reflected in
the market values of the quoted shares (87% of shares portfolio) which were
98% of acquisition cost for preference shares and 124% for ordinary shares.
ICICI holds shares worth Rs 5.3 million in companies with serious operating
problems. This indicates the extent of its possible losses on its investment
portfolio. However, at present market prices, the realizable capital gains
on the sale of ICICI's more profitable stocks would outweigh by a considerable
margin possible losses on other parts of its equity portfolio.
5.20       The dividend yield on equity investments improved to 4.8% in
1972, up from the 3.6% yield in 1970 when many profitable companies were
retaining their earnings in order to strengthen their net worth after the
losses produced by the recession. Furthermore, ICICI made capital gains
(before tax) of Rs 6.8 million in 1972 on sales of shares of Rs 13.7 million
acquisition cost, 1/ representing an additional 4% yield on the outstanding
equity portfolio.
1/   Total securities sold in 1972 amounted at cost to Rs 21.0 million
(Rs 7.3 million in ordinary shares, Rs 6.4 million in preference shares,
Rs 5.9 million in debentures and Rs 1.4 million in Government securities),
but capital gains were made only on the sales of the ordinary shares.

Profitability and Financial Position
5.21      Annex 18 shows ICICI's audited income statements from 1969 to 1972.
In 1972, ICICI's profit before taxes was Rs 45.0 million as compared with
Rs 35.1 million in 1970. ICICI was able to maintain and even slightly improve
its return on total assets, which is remarkable since its spread on lending
operations (its main source of income) decreased from 3.1% in 1970 to 2.8%
in 1972. The lower spread was due mainly to higher borrowing costs on foreign
lines of credits including recent World Bank loans. This was largely offset
by a higher yield (8.7% in 1972 versus 6.4% in 1970) on the equity portfolio.
AUtainistrative expenses, which had increased by 64% in 1970 (largely because
of salary increases), were kept under control: they were 0.4% of average
total assets in 1971 and 1972 as compared with 0.5% in 1970.  Although ICICI
has been paying a 10% annual dividend per share since 1970, it was able to
add about 60% of its net earnings to reserves. The further increases in share
capital and reserves during 1971 and 1972 explain the decrease in the ratio
of net profit to net worth from 13.7% in 1970 to 11.7% in 1972 and the
concurrent decrease in earnings per share. Overall, ICICI has a satisfactory
record of profitability.
5.22      Annex 19 shows ICICI's audited balance sheets from 1969 to 1972.
In 1972, ICICI's reserves increased by Rs 15.5 million to Rs 113.1 million
(Rs 103.1 million ex dividends) or 7.0% of the loan and investment portfolio,
compared with 6.5% at the end of 1970. It is ICICI's practice to earmark
part of its reserves as reserve against bad debts. As of December 31, 1972,
this reserve amounted to Rs 15 million, which compares with specific loss
possibilities of Rs 9.6 million (see para 5.16). During negotiations for
the eighth Bank loan, ICICI agreed that this "reserve", which is more in the
nature of a provision, would not be considered as part of the borrowing
base. On this basis, ICICI's debt/equity ratio, as defined in the Bank loan
agreement, stood at 7.8:1 at end of 1972 against a contractual limit of 9:1.
5.23      As of December 31, 1972, ICI&I's net working capital exceeded
undisbursed rupee commitments by 73%. This indicates a satisfactory liquidity
position.
5.24      ICICI's cash flow statements from 1969 to 1972 are shown in
Annex 20. ICICI's debt service coverage was 1.24 for 1972. This is
satisfactory as ICICI was able to meet its debt service obligations through
funds generated from operations.
5.25      Auditors.  ICICI's accounts have always been audited and approved
without qualifications by the chartered accounting firms N.M. Raiji & Co.
(Bombay) and Ray and Ray (Calcutta). However, the scope of the audit
required by the Companies Act is not in the detail which the Bank requires
from all its client development banks and ICICI has been requested to submit
to the Bank, from 1973 onwards, a long-form report on its accounts.
5.26      Market Quotation.  In 1972, ICICI's shares were quoted between
Rs 112 in April (after payment of dividend) and Rs 120 in December, i.e.,



- 19 -
12% to 20% above par but much less than book value (Rs 213.1 as of
December 31, 1972). At the present price, the dividend yield amounts to
8.3% and the price/earnings ratio to 5:1.
VI. BUSINESS PROSPECTS
Industrial Investment Perspectives
6.01      Because of the poor showing of agricultural production, power and
raw material shortages, transport bottlenecks and slack public sector demand,
it is doubtful whether the 7% industrial growth rate achieved in 1972 can be
sustained in the next two years. However, there are some favorable economic
factors. India has now achieved a sizeable and well-diversified industrial
structure. There is a potentially large internal market for industrial
goods. On the labor front, more cooperation is evident between trade unions
and management. Furthermore, India can draw on an increasingly experienced
and relatively cheap labor force, and new professional managers in both
the public and private sector are emerging.
6.02      In recognition of India's industrial potential, GOI's approach to
the Fifth Plan specifies a target annual growth rate for industrial pro-
duction of 8.3%. Realization of this goal, however, depends on GOI's
industrial policy framework and the investment response by the private sector
which accounts for about 85% of value added in industry.
6.03      Industrial policy towards the private sector has always had to
face the dilemma of satisfying social objectives of limiting the concentration
of economic power and of better income distribution with the need for a
dynamic industrial sector. There is no doubt that the 1970 restrictions
placed upon large industrial groups have resulted in a considerable loss of
new investment. However, the recent changes in licensing procedures (para
2.09) should greatly ease these restrictions. GOI has also announced that
outstanding applications, some of which it should be noted have been
outstanding for upwards of four years, would be cleared within a matter
of months. Industry has welcomed this announcement and the licensing
changes which, combined with underlying confidence of the private sector
which was being manifested during 1972, should lead to substantial new
investment in the next two years.
6.04      On balance, and despite two drought years in succession, the
future holds satisfactory prospects and it should be possible to restore
industry as the leading growth sector of the economy. Significantly, the
main feature of the 1973/74 budget is an increase in planned capital
expenditures of Rs 5.5 billion ($733 million) or about 7% over the 1972/73
budget. This increase should serve as a catalyst for further growth in the
industrial sector. The new licensing policy has already brought about a
further channelling of resources into priority sectors: core sector projects
sponsored by large firms are progressing and the development of industries



- 20 -
in backward areas is being encouraged. 1/ Nevertheless, machinery and
equipment imports are still required to sustain industrial growth. While the
level of capital goods imports into India is always likely to be fairly
limited on account of domestic capacity, it is nonetheless vital to ensure
that imports of these capital goods which can be absorbed are made available.
These imports are required to achieve a transfer of technology, to alleviate
certain capacity constraints, and to enable production lines to be properly
balanced.
ICICI's Business Prospects and Resource Requirements
6.05      In light of these developments in the investment climate, and
supplemented by its sizeable and very firm project pipeline, ICICI forecasts
future commitments to rise annually by about 16% during the 1973-77 period.
A large increase is projected for the current year 1973. Commitments are
expected to reach a level of Rs 553 million or about 42% over the Rs 365
million committed in 1972. Much of this increase is due, however, to
commitments which were expected to materialize in 1972 but slipped into the
first months of 1973. From 1974 onwards, the growth in commitments is
expected to stabilize at about 10% p.a. Altogether, ICICI's business
projections (Annex 21) appear realistic.
6.06      A summary appears below of ICICI's expected commitments of foreign
currency loans and relevant sources of finance from September 1, 1973, the
estimated date of effectiveness of the proposed tenth Bank loan, through
December 1975. The figures include an adjustment for the effects of the
dollar devaluation in February 1973 on ICICI's foreign currency resource
requirements (in $ million):

Resource gap                          -12.0      44.0   38.0    70.0
6.07      A significant aspect of ICICI's mobilization of foreign resources
is its expected entry into the Euro-currency market. The Bank has been
encouraging ICICI for many years to diversify its foreign currency resources.
I1/ In addition to existing incentives for these areas, GOI has recently
proposed a 10-year tax exemption for 20% of corporate profits earned by
projects set up in backward regions.



- 21 -
Recently, ICICI negotiated its first $15 million equivalent seven-year
Euro-currency loan. However, GOI approved this borrowing only after
considerable delay. In the meantime, the monetary situation has become
unstable and it is uncertain when the loan can be finalized. In any case,
this first Euro-currency issue would be important because it may pave the
way for further contacts with the international money market, thereby
reducing ICICI's dependence on official funds. At this time, ICICI plans
another Eurodollar borrowing of $20 million in 1975. Of this amount,
$10 million would be available for commitments in 1975.
6.08      Assuming the successful placement of these Eurocurrency borrowings,
ICICI's incremental resource needs would be $70 million and a tenth Bank
loan of this amount: is recommended. ICICI would blend portions of this loan
with the Eurocurrency funds, since the proceeds of the proposed seven year
Eurocurrency borrowing can be effectively utilized in financing loans of
longer maturities (most ICICI loans have lives of 10 years and above) only
if they are blended with resources of longer maturities. The Bank has agreed
to this blend arrangement whereby the early disbursements and repayments
would be on account of the Eurocurrency funds and the later disbursements and
repayments on account of Bank funds. This arrangement would bring about an
only marginally longer average disbursement and repayment period for Bank
proceeds.
6.09      Projected rupee commitments which total Rs 529 million for the
period from September 1973 to December 1975 are expected to be financed from
the following sources: Rs 122 million from cash generated from operations,
rupee loan collections and sales of securities and Rs 50 million from share
capital issues in 1973 and 1975.  This leaves a domestic resource gap of
Rs 217 million, which will have to be financed by a substantial domestic
borrowing program. ICICI intends to fill the gap through further debenture
issues and direct borrowings from IDBI. ICICI is confident that the improved
industrial climate and the willingness of financial institutions (which
mobilize and hold most of the private savings in India) to invest in
institutions with ICICI's standing will enable it to borrow on that scale.
Indeed, its good relationships with IDBI, LIC and UTI augur well for the
borrowing program. To the extent that ICICI may not succeed in meeting its
domestic resource requirements, it would have to scale down the volume of
its intended rupee operations.
6.10      In summary, for the forecast period, September 1973 through
December 1975, it is estimated that ICICI needs additional resources of
Rs 742 million to finance total commitments of Rs 1,369 million. As men-
tioned above, ICICI plans further borrowings to fill its local currency
resource gap of Rs 217 million. The foreign exchange resource gap of
Rs 525 million would be filled by the proposed $70 million Bank loan. This
loan would finance 38% of ICICI's total commitments and 62.5% of its foreign
exchange commitments. At the end of 1975, the Bank's exposure in ICICI is
expected to have decreased to 78% of total foreign currency loans outstand-
ing and to 51% of total loans outstanding, compared with 847 and 55% res-
pectively at the end of 1972.



- 22-
Financial Projections
6.12      Annexes 22 through 24 contain projections of ICICI's income
statements, balance sheets and cash flow for the period 1973 to 1977. They
are based on the business forecasts presented in paragraphs 6.05 - 6.06.
6.13      ICICI forecasts an increase in net earnings averaging 8.3% annually
during this five-year period.  Net profits are expected to slip by 5.7% in
1973 mainly due to lower income from dividends and short-term investments on
the one hand, and increases in borrowing costs on the other. However, from
1974 onwards when ICICI can benefit from the higher 9-1/2% interest it now
charges on its foreign currency loans, net profits are projected to increase
again, growing at an annual rate ranging from 10 to 13%. ICICI's interest
spread is expected to average about 2.5% over the period. Also on this basis,
ICICI's profitability appears to be reasonable.
6.14      During the five years ahead, ICICI expects to maintain salaries
and other administrative expenses at the 1972 level of 5% of total income
which corresponds also to the 1968-72 average. However, if ICICI is to
engage in more promotional activities, the 5% level may have to be surpassed.
Nevertheless, even if ICICI were to spend in addition Rs 2 million annually
for staff and administrative expenses, net profits should be a satisfactory
10% of average equity during the 1973-77 period, only somewhat down from
the average of 11.4% in the five-year period 1968-72. On the basis of this
profitability, ICICI expects to maintain a 10', dividend per share, representing
an average payout ratio of 47.5%'. This is expected to be satisfactory to
both management and stockholders: a desired dividend yield is sustained
and, at the same time, ICICI is able to retain sufficient earnings to expand
its equity base sizeably.
6.15      ICICI's assets are projected to increase at an average rate
of 13% p.a. during 1973 to 1977, faster than the 10% growth rate of the
preceding five-year period. Much of this increase is concentrated in
1973 (20% over 1972) due to rising disbursements of loans spurred by the
large number of industrial licenses issued in 1971 and 1972. The total loan
portfolio is expected to grow from Rs 1,309.9 million in 1972 to Rs 2,540.0
million in 1977, an average growth rate of 14% annually. Foreign currency
loans outstanding are estimated to comprise approximately 56% of total
assets in the 1973-77 period, somewhat higher than the 51% average during
the preceding five years.
6.16      Projected income and cash flow statements indicate that ICICI's
debt service coverage will average 1.12 in the 1973-77 period, ranging from
1.07 in 1977 to 1.18 in 1976. The cushion provided by funds generated from
operations and from repayments by clients may prove to be inadequate in
some years. However, there is no cause for concern since ICICI's overall
liquidity position is sufficiently strong to meet any shortfall. It holds
sizeable amounts of marketable equity investments with realizable capital
gains (para 5.19). Furthermore, ICICI's debt servicing coverage is likely
to remain satisfactory because it has followed a policy of matching the
maturities of its borrowings with the maturities of the loans in its
portfolio.



- 23 -
6.17      Debt/Equity Ratio:  ICICI requested an increase from the present
9:1 contractual borrowing limit in relation to its equity. This request
was analysed in the context of ICICI's portfolio (paras 5.12-5.20), profit-
ability (para 5.21), debt service coverage (para 6.16), liquidity (para
5.23), exposure in single enterprises (para 4.10), IBRD's exposure in ICICI
(para 3.03) and the prospects of raising additional share capital. The
review of the first five of these aspects supported the conclusion that ICICI
is a sound institution. On the other hand, ICICI's shareholders would have
to contribute only about $6.5 million to enable ICICI to stay within the
present debt/equity limit for the next two years. This is not an unreasonable
proposition, given that the Bank--whose exposure in ICICI is already high--would
provide a further $70 million loan. Furthermore, the higher risk for creditors
implied in an increased borrowing limit might diminish ICICI's prospects of
raising resources from the international capital market.
6.18      ICICI conceded that the investment community would be willing
to absorb further increases in ICICI's share capital, particularly in
view of the 8.3% dividend yield at the prevailing market price. However, it
would prefer a higher borrowing limit mainly because of the inconvenience
involved in a further share capital increase within two years of the
previous one. Since it is possible for ICICI to raise additional share
capital without unduly diluting its profitability or increasing its pay-out
ratio, and since the lower debt/equity ratio would leave ICICI in a stronger
financial position, it was agreed during negotiations that the present
contractual limit of 9:1 should be retained.

REVIEW OF ICICI'S DEVELOPMENT
1.        In the early 1950's, India was in need of an institution which
could finance the capital requirements of private Indian industry and con-
tribute to rapid industrial development, essentially by providing assistance
to projects utilizing the latest technologies. The recommendations of the
1953 Bank mission, headed by Mr. George Woods, led to the incorporation of
ICICI in 1955. ICICI's share capital initially consisted of Rs 50 million,
to which foreign banks and corporations (30%) and Indian shareholders (70%),
mostly financial institutions, subscribed. All of ICICI's capital was
privately held. The Government of India (GOI) provided a Rs 75 million
interest-free loan, repayable after a 15 year grace period and subordinated
to share capital, and the Bank a (first) $10 million loan in March 1955.
ICICI used these funds to finance the capital needs of private companies
by extending long-term rupee and foreign currency loans and through under-
writings of and direct suscriptions to shares and debentuires of industrial
enterprises.
2.        There are two distinct chapters in ICICI's 18 year history, namely,
the periods before and after 1960. The initial five years were a period of
formation and consolidation. The first general manager, an expatriate,
was confronted by a situation where, in the early years of the Second Five-
Year Plan, the need for ICICI financing was primarily for rupee loans and
the underwriting of and direct subscription to securities. This pattern
reflected the preference of entrepreneurs to finance imports of capital
goods with rupee loans to avoid exchange risks. As a result, ICICI's level
of operations in the initial four years did not constitute an auspicious
beginning. Total commitments during this period amounted to Rs 108 million,
of which only Rs 13 million was for foreign currency loans. The organizational
structure of ICICI also showed inherent weaknesses which manifested themselves
in a difficult relationship between management and board.
3.        The Bank was aware of these difficulties and succeeded in persuading
Mr. G. L. Mehta, then ambassador to the United States, to assume the chairman-
ship of ICICI's board of directors in December 1958. Mr. Mehta's personal
contacts with decision makers in New Delhi and his intimate knowledge of the
planning machinery augured well for ICICI's future. His leadership was
complemented by Mr. H.T. Parekh, deputy general manager since 1956, who was
appointed general manager in October 1958. Mr. Parekh's knowledge of Indian
capital market conditions proved invaluable. Furthermore, he was able to
establish an excellent working relationship with the board which, also in
1958, was enlarged and reorganized. The Bank offered to contribute to ICICI's
organizational and operational consolidation and subsequently seconded
Mr. William Diamond early in 1959 for one year. His contributions were
primarily in shaping ICICI's policies and its appraisal and follow-up
procedures.



APPENDIX I
Page 2
4.        Aided by economic conditions, ICICI's operations showed a sharply
rising trend from 1959 onwards: the severe foreign exchange crisis in 1958
resulted in suspension of rupee convertibility and prompted industrial firms
to seek more financing from ICICI for foreign currency loans.
5.        The second chapter of ICICI's history dates from 1960 to the present.
Despite a relatively underdeveloped capital market, a major recession in the
mid-sixties, a 63%o devaluation of the Indian rupee in 1966 and increasingly
restrictive Government controls in the licensing area, the period has been
characterized by solid and consistent growth. Total commitments rose from
Rs 63 million in 1960 to Rs 365 million in 1972, representing a compound
growth rate of about 16% annually. Due to the nature of its resource
endowment and the overall scarcity of foreign exchange in India, ICICI has
emerged as the largest institutional source of long-term funds for imports
of equipment and machinery by private industry. This is illustrated by the
growth of ICICI's foreign currency commitments from Rs 31 million equivalent
in 1960 to Rs 214 million equivalent during last year, thus rendering loans
for imports the most important factor in its total operations. Over the
years, ICICI has built up considerable expertise in advising its clients on
adopting new teclnologies, modernizing plant designs, and increasing their
export capacities. Rupee operations, conducted through loans, undenrritings
and direct subscriptions, rose from Rs 16 million in 1960 to Rs 151 million
in 1972. Underwritings and subscriptions round out ICICI's operations by
providing to enterprises funds they might not have been able to obtain from
the capital market. Simultaneously, this approach has also helped broaden
the capital market in India. Holdings of industrial securities are more
widespread now than they were 12 years ago, and ICICI has contributed to this
development by its conscious policy of selling its holdings in firms it has
financed when corporate and capital market conditions warranted such sales.
6.        ICICI's internal growth has been substantial.  Its professional
staff increased from 51 in 1960 to 119 in 1972 and has achieved high
standards in appraisal and follow-up work. Regional offices have been opened
in Calcutta and Madras so that closer contact can be maintained with
projects financed in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, and new projects developed
in Eastern and Southern India. At headquarters in Bombay, the economics
and market research departments have been strengthened, reflecting ICICI's
pursuit of the thorough analyses of projects in a rapidly developing
industrial base.
7.        Since 1960 an increasing share of ICICI's financing has been
channelled into non-traditional industries. Chemicals and petrochemicals
constituted 23% of total industrial assistance outstanding in 1972, compared
with 12% in 1960. Shipping now accounts for 9% of the total. Machinery
manufacture, electrical equipment, rubber products, glass, pottery and
refractories all accounted for increased shares of total assistance outstanding
in 1972.
8.        To sustain the growth in its volume of business, ICICI had to tap
its shareholders through two rights issues of Rs 25 million each in 1967
and 1971, thereby doubling its share capital. Following the nationalization



APPENDIX I
Page 3
of Indian banks in 1969, the majority (64%) of ICICI's shares are now held by
public sector institutions. However, this change in ownership has not
altered ICICI's conduct of operations. ICICI's management has improved the
profitability of the institution; return on equity increased, rising from
6.5% in 1960 to 11.7% in 1972. This has allowed ICICI to increase its cash
dividend from 6% in 1960 to the present 10% on par, and to augment reserves
from Rs 7.5 million to Rs 113.1 million. Its capacity to add sizeably to
reserves and the good quality of its portfolio have ensured ICICI's credit-
worthiness and consequently it has been able to increase rupee borrowings
from Rs 175 million in 1960 to Rs 605 million in 1972. In addition, three
placements of debenture issues totalling Rs 180 million were made on terms
favorable to ICICI.
9.        During the same period (1960-72), foreign currency resources grew
from about Rs 35 million (equivalent) to almost Rs 1 billion (equivalent). The
bulk (84%) of these resources has been provided by the Bank's nine lines
of credit. The balance was mobilized from the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau
(eleven lines of credit), the United Kingdom (three lines) and USAID (one
loan). To further diversify its foreign currency resources, ICICI is presently
negotiating a $15 million Eurodollar loan. This contact with the inter-
national capital market should enable ICICI to offer a still larger range of
services to its clients.
10.       The Government has always been important to ICICI as an allocator
of business, provider of funds and formulator of economic policy. While
operating within the broad framework of industrial policy, ICICI has been
able to maintain a satisfactory degree of operational autonomy. It will
probably be able to strengthen its standing in India even more if it can
respond to GOI's suggestions to redress the regional imbalance in its
portfolio, and to become more active in the field of promotion, especially
in industrially backward areas.
11.       Through numerous appraisal and supervision missions, ICICI's
development and achievements since its inception have been followed closely
by the Bank. Over the years, the Bank has granted increasingly large
loans and gradually relaxed ICICI's limitation of debt to equity from
3:1 initially, to 9:1. Over the past five years, only those projects which
have needed more than $4 million of ICICI's resources have required Bank
approval. Initially all projects financed with Bank funds were subject to
Bank approval. For the second Bank loan in 1959, a free limit of $100,000
was established (Annex 5).
12.       Mr. Parekh recently succeeded Mr. Mehta as executive chairman of
ICICI's board. He is assisted by an imaginative, competent management team
and ICICI's role as a development bank offering services to its clients is
expected to expand further. These developments should ensure ICICI's
continued creditworthiness and its further contribution to the growth of
India's capital market. Given the Government's interest in public financing
institutions as instruments to implement economic policy, ICICI is well
placed to increase its support of tthe country's industrialization.






APPENDIX II
Page 1
ICICI'S CONTRIBUTION TO GOI'S INDUSTRIAL POLICY OBJECTIVES
(a)  Joint Sector.  Consistent with GOI's policy guidelines
to broaden public sector ownership in industrial enterprises,
ICICI has been financing joint sector companies and
negotiating conversion rights for its rupee loans in cases
where it had substantial commitments to individual companies.
As of December 31, 1972, ICICI had extended assistance
totalling Rs 138 million to 12 companies with direct
Government ownership ranging from 19% to 49% of share
capital, and it had negotiated conversion rights on 50 loans
amounting to Rs 215.4 million.
(b)  Small Industries.  In response to criticism that it had
not done enough to assist small entrepreneurs, ICICI
decided in 1969 to extend long-term foreign currency
financing to small enterprises. As of December 31, 1972
it had approved assistance of Rs 20.8 million to 66 small
units. However, this type of business is not likely to
grow much in the future since small enterprises now have
access to foreign currency funds from the recent IDA credit
to the SFCs through IDBI. Furthermore, in view of the
greater familiarity of the SFCs with the problems of small-
scale industries and their closer proximity to small units
(many SFCs have established, or are planning to extend, a
network of branch offices), ICICI should not be faulted if
it leaves the financing of small industries essentially to
the SFCs. Nevertheless, in cases of complicated project
design and technology, ICICI is justified in continuing to
assist entrepreneurs in the small-scale industrial sector.
(c)  Backward Areas.  Also, in response to GOI's suggestion,
ICICI recently has begun to assist more projects in backward
areas. During 1971-72, it participated in the surveys of
backward areas carried out with other national term
financing institutions and is now collaborating with them
in promoting and implementing promising project ideas which
emerged from these surveys. Three such projects with a
total cost of Rs 336 million have already been implemented
with assistance from ICICI aggregating Rs 22 million.
Furthermore, through its own research and contacts, it
recently identified several projects in Orissa, an
industrially backward state, and is now working on their
promotion. In September 1972, it organized a seminar on
consultancy services which emphasized more effective
assistance to industrially under-developed states. Also,
to favor projects in backward areas, ICICI announced in
1970 concessional terms for Rupee (Annex 9) financing of
projects costing up to Rs 10 million. The limit was



APPENDIX II
Page 2
raised to Rs 30 million in January 1973 in view of the
limited response to the scheme (only two projects for a
total assistance of Rs 10.4 million had benefited from the
concessional terms by December 31, 1972).
(d) New Industries and Products. Consistent with GOI's objectives,
ICICI recently entered into new lines of activity such as
financing of hotels, construction industries and barge-building.
It has also financed modernization schemes in chemicals,
pharmaceuticals and steel. Of particular importance are
its research and development projects which should help
identify further lines of industrial activity in the next
few years. In addition, the manufacture of new products
has been supported by ICICI: tungsten filaments, load
luggers and truck mounted cranes have recently been added
to the list of ICICI-financed products. Most of these
new activities will result in foreign exchange savings
through import substitution. Others, especially hotels,
will contribute directly to the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
(e) Export Performance. ICICI's clients exported products
valued at Rs 1,136 million ($156 million) in 1971, slightly
down from the Rs 1,176 million ($162 million) figure in
1970. This decline is indicative of the country's poor
industrial performance as well as the increased domestic
demand during 1971, especially for chemicals.  Metal
manufactures declined by 27% in 1971 as a result of
shortages in the domestic availability of steel and aluminum.
For some items, GOl even banned exports. However, 1972
exports of ICICI's clients are likely to have been higher
than in 1971 since industrial production and exports
increased at a faster pace. The following table illustrates
the export performance of ICICI's clients during 1971 in
those non-traditional commodities in which their share in
India's total exports is substantial (30% on the average):

APPENDIX II
Page 3
Whereas total exports of ICICI's clients declined by 4%
in 1971, the table shows the even more disappointing export
performance of non-tradit:Lonal industries as a whole.
ICICI's clients in these industries (-15%) fared only
marginally better than the national average (-19%).
(f) Factor Proportions and Employment Creation. Since
ICICI's financing is directed mainly to the non-traditional
sector, most of the projects it finances are relatively
capital intensive by Indian standards. According to a
sample of 104 projects completed during the 1967-70 period,
ICICI-assisted projects required an average of Rs 40,000
($5,333) of investment outlays for each job created. The
investment/employment ratio ranges from Rs 16,500 ($2,200)
in automobiles and cycles to Rs 112,000 ($15,000) in
chemicals. ICICI estimates that the projects it has
financed since its inception in 1955 have created over
300,000 jobs, which represents about 5% of industrial
employment in factories employing over 25 workers in
India and 11% of employment created in industry since
1955. ICICI's impact on indirect employment creation in
India is likely to be substantial and will be analyzed
by the Special Study.






APPENDIX III
Page 1
EXPANSION OF ICICI'S PROMOTIONAL ROLE
1.        Backward areas.  Despite substantial cash incentives by the
Central Government and concessionary financing terms offered by both
commercial banks and term financing institutions, the volume of investment
that has been directed into backward areas is not encouraging so far. To
a large extent, the limited success was due to the belief that financial
incentives by themselves would provide sufficient inducement to attract
entrepreneurs into these areas. However, few entrepreneurs responded as
government agencies had not given adequate attention to planning the infra-
structural and marketing pre-requisites to promote industries.
2.        In implementing project ideas which emerged from the surveys
of backward areas in which it participated, ICICI has a distinct
advantage to offer stemming from its familiarity with the modern and non-
traditional industries which loom large in its portfolio and from the
contacts it has established abroad which could be utilized in international
joint ventures. All three major national term-lending institutions (IDBI,
ICICI and IFCI) have so far extended little financing assistance to backward
areas. But ICICI's contribution is the most modest of all three of them:
only 5% of its total assistance (compared with 10% for IDBI and 7% for IFCI)
has been directed to backward areas. However, now that a number of
feasibility studies have been completed, wlhich followed from the surveys
mentioned above, ICICI plans to step up its assistance to projects in back-
ward areas. Furthermore, ICICI explained during negotiations that several
projects which it has helped promote in Orissa will receive financing from
ICICI.
3.        Early Project Involvement.  In processing the growing stream of
applications for projects, ICICI generally becomes involved at a stage
after their essential specifications (location, capacity, technical process)
have been determined by the industrial license authorities. Nevertheless,
for projects in industrialized and backward areas alike, ICICI's role in
the framing of projects is particularly important at the early stages of
their formulation. However, given the system of Government control over
industrial investment, ICICI's role at the pre-industrial licensing stage
has limitations. Even if ICICI finds that a project offers substantial
economies of scale, it is difficult and a lengthy process in practice to
obtain a change in the output specification of the industrial license.
4.        Within these constraints, however, there are a number of instances
where early project review and involvement by ICICI can be useful. During
negotiations, it was agreed that ICICI will continue to play an active part
in the early review of projects which do not need an industrial license
(as for projects costing less than Rs 10 million). Furthermore, ICICI will
collaborate with other financial institutions in the preparation of
feasibility reports and design proposals for projects in areas where industrial
potential has been determined. Finally, ICICI will establish closer liaison
with planning authorities, by providing feedback on projects where a different
licensing specification would have been desirable, whenever there is a
possibility that such representation can improve licensing decisions.



APPENDIX IIT

5.        Collaboration with State-Level Institutions.  ICICI's offices in
Madras and Calcutta have established useful contacts in their respective
regions with state level institutions and agencies as well as with entre-
preneurs. To coordinate promotional and financing activities, monthly
inter-institutional meetings have proved to be of considerable value. ICICI's
contacts with state level agencies have increased as a result of state
initiatives to promote industrial growth, particularly in the backward
districts of various states. Recently, ICICI has been working more closely
with the SIDCs which have been formed to identify and promote industrial
projects.
6.        There are two areas in which ICICI can intensify its collaboration
with state level institutions in the immediate future. The first concerns
ICICI's support of technical consultancy services, particularly in backward
states. Recently, ICICI has collaborated with other institutions in
founding an industrial technical consultancy organization in the North-East.
In extending further support to this organization, ICICI plans to contribute
to the development of five of the most backward states in India. Secondly,
ICICI agreed during negotiations to help strengthen the promotional and
appraisal capabilities of SIDCs and SFCs. Towards this end, a training
program will be offered to professionals from SIDCs and SFCs at ICICI's
Training and Development Division as explained below.
7.        Staff Training for Local Development Bank Staff.  Since 1965,
ICICI has been providing annual training courses to two officers of develop-
ment banks outside India for a period of two months. In the light of this
experience and the repeated requests from local development banks for
staff training, ICICI has now evolved a plan to provide training facilities
to professionals of local development banks, mainly SFCs and SIDCs. The
Development and Training Division will be in charge of the program and
ICICI will bear the cost of the training program. To enhance the effective-
ness of this division, ICICI plans to recruit two experienced officers.
8.        The object of the program is to upgrade the personnel of SFCs/SIDCs
by acquainting them with promotion, appraisal, follow-up and market research
techniques used by ICICI. For this purpose, ICICI proposes to invite
SFCs/SIDCs to depute every quarter 1 or 2 staff officers for 8 to 12 weeks'
training with ICICI. It is expected that 4 to 8 officers will be trained
under the program every year.
9.        Establishment of a Housing Development Finance Corporation.  ICICI
has been spearheading the promotion of a housing development finance
corporation (HDFC). During negotiations, ICICI outlined further steps it
intends to take to contribute to the development of this vital segment of
the economy.
10.       The proposal foresees the creation of HDFC as a joint effort
involving ICICI, insurance companies, commerciLal banks and existing housing,
industrial and development corporations. HDFC is to be endowed with an
initial share capital of Rs 100 million and a loan capital of Rs 200 million.
ICICI would contribute Rs 5 million towards t'ae capitalization and Rs 10
million as an initial loan.

11.       The main objects of HDFC would be to provide loans to individuals,
builders and contractors for houses, shopping centers, residential and
office buildings and housing estate developments, including low income
housing. The corporation would also promote and finance small housing
finance companies. HDFC will have offices initially in Bombay, Delhi,
Calcutta and Madras; within 5 years it will have offices in all the States.
The board will consist of nominees of sponsoring shareholders.  It will be
advised by a professional advisory group comprising architects, lawyers and
chartered accountants.
12.       It is expected that HDFC would generally borrow funds initially
at 7% and later at market rates.  Funds would be lent out at an average rate
of 9%. For low income housing, HDFC would charge lower interest rates and
would set up a special reserve out of profits.
