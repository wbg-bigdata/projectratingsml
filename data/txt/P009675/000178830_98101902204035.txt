INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCrION AND DEVEOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
(ICICI) with the guarantee of the Government of India for the equivalent
of US$70 million to help finance ICICI's operations through the end of
1975. The terms of the loan would be an interest rate of 714 percent per
annum, and repayment according to the amortization schedule of sub-projects
up to a maximum of 15 years, including three years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of India is dealt with in paragraphs 2-14 of the
President's Report of the same date on a proposed development credit to
the Government of India for an Eighth Industrial Imports Project (Report
No. P-1268-IN of May 24, 1973). A Country Data Sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
3.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's forty-first operation in
India bringing the total of Bank funds committed to US$1,180 million. For
a review of Bank Group lending in India, reference is made to paragraphs
20-2t of the President's Report of the same date on the proposed Eighth
Industrial Imports Project. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
Group operations as of April 30, 1973, and noteson the execution of on-
going projects.
4.        It is clear from the review of Bank Group operations in India,
to which reference has just been made, that as much as possible of India's
external capital requirements should be provided on concessionary terms.
Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to India has been, and
should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the amount of IDA funds
that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small in relation to
India's needs for external support, and some modest Bank lending to India
is appropriate so long as the Bank's net investment in India is not increased
thereby.  As of April30, 1973, the loans to India held by the Bank totalled
US$537  million, ol wnich US$61    million remained to be disbursed leaving
a net amount outstanding of US$476   million.   Considering the scheduled
repayment of principal, which in Fy 1973 will amount to some US$ 49    million,
and the expected pattern of disbursements, the proposed loan would not lead
to an increase of the Bank's net investment in India above the present figure.



PART III - INDUSTRY
5.        Reference should be made to paragraphs 25-32 of the President's
Report of the same date on the propcsed Eighth Industrial Imports Project.
A further note to that President's Report is added below on financial
institutions in India.
6.        The industrial sector is served by a number of financial institu-
tions. On a national level there is the Industrial Development Bank of
India (IDBI), the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), and ICICI,
the beneficiary of the proposed loan. At the states level there are State
Financial Corporations (SFCs) and State Industrial Development Corporations
(SIDCs). The first three national institutions are primarily engaged in
term lending and their assistance has been directed mainly to medium and
large scale enterprises. IDBI, an affiliate of the Reserve Bank of India,
acts as a lender of last resort in its direct operations which have been
concentrated in the modern industrial sectors.    Its indirect operations com-
prise refinancing of loans and rediscounting of b-ills from industrial enter-
prises. Overall, IDBI is the largest source of term-loans for the sector
and its operations have accelerated rapidly over -the past two years, with
approvals in 1971/72 reaching Rs 1.43 billion. An important function of
IDBI is to aid small-scale industry which IDBI does through discounting
loans made by SFCs to small enterprises. Hitherto, as IDBI did not have
access to foreign exchange resources, small enterprises faced considerable
difficulty in meeting their foreign exchange needs.    IGICI was able to pro-
vide some,but only very limited,assistance.   In January 1973,  DA extended
a credit of US$25 million to IDBI to meet the foreign exchange cost of SFC
financed projects and this credit should greatly assist the small-scale
sector.
7.        IFCIE, which is half-owned by IDBI and half by other financial
institutions, also provides foreign currency loans;      its  specialty is
financing cooperatives, mainly sugar and cotton.    Approvals have totalled
about Rs 300 million per annum over the past three years    but  only
one-third has been available for import financing. These figures compare
with ICICI's approvals of Rs 524 million in 1972, the majority of which
were for loans to finance imports. Commercial banks, the Life Insurance
Corporation (LIC), and the Unit Trust of India (UTI), also provide long-term
finance. The latter two primarily underwrite new issues and invest in
industrial shares and debentures.
8.        At the stateslevel, the SFCs and SIDCs are the most important
industrial financing institutions. Total loans approved by the SFCs have
increased sharply, reaching Rs 6h0 million in 1971/72. The bulk (about
70 percent) of the SFC's assistance has been to the small-scale sector.
SIDCs have also been providing term loans at an increasing rate but their
main task has been promotional activities.

PART TV - THE PROJECT
9.        The Bank has been closely associated with ICICI since its
foundation in l955. The proposed loan would be the Bank's tenth to ICICI
and would bring the total amount of lending by the Bank to ICICI to US$3335-
million.
10.       The project was appraised in January/February 1973 and the
Appraisal Report (No. 142-IN of May 21, 1973) is being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Negotiations were held in Washington from
May 10 to May 16, 1973. The borrower was represented by Mr. S. S. Mebta.
Managing Director, and Dr. P. Medhora, General Manager, of ICICI.   The GOI
as Guarantor has reviewed and approved the proposed loan documents.
A project and loan summary is attached as Annex III.
Role, Ownership and Resources
11.       ICICI is the principal source of foreign exchange for industrial
projects in the Indian private sector, where its role is the promotion of
large and medium scale enterprises. Ownership of ICICI is dominated by
public sector corporations including the Life Insurance Corporation of
India, Unit Trust of India and a number of commercial banks which were
nationalized in 1969, and altogether these institutions hold 64 percent
of ICICI's capital. Foreign shareholders, mainly banks, hold 25 percent,
while the balance of 11 percent is held by private Indian investors. The
Bank has been the most important source of ICICI's funds,having provided
up to end of December 1972, 55 percent of its total resources and 84 per-
cent of its foreign currency resources. Other sources of foreign currency
have been USAID, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Overseas
Development Administration of the United Kingdom. Rupee funds have been
mobilized mainly through the public sector, initially from the Government
and later the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), through share
and debenture issues, and through internally generated resources. Recently,
in March 1973, ICICI successfully floated its fourth and largest debenture
issue for Rs 80 million.
Management and Board
12.       ICICI continues to be well-managed and to operate effectively.
Mr. H. T. Parekh, who has been with ICII since its inception, is Chairman
and Chief Executive. Mr. S. S. Mehta, who had previously been Assistant
General Manager and then General Manager, has recently been appointed
Managing Director. A number of other senior staff changes have also
been made, all from within the organization, thus preserving vital con-
tinuity and demonstrating ICICI's ability to br-ing forward competent
and experienced staff. The board of ICICI comprises 15 directors of
whom six are private industrialists, three are from public financial
institutions, two represent foreign shareholders, two represent GOI
while the remaining two are officers of ICICI (the Chairman and Managing
Director). ICICI maintains a close relationship with GOI,while still
retaining operational autonomy.



Operating Policies and Procedures
13.       ICICI's policy is to promote primarily large and medium scale
enterprises within the framework set by Government industrial policy.
A major objective is to assist enterprises using newer technologies and
in this it has been successful.   ICICI has also placed emphasis upon
enterprises which are export oriented. Investment policy is directed
towards meeting the long-term financing requirements of projects. In
addition, the underwriting of share issues is undertaken, especially for
new industrialists who would not otherwise have been able to go to the
market.  In July 1972, a merchant banking cell was established with
a view to providing a range of financial services and in particular to
advising enterprises in obtaining industrial licences.
1L.       ICICI's investigations into projects continue to center on the
technical and financial aspects of appraisal. As before these aspects
are generally well handled. Management and market aspects are also
adequately covered although more attention is required on organizational
arrangements for successfully realizing sales prospects at home and abroad.
In 1971 and 1972, an effort was made to improve appraisal work by intro-
ducing probability analysis and by providing a better integration of the
project into its wider industrial context. Overall, ICICI's appraisal
work continues to be of good quality. Some new suggestions on the
application of economic criteria were proposed during negotiations
(para. 23). Follow-up procedures and project supervision are satis-
factory. Some strengthening of thbeFollow-Up Department is needed
and ICICI has proposed staff increasesto meet its needs.
15.       1CICI's interest rate for loans to finance imports was increased
in December 1972 from 9 percent to 9..5 percent per annum. However, the
standard rate for rupee loans has been maintained at 8.5 percent per annum
in view of local money market conditions. A commitment fee of one percent
per annum on undisbursed amounts of loans is also levied.   ICICI generally
insists that its clients procure equipment on the best terms and requires
them to obtain quotations from firms of international standing in different
countries. Bids are carefully evaluated and procurement procedures are sound.
Portfolio and Financial Results
16.       ICICI's portfolio is in satisfactory condition and its liquidity
is good. In particular, the repayment performance of borrowers has improved
over the past two years with the percentage of loans affected by arrears
declining from 12.4 percent at the end of 1970 to 8.2 percent at the end of
1972; part of this improvement has been attributable to rescheduling. The
amount of principal actually in arrears amounts to 2.75 percent of the loan
portfolio.  The investment portfolio, comprising equity and debentures in
industrial enterprises, represents 16.5 percent of ICICI's total assets.
About 90 percent of these investments are in quoted companies.



17.       Profits before taxes increased by 9.5 percent in 1972 despite
a narrowing of ICICI's interest spread as a result of the rising cost
of borrowing. ICICI's debt/equity ratio was 7.8:1 at the end of 1972
compared with the ceiling set in the previous Bank's loan agreement of
9:1; this ceiling will be retained under this proposed loan. Debt
service coverage at 1.24:1 is satisfactory and it is notable that ICII
has been able to increase its total reserves and provisions further from
-6.5 percent of the loan and investment portfolios at the end of 1970 to
7.0 percent at the end of 1972.
Past Operations
18.       The sectoral distribution of operations continues to be wide.
Chemicals, petrochemicals, ferrous metal products, and engineering goods
remain prominent,, while increased or new lending has taken place recently
for shipping as well as pulp and paper.   ICICI-assisted projects account
for substantial portions of the country's manufacturing capacity in some
leading industries like synthetic rubber and electrical machinery. They
have contributed significantly to employment creation and have generated
satisfactory net benefits to the economy as indicated by a detailed sample
analysis of ICICI-assisted and completed projects (para. 22).
19.       Operations tend to be heavily concentrated in the established
industrial centers of Gujarat and Maharashtra and attempts to achieve a more
diversified geographical distribution have not proved very successful de-
spite Government incentive schemes. Recently, ICICI participated in surveys
of the industrial potential of several backward states and has already
financed a few projects following from these surveys, but ICICI wishes
to intensify its efforts to identify and promote new projects in these
areas.
20.       Over the past two years ICICI's operations have continued to
expand with an increase in loan approvals of 12 percentjinLnl971 and_of
a further 29 percent in 1972. The major share of approvals (63 percent
in 1972) continues to be for foreign exchange for imported equipment, but
approvals for rupee lending increased very sharply and in 1972 reached double
the level of 1970. This increased activity is a reflection of the, rasing con-
fidence on the part of the private sector in the longer term prospects of the
economy. This confidence is further reflected in the pronounced increase
in actual disbursements of foreign currency loans which went up from an
average of US$30 million per annum in 1970 and 1971 to US$36 million in
1972. Also, whereas disbursements under earlier Bank loans, the Sixth
(Loan 414 of May 1965) and the Seventh (Loan 515 of September 1967) were
slow and only now are within sight of completion, the Eighth (Loan 683
of June 1970) has been fully coimitted and the Ninth (Loan 789 of October
1971) is almost fully committed;   disbursements of both these last two
loans are running well ahead of the original forecasts.



Projected Operations and Rescurces
21.       The evidence of rising investment demand referred to in Part III,
and the acceleration in activity noted in para. 20 above, all point to an
increased need for imported capital goods.   This need is reflected in the
firm project pipeline which ICICI already has.   It is estimated that ICICI
will require foreign exchange commitment capability of US$112 million for
the period September 1973 through the end of 1975.   The proposed loan of
US$70 million would meet the major part of this requirement. Funds are
also expected from KfW and UK lines of credit, in addition to which ICICI
intends to place, with the approval already granted by GOI, its first loan
in the Euro-market. For some time, ICICI has been anxious to diversify
its sources of funds and in particular, to establish itself as borrower
in foreign capital markets.  The proposed placement will be the first of
a series.
Joint ICICI-Eank Special Study
22.       A point of special interest is the joint ICICI-Bank Special
Study to analyze ICICI's contribution to India's economic development.
The specific objectives of this study are to assess the development impact
of ICICI financed projects through estimates of economic rates of return,
and to evaluate ICICI's role in resource mobilization. The study will also
include an evaluation of the methodology used and the practical problems
encountered in assessing the developmental impact of ICICI. Preliminary
results based on a representative sample of 42 completed projects show
that three quarters of ICII assisted projects yielded an internal rate
of return of over 12 percent and half the projects yielded more than
20 percent. While the results so far show that the capital/output ratio
has declined marginally, most of IICI's borrowers are investing in
projects averaging Rs 40,000 (about US$5,000) for each new job created.
23.       An important function of this study is to increase the attention
given to economic aspects of project appraisal. Whereas ICICI has developed
considerable competence in the examination of engineering and financial
aspects of project proposals, ICICI is anxious to refine its approach.
This subject was discussed during negotiations, and agreement was reached
on such a refinement and on the use of economic analysis as a regular part
of ICICI's appraisal work.
Proposed Loan
24.       ICICI remains a creditworthy borrower and it is a financial
intermediary through which the Bank can continue to play an important
role in providing assistance to Indian industry. The amount of the loan
has been proposed in relation to ICICI's financing requirements. The use
of the proposed loan would be limited to expenditure abroad;   the terms
would follow those of recent Bank loans to development finance companies,
including the standard commitnent charge. As in the previous loan, only
those projects which need more than US$4T million of ICICI's resources,
including Bank funds, will require the approval of the Bank.

PART V - LEGA-L INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
25.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India, the draft Guarantee Agreement
between India and the Bank the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii5 of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. There are no special conditions of
effectiveness and the draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for
loans for development finance companies projects.
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1
Ln No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing date: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date was January
31, 1967.  The implementation of the project has been affected by technical and
managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new collieries to supply
IISCO's steel plant.  The Bank, together with technical consultants, has been
providing constant supervision and progress is being made in resolving the tech-
nical issues. On the managerial side, the Government of India announced on
July 20, 1972, that it was taking over the management of IISCO for two years.
The Government has assured us that this action will not interfere with IISCO's
obligation to the Bank. On April 30, 1973, US$1.7 million remained undisbursed
of which about   US$1  million has been earmarked for equipment on order and
technical services, while US$0.7 million may be cancelled by the closing date
of December 1973. The Bank has approved some increase in short-term indebted-
ness as well as a rehabilitation program and has also agreed in principle to a
reduction in the Bank's mortgage cover.
Ln No. 414     Sixth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$48.3 million loan of May 28, 1965; Closing date:
June 30, 1973
Ln No. 515     Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$24.b million loan of September 10, 1967; Closing
date; December 31, 1973
Ln No. 683     Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3! 1970; Closing date;
September 30, 1974
Ln No. 789     Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 2   1971 Clons
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of the
business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
June 30, 1970, for 414-IN has been extended three times to June 30, 1973 and
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

that for 515-IN twice, from December 31, 1971 to December 31, 1973. Loan 683-IN
;.a2 been fully committed as of December 31, 1972. Disbursements under Loan 789-DN
rte ahead of schedule.
C No. 89       Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966: Closing
date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign ex-
change cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Ralasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has been
subject to some delays, is Dart of a larger scheme for the integrated develop-
ment of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the credit out-
standing is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery up to December 31, 1973,
and as a result, the original closing date of December 31, 1972, has been
postponed by a year.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
date: December 31, 19
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Association
has approved plans for the expansion of an existing seed processing plant and
construction of a new plant. Orders have been placed for the equipment re-
quired for the former and tenders for equipping the latter plant have been
readvertised following rejection of earlier bidding as unresponsive. A major
difficulty has arisen becauise of a lack of response to tenders for land-levelling.
This problem is being overcome through demonstrations under field conditions in
the project area for contractors. A proposal is curently under discussion', which
would permit contractors to purchase imported equipment of their choice for land-
levelling.
Ln No, 615     Telecommunications III; US$27.5 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: June 30, 1973
The project, which was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50
percent by an IDA credit (153-IN),was designed to assist in financing the
telecommunications expansion program for the first three years of the Fourth
Pl&n oeriod (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three months prior
tc 2:he closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-IN has had to be post-
poned froin December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. Although disbursements have
-taken place broadly in line with the original schedule, there have been de-
lays in meeting project targets of about six months for local exchange
installations and up to two years for some long distance works, resulting from
difficulties exDerienced by local factories and foreign delivery delays of some
key it-'¶s. In recent months the situation has improved, especially at the local
factories.

Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam, and the
resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States of Gujarat and
Rajasthan. The project also includes canalization, land levelling, the con-
struction- of field channels, drainage works and roads, and a program to
support agricultural development. The project is likely to be completed about
two years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of the prime
contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to discharge his con-
tractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by departmental force
account. Since that time the Public Works Department has been making satis-
factory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area are likely to be
more extensive and more costly than expected and may not be completed until
1978. The outlook for other components of the project remains satisfactory.
As the delays in implementation have occurred at the start of the project, and
also before major investments had been made, both investment costs and benefits
will be deferred. Thus the effect of these delays upon the economic rate of
return is not likely to be significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 203     PunJab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing date: December 31, 1973
Cr No. 226     Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.4 million
credit of January 8, 1971; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 249     Haryana Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million credit of
June 11, 1971; Closin  date: March 31, 12975
Cr No. 250     Tamil Nadu Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 milliori credit
of June 11, 1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
Cr No. 278     Mysore Agricultural Credit Project; US$40.0 million credit of
January 7, 1972; Closing date: October 31 1975
Cr No. 29      Maharashtra_Agricultural Credit Project; US$30.0 million credit
March 29, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1975
All seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9 million,
are now effective. Except for the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment, all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and
medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm
investments as tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling.   Implementation
and disbursement have been slower than was originally expected, mainly due to
delays in the institutional reforms required under the projects (hiring of
groundwater experts, changes in lending criteria and terms,etc.). These con-
straints have now been overcome and the rate of disbursement is accelerating.
A recent mission has made recommendations to GOI to further improve project

performance. By April 30, 1973, US$26.8 million out of US$35 million had
been disbursed -- under the first to be approved, the Gujarat project.
In all US$56.0 million had been disbursed by April 30, 1973.
The only major problem which remains unresolved is the procure-
ment of tractors (which account for almost 30 percent of the credits).
The imposition by the Government of India of a 40 percent import duty and
the realignment of the rates of exchange of international currencies con-
tributed to the delays. Difficulties were also experienced in finalizing
tender documents. The exchange realignment of 1971 was instrumental in
distorting bid prices to the extent that the Government had to withdraw the
Punjab tender and to re-advertise. Fresh bids have been evaluated, but
further progress with procurement is delayed pending consideration of
a request by GOI that the Association should finance indigenous as well
as imported tractors. Tender invitations in the case of the other credits
are delayed pending the discussions on the Punjab case.
Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation;  US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
The project iias designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government was considering the
procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The Government's
proposals have recently been received and are under review.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunications IV; US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing date: December 31, 197h
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and has
been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over the
last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed. Production problems
in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about 6-9 months. However,
production has now picked up and as of March 31, 1973, US$7.9 million had been
disbursed under the credit. Full disbursement is expected by the closing date
of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II;  US$75.0 million credit of May 3,1971;
Closing date:  September 30, 1975.
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 416-IN,
is designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems associated
with preparing bid document suitable for international bidding and the analysis
of Whe very large number of bids involved, but contract awards have now been
made for much of the major equipment so that more rapid disbursement can be
expected.  Disbursements should be completed by the closing date of September 30,
1975.

Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer;  US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971;
Closing date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of
fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. After initial delays, the
project is now proceeding about six months behind schedule. However,res-
ponse to tenders has been disappointing and procurement difficulties and
labor problems could lead to additional delays.
Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971
Closing date: 'September 30, 1975
This credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's
wheat belt, was declared effective on November 14z, 1972.
Cr No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing date: March 31, 1977
This project comprises the construction of a dam on the Godavari
River, a concrete-lined main canal, an irrigation distribution system to serve
100,000 ha, agricultural support services and the construction of village
roads. With the exception of the lining of the main canal, the project civil
engineering works are generally proceeding satisfactorily, and disbursements
are ahead of schedule. Bids for two canal-lining contracts, opened in March
1972, were unreasonably high, and the contracts were retendered. Again, in the
view of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, the bids were too high. Further
evaluation of the bids is now tading place in order to avoid a third tender.
The program for agricultural development, which has been falling behind schedule,
is receiving close attention by the State Government, with assistance and advise
from the Government of India and IDA review missions.
Cr No. 279     Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7, 1972;
Closing date: March 31, 1975
The engineering design for this project, for the expansion of an
urea plant in Uttar Pradesh, is now well advanced and equipment estimated to
cost about US$4.0 million has been ordered. Although delivery of some
equipment may take longer than forecast during appraisal, the project is pro-
gressing without serious difficulties.
Cr No. 280     Railways XI; US$75.0 million credit of January 24, 1972
Closing date: September 30, 1974
This project, consisting of new and ongoing works in the Indian
-Railways investment program for three years beginning April 1, 1971, is pro-
gressing in a satisfactory manner. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 294     Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,
1972; Closing date: Dacember 31, 1978
This credit, which will help to finance the establishment of
wholesale markets in about 50 towns, was declared effective on July 31, 1972.
A supervision mission has recently visited the project and has reported very
good progress in the selection, design and appraisal of individual market
sub-projects. Disbursements are expected to begin within the next few months,
ahead of schedule.
