TUNISIA. TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
(Loan 858-TUNI, Credit 329-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
Loan 858-TUN and Credit 329-TUN for the Tunisia Tourism
Infrastructure Project were signed on September 28, 1972. They amount to
US$14 and 10 million, respectively, and were complemented by additipnal
external financing of DM 40 million provided by the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau of Germany. The IDA Credit was fully disbursed in September
1978; the Bank loan was closed on December 31, 1980, with the last
disbursement made on September 15, 1981, leaving an undisbursed balance of
US100,000.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by-the Urban
Projects Division of the EMENA Projects Department. The PC9 is based on a
review of project files and documents as well as on information collected in
Tunisia during a project completion mission carried out in April 1981. The
Tunisian officials concerned effectively assisted the completion mission in
fulfilling its assignment.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion Report
was sent to the Borrawer; however, no comments were received.

TUNISIA: TOURISM INFRASTRUCTLURE PROJECT
(Loan 858-TUN, Credit 329-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1. Prepared from 1969 to 1970 and appraised in 1971, the Tunisian'Tourism
Infrastructure Project was one of the first lending operations of this type by
the World Bank Group. The project consisted in the impleementation of
transport, water, sanitation, power and telecommunication facilities to
promote tourism development in six selected coastal areas. The projet also
included the fund'ng of studies and technical assistance to complete project
preparation, train technical personnel, help project management and promote
the timely development of hotel investment.
2. Upon initial delays in the preparation of the land-use plans and final
engineering, project implementation took momentum in 1976 and was essentially
completed in 1980, three years later than originally envisaged. This,
combined with unpredictable inflation and exchange rate movements, resulted in
a cost overrun of 18% measured in Tunisian liras, or 35% measured in US
dollars. The cost overrun would have been substantially larger if the
original volume of works had not been reduced by about 30% as a result of a
general project revision jointly carried out in 1976 by the Borrower and its
lenders.
3. The institutional and economic goals of the project were generally
achieved or have good prospects of being achieved. In particular, the results
of the project economic reevaluation show an internal rate of return of 22.7%
on the total program of investments, considerably higher than the 16.3%
calculated at appraisal. Indeed, the negative effects of higher than
anticipated infrastructure costs and slower than expected tourism development
are offset by delays in the project expenditures and evidence of improved
hotel occupancy rates and operating revenues. The last two factors also
enhance the contribution of the project towards foreign exchange earnings
which, in spite of a 30% reduction of the project size, are estimated at an
additional USt276 million annually in 1980 prices and rates of exchange, or
only US$11 million less than expected according to the original project.
Conversely, the impact of the project on employment generation is estimated to
result in 8,700 additicnal jobs or 30% less than originally anticipated.
4. A retrospective analysis of the project experience allows for the
following main considerations;
-    In terms of goals and resource mobilization, the project constituted
one of the most original and comprehensive tourism projects ever
implemented. It interpreted correctly the Borrower's sector
priorities and problems;



Project implementation would have gained if it had been phased over
time in order to be more responsive to the unpredictable development
of tourismn demand. This would have spared revising the project's
program of work in 1976;
Initial delays in project implementation could have been avoided by
delaying appraisal after the exactment of the land-use plans and the
completion of final engineering studies; and
The development of hotel accommodation facilities on the project
sites could have been fostered by linking investment promotion, which
is carried out by a specialized department of the National Tourism
Office (ONTT), to the land sale activity, which is carried out by a
separate tourism land agency.



TUNISIA. TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Tourism development in Tunisia started in the early 1960s.  It had
taken place mainly at certain coastal cities (notably Tunis, Hammamet, Nabeul,
Monastir, and Sousse) where infrastructure facilities, such as water supply,
and electricity, could be made available by extending the existing urban
network. However, this development took place in a disorderly fashion and
with great strains on existing infrastructure systems.
1.02     In 1968, the Tunisian government indicated to the Bank its interest
in obtaining financial assistance for tourism infrastructure in order to
improve the level of infrastructure service to existing -.-tels while better
planning the development of new facilities. A Bank identification mission,
early in 1969, recommended that the Government prepare feasibility and tech-
nical studies.  In the same year, with Italian bilateral assistance, the
Tunisian government started the preparation of a Master Plan for consolidating
and developing beach tourism in selected coastal areas.  The Master Plan,
prepared by ITALCONSULT, was completed in 1971 and provided the basis for a
comprehensive infrastructure project for the priority tourism zones of Tunis
North, Tunis South, Hammamet/Nabeul, Sousse, Djerba, Zarzis and Kerkennah.
The project called for the upgrading and extension of road, water supply,
electricity and telecommunication networks as well as the provision of public
sanitation systems to protect the environment from pollution and health
h azards. Major infrastructures were scaled to meet the projected development
needs of accommodation facilities over 10-15 years with an ultimate saturation
capacity in land-use terms of some 174,000 beds (later scaled down to
130,000).  The infrastructure was planned also to serve the needs of the local
population.
1.03     The Bank group's involvement in the financing of tourism infra-
structure complemented previous involvement in the development of hotel
accommodations in the late 1960s in the form of financial assistance to local
institutions financing tourism accommodation facilities. By the end of 1970,
the Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI), now Banque de Developpement
Economique de Tunisie (BDET), had received some US$25 million in Bank loans
(Loans 449, 512 and 648 of May 1966, September 1967, and November 1969,
respectively), and onlent some US$14.5 million to private investors for hotel
construction. In 1969, IFC with a US$8.0 million loan, and the provision of
US$2.2 million equity, assisted the Government in creating the Compagnie
Financiere et Touristique (COFITOUR) as a specialized tourism financial
institution.  Additional IFC financial support to tourism development includes
a US$1.6 million loan (US$0.3 million equity) to the Societe Touristique



-2-
Hoteliere (STH) in 1973 and a US32.5 million loan (IJS$.07 million equity) to
the Socift6 Sousse Nord in 1975.
1.04     The Bank group has also assisted with the development of Tunisia's
various infrastructure systems on a countrywide basis and the tourism infra-
structure provided under this project constitutes a part of such system.  The
Bank group's general infrastructure loans have been as follows;

1.05     This project completion report is based on information contained in
the Project Appraisal Report (Pt-5a of May 30, 1972) and a review of Bank
files which included supervision reports and progress reports prepared by the
Borrower. A supervision mission visited Tunisia in March-April 1981 to obtain
additional information.
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
2.01     At the time of appraisal at the end of 1971, tourism had already made
substantial progress in Tunisia during the preceding ten years.  International
arrivals had increased from 53,000 in 1962 to 608,000 in 1971 and nonresident
bednights from 396,000 to 5,821,000 over the same period. These growth rates,
at an annual average of over 30% for arrivals and about 35% for bednights (the
discrepancy being explained by a lengthening of average stay from 7.5 to 9.6
days), were among the highest in the Mediterranean.
2.02     Tunisia's success in the 1960s was related to the advent and rapid
growth of air charter package tours which tapped the mass markets of the major
European tourist-generating countries.  The handicap of the sea crossing was
eliminated and Tunisia's geographical location (the closest North African
destination for the major European markets) afforded easy access at competi-
tive air transport costs.  The country's extensive beaches and pleasant
climate for most of the year were undoubted assets. The low-cost economy was

another attraction.  Finally, there was a timely investor response and hotel
capacity increased tenfold from 4,000 beds in 1962 to 41,000 beds in 1971.
2.03      At this point, the Tunisian authorities were convinced that the
market prospects were good for further tourism development throughout the
1970s and thereafter, provided that infrastructure constraints and shortages
of trained personnel were removed and a favorable hotel investment climate was
maintained. Accordingly, the target for 1.5 million arrivals was advanced
from 1985 to 1980. In the event, 1.6 million arrivals were recorded in 1980.
This represents an annual average increase slightly in excess of the targeted
9%.
2.04      Tourism growth was not smooth throughout the 1970s.  As elsewhere,
tourism traffic declined in 1973 and 1974 as a result of the worldwide energy
crisis and the related setback in economic conditions.  The sector recovered
rapidly in Tunisia in 1975, considerably faster than many other destinations,
and topped one million arrivals for the first time.  However, there was once
more a pause in 1976 and 1977, possibly as the result of special factors such
as the- closing of the border with Libya.  Since then, traffic has shown a
healthy and steady increase over the last three years, averaging 16.5%
annually, a rate in excess of double that for the Mediterranean region as a
whole.
2.05     As a result both of the sluggish performance in the mid-1970s and the
(probable) related hesitancy of the Tunisian authorities to accord the tourism
sector top priority, hotel investor interest lagged at that time so that, in
the following three years, the growth in the supply of hotel beds was slower
than that for traffic. Total bed capacity rose from 64,097 in 1977 to 71,150
in 1980, an annual average increase of only 3.5%.  As a result, the average
bed occupancy rate rose from 47.1% to 60.0%.  The latter rate is very high as
a national average for a tourist destination where the preponderance of
traffic is directed toward highly seasonal beach destinations. In fact, at
the most successful resort areas, a large number of hotels were operating at
full capacity (or even beyond) during the high season.
2.06     As a result of the excellent occupancies and the related substantial
profitability, investor interest revived and by early 1981 the ONTT had
identified tourist accommodation projects totalling 56,045 beds. Of these,
however, only 1,424 were actually under construction so that there were
capacity constraints projected for both 1981 and 1982. On the other hand,
there were a further 12,896 beds fully studied and ready for implementation.
Provided finance could be found for these additional beds and project
execution were expeditious, the capacity constraints could be eased in
1983-84. Early drafts for the tourism sector of the Sixth Plan, 1982-86, have
established a target of 40,000 additional beds (including 10,000 in seasonal
vacation villages) in operation by 1986. This would entail investments of
around TD 30 million (US$785 million). In order to maintain the profitable
1980 occupancy rates, traffic would have to increase at an annual average of
about 9%, fully consistent with long-term average growth rates registered over
the 1960s and 1970s and therefore a reasonably attainable marketing objective.

2.07     Gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism have increased steadily
each year since the early 1960s.  In 1971, at TD 53.8 million (US$130.9
million), tourism was the largest single foreign exchange earner, providing
25.3% of all such earnings.  By 1980, tourism earnings had grown to TD 259.8
million (US$632.1 million) and, although the sector had been replaced by oil
as the largest earner, it still provided 24.5% of all foreign exchange
receipts.  If the tourism section of the Sixth Plan were adopted and achieved,
gross foreign exchange receipts in 1986 would total about TD 430 million
(US$1,046 million) in constant 1980 prices.
2.08      Employment in the accommodation industry has grown steadily.
Reaching 16,500 in 1971, it increased by 74% to 28,675 in 1980.  The draft
Sixth Plan would add an additional 16,000 jobs.  In addition to those employed
in the accommodation industry, it is estimated that a further 25,000 were
employed in 1980 in other tourism enterprises, such as restaurants,
specialized local transport, travel agencies, handicrafts, tourist shops and a
variety of entertainment, sports and leisure facilities.  Furthermore, perhaps
another 50,000 were employed in activities directly supplying goods and
services to the accommodation and other tourism enterprises.
2.09      A summary of ten principal indicators of tourism development in
Tunisia since 1962 is contained in Table 1.
III. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
3.01      In preparing the infrastructure projects, the Tunisian government,
the Bank and KfW (co-financier) focused on three major objectives: (i) the
establishment of an appropriate juridical and legislative framework for
acquiring land for hotel development, providing incentives to investors, and
controlling hotel activities; (ii) the development of land-use plans for
addressing tourism development in suitable areas and protecting the physical
environment; and (iii) the provision of least-cost infrastructure to support
tourism development. In the process, the Bank's main contribution was to help
the Tunisian government in planning tourism development in accordance with
sound economic principles. For example, tourism development on the Kerkennah
Island, originally envisaged in the Master Plan, was discarded because of the
high infrastructure development costs.  The Bank was also instrumental in the
establishment of (i) the "Agence Fonciere Touristique", a land agency
especially created to acquire land for tourism development, (ii) a special
unit for maintaining and operating the project sewerage facilities which
eventually became the Office National de l'Assainissement (ONAS), and (iii)
the Infrastructure Department of the Office National du Tourisme Tunisien
(ONTT), which was assigned the responsibility of the project.
3.02     The project was appraised in December 1971 by an appraisal mission
consisting of nine Bank staff members and one consultant, covering most of the
needed technical, financial and economic specialities.  The project's program
of works and cost estimates were based on preliminary engineering studies
carried out by ONTT in association with SONEDE (National Water Authority),

STEG (Power Authority), and PTT (Telecommunications Ministry), and with the
assistance of the consulting firm SOGETHA for water supply, BCEOM for
sewerage, and STUDI-BCEOM and SCET for roads.  Preliminary engineering was
based on the Master Plan (1:25,000 scale) for the six tourism zones, with the
understanding tnat it would have been reviewed after the completion of a
detailed land use plan for each zone at the 1:2000 and 1:5000 scale. The
preparation of these plans was awarded, in consultation with the Bank, to the
consulting firms ITALCONSULT and SCET.  Appraising the project on the basis of
preliminary engineering studies based on a 1:25,000 scale Master Plan was a
major cause of the great difference between the quantity and cost of the works
implemented and those planned at appraisal. Moreover, the fact that the
project had not yet reached the stage of final design was not adequately
reflected in the loan agreement which would have needed a more general project
description.
3.03     As defined at the time of appraisal and described in the loan
agreement, the project consisted of the following parts;
A. Infrastructure works, varying according to the project zones and
including;
- the improvement or construction of a total of 196 km of main
roads, access roads and bicycle paths;
- the installation of a total of 140 km of water supply and
distribution mains, the construction of 4 reservoirs with a
total capacity of about 15,000 m3, and exploratory drillings,
development and equipment of groundwater resources in the region of
Koutine to serve the tourism zones of Djerba and Zarzis;
- the construction of a total of 113 km of main sewers with about
44 lift stations, 15 treatment and disposal facilities, and
connection lines to hotels;
- electrical installations to connect with hotels and supply them
with power from the STEG HV system, including MV and LV lines,
transformer stations and all ancillary installations; and
- installation of telephone and telex equipment in each hotel, and
expansion of local public exchanges to handle the additional load.
B. Studies and professional services for:
- preparing the land-use plans for the project tourism zones;
- preparing detailed engineering and supervising the construction of
the project infrastructure works; and
- preparing a feasibility study for sewerage treatment and disposal in
"Grand Tunis."
C. Studies for the expansion of hotel and tourism training.
D. Training of specialists to operate the sewerage treatment and disposal
facilities.
E. Promotion program to attract tourism investment in the project zones.
F. Management and equipment (including technical assistance) for ONTT's
Infrastructure Department and other project implenting agencies; and



-7-
G. Working capital to enable SONEDE to start operating the sewage disposal
and treatment facilities.
3.04     The total cost of implementing the project was estimated at DT 26.5
million or US$55 million equivalent. The financing plan of the project
included a US$14 million Bank loan, a US$10 million IDA credit, a DM 40
million German loan by KfW, and Tunisian budgetary funds for some TD 9
million. Project implementation was thus to be financed by the Bank, IDA, KfW
and the Tunisian government in the proportion of 25.4, 18.2, 22.7 and 33.7
percent, respec- tively.  Of the foreign financing 81.5% was calculated to
cover the project foreign exchange cost, while the remainder would contribute
to local cost financing.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness
4.01     The Loan Agreement specified March 1, 1973 as the date of loan
effectiveness.  The project became effective on June 29, 1973, four months
after the original date.  This delay was mainly due to difficulties in the
enactment of the legislation to establish the tourism land agency (see para.
4.04) and in appointing project staff.
Covenants
4.02     The Loan Agreement and the two Project Agreements with ONTT and
SONEDE, respectively, included a comprehensive set of covenants reflecting the
complex nature of the project and the Bank's desire to ensure effective
implementation of a new type of project.  The overall performance of the
Tunisian government in meeting the various covenants was good.
4.03     Problems were encountered only in the fulfillment of the covenants
related to the enactment of land-use plans for the project zones and the
acquisition of land for project purposes. All land-use plans were to have
been enacted by September 28, 1975, three years after the Loan Agreement
date. In the event, only the land-use plans of Tunis South and of the
Beni-Khiar portion of Hammamet-Nabeul were approved by that date.  All other
plans were approved in 1976 and 1977.  The difficulty in preparing and
enacting the plans was underestimated at appraisal time by both the Tunisian
government and the appraisal mission. This had critical consequences in
delaying the preparation of final engineering and consequently project
implementation. It would have been preferable to postpone project appraisal
until after completion of the land-use plans.
4.04     Land acquisition was the cause of delay in the implementation of
several infrastructure works.  Despite the provision of the Loan Agreement,
ONTT and the Agence Fonciere considered it inappropriate to undertake any land
expropriation in the project areas.  Also, they considered it inappropriate to
acquire land at prices substantially higher than those of previous trans-
actions of agricultural land, because this would have increased the reference



-8-
prices for further land acquisition.  The negative impact of delays in land
acquisition on the implementation of a number of infrastructure works could
probably have been reduced by planning land acquisition for all infrastructure
works earlier and in detail, and exceptionally by resorting to land expro-
pri ation.
4.05      According to the Loan Agreement, the Borrower was to have reviewed
the tourism incentive study within one year of its completion to have
determined, in agreement with the Bank, any amendments to be made to the
existing tourism incentive systems. The tourism incentive study was completed
in 1975 and reviewed by ONTT in 1976. The conclusion of ONTT review was that
the total amount of existing incentives was basically sound, but that it would
be preferable to shift them from tax and customs duties exemptions to invest-
ment grants. The proposal was accepted by the Bank on the occasion of a 1977
tourism sector review. However, since then the Tunisian government has been
reluctant to enact ONTT's proposal because the Ministry of Finance considers
it easier and more cost effective to renounce a source of income rather than
provide cash grants from budgetary sources.  The Bank's present position is
that the existing system is acceptable and there is no pressing reason to push
for modification.
Planned and Actual Implementation
4.06      In 1975, ONTT, with Bank and KfW approval, carried out a general
reassessment of the planned project infrastructure program. This was prompted
by. (i) the need for limiting investment costs inflated by the world economic
recession and delays in project implementation, (ii) tne completion of the
detailed land use plans (para. 3.02) which determined changes in the
infrastructure design, (iii) a government reassessment of the Tunisia tourism
development targets to cope with a lower than expected growth of international
arrivals, and (iv) were government attitudes toward providing hotel investors
with infrastructure incentives.  The reassessment resulted in an amendment of
the project description of schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement, including a
partial reduction in the quantity of infrastructure to be built under the
project and the transferring to private financing of components such as hotel
transformers and hotel telephone switchboards.  Subsequently, in 1979 and
1980, a few other infrastructure works were postponed because they were not
needed at that time.
4.07      The program of infrastructure works as revised in 1975 and ultimately
implemented included the following changes:
- the number of km of roads is 38% less than planned at appraisal;
- the number of km of sewerage mains is 44% less than planned at
appraisal;
- the number of lift stations is 29 instead of 44;
- the number of sewerage treatment plants is 10 instead of 13
(although in the case of Tunis North, the project will use
facilities built by ONAS to serve the northern part of Grand Tunis);
- the number of km of water mains is 10% more than planned at
appraisal because of the extension of water lines for use by local
population;



-9-
- the number of reservoirs is three instead of four with a total
capacity of 11500 m3 instead of 15,000 m3;
- the power component includes the construction of additional MV
lines, in particular in Djerba-Zarzis, replacing the implementation
of LV lines; the implementation of LV lines and MV-LV transformers
being transferred to the financing by hotel investors; and
- the telecommunications component (which was originally designed to
include the installation of telephone and telex equipment in each
hotel and the expansion of local public exchanges to handle
additional loads) provides for telephone distribution lines
exclusively; telephone lines, financed under the project being used
to extend service to the local population (PTT is assuring the
extension of telephone exchanges with its own resources).
4.08     Whereas the land-use plan, as originally appraised, indicated a phy-
sical capacity for hotel development of 174,000 beds, the 1975 project
revision recommended postponing the development of a number of subzones and
thus reduced that theoretical capacity at 130,000 beds.  The infrastructure
actually installed based on the project revision would limit hotel development
to 74,000 beds, while relatively minor infrastructure additions would raise
the latter figure to about 90,000 beds.  These constraints on bed capacity
mainly result from the phased development of critical infrastructure
facilities such as sewerage and water supply. At Djerba and Zarzis, present
serious water supply constraints could jeopardize the full utilisation of
parts of the other infrastructure works already executed.  Since the ultimate
construction of a desalinization plant could remedy this situation,
feasibility studies for such a facility were financed under the project and
completed in 1977; the Government and SONEDE are still assessing the many
technical, financial and operational problems posed by the implementation of
the facility.  Meanwile, SONEDE, with the financial assist- ance of KfW is
expanding water supply production throughout the south of the country to
provide piped water to rural settlements. Expansion of water pro- duction
would also serve additional tourism development. However, since the water
requirements of hotels compete with those of the rural population, KfW has
included special covenants in its Loan Agreement limiting the amount of water
to be used for tourism. According to the possible results of water saving
measures to be applied by hoteliers, this additional capacity could allow from
2,000 to 5,000 additional beds and postpone the need for a desalinization
plant from 1986 to 1990.
4.09     The overall implementation of the software components of the pro'ject
was carried out satisfactorily even though several of them were the object of
major organizational changes and were not financed under the project. Because
of the creation in 1974 of ONAS, the implementation of Parts D and G of the
project--the training of specialists and working capital to enable SONEDE to
start operating the sewage disposal and treatment facilities--became super-
fluous.  ONAS fulfilled the above obligations with Government funds, as well
as financial assistance from a specifically designed Bank sewerage project
(Loan No. 1088, dated January 28, 1975). Also, the financing under the
project of Part E--promotion to attract tourism investment in the project
zones--became superfluous because ONTT decided to implement it exclusively
with in-house personnel and budgetary funds.



-10-
4.10     On the otner hand, the studies for expanding the hotel and tourism
training program carried out by ILO, were instrumental in the preparation of a
hotel training project which prompted the construction of two training centers
in Hammamet and Sousse with a yearly output of 250 students each.  The project
received Bank financial assistance (Loan No. 1029-TUN) and was also completed
in 1981.
Original and Actual Implementation Schedule
4.11     The project was completed some four years behind the planned com-
pletion date of December 12, 1976. However, most infrastructure facilities
were completed with an average delay of two years, with only a few not being
completed until two years thereafter. Table 2 compares the original and
actual implementation schedule of the various project infrastructure works
through the proxy of the expected and actual expenditure profiles:

aT Includes final expenditures carried out in 1981.
The delay in project implementation was mostly due to slow preparation of the
detailed land-use plans of the project zones and problems in acquiring land
for the construction of specific infrastructure works (paras. 4.03 and 4.04).
Occasionally, project implementation was delayed by coordination problems
between ONTT and the utility agencies during critical phases of project
implementation.  Because of continuous unpredictable delays in awarding



-11-
contracts and implementing a few infrastructure works in the final project
implementation phase, the Bank had to postpone the original closing date three
times from December 31, 1977 to December 31, 1980.
Project Cost, Procurement and Disbursements
4.12     The final cost!/ of the project totals about DT 31.million or 18%
more than the appraisal estimate of TD 26.5 million.  The cost of the project
in dollar equivalent, taking into account the effects of exchange rates
changes on the yearly project expenditures, could be set at US$74.1 million or
35% more than the appraisal estimate of US$55 million.  Since, according to
the completion mission estimate, the actual foreign exchange component of the
project amounts to 48% of the total project cost (55% according to the
appraisal estimate) the foreign financing (para. 3.04) largely covers all
project foreign exchange costs.
4,13     Final costs for the individual project components vary greatly with
roads, and electricity, showing savings of 18% and 20%, respectively, and
water and sewerage having increases of 17% and 67%.  Also, land acquisition
and the cost of studies and project administration had sizeable increases.
Cost savings mainly depend on reduction of the quantity of works resulting
from the 1975/76 project revision (see para. 4.07).  Cost overruns are mainly
related to (i) delays in the original project implementation combined with the
domestic and international inflation that followed the 1973/74 energy crisis;
and (ii) the final definition of quantities and works following the completion
of the land-use plans and, subsequently, the final design of infrastructure
works. After the project revision of 1975/76, there was no significant change
in the final cost of the individual project components. Table 3 gives a
comparison between the expected and actual costs by project component and zone.
4.14     The implementation of the project called for the awarding of over 100
contracts of which 46 were for civil works and the remainder for procurement
of construction materials, equipment and professional services (see Annex
VII). Despite the large number of contracts dealing with many different
infrastructure works, procurement was satisfactorily carried out in accordance
with the provision of the Loan Agreement and Bank guidelines.
4.15     Disbursement of the IDA credit (US$10 million) and Bank and KfW loans
(US$14 m. and DM 40 m. , respectively) was slower than expected at appraisal
because of delays in project implementation. Also, on several occasions,
disbursements were delayed by slow payments to contractors as well as slow
preparation of withdrawal applications by the project implementation agency.
Moreover, in 1977 the disbursement percentage of civil works (70%) was reduced
to 30% and disbursements on the project administration expenses were stopped
in order to allow further Bank disbursements until completion of all project
works. While retaining the original disbursement percentage for civil works
1/ Including a few construction works still under implementation at the date
of the completion mission of March 1981.

would have terminated disbursement at the end of 1979, well ahead of the
completion of all project works, the change to 30% caused additional delays in
the disbursement of the Loan proceeds.  At the closing date of December 31,
1980 the loan presented an undisbursed balance of US$946,347. At the
Tunisians' request the Bank agreed to keep the loan account open for a few
additional months to allow disbursements on the expenditures of contracts
awarded prior to the closing date. Ultimately, the Bank disbursed also the
complement to 70% of a few withdrawal applications for civil works previously
considered at 30%. This allowed to complete disbursement of all the loan
proceeds but $100.000 (cancelled amount). it is expected that the KfW loan
will be closed soon. Indeed, because of the revaluation of the Deutsche mark
as well as the reduction in the volume of project works, the KfW loan would
have presented a sizeable undisbursed balance. This has been avoided because
KfW agreed, upon the Tunisians' request, to disburse the complement to 70% on
a large number of withdrawal applications for civil works on which the Bank
disbursed at 30%.
Use and performance of contractors, suppliers and consultants
4.16     Construction work completed by contractors throughout the project was
generally of good quality and only in a very limited number of cases ONTT had
to postpone provisional acceptance because of deficient standards. Coritrac-
tual litigation was infrequent, and, when it arose, resulted from differing
interpretation between ONTT and contractors on the responsibility for con-
struction delays, the effect of price escalation formulas on the contract
prices and the damage due to contractors by an unpredictable reduction in
construction quantities. ONTT has already satisfactorily solved most legal
cases and expects to do as well for those still pending.
4.17     Equipment suppliers' performance was generally satisfactory, except
for delays in the delivery of telecommunication plastic ducts.  This, as well
as organizational constraints on the part of PTT, contributed to delay imple-
mentation of the telecommunications component.
4.18     The performance of consultants employed for the preparation of the
physical planning and final engineering studies as well as the tourism
incentive, hotel training and water desalinization studies, was also satis-
factory. Nevertheless, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of the tech-
nical assistance on the project direction because, while undoubtedly some
particular types of expertise were needed in the early stage of project
implementation, the cost effectiveness of the overall technical assistance
program is in doubt, given the qualified managerial and operational staff
available within the project direction itself.
Reports and Auditing
4.19     Throughout project implementation, ONTT prepared and forwarded
quarterly reports to the Bank for information and comments. The reports were
generally comprehensive and accurate although not always prepared on time.
The preparation of reports every six months would have achieved the same
information and operational results while saving work for ONTT and allowing a
more timely submission of such reports. As required by the project agreement,
ONTT had the accounts and financial statements of the Infrastructure Depart-
ment satisfactorily audited by independent auditors at the end of each fiscal
year.

V. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
5.01     When the Bank visited Tunisia in January 1969 to identify and start
preparation of the tourism infrastructure project, a parastatal organization,
the Commissariat General du Tourisme et du Thermalisme (CGTT) was already well
established and dealt with nearly every aspect of tourism development.  After
a brief change to ministerial status, the government tourism organization was
transformed into an autonomous body, the Office National du Tourisme et du
Thermalisme (ONTT), which continued the activity of CGTT under the supervision
of the Ministry for the Economy.
5.02     The Bank's main contribution to institutional development through the
infrastructure project consisted in assisting the Tunisian government in (i)
setting up a special project unit, later on transformed into ONTT's Infra-
structure Department, to coordinate and finance the development of tourism
infrastructure facilities, (ii) establishing a specialized land agency, the
Agence Fonciere Touristique (AFT) , to acquire land for tourism development and
(iii) streamlining arrangements between ONTT, the coordinating and financing
agency, and the government agencies in charge of executing and later on
operating the various infrastructure facilities. In this respect, the project
was also instrumental in the creation of the Office National de l'Assainis-
sement (ONAS) the natural outcome of the special projects division, created to
maintain and operate the project sewerage facilities within the Hydraulic
Department (HAR) of the Ministry of Agriculture.
5.03     In retrospect, it appears that the diagnosis of the institutional
issues at appraisal and the action taken to ensure effective project imple-
mentation were appropriate and worked satisfactorily.  However, the arrange-
ment whereby ONTT acted as the coordinating and financing agency while other
agencies acted as executors was not free of problems and entailed occasional
conflicts on infrastructure design, planning and procurement, as well as
lengthier procedures of preparation and approval of bidding documents and
awarding of contracts.  While the first problem is the inevitable and often
useful result of the interaction process between a multi-disciplinary
coordinating agency and specialized execu,ing agencies, the second could
possible have been avoided by transferring to the executing agencies full
responsibility of awarding contracts and paying contractors.
5.04     Considering the good performance of the Infrastructure Department as
well as the considerable expertise acquired by its managerial and professional
staff, ONTT wishes the Department to continue as part of its permanent
organizational structure. While continuing its activity of coordinating and
financing specific integrated infrastructure projects, the Infrastructure
Department should also promote and follow up projects autonomously carried out
by other agencies as well as private developers.
5.05     The AFT has encountered funding problems.  Its original capital of TD
1.0 million was increased to TD 1.5 million only in 1981; this will allow a
limited expansion of its acquisition program. Because of its statutes, AFT
was required to sell land at the average acquisition cost plus 10% to cover
its administrative expenditures.  Only recently, and after many discussions



15-
with Bank supervision missions, the AFT has been authorized to revalue land
prices in order to take inflation into account.  According to its legislation,
in July 1980, the AFT lost its preemptive rights on the land sold in the
tourism zones. This will weaken AFT's role in controlling land prices in the
project areas and could generate speculative tendencies.  However, an increase
of land prices to market prices in the project areas appears appropriate
because it will thereby eliminate indirect subsidies to the tourism sector
through the underpricing of tourism land. l/ This problem was underestimated
at the time of appraisal when emphasis was placed wholly on fighting land
speculation.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01     The various infrastructure facilities are operated and maintained by
the relevant agencies as part of their respective national systems. Sewerage,
water, electricity and telecommunication charges and tariffs are established
nationwide on the basis of the general financial policies of the agencies.
The Bank is extensively involved in financing of water supply, sewerage and
electrification projects (para. 1.04) and, through these projects has influ-
enced such policies.
6.02     In accordance with the project agreement with SONEDE for the imple-
mentation of the tourism infrastructure project, its water rates in the
project areas were reviewed upon completion of an hydrogeological and water
consumption study already being carried out at the time of appraisal. On
December 19, 1978, a joint decree of the Ministries of Finance and of Agri-
culture established a new national tariff structure with progressive tariffs
for residential and industrial users (TD .068/m3 for the first 40 m3, TD
.110/m3 for the next 30 m3 and TD .150/m3 for over 70 m3) and a flat tariff
for tourist users (TD .220/m3).  The establishment of progressive and/or
seasonal rates for water for tourist users was discarded because it was con-
sidered too complex to apply and economically insignificant, given the
operating pattern of hotels in Tunisia. SONEDE's data on operating costs,
including depreciation of capital investments, show that the selling price of
water to tourist users in all project zones is in excess of the cost of water.
2/  Assessment of financial performance of SONEDE, including adequacy of
operations and of tariff policy, was carried out on occasion of the PCR of the
third water supply project, Loan 989, dated May 28, 1974.
6.03     Financial covenants for the sewerage and water pollution abatement
facilities in the project areas called for the establishment of sewerage
charges sufficient to cover all operating costs, including maintenance and
provision for depreciation and renewal of the fixed assets.  The presidential
decree No. 78-972 of November 7, 1978, set the quarterly charges for tourism
1/ Cost of land for hotel projects in the tourisni zones represented an
average of 4% of total investment as against an accepted ratio of up to
10% in other zones and competitive destinations.
2/ The actual economic cost of water in Djerba/Zarzis according to recent KfW
estimates appears to be considerably higher in the range of DT 0.400 per
cubic meter.



-16-
users at TD 0.750 per connection and TD 0.085 per m3 of water consumed.  Rates
for residential and industrial users are TD 0.020 and TD 0.35 per m3, respec-
tively. All charges are collected together with the water bill by SONEDE and
remitted to ONAS.  The present rates for residential and industrial users are
not sufficient to cover fully depreciation and provide for the renewal of
fixed assets. In the case of tourism users, the rates will probably meet the
above requirements when tourism development in the various pro je-t zones is
complete. The latest assessment of the operation and the financial position
of ONAS was carried out during a combined supervision mission of the first and
the second sewerage projects (Loans 1088-TUN and 1675-TUN) in November 1980.
With the assistance of the consulting f irm SOTINFOR, ONAS is reviewing its
present structure of sewerage charges.  SOTINFOR will assist ONAS to improve
and modernize its f inancial and administrative services.
6.04      The tourism infrastructure loan agreement does not include any
specific f inancial covenant for the power and telecommunications components.
This is due to the fact that the relevant facilities represent a marginal
share of overall investments in the power and telecommunications sector in the
project area and they are closely related to the additional requirements of
each local network.
VII. HOTEL DEVELOPMENT
7.01      The appraisal projected the opening of about 56,000 beds in the six
zones during the 1972-81 period, of which 13,000 would be opened by the end of
1974, thus adding to the stock of "existing" hotels, leaving 43,000 beds, to
be opened between 1975 and 1981, properly ascribable to the project as "new"
hotels. Accordingly, allowing for capacity already in operation prior to
1972, there would be a total of 89,000 in operation by 1981. In fact, there
were only 44,481 beds in operation in 1981.  Of these, 8,151 new beds had been
installed by 1981, in contrast with appraisal projection of 43,000.  Even
allowing for the delays in infrastructure implementation and thus extending
the period for project-related hotel investment until 1985, only 58,065 beds
are now projected to be in operation in the six zones (see Table 4). Thus,
only 21,737 new beds may become operational by 1985, about one-half the
appraisal's projection.  This projection is based on the number of beds under
construction or in the ONTT pipeline as of April 1981. Some of these projects
in the pipeline may not materialize, particularly those scheduled for late in
the five-year period, while others, not yet listed, may be added later.
7.02      There are probably several reasons for the discrepancy between
appraisal projections and the actual performance until 1981 (and probably
thereafter) for accommodation development.  The appraisal based its pro-
jections on a linear extrapolation of 1967-72 trends while, in the event, the
hotel investment climate in the mid-1970s, following the 1973-74 energy
crisis, became radically less propitious than previously. Once the investment
climate improved, along with increases in tourist traffic in the late 1970s,
and new investment decisions were made, the inevitable gestation delays meant
that the resultant additional capacity did not become operational until
1979-81.  In retrospect, the appraisal estimates were also optimistic
concerning a sustainable high growth rate over an extended period of time.

TOTAL              89,000               44,481         58,067
7.03     Although the original appraisal targets were not met,the Sousse and
Hammamet zones performed better relative to the other zones. This is
explained by the fact that they were, and are, the two most developed zones
and many investors prefer the security of locating in already proven
destinations.  Moreover, in the case of Sousse, a large-scale complex at
Sousse Nord (including the Port El Kantaoui) had already been planned, and
partially financed, by the mid-1970s and thus could be implemented without
deay.  In  ontrast, at Djerba the 2,500-bed complex of Dar Djerba was already
under constr\uction at loan signature and was opened in 1974 and this
substantial additional "existing" bed capacity has inhibited further
investment since.  At Tunis South, seasonality has discouraged large
additional investments. Finally, at Tunis North, delays in infrastructure
implementation also delayed hotel investment decisions, but now no less than
4,120 new beds are planned by 1985.
7.04     Under the project, AFT was established to prevent land speculation by
acquiring land in the tourism zones and reselling it to hotel investors.  How-
ever, this agency was purposely deprived of any investment promotion role, a
role which was assigned to ONTT, exclusively. This negatively affected the
implementation of an aggressive sales oriented land acquisition policy.
7.05     It has been feared that the lack of trained personnel would constrain
hotel development and the project therefore included funds for the study of an
expansion in hotel training facilities. The subsequent hotel training project
was financed by the Bank (Loan No. 1029-TUN, signed on July 17, 1974) and is
now substantially completed (see relevant PCR).  Thus, this potential con-
straint on hotel development has in the main been eliminated.
7.06     Finally, the availability of hotel finance has fluctuated and
occasionally inhibited investment. During the mid-1970s particularly, when
there were considerable uncertainties as to the future growth of tourism in
Tunisia, equity investors were looking to other sectors. At the same time,



-18-
the main Tunisian sources of hotel credit funds, BDET and COFIT, were both
giving higher priority to other sectors and/or were short of finance for
hotels. However, since 1979 there seems to have been little shortage of
equity funds for hotel investment while the outlook for obtaining loan finance
from abroad may have improved.  The large number of hotel projects recently
submitted to ONTT's approval indicates an improvement in the investment
climate and better prospects for further tourism development.
VIII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
8.01     As in the appraisal, the economic reevaluation takes into account a
larger program of investments (and related Denefits) than those specifically
financed under the project itself.  Investment costs include not only those of
infrastructure works but also those of hotels, other tourist accommodations
and other tourism enterprises, such as restaurants, recreational facilities
and tourist shops, all made possible by the installation of the project's
package of infrastructure. The benefits result from the additional receipts
obtained from tourists.
8.02      In measuring cost and benefits, a distinction is made between exist-
ing and new tourism facilities.  The former are taken to be those in the six
zones already in operation prior to 1976 on the assumption that these either
existed before loan signature or were under construction, or that the invest-
ment decision to construct them had been taken prior to loan signature.  The
reevaluation thus delays by one year, as compared with the appraisal, the date
at which tourist facilities are regarded as "new" in order to take into
account the early delays in project implementation.  Furthermore, in order to
reflect the gestation period for investments in hotels and other tourism en-
terprises, the reevaluation includes all such investments in the six zones
completed and ready for operation by the end of 1985, in contrast to the
appraisal which expected such investments to be completed by 1981.
Revenue and Cost Assumptions
8.03      Since investments in infrastructure included in the project have now
been completed, their actual costs (rendered in 1980 prices) and their year-
by-year phasing are now known. In addition, the costs of certain minor infra-
structure not included in the project have been taken into account.  On the
other hand, while the appraisal included the cost of a desalinization plant at
Djerba-Zarzis (estimated at TD 1.8 million 1973 prices), such a plant in the
event was not needed because alternative water sources were subsequently
found, and, accordingly, such a cost need not be included.  Actual investment
costs in hotels and other tourism facilities built between 1976 and 1980 (all
rendered in 1980 prices), have been used, while known unit costs in 1980
prices have been used to calculate all such investments until 1985. For all
investments associated with the project, necessary replacements were inserted
into the cost stream. Furthermore, since each investment item is regarded as
having a 25-year life, residual values are taken into account at the appro-
priate future year for each item. Finally, all customs duties and taxes
(calculated at 19% of total investment costs) have been excluded.



-19-
8.04      The gross benefits are the receipts from tourists made possible by
the project.  (Since these receipts include payments for public utilities, the
benefits to such utilities are thereby taken into account.)  For "new" hotels
in operation during 1976-80, the actual average bed occupancy rates for each
zone are used.  For "new" hotels starting operations from 1981 onwards, it is
assumed that three years from the start-up of such hotel will be taken for bed
occupancy rates to build up to the 60% actual average bed occupancy rate for
all Tunisian hotels in 1980, namely 50%, 55% and 60% in the three successive
years. For the "new" hotels in operation from 1976 or thereafter until 1980,
estimates based on actual performance are made for gross revenues.  For hotels
after 1980, average bednight revenues in 1980 are used (TD 15 per night).
Gross operating profits (or benefits net of operating costs) are calculated
26% of total revenues in the Hammamet and Sousse zones and at 24% at the Tunis
North, Tunis South, Djerba and Zarzis zones, these percentages being based on
recent average experience.
8.05      With respect to "existing" hotels and other tourist enterprises (all
those in operation prior to 1976), the analysis assumes that without the proj-
ect their occupancies would have declined because the absence of adequate
infrastructure (particularly of sewerage to combat pollution) would have had
an adverse impact on market growth.  Thus, it was assumed that 5 percentage
points of the occupancy in "existing" hotels resulted from the project and the
gross operating profits (or benefits net of operating costs) were calculated
on the same basis as for new hotels as described in the previous paragraph.
8.06      For gross tourist receipts outside hotels and other accommodations,
the actual daily average of TD 6.5 in 1980 is used. This amount is applied to
the actual total bednights until 1980 and the projected total bednights there-
after. Gross operating profits (or benefits net of operating costs) are
assumed to be 35% of total revenues for all zones.
8.07      Both the appraisal and the reevaluation exclude benefits to the local
population of the investment in infrastructure and to this extent the economic
return is understated. Also, the costs and benefits from international air
travel and tour operations are likewise excluded in both sets of calcu-
lations. However, whereas the appraisal assumed that these benefits would
mostly accrue to foreign airlines and travel agents, in fact Tunisair and
Tunisian-owned tour operators have expanded considerably since the early
1970s. Accordingly, the exclusion of these benefits probably leads to a
further understatement of the economic return.
Economic Rates of Return
8.08      The reevaluatlon shows an internal economic rate of return of 22.7%
on the total program of investments, considerably higher than the 16.3%
calculated in the appraisal.  This substantial improvement has come about as
the result of a number of variations in the event from the appraisal
assumptions. The additional beds now in the program total 21,737 instead of
the 43,000 assumed in the appraisal.  This represents a substantial reduction
in investment costs but, on the other hand, since occupancies and hotel
profitabilities are higher than appraisal projections, hotel benefits have not



-20-
been reduced in a similar proportion.  Since the already sunk costs in the
package of infrastructure physically would permit a much larger hotel
capacity, additional hotel investments beyond those included in this analysis
(if individually viable) would make a marginally greater contribution to the
program than previous hotel investments.
8.09     As in the appraisal, the analysis was modified for an economic value
of labor 25% below market wage rates and of foreign exchange 33% above the
exchange rate.  The resulting rate of return is 32.5%.  This compares with
16.9% and 20.7% for shadow wage and shadow foreign exchange rates adjustments
respectively in the appraisal (which did not present a calculation for the
combined modification).
8.10     The analysis was tested for sensitivity to a 10% reduction in total
gross operating profits from 1981 onwards.  Such a reduction could result from
lower occupancy rates than assumed, lower hotel prices, an increase in
operating costs as percentage of revenues, or a combination of these factors.
In this case, the rate of return would be 20.6% as compared with the best
estimate of 22.7%. This diminuation is proportionally less than that in the
appraisal (from 16.3% to 14.3%) because in this analysis, it has been possible
to use actual gross operating profits for the 1976-80 period.
8.11     Because of the uncertainties concerning the benefits of the project
to existing hotels (see para. 8.05) , these were reduced from 5 percentage
points of occupancy to 2 percentage points.  This results in a 17.6% rate of
return compared with the best estimate of 22.7% (14.3% and 16.3% respectively
in the appraisal).
8.12     It is thus demonstrated that for the worst likely future outcome of
the project and associated program, the economic rate or return could be above
both that projected in the appraisal and the opportunity cost of capital in
Tunsia.
8.13     Separate rates of return were also calculated for each tourism zone.
As compared with those in the appraisal, they are as follows (in %):
Reevaluation              Appraisal
Tunis North                22.1                      12.4
Tunis South                15.0                      10.9
Hammamet                   37.5                      19.4
Sousse                     21.4                      17.4
Djerba                      14.1                     17.6
Zarzis                     14.7                      15.0
All                        22.7                      16.3
The reasons given in the appraisal for the different rates of return between
zones included the differing characteristics of the hotel and tourist trade,



-21-
with respect to hotel category mix, seasonality and occupancy rates, and the
differing extent of the infrastructure backlog at the outset.  These factors
certainly had some impact.  However, the extent to which in each zone new
hotels were, and are being, constructed in relation both to the required
infrastructure investments and the quantity of existing hotel capacity are
perhaps the most important factors.
8.14     For example, the rate of return in Djerba is lower than in the
appraisal, because no new hotel capacity has been installed there, nor is any
expected before 1984, while the infrastructure investment at US$13.91 million
(or 25.3% of total project costs) was substantial.  The main reason the rate
of return, although the lowest, remains as high as it is (14.1%), is because
the substantial number of beds (7,449) already existing in 1976 derived bene-
fits from the project.  On the other hand, the rate of return of Tunis South
shows a substantial improvement because, although no additional capacity was
in operation by 1980 and only 398 additional beds are forecast by 1985,
infrastructure investment costs were comparatively low (US$3.5 million or 6.4%
of total project costs) while the existing hotel capacity was substantial
compared with such costs. Likewise, Tunis North shows a substantial improve-
ment in the rate of return even though there has been no additional capacity
in the zone (whose perimeter has been reduced since appraisal) nor is any
envisaged until 1985, also because the infrastructure investments were low
(US$3.43 million, or 6.2% of total project costs)  as compared with the
benefits to existing hotels.  Hammamet, already with the highest rate of
return in the appraisal, shows the greatest improvement in the present
analysis (from 19.4% to 37.5%) because there was the largest number of
existing beds in the zone (at 15,833 beds, about half of the beds in all six
zones), a substantial number of new beds (6,422) and modest infrastructure
investment costs (US$12.7 million or 23.1% of total project costs) relative to
the size of the existing and new hotel capacity.
Foreign Exchange Earnings
8.15     Given a persistent foreign trade deficit and the prospect of Tunisia
becoming a net importer of oil by 1986 (see para. 2.07), alternative sources
of foreign exchange earnings are of high priority.  The tourism sector already
provides around 25% of such earnings (see para. 2.07) and the project and the
associated program are providing substantial additional earnings so that the
sector will probably increase the proportion it provides of all earnings and
may well replace oil as the largest single source by the mid-1980s.
8.16     That additional gross foreign exchange revenues attributable to the
program of infrastructure and superstructure investments is estimated (in 1980
prices and rates of exchange) at about TD 114 million, or US$276 million, in
1987 when all facilities have become fully operational. This is roughly the
same amount as projected in the appraisal for 1984 (the year then scheduled
for full operations), namely TD 125 million, or about US$287 million in 1980
prices and rates of exchange.
8.17     Allowing for operating costs in foreign exchange and annual debt
service and profit repatriation on foreign investment, net foreign exchange
earnings in 1987 are calculated at about US$212 million (in 1980 prices and
rates of exchange), or 77% of gross earnings.



-22-
Employment
8.18     When in full operation, the program of investments will have
generated about 8,700 additional permanent hotel jobs.  This is substantially
below the appraisal estimate of 12,500 such jobs because considerably less
additional hotel capacity will have been installed (see para. 7.01). However,
the program will have generated an additional 8,000 jobs in tourism enter-
prises outside the hotels and a further 15,000 jobs in activities providing
goods and services directly to tourism enterprises.  Finally, substantial
construction employment has been generated.
IV. THE BANKS'S ROLE
9.01     Besides providing financial assistance, the Bank helped the Tunisian
government to conceive and plan the tourism infrastructure development within
the framework of a comprehensive sectoral approach.  The Bank was also instru-
mental in the enactment of legislation regulating the development of tourism
land, the creation of the Agence Fonciere Touristique (AFT), and the setting
up of a special unit for maintaining and operating the project sewerage faci-
lities which eventually became the Office National de l'Assainissement (ONAS),
which now has the responsibility for all sewerage facilities in Tunisia.
9.02     The need for Bank supervision during project implementation was
relatively limited, because the Borrower was in general responsive to Bank
advice.  The main discussions between the Bank and the Borrower concerned the
project composition at the time of the 1975 revision and, subsequently, the
need to concentrate hotel investments in the tourism zones and avoiding sub-
sidies in the selling price of tourism land. All discussions had a satis-
factory conclusion and prompted specific government actions.
9.03     Because the project included different infrastructure facilities, the
Tourism Department strongly relied on the assistance of other Bank project
divisions for supervising the implementation of specific infrastructure
works. Cooperation was smooth and effective although there were occasionally
minor delays in the processing of bidding documents due to the temporary
unavailability of staff. The participation of staff from the various project
divisions in the appraisal was essential in ensuring continuity between
appraisal and supervision.  Moreover, the fact that the Bank made other loans
for infrastructure developments, in addition to those comprising components of
the tourism project, helped to ensure enhanced supervision and consistent and
comprehensive policies.
9.04     In 1978, on the occasion of the discussion of a sector review report,
the working relationship between ONTT and the Bank became strained because of
different views on the potential economic returns from expanding beach hotel
accommodation capacity. The sector report warned that existing accommodation
capacity had unsatisfactory occupancy rates and that because of dilution
effects on off-season tourism demand, an immediate capacity expansion would
prejudice the overall financial and economic performance of the sector.



-23-
ONTT felt that, because of the seasonal structure of the Tunisian tourism
market, capacity expansion would have only marginal effects on occupancy rates
and consequently on hotel financial and economic performance.
9.05     From 1977 to 1980, accommodation capacity expanded very little (from
64,097 to 71,150) and occupancy rates increased dramatically (from 47.1% to
60%).  To some extent, the increase in occupancy rates was due to the limited
increase in accommodation capacity.  But, there was also a rapid growth in
traffic (averaging 16.5% annually) reflecting Tunisia's strong competitive
position and, probably, an augmented marketing effort.  However, restraining
capacity growth has not had the effect of improving seasonality, as the 1981
sector review had suggested it might. The fact that the Bank suggested a
slow-down in the development of accommodation facilities in 1978 and postponed
discussions of a possible loan to COFIT for onlending to tourism investors was
perceived as inconsistent with the Bank financing of the infrastructure
project and in particular with Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement which states
that ". . .Borrower shall use its best efforts to provide the financial
institution...with all appropriate means to finance hotel and tourism industry
investments in the project zones...".  However, a better understanding of the
Bank's position and the nature of the sector mission's recommendations was
achieved on the occasion of a subsequent Bank assessment of the tourism sector
carried out in 1979.
9.06     The present situation of the tourism sector is most appropriate for
external financial assistance to tourism financial institutions operating in
the tourism sector.  In 1979, the Tunisian government received financial
assistance from Kuwait and is presently seeking additional assistance from
other oil-producing countries.
X. CONCLUSION
10.1     In retrospect the Bank's interpretation of the Borrower's sector
priorities and problem was correct.  The project appears justified in terms of
general objectives and content as proved by the pivotal role in the country's
tourism development as well as its higher than expected ERR (para. 8.08).  The
need to revise the size of the project in 1975 was mostly the result of unpre-
dictable events on the international scene (para. 4.06).  However, that
revision could have been avoided by designing an initial project for a first
phase of a planned overall development program.  This is what ultimately
happened following the project revision but with some waste of time and some
inconsistencies in the various infrastructure investments.  A phased approach
was probably discarded because of excessive reactions to short-term market
prospect as well as uncertainties in the actual financing of subsequent
project phases.
10.2     The Bank's assessment of the Borrower's implementation capacity was
accurate. ONTT and all other project executing agencies demonstrated the
managerial and the technical skills needed to execute and operate the project
facilities effectively. However, the Bank was too optimistic in assessing the
amount of time that ONTT would require to overcome the organizational and
procedural constraints related to the preparation of the land-use plan (para.
4.11) and to coordinate the activity of other project executing agencies
(para. 5.03).



-24-
10.3     As stated earlier in the report, the delays encountered in project
implementation as well as the slow-down in the development of international
tourism following the 1973-74 energy crisis resulted in a much slower than
expected development of accommodation facilities in the project zones.
Consequently, a comprehensive and final evaluation of the project needs to be
postponed to a later stage when all hotels and other superstructure are in
place and operational.  However, it is already possible to formulate a number
of observations:
(i)   Initial delays in project implementation could have been
avoided by completing the preparation of the land-use plans for
the project zones and advancing the preparation of final
engineering for the project infrastructures before project
appraisal.  The recent Bank policy requiring completion of
final engineering before Board presentation stems from similar
problems experienced in many of the Bank's infrastructure
projects.
(ii)  Comprehensiveness and a sectoral approach constitute the main
feature of the project and make it a model of good planning.
However, these goals could have been combined with a phased
development process more responsive to the unpredictable
development of tourism demand. This would have further
enhanced the project's economic and financial returns through a
better exploitation of the infrastructure facilities.
(iii) Developing the project tourism zones through the subsequent
densification of subzones would have better suited the
operational requirements of the infrastructure facilities and
the marketing needs of hotels. This strategy is being applied
for the development of Sousse Nord, where a specific company
was created to develop secondary infrastructure and accommo-
dation facilities as well as to promote land sales. While the
possibility of replicating the experience of Sousse Nord is
limited to very few zones which present sizeable portions of
contiguous vacant land (e.g., Djerba), the activity of AFT
could be focussed as to achieve this objective in all zones.
This requires an expansion of the AFT's present role in
acquiring land and promoting its sale especially since AFT lost
in July 1980 its preemptive rights. Several supervision
missions have discussed this issue with the Government and
found positive response.
(iv)  Project financing was limited to basic infrastructure
facilities.  In retrospect, it would have been preferable also
to provide for solid waste collection and disposal, street
lighting, municipal parks and equipped recreational areas.  The
project could have also tackled the problem of using treated
sewerage water either for agricultural purposes or for garden-
ing. ONTT is well aware of the above possible improvements and
is planning their implementation jointly with the interested
local and central agencies.



-25-
(v)   The project description in the Loan Agreement was associated
with a detailed listing of the project works and relevant
quantities.  Given the programmatic nature of the project and
the long implementation period, it would have been preferable
to have had a more general project description.
(vi) In terms of goals and resource mobilization, the Tunisia
tourism infrastructure project constitutes one of the most
original and ambitious tourism projects ever implemented. The
project's success will be measured in the coming five to ten
years according to the actual growth of tourism accommodation
capacity and tourist arrivals and revenues in the project
zones.  Environmental control and integrated physical and
economic planning stand out among the major project achieve-
ments and are instrumental to an optimal growth. To ensure
that these achievements remain a lasting legacy of the project,
it is essential that the institutions built for the project
implementation stay at work and progressively shift from con-
struction to monitoring and supervision activities.  Government
is aware of this need and is taking measures to this effect.
