REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA FOR A TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.        1 submit the following report and recommendatlon on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of $14 million and a proposed credit for the equiv-
alent of $10 million, both to the Republic of Tunisia, to help finance a
tourism infrastructure project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The
credit would be on standard IDA terms. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau is
considering a loan of DM 40 million (equivalent to about US$12.4 million)
from German aid funds for the same project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-38a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 18,
1971. An economic mission visited Tunisia in March 1972 and its report is
expected to be issued in early summer. A country Data Sheet (Annex II) and
a Map of Tunisia are attached.
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural
resources. Agriculture, the largest sector in the economy, is highly de-
pendent on weather; minerals, particularly phosphate, are of low quality
and have suffered from deteriorating world market conditions. Industrial
development has been handicapped by the small size of the domestic market
and in most sectors a lack of skills and experience has been a constraint.
However, petroleum was discovered in the mid-sixties and has since become
a relatively significant source of revenue; tourism expanded rapidly, con-
tributing to regional development, employment and foreign exchange earnings.
Tunisia's traditional society is beginning to modernize owing largely to fast
expanding education and social services. In the 1960s, development policies
emphasized social objectives and assigned a major role to the public sector.
Despite high investment, overall economic performance was disappointing. A
new development strategy was introduced in 1970, whose main objectives are to
increase production, exports and employment, and to achieve this mainly by en-
couraging private initiative and reducing direct Government involvement in
economic decisions and relaxing administrative regulations.
4.        GDP in real terms increased by an estimated 9 percent in 1971,
largely because of better agricultural crops, and a very good tourist sea-
son. By now, the new Government policies have raised confidence in the
private sector, whose reactivation In turn appears to have benefited most



-2-
sectors of the economy. The balance of payments position improved consid-
erably. Foreign exchange earnings were substantially higher than in 1970,
due to higher export prices for petroleum and the expansion of tourism and
workers' remittances. The current deficit declined from $95 million to about
$50 million despite rising imports. Since capital inflows remained at a
high level, foreign exchange reserves increased by about $100 million.
5.        The improved economic and financial situation facilitated a con-
tinued liberalization of economic policies. To stimulate competition the
Government further reduced import restrictions for domestic manufacturers.
Approval procedures for new investments were considerably eased and banks
were given more responsibility in allocating investment funds. The Govern-
ment has undertaken a thorough review of the tax system, including customs
tariffs, and is now introducing a number of reforms designed to stimulate
production, encourage exports and achieve greater equity and simplicity in
administrative procedures. These developments have led to a sharp rise in
private investment projects submitted for official approval during 1971.
6.        There has been less progress in relaxing price regulations and in
reorganizing state-owned enterprises. Several of these enterprises still
experience difficulties. An inter-ministerial committee on state-owned
enterprises recommended changes in the financial structure, operation and
management of six of these enterprises but the measures so far taken were
largely insufficient.
7.        Agriculture is still the dominant sector in the economy.    It pro-
vides nearly half of the employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and
17 percent of GDP; food processing industries account for another 5 percent
of GDP and over a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural out-
put stagnated during the second half of the 1960s, due to unfavorable weather,
the effects of organizational changes including sweeping land reform measures,
and the lack of modern skills and inputs. The new Government policies, since
1969, have renewed confidence of private farmers. Due to their revived ini-
tiative and better weather, agricultural output increased substantially in
1971 and is expected to grow further in 1972. Past investments, particularly
in irrigation works, will permit expansion of production, and domestic and
foreign markets could absorb much more than is presently produced. The
sectorts future development will depend on energetic efforts to improve
methods and efficiency of production, and on increased training.
8.        Tunisia's crude oil production (primarily from the El Borma fields
in the South) was slightly above four million tons in 1971. It has tended
to level off since 1969, but recently intensified prospecting has led to the
discovery of new deposits near Sfax and in the Gulf of Gabes, which are ex-
pected to raise production to about 6 million tons per year by 1974. On the
other hand, prospects for increasing phosphate production beyond the present
level of about 3 million tons per year are uncertain, primarily because of
high production costs.



-3.
9.        Manufacturing contributes about 15 percent to GDP. Up to 1969,
sector development focussed primarily on import substitution by state enter-
prises and processing of minerals for export. Because of the small domestic
market and difficulty of increasing exports, output grew slowly. Tunisia's
proximity to Europe, low cost and relatively abundant labor and the 1969
Association Agreement with the EEC, which allows duty free access to the
Community for most Tunisian industrial exports, favor the development of
export industries. Recent import liberalization has given larger scope
to private initiative in industry and should help foster domestic competi-
tion; furthermore, legislation providing substantial incentives for domestic
and foreign investments in export-oriented industries has recently been passed
by Parliament. There appear to be good prospects for private foreign invest-
ments and sub-contracting which could make a significant contribution to
future industrial development. The Government now places high importance
on the development of industry in its broadest sense as the main source of
future growth and employment.
10.       The current economic recovery, if it continues through 1972 as
seems likely, should finally raise average annual growth of GDP during
the Third Plan period (1969-72) to a rate close to the Plan target of 6.5
percent. It also seems likely that the Plan's projected investment and sav-
ings ratios of 23 percent and 15 percent of GDP will be attained. Total in-
vestment over the Plan period is expected to be about D 670 million compared
with the Plan target of D 617 million. Over the period 1969-71, net external
financing was equivalent to 9 percent of GDP and about 40 percent of invest-
ment.
11.       The main sources of external aid have been the members of the Con-
sultative Group for Tunisia. In the last decade, the country received (in
terms of actual disbursements) external official aid in the amount of about
US$789 million, about 90 percent of which was granted by bilateral donor
countries and agencies (mainly USAID, France, Federal Republic of Germany,
Canada, Italy, Sweden and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development)
and 10 percent by multilateral sources (primarily the Bank Group and, to
a lesser extent, the U.N. and the African Development Bank). However, there
has been a considerable increase in the proportion of multilateral aid over
the period from about 3 percent in 1961-65 to 15 percent in 1966-70. Of total
aid received, 28 percent was in the form of grants, including agricultural
commodities and technical assistance, 30 percent in the form of non-project
loans and 42 percent in project loans. The largest share of project loans
was for irrigation infrastructure (about US$100 million), followed by trans-
port and communications (about US$87 million) and tourism (about US$80 mil-
lion). Total external aid received in 1971 amounted to about US$125 million.
12.       The capital budget relies heavily on external finance. This re-
flects the fact that public savings are as yet inadequate to finance the
public sector investment program. In many sectors and for important projects,
particularly in agriculture, education and other parts of the public sector,
there is therefore a need for local currency financing in excess of what can



- 4 -
be raised domestically. Repayments on external debt are preempting a large
amount of domestic and external resources. For example, in 1971 this repre-
sented over 30 percent of gross external borrowing. Domestic-savings have
increased from 7 percent in 1969 to 19 percent in 1971, but at least 40 per-
cent of investment needs between 1962 - 1971 have been financed externally.
Maintenance of a rate of investment required to assure reasonable growth
will continue to depend on a large amount of external aid including funds
to finance local expenditure.
13.       The 1973-76 plan which the authorities are now preparing, assumes
that a satisfactory rate of economic growth in the coming years will require
high investments; and although domestic savings will rise further, Tunisia
will continue to need substantial amounts of external assistance.
14.       Tunisia's foreign debt burden is relatively high:   in 1970, the
last year for which complete information is available, the debt service
ratio was about 22 percent. Restrained short and medium-term borrowing,
substantial foreign aid on favorable conditions, and higher foreign exchange
earnings reduced this ratio to below 20 percent in 1971; with prudent debt
management it should remain at this lower level in the next few years.
Tunisia's creditworthiness for borrowing on conventional terms will continue
to depend however on her ability to attract a large proportion of external
assistance on concessional terms. The Consultative Group for Tunisia, which
met in October 1971, welcomed Tunisia's new economic policies, and agreed
that for a number of years the country needs continued assistance on soft
terms which the members of the Group expressed their willingness to provide.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Beginning with a credit of $5 million for an education project in
1962, Tunisia has to date received a total of fourteen Bank loans and eight
IDA credits amounting to, respectively, $128.3 million and $48.7 million,
net of cancellations and refundings. The proposed loan and credit would
bring the total to $201.0 million.
16.       The bulk of Bank/IDA lending has been for transport. Two lending
operations for port construction, one for the railway company, one for road
construction and one for a gas pipeline account for 36 percent of the Bank
Group's present commitment in Tunisia. Public utilities come second (21 per-
cent) including two operations for water supply and one for power generation
and distribution, followed by industrial and hotel financing through Societe
Nationale d'Investissement - SNI - (20 percent), agriculture and fisheries
(11 percent) and education (10 percent).
17.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in SNI, and in COFITOUR,
a tourism development company. Its net commitments presently held in these
enterprises total US$11.3 million.



- 5 -
18.       Annex I contains a Summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IFC investments as of April 30, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.  While in the first years of cooperation with Tunisia the Bank
Group's lending primarily aimed at long term investments in infrastructure
and resource development, its focus is now on the development of human re-
sources and to mote immediately productive investments in industry including
tourism and in agriculture, with particular emphasis on increasing foreign
exchange earnings. Industrial and agricultural credit is being channelled
at an increasing rate into the economy to allow full use of earlier infra-
structure investments. The shift in the focus of Bank Group lending aims
at supporting the new policies and development strategy of the Government
described in Part I of this report.
19.       Tourism has been the fastest expanding sector of the economy.
However, infrastructure investments in this sector have been lagging behind
vigorously expanding hotel facilities. The present project aims at correct-
ing this situation and providing basic infrastructure for a further expansion
of the industry until 1981. It would be the first Bank Group operation which
attempts to meet the comprehensively planned infrastructure needs of virtually
the entire tourism sector of a country.
20.       A fifth loan to SNI and a second power project are under prepara-
tion for presentation to the Executive Directors for the next fiscal year.
Projects in agriculture (livestock, agriculture credit and rural development
in rainfed and irrigated areas) together with an urban sewerage project and
a second tourism project for infrastructure and training are expected to be
prepared during Fiscal Year 1973 for consideration by the Executive Directors
in Fiscal Year 1974. At the request of the Government, Bank consultants are
presently assisting the Ministry of Agriculture of Tunisia in reviewing the
situation of small and medium size farmers and assessing their demand for
credit. The outcome of this study, to be completed by the end of July, is
likely to be discussed at the next meeting of the Consultative Group sched-
uled for next November. The Consultative Group will also review the progress
made towards promoting export-oriented industries since the discussions held
on this subject at their last October 1971 meeting. The studies carried out
by consulting firms to finalize the Water Master Plan for Northern Tunisia
under the supervision of the Bank will also be reviewed at the forthcoming
session of the Consultative Group. No IUC investments are at present in an
advanced stage of preparation.
PART III - THE SECTOR
21.       International tourism in Tunisia started from a low level in the
early 1960s and expanded vigorously since. Foreign exchange receipts climbed
from $3 mlllion in 1961 to an estimated $110 million last year. This cor-
responds to about 22 percent of total current foreign exchange earnings and
has made tourism Tunisia's most important source of foreign exchange. With



- 6 -
growing personal income in western European countries, tourism demand is
expected to expand further in the years to come. Tunisia has a good chance
of winning a substantial part of the increasing tourism traffic if sufficient
hotel capacity can be provided. About 1.5 million foreign visitors are ex-
pected by 1980, up from 600,000 in 1971. This is the official projection on
which planning of infrastructure and hotel capacity is based.
22.       Several factors account for Tunisia's booming tourism development.
For tourists from Europe's more affluent population centers it is the closest
African country, reached in one hour's flight from Rome, two from Paris and
Frankfurt, and three from London. It has fine beaches, numerous Arab, Roman
and Phoenician historical sites, and offers a pleasant climate throughout
most of the year.
23.       Tunisia's principal tourism market is Western Europe which in 1970
accounted for 80 percent of total arrivals; 94 percent of European visitors
arrived by air. Car ferry connnections to Europe exist between Tunis,
Marseille, Genova and Sicily. However, because of distance and high cost
of boat travel, motorized tourism from Europe is not expected to increase
substantially above its present marginal share.
24.       Its location puts Tunisia at some disadvantage compared with its
main European competitors (Spain, Italy and Yugoslavia). Yet, higher cost of
air travel provides for some selection; generally, tourists visiting Tunisia
come from somewhat higher income groups and travel on fairly comfortable
budgets, spending about $17 per day on the average. Generally, the Tunisian
hotel industry caters to the more demanding tourist; holiday villages and
youth hostels represent a small fraction of accommodations offered; and camp-
ing grounds are still unknown.
25.       Domestic tourism has not kept pace with the steep increase in the
number of international vacationers, but still has grown, in number of bed-
nights, by 40 percent over the last five years.
26.       Accommodation has expanded with growing demand, from 4,000 hotel
beds in 1961 to 46,000 in 1971. During the summer months, occupancy climbs
above 80 percent. As in other Mediterranean countries, demand during the
winter months is still lacking, bringing annual average occupancy to 38 per-
cent in 1971. By offering attractive package tours for extended winter
vacations, particularly for retired people, Tunisia may find a further prom-
ising market.
27.       The industry's rapid development has not only aided Tunisia's for-
eign exchange position; it has had measurable side-effects on employment:
13,000 persons (i.e. 1 percent of the total labor force) are employed in
hotels, and a still higher share in ancillary activities such as travel serv-
ices, transportation, construction, and the supply of goods and other services
to the tourist. For the handicraft industry, international tourism opens an
export outlet, which because of noncompetitive prices, it would not otherwise
find. Finally, tourism provides economic activity for regions, such as
Tunisia's South, which have few other resources to support their development.



-7-
The Government's Role
28.       The Government intervened directly in the sector in the early
years of tourism development; a government-owned hotel company was among
the first hotel ventures but because of its modest success the Government
subsequently left a growing share to private interests, and now refrains
entirely from direct investment in hotels. Instead it promotes private
hotel development through an incentive program, which is designed to attract
foreign and domestic hotel investors. The Government's agent for these op-
erations is the National Tourism Office (ONTT), a dynamically led, semi-
autonomous agency, which took over its functions from the former Tourism
Ministry some eighteen months ago.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the Tourism Infrastruc-
ture ProJect Tunisia" (No. PT-5a) dated May 30, 1972, is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. A Loan/Credit and Project Summary
is attached as Annex III.
30.       To date, tourism facilities developed without a clear plan.   Land
was amply available, and any investment was welcome. The Government pro-
vided infrastructure, like roads, electricity, telephone and water although
not on the scale required. The limits of this laissez-faire approach are
becoming evident. Land for further development is becoming scarce, and
pollution a problem. Only planned development can lead to better use of
the remaining beaches. Public sewerage services will have to be provided if
pollution of beach areas caused by hotels and nearby urban areas is not to
restrain tourism growth. The Government early realized these needs, partly
by learning from experience made by other Mediterranean countries that un-
planned development can lead to an early exhaustion of their tourism re-
sources. In 1968, it embarked on a sector-wide planning exercise. Starting
from an investigation of market prospects, the Italian consultant bureau
ITALCONSULT studied Tunisia's physical development potential for tourism
and worked out a comprehensive framework for an integrated sector plan
which covers investment needs until 1985.
31.       The present project is largely based on this study and aims at
implementing the first phase of an infrastructure program proposed in this
study. The Government has selected six coastal zones covering a total of
36,500 hectares for this program. From North to South these zones are
(see map): Tunis-North (2,575 hectares), Tunis-South (4,750 hectares),
Hammamet including Nabeul (8,000 hectares), Sousse (4,475 hectares), Djerba
(9,600 hectares), and Zarzis (7,100 hectares). Already today, these zones
contain more than half of Tunisiats hotel capacity. In the absence of master
plans and zoning regulations, hotels in these zones to date were built in a
haphazard fashion, mostly along the coastline. They are generally self-
contained and offer their patrons all necessary services including night-



- 8 -
clubs, bars and shopping-bazaars on the site. As a result of this ribbon-
like development, beaches are "under-utilized" and hotel guests are isolated
from towns and villages.
32.       The proposed project was appraised in November and December 1971.
Negotiations were held in Washington in April and May 1972. The Borrower
was represented by Mr. Ridha Azzabi, Director General of the National Tourism
Office (ONTT). A delegation of KfW, headed by Mr. Hopfen, Director of the
Africa Department, attended part of the negotiations.
Project Organization
33.       The National Tourism Office -- ONTT -- (see para. 28 above) which
has been responsible for project preparation, will be in charge of the
project's overall planning, financing and supervision. Technical execution
would rest with five public agencies and corporations traditionally in charge
of the infrastructure works included in the project. This would be the
Ministry of Agriculture for sewerage works, the Ministry of Public Works
for road construction, the national water supply company, SONEDE, for water
works, the public power company, STEG, for power distribution, and the
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications for telecommunications installations.
A central project unit ("Direction des Travaux") would be set up in ONTT.
One of its first functions will be to formulate by using a "critical path
method" (CPM), a coordinated plan and schedule for the execution of the var-
ious studies and ensuing project works. A preliminary version, covering
the immediate steps to be undertaken, will be prepared before effectiveness.
Cooperation between ONTT and the five agencies and corporations will be
assured through a standing committee, in which all agencies will be repre-
sented and which will be chaired by ONTT's director-general. Procedures
for ONTT's cooperation with these agencies and corporations have been agreed
upon in five protocols. Two special units will be created in the Ministries
of Agriculture and Public Works to oversee execution of sewerage works and
road construction. All units will be staffed with the assistance of con-
sultants. ONTT will budget all project expenditure, award and sign con-
tracts upon advice from the technical agencies and corporations, and reim-
burse them for work done on force account.
34.       The five agencies and corporations would operate and maintain the
project installations, with the exception of sewerage installations which
SONEDE would take over from the Ministry of Agriculture upon their comple-
tion in order to operate and maintain them.
Major Project Components
35.       The project includes three major components:   (i) preparation of
master plans; (ii) infrastructure works; (iii) project operations and studies.



-9-
(i) Preparation of Master Plans
36.       Detailed master plans will be prepared as part of the project, in
order to assure the integrated planning of the six zones (hereinafter referred
to as "project zones"). They will be comprehensive and are to include exist-
ing communities. Hotels and tourism facilities will be grouped in clusters
to make more economic use of the seafront and to preserve the landscape and
architectural character of each region. ITALCONSULT and SCET-Cooperation
have been retained to work out the master plans for the project zones within
eighteen months after loan signature. These plans will be based on the plan-
ning exercise completed by ITALCONSULT in 1971. The Government has prepared
legislation which will enable enforcement of these plans. These planning
services are estimated to cost about $1.9 million, including price contin-
gencies.
(ii) Infrastructure Works
37.       The project provides for infrastructure which would allow for
hotel construction in the project zones providing about 43,000 additional
beds by 1981, but would also meet the needs of existing hotels for which in-
frastructure, particularly sewerage, is insufficient or lacking. In order
of importance the project includes sewerage works, roads, water supply,
electricity and telecommunications. Together with land acquisition and
contingencies, these components have an estimated total cost of about
$46.6 million. This amount would cover all major infrastructure works such
as sewerage treatment and disposal facilities, main collectors and pumping
stations, main water supply lines and reservoirs, as well as trunk roads.
Major works will provide enough capacity to meet demand through 1981, except
for water supply works in Djerba and Zarzis where known groundwater resources
will support hotel expansion only through 1979. To supply hotels constructed
after that date it will be necessary to resort to desalination or to mining
of water, and exploration of these possiblities will be financed under the
project. The major works should be completed in four years, by the end of
1976. Up to that year the project would also cover "minor works", that is
in particular all hotel connections for sewerage, roads, water supply, elec-
tricity and telecommunications.
(iii) Project Operations and Studies
38.       The project will cover the personnel and equipment expenditure of
the project unit in ONTT and of the two special units in the Ministries of
Agriculture and of Public Works, as well as the cost of consultants' assis-
tance to these units. It would include the cost of detailed engineering of
civil works in sewerage, roads and water supply, as well as construction
and operation of a pilot stabilization pond in the Sousse area. This pond
would enable the Government to decide on the most appropriate choice of
sewage treatment for that area. In addition, the project provides for a
feasibility study on improved sewage treatment in the Greater Tunis Area,
where inadequate sewerage represents a growing health hazard for the local



- 10 -
population. This study would provide the basis for an urban sewerage proj-
ect which the Bank may eventually finance. Also related to the project's
sewerage component would be a training program for specialists who will
operate the sewage treatment and disposal facilities included in the proj-
ect. The costs of this program are also part of the project.
39.       Existing hotel training schools are not sufficient to meet the
personnel requirements of the growing tourism sector, and the project pro-
vides funds to meet the cost of studying the need for expanded facilities.
It further provides funds for investment promotion, aimed at attracting
local and foreign investment into the Tunisian hotel sector.
40.       For project operations and studies, as mentioned in paras. 38 and
39, the project includes an amount of about $6.5 million.
41.       Following is a summary of project cost including contingencies
(in US$ million):

24.2     30.8      55.0
These cost estimates include taxes and import duties.   The foreign exchange
component of the project would be about 56 percent.
Particular Project Features
42.       An important aspect of the project is its organization, as des-
cribed in paragraph 33. Instead of adding a new organization to existing
ones for project execution the project will rely on the present setup which
will be reinforced by qualified Tunisian or expatriate experts. The notion
of a task force including different and independent agencies formed to carry
out a particular project is new to Tunisia, and represents a promising
attempt at modernizing its rigid administrative structures.
43.       An interesting solution has been suggested for the control of land
transactions. The Government is well aware of the need to hold down land
prices if, in the longer run, it wants to attract investors into the project



- 11 -
zones. At the same time, it intends to prevent land speculation and wind-
fall gains for reasons of social justice. All this would be achieved through
legislative and organizational measures. The project zones would be declared
tourism development areas. Under proposed legislation (whose enactment by
Parliament will be a condition for loan and credit effectiveness) the Gov-
ernment would have the power to control land transfer, and to expropriate
land in these areas in the interest of assuring sound tourism development.
For this purpose a public land corporation (Agence Fonciere) is being
created (its creation is likewise a condition for loan and credit effective-
ness) which in close cooperation with ONTT will buy up or expropriate land
required for tourism installations, and sell it to investors. The investor
would be required to use the land for the purposes set by ONTT. Any use for
other purposes would lead to forfeiture of ownership. The corporation will
have an initial capital of D 1 million (about $2.1 million). This fund
would revolve and replenish itself as land is sold to investors.
44.       The success of the project will depend largely on the pace at which
investment in superstructure, that is mainly hotels, follows the implementa-
tion of the infrastructure program. With the favorable market prospects for
Tunisia's tourism industry, it should not be difficult to mobilize sufficient
funds for hotel construction. An estimated $220 million would be required
for the construction of 43,000 additional hotel beds in the project zones
over an eight year period from 1973 through 1980. In the light of past
Tunisian experience, about 60 percent of this amount or $132 million would
be in the form of loans and the balance in equity. An amount of $16 million
in loan funds would thus be necessary per year. This amount could be provided
by Tunisia's two long-term lending institutions, SNI and COFITOUR. Equity
would be provided by Tunisian and foreign investors, and COFITOUR and its
shareholders, among them well-known international tourism interests and IFC,
would play an important role in attracting such foreign investment. To in-
duce more domestic and foreign capital to invest in hotels, the Government
intends to launch a promotional campaign for which $310,000 will be available
under the project (see para. 39 above). Furthermore, under a covenant of the
loan agreement, the Government undertakes to make its best efforts to ensure
that adequate funds are available to potential investors.
45.       Furthermore, the Government intends to concentrate its future
investment promotion in the six project zones, and give special encouragement
to tourism promoters in these zones. At present, the Government provides
throughout the country minor infrastructure works for new hotels, allows
duty free import of required materials, exempts new hotels for five years
from profits tax, and grants a three percent interest bonus on all domestic
loans for hotel construction. The level of these incentives is probably
not out of line when compared to that of other Mediterranean countries with
which Tunisia competes for tourists from western Europe. However, the
existing system has serious shortcomings: procedures are cumbersome, pay-
ments are often made after long delays, and all investment is treated
equally, irrespective of economic priority. Under a covenant of the proj-
ect agreement, ONTT will review, within eighteeen months, this system and



- 12 -
recommend more selective measures of promoting investment, which then would
provide more favorable incentives to project zones. Tunisia will review
the study carried out by ONTT and determine, in agreement with the Bank and
the Association, any amendment to be made to the existing incentive system.
Co-Financing Arrangements
46.       The Bank loan of US$14 million and the IDA credit of US$10 million
would cover about 43.6 percent of total cost. German bilateral aid for the
project through a loan by Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW) of up to
DM 40 million (about US$12.4 million equivalent) would provide 22.6 per-
cent of total cost. This loan would probably be for 30 years, including
10 years of grace at 2 percent annual interest. Civil works and equipment
in the two southern zones, Djerba and Zarzis, would be primarily financed
from German funds, while Bank/IDA funds would be used for financing equip-
ment and civil works in the four other zones. All other cost would be met
jointly. Substantial German aid funds have previously been invested in
Djerba and Zarzis in roads, water supply and in the Djerba International
Airport, and the German funds provided under the present project would com-
plement these previous investments.
-47.       Under the financing arrangements with KfW, uniform project ad-
ministration would be assured.   The Bank/IDA would primarily be in charge
of procurement supervision.   However, disbursements would be separate for
civil works and equipment for the Djerba and Zarzia zones and the other
four project zones.   Parallel disbursements are foreseen for all ex-
penditure on consultants' services, and administration. Both institutions
would later, subject to consultation, allow the use of savings made in
Djerba/Zarzis for other zones and vice versa. Since this arrangement would
only effect disbursement procedures, it should not put an unreasonable ad-
ministrative burden on ONTT or jeopardize the project's organization.
Procurement
48.       Civil works other than minor works and equipment contracts, includ-
ing those to be financed by KfW, would be internationally tendered on the
basis of the Bank and IDA guidelines.   On equipment, local suppliers would
\ enjoy a 15 percent preference on the c.i.f. price of competing imports, or
of the level of import duty whichever is lower.   Under its association agree-
ment with the EEC, Tunisia has preferential tariff arrangements in favor of
EEC countries.  However, bids for equipment for the project will not be in-
! tited for some six months and their evaluation will then confonm to whatever
; policy the Bank has on this subject at that time.
Local Cost Financing
49.       The Bank, IDA and KfW would together finance some US$5.6 million
local cost amounting to 23 percent of total local cost (US$3.7 million by
Bank/IDA and US$1.9 million by KfW). This amount of local cost financing
from external funds is justified for the reasons given in para. 12 above.

Economic Analysis
50.       The project would generate substantial new revenue for Tunisia's
tourism industry. When comparing expected revenues to expected cost which,
together with the cost of the project, would include the expenditure on
later hotel construction, net benefits would represent an internal economic
return of 16.3 percent.   This would assume an average life time of 25 years
for infrastructure investments under the project. This rate of return, when
tested for its sensitivity, did not fall below 12.8 percent.
51.       The project would have considerable impact on Tunisia's balance
of payments. Incremental annual foreign exchange earnings are expected to
amount to $14 million in 1975, and to rise gradually to $97 million per
year by 1984. This compares with the estimated total foreign exchange out-
lays on the project and the necessary superstructure of about $100 million.
The project will also have a notable effect on employment and will almost
double the number of those presently employed in the industry (about 13,000).
One-half of new jobs will be for unskilled personnel. Furthermore, the proj-
ect will indirectly generate employment in other sectors. Finally, the pro-
posed project will have a regional impact. With the exception of the tourist
zones of Tunis North and South, which account for only 15 percent of the in-
vestments, the project is concentrated in semi-urban and rural areas where
unemployment and underemployment are high.
52.       The project will be self-liquidating to the extent that water,
power and telecommunications charges will cover depreciation, operation and
maintenance costs and would allow for a return on investment. Sewerage
charges are expected to cover only operation, maintenance and depreciation.
Charges and tax revenues from incremental tourism expenditures, such as
those deriving particularly from sales and income taxes, and import duties
on goods and services sold to foreign and domestic tourists, are expected
to provide a return of at least 22 percent on the total investment cost.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft (a) Loan Agreement and Development Credit Agreement
between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank and the Association, respec-
tively; (b) Project Agreement between the Bank, the Association and Office
National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme (ONTT); and (c) Project Agreement
between the Bank, the Association and SocietE Nationale d'Exploitation et
de Distribution des Eaux (SONEDE); the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the text
of the resolutions approving the proposed loan and credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 14 -
54.       The draft Loan Agreement, Development Credit Agreement and Proj-
ect Agreements conform substantially to the pattern of agreement used for
this type of project.
55.       The effectiveness of the Loan, Development Credit and Project
Agreement, and of the KfW Loan and Project Agreement are conditional on
each other. Additional conditions of effectiveneas include inter alia:
(a) the enactment of the legislation referred to in paragraph 43 of this
Report and of the regulations defining the functions of SONEDE under the
Project, and (b) the establishment of a standing committee referred to in
paragraph 33 of this Report.
56.       Additional events of default would give the Bank and the Associa-
tion the right to suspend or premature the Loan and the Credit if certain
events occurred, including the suspension, termination or acceleration of
the KfW Loan or if the legislation defining the status of ONTT, SONEDE and
STEC and the legislation and regulatory measures referred to in paragraph
43 of this Report, and the Protocols regulating the relations among ONTT
and the several entities concerned with the Project were amended, suspended,
abrogated or terminated without the prior approval of the Bank and the
Association.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
1.       Execution of most Bank and IDA financed projects in Tunisz, )d  s been satisfactory.
2.       Following approval of te memorandum to the Executive Directors of August 21,
1971 (IDA/R71-57) part of the remaining proceeds of the second education credit of
1966 (No. 94) was allocated to finance additional equipment for a number of existing
schools and technical assistance in educational planning.  Procurement of this equip-
ment is proceeding satisfactorily. An assessment of the technical assistance require-
ments was made in late 1971, and recruitment of education planning experts is expected
shortly.
3.       The execution of the railway project of 1969 (Loan No. 606/Credit No. 150) is
progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by the end of 1973. However,
financial difficulties are threatening the project mainly because of the unsettled
arrears of the railway company's main customer, the Gafsa Phosphate Company. This
situation is kept under close review.
L.       A detailed account of the problems encountered in implementing the Cooperative
Farm Project of 1967 (Loan No. 48h and Credit No. 99) was contained inthe memorandum
to the Executive Directors on obvember 5, 1970 (R70-213). The Executive Directors
approved amendments to the original Loan and Credit Agreements on November 17, 1970.
These amendments became effective on March 2h, 1971, and disbursements have been
resumed and are on schedule. This project is nearing completion. The alosing Date has
been postponed by one year until March 31, 1973 in order to allow for effecting out-
standing withdrawals.
