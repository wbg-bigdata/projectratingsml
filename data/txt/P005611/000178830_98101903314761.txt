TUNISIA
APPRAISAL CF THE TOURIS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
SUMARY
i.        This report appraises a project to provide infrastructure for six
tourism zones located on Tunisia's 1000 kn coastline (Map No. 37h7).  The
infrastructure package which includes roads, water, sewerage, electricity
and telecommunications, is Tunisia's first tourism infrastructure project.
submitted to the World Bank Group for financing. It complements the Group's
financing of hotels and other accommodation facilities in Tunisia which has
been carried out through two channels: the Compagnie Financiere et Touris-
tique (COFITOUR), created in 1969 with the help of IFC financing of US$9.9
million, and the Societe Nationale d'Inmestissements (SNI) which over the
last four years has relent US$14.5 million in Bank funds for hotel construction.
it.       International tourism has developed impressively in Tunisia in the
last decade. Increasing at an annual growth rate of 30% -- a performance
unmatched by any other Mediterranean country -- foreign visitor arrivals rose
from 46,ooo to 64o.0oo between 1961 and 1971. During the same period, gross
foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased from US$3 million to an
estimated US$110 million, and are now the largest single item on the receipt
side of Tunisia's balance of payments.
iii.      Systematically overshooting the targets set by various national
development plans, Tunisia's accommodation capacity increased at an annual
rate of 26% over the last decade -- from 4,000 beds in 1961 to about 43,000
in 1971. With the low wages and prices prevailing in the country, and yearly
bed occupancy rates generally high, the Tunisian hotel industry is in a good
position to compete with its Mediterranean rivals.
iv.       The public sector, actively if not always effectively, supported
tourism's performance during the 60's. Goverment action ranged from provi-
sion of incentives and hotel financing to promotion and assistance to investors
in obtaining hotel sites. The Goverment has recently taken a series of steps
to reinforce the sector and has advanced to 1980 the 1,500,000 foreign visitor
arrivals target, originally set for 1985. This target, which implies an average
annual growth rate of about 9%, seems reasonable -- in the light of past trends,
outlook for the development of the potential market, and Tunisia's comparative
advantages.
v.        The six project zones, selected by the Government as the most suit-
able areas for hotel development, together account for a large proportion of
the country's accommodation capacity and foreign visitor traffic. Although
differing greatly as to natural setting and man-made tourism attractions,
they have in common outstanding beaches and clear coastal waters, excellent
for swimming, fishing and boating, and a fine climate, characterized by mild
winters and pleasantly warm summers. For these reasons, they are likely to
remain the principal destinations of foreign visitors to Tunisia.



- ii -
vi.       The development of infrastructure has fallen behind the fast growth
of accommodation in the six project zones -- with the infrastructure backlog
progressively worsening, from north to south.  Traffic congestion is becoming
frequent in the peak season, inadequate sewerage services are causing pollu-
tion of beaches, and water ia increasingly in short supply in Djerba and Zarzis.
vii.      Due to lack of proper physical planning and building control, the
development of accommodation has thus far proceeded haphazardly in the six
tourism zones. "Ribbon" development has predominated, requiring excessive
beach surfaces. Often no space has been allocated for green belts or parks
between hotels.
viii.     The project is a package of infrastructure works comprising roads,
water, sewerage, electricity and telecommunications to be implemented in the
six zones, within a carefully designed physical framework. The proposed works
would serve a two-fold purpose: the elimination of current infrastructural
backlogs, and the provision of a sound basis for further development of accommo-
dation in the six zones. The infrastructures considered in the project are of
two kinds: major infrastructures serving zones or sub-zones, and minor infra-
structural connections (branchements) for individual hotels.  Major infrastruc-
tures are scaled to reflect least-cost solutions to meet demand at least through
1981. Minor infrastructures are those required by both existing hotels and
hotels to be built during the project implementation period (1973-1976).
ix.       Consultant*' studies estimate that together the zones will accommo-
date at "saturation point" a maximum of 1741,000 hotel beds.  The saturation
limit for the six zones and each zone individually has been established
according to internationally-accepted standards for beach-use and building
density. Each zone will have its own pattern of hotel development, based on
a proper balance of accommodation standards and the quality of tourism resources
with anticipated market preferences. The locations of both superstructure and
infrastructure are well chosen and the "nuclear" type of development proposed
for prospective accommodations is at once more economical and more attractive
than the "ribbon" development prevailing heretofore.
x.        The favorable outlook for the development of the market, combined
with the prospect of greater external economies and more profitable operations
implied by the infrastructure improvements resulting from the project, should
be an effective stimulus for future hotel investment in the six project zones.
In addition, the Goverruent has agreed to streamline and improve the existing
hotel investment incentive system, to enforce stricter control on prices of
land and to expand hotel training programs.
xi.       The project is estimated to cost US$5.o million equivalent, includ-
ing contingencies. Contracts for construction and equipment would be awarded
after international competititve bidding. Small civil works contracts,
totalling no more than about US$7.0 million equivalent would be locally adver-
tised. The foreign exchange component of the total cost of the project would



- iii -
depend upon the outcome of international bidding. Assuming that Tunisian
contractors win about 50% of the bids (in value terms) for major roads,
sewerage and water works, which seems likely the foreign exchange component
of the total project cost would be 56% or US$30.8 million. The proposed
Bank loan and IDA credit would total US$24 million. Another US$12.4 million
would be made available through German bilateral assistance. These funds
combined are expected to cover all foreign exchange costs plus 23.1% of
local costs. The balance of the required financing of US$18.6 million equiv-
alent would be provided by the Tunisian Government.
xii.      In addition to improving the infrastructural services for existing
hotels (and for the local population), the implementation of the project
would provide the basis for the construction of 43,000 additional beds by
1981, as well as for the expansion of other tourism facilities such as shops
and restaurants. The economic evaluation of the project has thus been made
in terms of this larger program of investments. Net benefits would essen-
tially be measured by additional expenditures of visitors to the six project
zones, less the cost of operating the facilities. With an estimated economic
life of the program of investments of 25 years, the internal economic return
on the whole program would be 16%. Separate rates of return were calculated
for each of the tourism zones. These rates range between 11% and 19%. Net
foreign exchange earnings are estimated at US$14 million in 1975 and US$97
million in 1981 when the program is expected to be in full operation.
xiii.     The "Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme" (ONTT) would be
the "mattre d'ouvrages" of the project and as such would have the overall
responsibility for the implementation of the proposed works. It would admin-
ister the project funds, provide for disbursements, and coordinate the activity
of the various government agencies which would be in charge of the execution
of the individual project components; the Ministry of Public Works for roads,
the Ministry of Agriculture for sewerage, the Ministry of Post and Teleconmu-
nication for teleconmunication, SONEDE for water and STEG for electricity.
Upon completion of works, the individual infrastructure elements would be
entrusted to the respective agencies for operation.
xiv.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$14 million for a term
of 25 years, including five years' grace, and an IDA credit of US$10 million.
The borrower would be the Government of Tunisia.

APPRAISAL OF THE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1968, the Tunisian Government indicated interest in obtaining
Bank financing for tourism infrastructure. A Bank indentification mission,
early in 1969, recommended that the Government prepare studies for pre-
selected littoral areas. In 1970, with Italian bilateral assistance, the
Tunisian Government contracted Italconsult (an Italian consulting firm) to
prepare master plans for seven coastal areas: Tunis North, Tunis South,
Hammamet, Sousse, Djerba, Zarzis and Kerkennah. These plans were completed
late in the spring of 1971.
1.02      Subsequent Bank missions discarded Kerkennah, where lack of basic
infrastructures would have rendered tourism development too costly, and
requested that in the remaining zones, feasibility studies be undertaken
for individual infrastructure elements of the project: sewerage, water,
roads, electricity and telecommunications. These studies were concluded in
time for a Bank appraisal mission to visit Tunisia in November 1971.
1.03      Due to the complexity of the proposed works, which involve and
affect the whole tourism sector, the project required about three years of
preparation. For the same reason, an unusually large number of Bank staff
participated in evaluating the project. The appraisal mission itself,
consisting of Messrs. Odone, Athanassoglou, Boyd, Delvaux, Kulaki (Consult-
ant), Menezes, Prevost, Ringskog, Soges and Thys, completed its field work
in December 1971. Mr. Sear had earlier evaluated the electricity component
of the project. A desk evaluation of the telecommunication component of the
project was made by Mr. Bassole. While in Tunisia, Mr. Saad El-Fishavy
assisted the appraisal mission in legal matters.
1.0       This would be the first financing of tourism infrastructure by
the Bank/IDA in Tunisia.
2. BACKGROUND
A. The Economy
2.01      An analysis of Tunisia's economy appeared in the report "tCurrent
Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia" (EKA-38a) dated August 18, 1971.
2.02      Although Tunisia possesses good development opportunities, the
growth in real output over the last decade averaged only 3.4% per year.
Recent growth was adversely affected by severe droughts in 1966 and 1967,
disastrous floods in 1969, and excessive government involvement in important
sectors of the economy. Mining and tourism grew rapidly, however, the former



-2-
benefiting from recently discovered oil deposits, and the latter from
its intrinsic potential and as the only sector truly open to private ini-
tiative (Table 1). With a major change in government policy in 1970,
leading to the opening of other sectors to free enterprise, the flow of
private capital to tourism seems to have slowed down temporarily.
2.03      The growth of the economy has been accompanied by a widening def-
icit on merchandise account. Earnings from tourism have increasingly filled
this gap and are now the largest single source of foreign exchange. With
good prospects for fast development, tourism should continue to strengthen
the balance of payments and help to provide employment for the large labor
surplus. Moreover, since hotel investments tend to follow the territorial
distribution of tourism assets, most of which are found outside urban areas
and in the poorer, southern provinces of the country, the sector could
increasingly contribute towards alleviating regional disparities in income
and employment.
B. The Sector
2.04      Centrally situated between the Eastern and Western basins of the
Mediterranean, Tunisia is the nearest point of the African continent to the
hub of the European tourist market in the London-Frankfurt-Paris triangle.
The country's 1,050 km of coastline has some of the finest beaches of the
Mediterranean with a pleasant climate prevailing for the greater part of
the year. Enhancing these natural tourist assets, evidence of Tunisia's
cultural past abounds throughout the country: Phoenician ruins dating from
the period when Carthage was a major maritime power, Ronan aqueducts, temples,
and coliseums, Byzantine-inspired mosques, Turkish fortifications along the
old Barbary coast and, in all Tunisian towns, ancient Arab "souks" where a
variety of imaginative handicrafts are offered. Over the past decade, this
wealth of tourism resources has attracted a rapidly increasing number of
foreign visitors.
2.05      Between 1961 and 1971, foreign-visitor arrivals in Tunisia in-
creased at an annual rate of 30%, rising from 46,0o0 to 640,000 (Table 2)
-- a performance unmatched by any other Mediterranean country. Although con-
tinuous throughout that period, the growth of foreign tourism demand was
slowed down in 1969 and 1970 by a combination of political uncertainty, floods
and cholera.  The average growth rate of arrivals for those two years,was only
11.5%. The growth trend regained impetus in 1971, however, when foreign-
visitor arrivals rose by 50% over the 1970 level. International tourism demand
developed even more quickly in terms of bednights, with foreign visitors'
length of stay increasing steadily over the same decade to the present average
of about 10 days. Because of Tunisia's low per capital income, the development
of domestic tourism demand was much slower. The number of domestic tourist
bednights as a percentage of total hotel bednights has rapidly declined --
from 27% in 1963 to 7% in 1970.



-3-
2.06      The principal tourist-generating market for Tunisia is Western
Europe, which in 1970 accounted for 80% of total foreign arrivals; Germarny,
France and the U.K. are the three top suppliers within this market (Table 3).
As Tunisia lies on the opposite side of the Mediterranean Sea from Europe,
about 75% of its visitors arrived by air -- the majority at Tunis-Carthage
Airport and the remainder at Djerba and Monastir Airports.
2.07      According to the results of a sample survey undertaken by the
"Compagnie Financiere et Touristique" (CCFITOUR) from May to August 1971,
beach-oriented and climate-seeking vacationers (as opposed to business
traffic) form the majority of Tunisia's foreign visitors. COFITOUR's find-
ings are confirmed by the high percentage of foreign visitors travelling to
Tunisia on charter flights or with inclusive-tour groups, and by the concen-
tration of tourism traffic in the aummer months, when more than 60% of total
foreign-visitor bednights were registered (Table 4).
2.08      Although the cost of accommodation and services is lower in Tunisia
than in other Mediterranean destinations, the relatively high cost of air
travel (even via charter flights) from Western Europe makes a vacation in
Tunisia more expensive than in areas which can be reached by car or train
(para. 5.03). Foreign visitors to Tunisia have higher incomes than those
going to, say, Spain, Yugoslavia or Italy's Adriatic Riviera. Indeed,
COFITOUR's survey indicates that only 7% of foreigners visiting Tunisia in
the 1971 May-August season were blue-collar workers, the remainder being
professionals or white-collar workers.
2.09      Systematically overshooting the targets set by various national
development plans, Tunisia's accommodation capacity expanded at an annual
rate of 26% over the last decade -- from 4,000 hotel beds in 1961 to about
462000 in 1971 (Table 5). The capacity created during that period, and almost
entirely (95%) attributable to private investments, is in the main composed
of first-class and tourist-category hotels along the coast (Table 6). Some
tourist villages were built between 1961 and 1971, but their proportion to
total accommodation capacity remains at the low level of about 17%. Supple-
mentaray accommodations (rooms in private homes, camping sites, etc.), which
make up a substantial share of other Mediterranean countries' tourism supply,
are generally lacking in Tunisia.
2.10      On the whole, the prospects for the Tunisian hotel industry are
favorable. With the low wage and price levels prevailing in the country,
the industry is in a good position to compete with its Mediterranean rivals.
Full board rates range from US$7 in tourist-category to US$20 in deluxe
hotels, and in the summer months occupancy levels are generally above 80%
(Tables 7 and 8) -- thus supporting the hypothesis of a considerable volume
of unsatisfied demand. The Tunisian hotel industry is also benefiting from
the economies of scale brought about by the continuous enlargement of the
average hotel, i.e. from 56 to 187 beds in the period considered (Table 5).



4~~~~~~   
At present, one-and two-year old hotels, facing the usual difficulties of
the run-in period, account for a high 32% of Tunisia's total accommodation
capacity.  As this proportion declines in future, both the occupancy and
profitability of the Tunisian hotel industry should further improve.
2.11      The rapid expansion of Tunisia's accommodation capacity has result-
ed in a shortage of trained personnel and in declining standards of service,
particularly during the peak summer months. The present gap between supply
and demand is bound to widen -- unless hotel training programs now under way
are substantially expanded.
2.12      The tourism sector has contributed more and more significantly to
Tunisia's economy. Between 1961 and 1971, earnings from tourism climbed from
US$3 million to an estimated US$110 million.  The steady increase in the average
daily expenditure by foreign visitors -- which rose from US$9 in 1961 to US$17
in 1971 -- explains why foreign exchange earnings from tourism grew even faster
than foreign-visitor bednights. Accounting for 22% of total receipts from the
export of goods and services, foreign exchange earnings from tourism are now
the single most important source of foreign exchange for Tunisia (Table 9).
With regard to labor, a recent survey shows that in 1971 about 13,000 people
were employed by the hotel industry -- about 1% of the total in employment.
These figures give only a partial picture of the impact of tourism development
on employment, however, since hotels represent only a part of the tourist
sector. Moreover, it does not take into account the indirect employment
effects in other sectors ascribable to tourism demand.
2.13      The public sector actively, if not always effectively, supported
tourism's development during the 60's. Over this period, the original struc-
ture of the governmental organization responsible for tourism changed from
semi-governmental agency level (the 'Commissariat General du Tourisme et du
Thermalisme", or CGTT) to ministerial status, and thence (in 1970) to that
of an autonomus body (the "Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme",
or ONTT) under the supervision of the Ministry for the Economy. The adminis-
trative structure of ONTT is more fully described in Annex 1.
2.14      To promote Tunisia's image on the international tourism market, ONTT
and its predecessors have supported the joint efforts of the country's hotel
industry and travel agencies by opening tourist bureaus in several European
capitals. In 1970, ONTT's advertising and promotional expenditures amounted to
US$700,000, or 20% of its total operating budget; by the end of 1971 this expen-
diture had increased to nearly US$1 million.
2.15      Over the years, the government has instituted a number of incentives
for tourism investments.  These incentives include:
(i) outright payments (through ONTT) for minor infrastruc-
tures, linking up hotel sites with the main infrastruc-
ture systems;



- 5
(ii) duty exemption for imported materials required for
hotel construction;
(iii)  interest rebates on hotel loans of up to 3% on
commercial interest rates (which are at present
around 9%); and
(iv)  a five-year exemption from the tax on profits.
The Tunisian hotel investment incentive system shows a number of weaknesses
stemming from the haphazard manner in which the benefits have been established
-- one at a time, without an overall and rational design.  In the first place,
it is doubtful whether the various incentives, taken together, are commensurate
with actual need or whether the objective of sustained flows of private hotel
investments could not be achieved with a different "mix" of incentives, entail-
ing less risk of resource misallocation and/or a lesser cost to the Government.
In the second place, investment incentives are granted too indiscriminately --
to all hotels irrespective of their location and/or type. Thirdly, the multi-
plicity of laws and regulations regarding hotel investment incentives is such
as to render the benefits unclear to potential investors and difficult to
administer for Tunisian authorities.
2.16      The Tunisian Government also assists tourism investors in obtaining
hotel sites. All land transfers within the country are subject by law to the
approval of regional Governors; a land owner's refusal to sell at a price and
for a purpose recommended by one of these regional authorities entails the
prospect of the risk of his being prevented from selling his land for any
other purpose. The public sector has thus been able to ensure the availability
of coastal land for hotel development at reasonable prices (about US$1 per mi2).
It is questionable, however, whether this indirect, and somewhat empirical
method of land control would work in future as increasing demand heightens the
competition for coastal sites.
2.17      The "Soci4te" Nationale d'Investissements" (SNI) and the "Compagnie
Financi6re et Touristique" (COFITOUR) have taken the lead in hotel credit,
and together have thus far provided total financing of about US$30 million
to some 40 hotel projects. Both institutions derive their funds from the
public and private sectors in Tunisia, as well as from international sources
such as the World Bank Group, with whom they are associated. Funds available
for hotel lending have thus far been adequate. The repayment period of Tunisian
hotel loans (10 to 12 years), however, is too short; it is markedly below the
average life of hotels and inconsistent with the loan terms (15 to 25 years)
offered by hotel credit institutions in such other Mediterranean countries
as Italy, Greece and Morocco.
2.18      The Government has recently reasserted its interest in tourism
development. The transformation of the Ministry of Tourism into the ONTT has
proven timely. Combining greater flexibility in decision-naking, financing
and personnel recruitment with good leadership at both top and intermediate



-6-
levels, the new organization is far better equipped to perform the multiple
tasks imposed by the continuous expansion of the sector. On November 2,
1971, the Council of Ministers approved a series of measures providing, inter
alia, for the doubling of Tunis-Carthage Airport's terminal building capacity,
for the exemption from customs duties of cars and buses to be used as tourist
conveyances, and for reduced gasoline prices for "motorized" forei,gn visitors.
On April 19, 1972, the Council of Ministers approved a draft-lawL/ establish-
ing (i) the concept of priority tourism development zones (the practical
definition of the tourism zones' boundaries is left to subsequent implement-
ing decrees); (ii) the principle that hotel development in these zones would
take place according to master plans and (iii) a public real estate corpora-
tion (Agence Foncikre Publique) with the primary task of facilitating land
transfers from present owners to hotel investors.
2.19     Spurred by the 1971 tourism boom, Tunisian authorities have advanced
to 1980 the 1,500,000 foreign-visitor arrivals target originally set for 1985.
According to these revised projections, foreign-visitor arrivals should increase
at an annual rate of about 9%. The prospects for the further expansion of the
tourism supplier market are favorable, and Tunisia's tourism potential is still
far from being fully realized. The implementation of the project would sub-
stantially improve conditions for investors and visitors alike. Assuming
vigorous govermental policies, tourism sector growth should attain or even
exceed official projections.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01     The six project zones, selected by the Government as priority tour-
ism development zones in terms of the draft-law referred to in para. 2.18,
represent the bulk of the Tunisian tourism sector. With approximately 170 kn
of coastline, they take up about 58% of the country's accommodation capacity
and foreign-visitor traffic. Although differing greatly as to natural setting
and man-made tourism attractions, the six project zones have in common fine
beaches and clear coastal waters, excellent for swimming, fishing and boating,
as well as a good climate, characterized by mild winters and pleasantly warm
summers. Given Tunisia's latitude, temperatures in the six project zones as
a whole compare favorably with those prevailing in major northern Mediterranean
resorts (Table 10), allowing for a longer tourism season.  A comparative profile
of the six tourism zones, which are more fully described in Annex 2, is shown
below:

ism zones ("Projet de Loi relative 'a l'amenagement des zones touristiques

3.02      The development of infrastructure in the six project zones has
generally lagged behind the development of accommodation capacity. The infra-
structural backlog is particularly evident with respect to roads, sewage and
water facilities and is progressively worsening from North to South. Expanded
motor traffic is making increasingly heavy demands on the road network of the
six project zones; furthermore, many towns are gradually losing their original
charm because heavy traffic is routed through their center, resulting in noise
and air pollution. As a rule, hotels have been obliged to provide for their
own sewage disposal needs through individual septic tanks, while for hotels
located in the vicinity of urban centers, additional nuisance was caused by
the discharge of untreated sewage effluent from municipal sewers along nearby
shores. Scarcity of water is a problem particularly in the Djerba and Zarsis
zones; unless water capacity is expanded, these zones will cease to grow
despite their outstanding tourist resources.



-8-
3.03     Due to the lack of proper physical planning and building controls,
the development of accomrnodation in the project zones has thus far progressed
haphazardly. In most coastal areas, hotels were built in a single row close
to the water -- a type of development requiring beach and building surfaces
which are out of proportion to the number of tourists actually accommodated.
Often no space was allocated for green belts and parks between hotels, as
modern ecological and resort development standards would have required.
Furthermore, the distances involved in this ribbon-type development have
induced hotel owners to create individual shopping and recreational facili-
ties for their guests, whereas "shared facilities" would have been a more
economic way to meet these requirements.
B. Description
3.4       The project is a package of infrastructures comprising roads, water,
sewerage, electricity and telecommunications to be implemented in the six
zones, within a carefully designed physical framework. The project also
includes studies for expanding current hotel training plans and a program for
promoting hotel investors' interest in the project zones.
Infrastructure Works
3.o5      The proposed works would serve a two-fold purpose: the elimination
of current infrastructure backlogs leading to the improvement of existing hotel
services in the six zones, and the provision of a basis for further hotel
development in these areas. The infrastructures considered in the project are
of two kinds, major infrastructures serving zones or sub-zones, and minor infra-
structure connections (branchements) for individual hotels. Major infrastruc-
tures are scaled to reflect least-cost solutions; they will have sufficient
capacity to meet demand at least through 1981 in all project zones except for
water demand in Djerba-Zarzis, which will be met by works under the present
project only up to 1979. Minor infrastructures are those required by both
existing hotels and hotels to be built during the project implementation period
(1973-1976). Minor infrastructures needed by hotels built in the period 1976-
1981, as well as desalination plants possibly required in Djerba and Zarzis
after 1979, could be the object of a second infrastructure project in Tunisia.
3.06      The road component consists of improvement to, or the construction
of, about 113 km of main roads, including two major bridges, and about 83 km
of minor access roads. The main highways are those linking project zones
with either the national road network or with airports, or which ensure
improved communication between various activity centers within each zone.
The minor access roads are those connecting specific hotels and tourist facili- -
ties with the road network. The roads in the project run through generally
flat or gently rolling terrain and pose no major engineering problems. For
this reason, appraisal of the road component of the project was based on



-9-
preliminary engineering, rather than on final engineering as normal Bank
practice requires. Alignments have been carefully selected to blend
harmoniously with the landscape and, whenever possible, to provide pan-
oramic views. They have been planned in such a way as to bypass towns such
as Hergla, Taguerness, Aghir and Houmt Souk -- freeing the center of these
towns from heavy traffic, noise and air pollution. The road component of
the project is described more fully in Annex 3.
3.07      Tunisia's national water authority, the "Societe Nationale d'Exploi-
tation et de Distribution des Eaux" (SOITDE) is at present increasing the
capacity of the major sources of supply for the regions in Which the project
zones are situated: this national water program is being implemented with
Bank and IDA financial assistance (Loan 581-TUN and Credit 209-TUN). The
resultant additional capacity will smffice to meet the water demands of the
Tunis North, Tunis South, Hanmamet and Sousse project zones, until 1981.
In Djerba and Zarzis, however, the expanded water capacity is rapidly being
absorbed by existing demand. Works for the completion of the second pipeline
supplying these two zones -- originally scheduled under the last phase of the
national water program -- have thus been included in the tourism project.
The project will also provide, for all six zones, trunk distribution mains
and other distribution branches, as well as the construction of reservoirs,
and lines to connect hotels with the distribution systems. The water component
of the project -- which also includes a feasibility study for the installation
of desalination plants in Djerba and Zarsis after 1979 -- is described more
fully in Annex 4.
3.08      The implementation of the sewerage component of the project will
provide for collection and treatment of all sewage flows from the hotel zones
themselves and from municipal sewerage networks (Maps Nos. 3859-3864) -- thus
freeing all bathing beaches in each project zone from sewage pollution.
Methods for treatment and disposal of sewage have been already selected in
most instances. A final choice, however, remains to be made for the treatment
of sewage effluent from the Sousse area, namely whether this sewage would be
treated in a stabilization pond or disposed of through a sea outfall. It is
recommended as a condition of the loan and credit that the final choice
between these alternate methods be subject to Bank approval. The sewerage
component of the project would include consultants' services as well as train-
ing programs for the staff who are to operate the facilities. The sewage
component of the project -- which also includes a feasibility study for treat-
ment and disposal of greater Tunis sewage -- is described more fully in Annex 5.
3.09      In Tunisia, electric power for public use is provided by the "Societe
Tunisienne de l'Electricitd et du Gaz" (STEG), an autonomous government-owned
entity created in 1962. The Bank made a power loan of US$12.0 million to
STEG last April, to finance works which would extend high voltage transmission
lines to all regions of the country, including some of the six tourism zones.
The power component of the tourism project would thus be limited to extensions



- 10 -
from the high voltage transmission lines to the medium and low-voltage system
and the installation of transformer stations at individual hotels within each
project zone.  The electric power component of the project is described more
fully in Annex 6.
3.10      Telecommunications in Tunisia come under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Post and Teleccmmunication (P.T.T.). The telecommunications
component of the project consists of the installation of telephone and telex
equipment in individual hotels and expansion of local public exchanges to
take care of the additional loads. The improved local telecommunications
services will be connected to Tunisia's national network of open-wire carrier
circuits, cables and radio relay links with switching facilities which, by
the end of 1972, should be 95% automatic. The telecommunications component
of the project is described more fully in Annex 7.
Physical Planning
3.11      The preparation of the project and of its related feasibility
studies on roads, sewerage and water has been based on Italconsult's master
plans (para. 1.01). On the whole, the proposals put forth in these plans
(Maps Nos. 3748-3753) reflect awareness of the problems inherent in the project
zones, and sensitivity to the Tunisian landscape. The analysis of the physical
aspects and tourism assets of the six project zones is accurate. The saturation
limits for the six zones and each zone individually have been established
according to internationally-accepted standards for beach-use (ranging from
12 to 24 m2 per bather) and building density. The six zones combined will
accommodate at "saturation point" a maximum of 1741,000 hotel beds, of various
types and categories. Each zone will have its own pattern of hotel develop-
ment, providing less of one category and type of hotel accommodation and more
of another. The particular "mix" for each zone and each year has been based
on the desire to achieve an appropriate balance of accommodation standards and
quality of tourism resources with anticipated market preferences. The locations
of both infrastructures and superstructures are well chosen and the "nuclear"
type of development proposed for prospective accommodations is at once more
economical and more attractive than the "ribbon-like" development prevailing
thus far along the Tunisian coast.
3.12      Despite its merits, the physical planning framework provided by
Italconsult's studies is rather general. The scale used (1:25,000) precludes
detailed reconnaissance, the zoning and land-use plans do not take into
account property boundaries, and recommended building codes are in a schematic
form. Detailed master plans (scale 1:2000/5000) are needed to provide a more
effective instrument for the orderly development of tourism in the project
zones.  These plans, which are to be closely coordinated with the final
engineering for roads and sewerage (para. 3.27), should (i) provide a more
precise definition of the areas to be devoted to hotel development, urban
expansion, infrastructures and public use (squares, parks, gardens, etc.);
(ii) propose building codes and zoning ordinances which will include density



- 11 -
indices, bulk, height, architectural style, and minimal distances between
building structures in each zone and sub-zone; and (iii) recommend ways
to preserve and upgrade the environment, and control pollution and beach
erosion. In consultation with the Bank, the Government has prepared the
Terms of Reference and selected two consulting firms (Italconsult and SCET)
for undertaking the detailed master plans. The related contract would be
signed before loan and credit effectiveness. Actual enforcement of the
detailed master plans would begin not later than three years from the date
of signature of the loan and credit. To make enforcement possible the six
zones would be defined by a decree as priority tourism development zones
(para. 2.18) and the issuing of this decree would be a condition of loan and
credit effectiveness.
C. Cost Estimates
Cost Estimates
3.13      The estimated total cost and foreign exchange component of the
project by project zone and major categories of expenditure are given in
Table 11 and are summarized in Table II.
3.14      Construction costs have increased by approximately 5% per year
since 1962. As it is prudent to assume that the increase will continue at
the same rate, appropriate provision has been made for such increases in the
costs of infrastructure works during the construction period. At present only
feasibility studies exist for the various components of the project and
related cost estimates are subject to change when more detailed studies are
completed. Accordingly, physical contingencies provided are unusually high.
This provision ranges between 9% and 20%, reflecting the varying states of
preparation for each type of infrastructure. The details of allowances pro-
vided for price increases and physical contingencies are shown in Table 12.
The total provision for contingencies would amount to 29.6% of base line
costs, or 22.9% of total project cost.
3.15      Most building materials needed for project implementation are
produced locally, while most of the equipment will have to be imported. The
foreign exchange component of the total project cost would depend upon the
outcome of international bidding. Assuming, as is likely, that Tunisian
contractors would win about 50% of the bids (in value terms) for major road,
sewerage and water works, the foreign exchange component of the total project
cost would be 56% or US$30.8 million.

a/ Derived from Table 11.
This distribution essentially reflects (i) the extent of the backlog in each
zone and for each type of infrastructure and (ii) the projected growth of
accommodation capacity (Table V) in the individual zones.
3.17      The distribution of project funds will favor the less developed Djerba
and Sousse project zones which have poor infrastructures, but a large develop-
ment potential; these zones combined would take up more than half of the project
funds. The Tunis North and Tunis South project zones, where a scarcity of land
limits development prospects, have a better infrastructure system; they would
thus absorb only about 13% of the project investments.
3.18      Not surprisingly, a substantial share of the project funds will go
for sewage works, the most neglected infrastructure in the past and the most
essential to environmental preservation. Road works, which will be spread



-114-
rather evenly amongst project zones and which will be increasingly needed
as motorized tourism develops, will account for the second largest share of
the project funds. As for water works, they will be concentrated in the
southern project zones -- where the scarcity of water capacity is a primary
obstacle to tourism development.
Financing
3.19      The project would be financed with Bank, IDA, German (KfW) and
Tunisian funds, in the following amounts and proportions:

a/ German funds would be primarily concentrated in the Djerba-Zarzis zones.
The Government will have to make budgetary provisions to meet ONTT's estimated
annual financial requirements as shown in Table 14. These requirements would
include (i) the Tunisian share of project cost, totalling an estimated US$18.6
million equivalent, and (ii) the estimated amounts which ONTT would have to
advance in the course of construction and which would be subsequently (i.e.
within 2-3 months) reimbursed by IBRD/IDA and KfW. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Government would provide ONTT with these
budgetary appropriatiors Assurances were also obtained that the Government
would cover possible cost overruns.
Procurement
3.20      The proposed project is within the capacity of the Tunisian construc-
tion industry to implement, but it is expected that foreign contractors would
submit bids for the larger contracts. Major road, sewerage and water works
would be awarded under international competitive bidding and items would be



- 15 -
grouped to the extent practicable to encourage such competitive bidding.
The minor water, road and sewerage elements of the project would involve
numerous civil works contracts which would be too small to attract foreign
bids; consequently, it is proposed that only national advertising be used
for these bids. In some cases, the minor works may be carried out on the
basis of force accounts.
3.21      All equipment purchase contracts would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding. In evaluating bids, local equipment
manufacturers would be allowed the preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f.
cost of competing imports, or the level of customs duties generally applicable,
whichever is lower. Tunisia is associated with the European Common Market,
and imports from EEC countries enjoy preferential treatment. In the past,
there has been no consistent policy in Tunisia on evaluating bids for Govern-
ment imports. Some Government agencies evaluate on a c.i.f. basis, others
on the basis of the offering price, including customs duties. ONTT which has
only recently been established and has thus limited experience in this field,
has not yet determined on which basis it would evaluate bids for the project.
Irrespective of the basis for evaluation, ONTT has indicated that import
duties have to be paid and the cost estimates include import duties.
Disbursements
3.22      Bank, IDA, KfW, and Government funds would be made available to
ONTT, which will be responsible for all payments related to project implemen-
tation. The Bank/IDA would thus deal with a single administrative agency.
Disbursements will be made on the basis of (a) 70% of total expenditures on
civil works; (b) 75% of total expenditures on equipment or 100% of all
identifiable c.i.f. costs; (C) 45% of the costs of professional services,
project administration, training and promotional program. These percentages
womld be adjusted as necessary so that withdrawals would be disbursed over the
project implementation period. Any loan and credit funds not required for
purposes consistent with the project would be cancelled. The estimated
disbursement schedule of the loan is based on the projected construction and
expenditure schedules shown in Table 13 and Chart 1.
D. Execution
3.23      ONTT would be the "mattre d'ouvrages" of the project and as such
would have the overall responsibility for the implementation of the proposed
works. It would administer the project funds, provide for disbursements,
and coordinate the activity of the various government agencies in charge of
executing the individual project components (para. 3.24).  ONTT would further-
more supervise the preparation of the detailed master plans (para. 3.12) and
of the studies for expanding current hotel training programs (para. 4.07).



- 16 -
Finally, it would cloaely cooperate with the public real estate corporation
that is to be created (paras. 2.18, 4.03) and see to the implementation
of the touriam investment promotion program (para. 3.04). The various tasks
required of ONTT would be performed by a newly established project unit
(Direction des Travaux). A full-time director of this project unit has been
appointed, who is acceptable to the Bank. The "Direction des Travaux" will
be staffed with engineers, urban planners, architects, economists, lawyers
and accountants as shown in Chart 2. Some of this staff will be provided
through a consultant technical assistance contract. The signature of this
technical assistance contract between the Government and the consultants
selected would be a condition for loan effectiveness -- with both the contract
and the consultants approved by the Bank. Also as a condition for effectiveness
the special project unit would be operative and its key professional staff
appointed.
3.24      Various government agencios would have technical responsibility for
the execution of individual project components: the Ministry of Public Works
for roads, the Ministry of Agriculture for sewerage, the Ministry of Post
and Telecommunications for telecommunications, SONEDE for water and STEG for
electricity. Whereas the present organization of SONEDE, STEG and the Ministry
of Post and Telecommunications is already adequate to control the execution of
the project, new organizational arrang.enta should be made in the Ministry of
Public Works and the  Ministry of Arlic iriie.   
3.25      For the supervision of the road works, the Governrent will establish
a special operations unit ("8ervioe des Cperations Speciales") within the DPC,
similar to the "cellule de contrSle" which is currently supervising the works
under the Bank'sfirst highway project. Technical assistance to this special
unit will be provided by consultants acceptable to the Bank. During negotia-
tions, the Government agreed that, if the special operations unit could not
be established in good time, a consulting firm acceptable to the Bank would
be employed for construction supervision.
3.26      The Htrdraulic Department (H.A.R.) of the Ministry of Agriculture
is presently responsible for planning and constructing all sewerage facilities
financed by the Government. Due to the cumbersome administrative procedures
of the Ministry of Agriculture, H.A.R. has been slow to respond to the
sewerage needs of Tunisia. To ensure the implementation on schedule of the
sewerage component of the project, the Minister of Agriculture has recently
established an autonomous project unit within H.A.R., and has appointed the
Chief Officer of this unit. Technical assistance to the special unit would
be provided by a general contract with consultants (BCEOM). Terms of Refer-
ence for this contract were reviewed and finalized by the Government and the
Bank during loan and credit negotiations. Signature of the contract would be
a condition of loan and credit effectiveness. Before effectiveness, the special
unit would be operative and have its key professionals in place.
3.27      The detailed engineering for major road works and for the works
included in the sewerage component of the project will be prepared by consult-
ants. Signature of the consultantst contracts would be a condition for loan
and credit effectiveness -- both the consultants and the contracts having been
approved by the Bank.



- 17 -
3.28      Strict coordination is needed for the implementation of the proj-
ect, which involves numerous governmental agencies. Two specific instruments
have been planned to this effect: interagency agreements and a Technical
Coordinating Committee. Five interagency agreements (protocol), regulating
in detail the relations between ONTT and each of the executing agencies on
matters of project preparation, construction supervision, procurement and
disbursement, have been agreed upon between the parties concerned and received
approval by the Council of Ministers. The Technical Coordinating Committee
would be composed of high-ranking representatives of the various executing
agencies who will meet periodically, under ONTT direction, to consider major
problems of coordination. In the event of disagreement within this committee,
these will be settled by the Council of Ministers. The decrees establishing
this committee and appointing committee members, which is already in final form,
would be issued prior to loan and credit effectiveness. Furthermore, a
comprehensive schedule would be prepared to ensure that preparation of both
detailed master plans (para. 3.12) and final engineering on road8 and sewerage
(para. 3.27) proceed in a coordinated fashion. This schedule would be prepared
by ONTT in consultation with the executing agencies and be approved by both
the Technical Coordinating Committee and the Bank prior to loan and credit
effectiveness.
E. Organization for Operation
3.29      Upon completion of all proposed works, the project unit within ONTT
would be dissolved and all the roads, water, electrical power and telecommuni-
cation infrastructures would be entrusted to the appropriate governmental
agencies -- the Minister of Public Works, SOXEDE, STEG, and P.T.T., respectively.
Past Bank experience with these agencies indicates that they are capable of
maintaining and operating such infrastructure.
3.30      With regard to the sewerage component of the project, the special
unit within H.A.R. would also be dissolved and the coMpleted facilities entrusted
to SONEDE. Accordingly, the law establishing SONEDE has been modified to broaden
SONEDE's scope of activity in such a way that this agency can operate, maintain
and renew the project's sewerage facilities in each of the tourism zones and
also have the right to operate and maintain similar facilities throughout the
country. The modified law also provides that a "convention generale" promul-
gated by decree would establish the framework and general guidelines for proce-
dures, charges and relationsips between SONEDE and the parties concerned
(government, municipalities, or private entities), leaving only the specifics
to be fixed in individual agreements with each party. The decree establishing
the "convention generale" should be issued prior to loan and credit effective-
ness, after the draft of the "convention generale" has been approved by the
Bank.

4. HOTL DEVELOPNT
.01       Joint projections by Italconsult, ONTT and Bank pre-appraisal
missions envisage the opening of about 56 000 additional bedsl-' in the six
project sones during the 1972-1981 periocv/. Whereas projections of capacity
up to the end of 1972 reflect beds currently under construction, those for
the following nine years (1973-1981) are generally based on a linear extra-
polation of the 1967-1972 trends. In the Tunis North and Sousse zones,
however, projections have also taken into account specific hotel investments
now in the planning stage (Annex 2).  The past, current and prospective
development of accommodation capacity in the Bix tourism zones may be summari-
zed as follows:
Table V
Past and Projected Development of Accomnodation Capacity
in the Six ProJect Zones

Tunis North         898     1,782             176                  5,700

Hammamet          3,138    14,379           2,248                 35,000
Sousse            1,461     5,419             791                 22,500
Djerba            2,153     7,134             996                 14,700
Zarzis               08     2.315             381                  5.9oo
Total          8,716    33,211          4,896                  89,000
The 1972-1981 projections for the distribution of accommodation capacity by
category reflect a gradual adjustment towards the saturation-point distri-
bution patterns recommended by Italconsult for each zone (para. 3.11).
4.02      Entrepreneurial interest in tourism, which may have slackened
temporarily as a result of the opening of other sectors of the economy to
private capital, should rapidly revive. The favorable market outlook, and
the prospect of improved external economies and operational profits result-
ing from the project's works, should effectively stimulate hotel investment
1/ 4.3,000 beds out of this total would be opened between 1975 and 1981, and
may be properly ascribable to the project (Annex 8).



i   Y

in the six project zones -- as should the knowledge that these works are
backed by external financial assistance. The 1981 target, implying an annual
growth in accommodation capacity of 6,198 beds over the period 1972-1981,
as compared with the historical growth of 4,896, appears reasonable in this
context. The attainment of this target assumes, however, intensified govern-
mental action directed to reinforce the tourism sector in general and to
improve further investment conditions in the six project zones in particular.
4.03      Prevention of land speculation within the project zones and avail-
ability of land at reasonable prices for hotel investors are essential to the
project's success. A first step towards the attainment of these objectives
would be the establishment of the public real estate corporation envisaged by
the draft-law on land use, building activities and land transfers in the tourism
zones (para. 2.18). Acting as a land-bank, this corporation would acquire land
before and during the implementation of the proposed works and resell it to
hotel investors. Land acquisitions by the corporation would be through one of
the following methods: (i) normal purchase; (ii) expropriation; or, (iii)
the exercise of the "droit de pr4emption" (that is, the right of the corporation
to preempt land when offering a price equal to that offered by prospective
private purchasers).
)4.04     To put the corporation in a position of operating effectively,
additional measures would be taken to complement those envisaged in the draft-
law mentioned above in para. 4.03. In the first place, to avoid speculation,
the corporation would immediately proceed to buy substantial quantities of land
in the project zones at their present low prices. All sellers of land in the
project zones will have to notify the corporation sufficiently in advance of
their intention to sell. In the second place, appropriate measures would be
taken to prevent land speculation at subsequent stages and/or land misuse by
hotel investors. In particular, the sale of land to these investors would be
condtional upon the exclusive use of land for the purpose of tourism develop-
ment; in the case of insufficient use or misuse of land by hotel investors
(or their possible assignees), the corporation would be entitled to repossess
4t. The passage by the National Aseembly of the draft-law on land use, building
activities and land transfers in the tourism zones, as well as the introduction
of complementary legislative and regulatory measures on the functioning of the
corporation and land transfers within the project zones would be a condtion of
loan and credit effectiveness. Before their formal adoption, all said legislative
and regulatory measures would be submitted for Bank approval.
4.05      In addition to the financial requirements of the proposed infrastruc-
ture project, planned hotel development calls for a total investment in accommo-
dations of about US$220 million in the period 1973-1981. Given the financial



- 20 -
structure of hotels in Tunisia, this would mean that the requirements in
loan funds would be US$16.5 million per year on an average. During loan
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government would make its
best efforts to provide the necessary financing, should loan funds from
normal channels fall short of requirements. Further, ir. order to make the
terms of Tunisian hotel credit comparable with those of other competitive
Mediterranean countries, the Bank Group should encourage COFITOUR and SNI
to extend the term of their loans to an upper limit of 20 years (as against
the present 12 year limit). Within this new limit, the range of individual
loans should reflect the average life of proposed hotel projects.
4.06      During loan and credit negotiations it was agreed 'that ONTT would
carry out a study aimed at increasing the efficiency of the Tunisian hotel
investment incentive system (para. 2.15). To be completed within 18 months
from loan and credit signature, the study would assess whether the overall
amount of incentives under the present system is economically justified.
This assessment would be made in the light of (i) policies pursued in other
sectors of the country's economy, (ii) the proposal that Tunisian hotel
financing institutions such as SNI and COFITOUR extend repayment terms of
their loans (para. 4.05), (iii) the level of hotel investment incentives
current in competing Mediterranean countries, and (iv) other relevant factors.
Furthermore, the study would propose suitable selectivity criteria graduating
investment incentives according to the location and category of hotel. The
location criteria would favor the coneentration of hotel investment in the
six project zones; hotel investments in these zones would enjoy, at least over
the next five years, greater benefits than hotel investments in any other part
of Tunisia. The category criteria would reflect the desirability of bringing
existing category patterns in the six project zones into line with both the
ideal patterns proposed in Italconsult's general plans (para. 3.11) and
anticipated market trends.  Finally, the study would propose all appropriate
measures to simplify existing, cumbersome procedures and to render the system
more easily administered. Within one year from completion of the study, the
recommendations would be jointly reviewed by the Government and the Bank in
order to determine the amendments that would be actually made to the hotel
investment incentive system. Submission to the Bank of the Terms of Reference
for the study would be a condition for loan and credit effectiveness.
4.07      Because of the natural influx of domestic capital into the tourism
sector, little promotional effort has thus far been needed to stimulate hotel
investment. With the likely diversion of domestic capital to other sectors
of the economy, foreign private initiative should be encouraged to increase
its participation in the development of accommodations in the six zones.
The Government intends to submit for Bank approval the outline of a specific
promotional program, the implementation of which is provided for in the proj-
ect costs. This program should include, amongst others, the preparation and
distribution of an investment guide in several languages describing investment
conditions in the six project zones, as well as campaigns aimed at the inter-
national capital market.



- 21 -
4.o8      A recent survey on employment within the hotel industry shows
that one position requiring hotel training is created, on the average,
for every nine beds built. On the basis of this survey it can be estimated
that the hotel industry will be requiring 1,100 trained persons annually
in the coming years. At present, the existing hotel schools can accommo-
date a demand of roughly hOO. This capacity is going to increase to 500
as a result of the expansion of the hotel training program currently in
progress. Even though the Government has earmarked funds in the budget of
1972 for further additions of 300, supply would still fall short of demand
to an extent of about 300 hotel personnel. Funds have thus been included
in the project to study the possibility of a new expansion in the Tunisian
hotel training program designed to meet fully anticipated personnel require-
ments.

5. JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Justification
Prospects for the Development of the Market
5.01      The market Justification for the project is based on the forecast
that foreign visitor traffic to Tunisia, in terms of bednights, will grow
in line with the expected development of the country's accommodation capacity
(Table 5). Assuming that in the forthcoming decade the average length of stay
of foreign visitors increases from the present 10 days to 12 days, as is
likely given past trends, the number of these visitors would rise from 642,000
to 1,516,000 (Table 15). This forecast is basically consistent with that
proposed by both Italconsult and the Tunisian authorities and appears reason-
able in the light of (i) the past performance of the tourism sector, (ii) the
prospects for the expansion of the European tourism market, and (iii) the
comparative advantages the country enjoys.
5.02      The above assumptions imply that foreign visitor arrivals and foreign
visitor bednights in the whole of Tunisia would grow in the 1971-1981 period
at annual rates of 9.0% and 10.8% respectively -- as against corresponding rates
of 25% and 33% registered for the 1965-1971 period (Table 15). In absolute
terms, the projected growth rate of foreign visitor arrivals would represent
an average annual increase of 87.,400 -- only slightly higher than the 79,500
average experienced from 1965 through 1971.
5.03      Tunisia, like other destinations in North Africa and the Middle East,
is primarily accessible by air from Europe, their major tourism supply market.
This group of tourist destinations cates to a particular segment of the European
market clearly differentiated from that composed of European vacationers travel-
ling either within their own countries, or to neighboring countries easily
reached by ground transportation. In season, an all-inclusive two-week vaca-
tion in North Africa or the Middle East is currently being marketed at between
US$200 and US$300 via charter, or US$300-400 on an inclusive tour basis
(Table 18) -- i.e., at prices considerably higher than those spent by most
Europeans for an equally long vacation within Europe itself.
5.04      Given current and prospective per capita income levels and income
distribution in Europe, the number of Europeans able to afford a vacation in
Mediterranean tourist destinations of North Africa and Middle East -- at
present relatively small -- should grow rapidly in the coming years. Moreover,
the increasing popularity of air transport, coupled with the progressive
saturation of Europe's tourist resorts, is likely to stimulate European vaca-
tioners to travel further in search of more exotic environments and less
crowded beaches. Both the favorable outlook for the expansion of the potential



- 23 -
market and the heightened tendency to substitute remote destinations for
those close at hand, should increasingly support the development of the
European tourism demand for North African destinations. Throughout the
seventies, this demand may be expected to develop at a pace at least sim-
ilar to that registered in the 1965-1971 period -- an annual average
growth rate of 11% (Table 16).
5.05      Because of its favorable geographical position and its relatively
low level of prices, Tunisia is at present the least expensive tourist
destination among North African and Middle East countries for organized air
travellers departing from Europe (Tables 17-18). The implementation of the
project should substantially improve the country's competitiveness in terms
of services. The prospect of a vacation in a well-preserved envirorment
with unpolluted beaches and planned accommodations should prove an important
factor in this context; as should the completion of the planned ferry-boat
connections with Sicily which will open the country to expanded flows of
motorized vacationers.
Occuanc  Rates
5.o6      Parallel growth of accommodation and demand implies that occupancy
levels of both existing and planned hotels in the six zones will be similar
to that experienced in the recent past. This implication is rendered likely by
seasonal fluctuations which are mainly governed by social customs in the
tourist-generating market (school holidays, closing of factories in August,
etc.).
5.07      One particular factor to be taken into account, however, is the
11runnin-infl period of a hotel. In the case of Tunisia, it is assumed that
in the fi-rstC year of its opening, a new hotel would have an occupancy rate
of only li&lf of the normal occupancy it should enjoy; and would reach normal
operational levels only in the third year.
B. Economic Justification
Th e project is a package of infrastructure investments serving
primarily the tourism industry and covering widely-separated geographical
areas. Since the project is part of a larger program of investments, its
economic evaluation has been made in terms of this larger whole.  The gross
benefits of these investments consist mainly of the additional revenues earned
or "savedl/ by hotel and other facilities used by tourists.  Investment costs
include not only the capital required to construct the proposed infrastructure
works, but also the costs of expanding other tourist facilities, the most
important being hotel accommodation. Needed investments in facilities such
as shops and restaurants are also taken into account.
J "Saved'means revenues of existing hotels which in the absence of the project
might be lost through lower occupancies (c.f. para. 11 of Annex 8).

5.09      The net benefits of the program of investments envisaged would be
the additional revenues generated or "saved" as a result of increased tour-
ism in the six project zones legs the costs of operating the facilities and
services to be provided. Revenues and costa associated with international
air travel and other segments of the travel industry have not been taken
into account, since the benefits would mostly accrue to foreign airlines
and travel agents.
Rates of Return
5.10      With an estimated economic life of the investments of 25 years,
the internal economic return on the program would be 16.3%. To allow for
uncertainty, and to test the sensitivity of the rate of return to changes
in the values of some of the variables, various rates of return were calcu-
lated by modifying some of the key assumptions made in the economic analysis.
Results of this testing show that the rate of return is sensitive to changes
in occupancy levels, investment timing, and especially to a change in the
foreign exchange rate. However, even on the least favorable combination of
assumptions, the rate of return does not fall below 12.8%.
5.11      Separate rates of return were calculated for each of the tourism
zones. These rates vary greatly with the highest on investment in Hammamet
(19.4%) and lowest on investment in Tunis South (10.9%).
5.12      The economic justification is reviewed in greater detail in Annex 8.
C. Balance of Payments and Emnloyment Effects
5.13      Tunisia has experienced sizeable deficits in the current account
of the balance of payments in recent years. Between 1965 and 1970, such
deficits averaged US$120 million a year or about 11% of GNP. Imports of
capital and intermediate goods continue to rise under the impetus of higher
investment and increased industrial demand. Since the trade deficit is not
likely to decline, the growth of foreign exchange earnings from tourism is
vital to the development of Tunisia's economy.
5.14      The facilities planned for the six zones will primarily serve
foreign visitors.  Starting with a small inflow of US$114 million in 1975, net
foreign exchange earnings attributable to the program of investments will rise
to US$97 million in 1984, and subsequent years, when the facilities are fully
operational. This compares with the estimated foreign exchange cost of the
program of investments of about US$100 million.
5.15      Although statistical evidence is insufficient, rough estimates indi-
cate that total employment in Tunisia has risen little over the last three years,
and the percentage of male unemployment has remained high (at 15 to 20% of the
labor force). The proposed program is important in this context. When in



- 25 -
full operation, it is estimated that the program of investments will provide
12,500 additional jobs, one half of which will be for unskilled personneli
In 1971 employment within the hotel industry for the whole of Tunisia stood
at 13,000. The addtional employment created understates the full employment
effects of the project, since hotels represent only a part of the tourist
sector and since in addition to direct employment the program will indirectly
generate employment in other sectors. Furthermore, with the exception of
Tunis North and South, which account for only 15% of the investments, the
project is concentrated in semi-urban or rural areas where, according to the
1966 census, unemployment and underemployment rates are substantially higher
than the national average.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      The envisaged tourism investment program consists of different
superstructure and infrastructure elements, some revenue-earning and others
not. Superstructure facilities, of which the hotels are the most important,
will earn their revenues by charging the viBitors directly. Given favorable
market prospects and assuming hotel loans are granted on more appropriate
terms, investors in hotels and other facilities can expect to repay any
debt incurred and earn a satisfactory return on their equity.
6.02      During loan and credit negotiations, it was agreed that the Govern-
ment make available a minimum of about US$2.1 million to the public real. es-tate
corporation (Agence Fonciere Publique) (paras. 2.18, 4.03 and 4.04). The
Governmentts intention is to make the corporation financially autonomious,
with m.ost of the revenue coming from the sale of land.  Resale price of land
would be calculated on the basis of the aggregate amount of the initial price
paid for the land and the corporation's ewp.nditures.
6.03      With regard to water supply, existing rates produce a reasonable cash
position and an adequate rate of return on net fixed assets.  These financial
results, however, are achieved through year-round, nationwide uniform tariffs
wh-lch dn not reflect the marginal cost of water in the various zones and
seasons, The gap between the economic cost of water production and tariffs
is particul.,arly wide in the Djerba-Zarzis project zones during the suimmer
months -- a gap which might lead in the future to investment misallocations
and water shortage. Obviously, this problem could only be solved with the
introduction of seasonal differential pricing in Djerba-Zarzis substantially
higher than in the rest of the country. During negotiations it has been agreed
that SONEDE, upon completion of the hydrogeological and water consumption
studies it is presently undertaking, would introduce in Djerba and Zarzis,
water rate schedules which would reflect the higher marginal costs of supplying
water to large consumers during the peak periods. The detailed structure and
level of such water rates would be evaluated in the light of the study O04TT
would make to improve the effectiveness of the current system of investment
incentives to the tourism industry (para. 4.06).



- 26 -
6.04      The sewerage component of the project represents the first organized
attempt towards alleviating the problems posed by an insufficient sewerage
system. It is proposed that charges for the services at least cover the
operating, maintenance and depreciation costs (see Annex 5, paras. 31-33).
The establishment of such charges, prior to the operation of these facilities,
would be a condition of the loan and credit.
6.o5      The electric power component of the project is a small part of the
expansion program planned for the whole country. Electric power provided
to the project zones will be so priced as to cover operating costs and depre-
ciation; it would furthermore provide an adequate return on capital invested.
The precise tariffs to be applied are currently being examined as part of a
larger rate study.
6.o6      The telecommunications component of the project is similarly expec-
ted to earn sufficient revenues to allow for an adequate return on the invest-
ment.
6.07      Roads included in the project would generate revenues in the form
of incremental gasoline taxes, etc., and these revenues would be more than
adequate to cover maintenance costs.
6.08      In addition, substantial amounts of incremental tax revenue  will
be accruing to the state and should properly be imputed to the project. These
revenues are derived from sales taxes, income taxes, import duties, etc., on
goods and services sold to foreign and domestic visitors. While the exact
amount of taxes as a percentage of total revenues will vary greatly, it is
estimated that on an average every 100 units of tourism expenditures generate,
directly or indirectly, 20 units of tax revenue.
6.09      When the tax revenues are added to the revenues generated through
charges and tariffs minus the operating costs associated with providing these
services and this stream is measured against the investment cost of US$55
million, it yields a return of at least 22%.
6.10      Accounts and financial statements in a form acceptable to the Bank
should be kept by ONTT for all project operations. Audited financial state-
ments in a form acceptable to the Bank, prepared by auditors approved by the
Bank, would be presented to the Bank within three months of the close of the
financial year.

TUNISIA
TOURISM fINFASTRUCTURE PROJECT
The Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme
1         The Office National du Tourisme et du Thermalisme (CNTT) was
established in July 1971 (Decree No. 71 264). It took the place of the
short-lived Ministry of Tourism and Regional Development. This change of
status had important advantages because it placed the Tunisian Government
tourist organization on a semi-autonomous basis, with the power to manage
its own finances, contract loans, make payments and hire personnel outside
the restrictions of a Government departaent. The Office was placed under
the supervision of the Ministry of National Economy. Apart from the above
changes, the Office largely carries out the functions of the former
Commissariat General au Tourisme et au Thermalisme (OGTT) which had been
the principal authority for the promotion and development of tourism in
Tunisia until the formation of the Ministry of Tourism in 1969.
2.        The functions of the ONTT may be  umnnarized as follows:
i.    To formulate and implement the policies of the Government
in tourism and thermalism within the framework of the plan
of economic and social development formulated by the
Ministry of Planning;
ii. to promote the development and equipment of zones of
tourism and thermal interest;
iii. to be responsible for implementing the regulations
affecting public and private interests in those fields;
iv.   to provide all forms of assistance to those engaged in
tourism development;
v.    to provide tourism training;
vi.   to coordinate and promote tourism development with
public and private bodies, including construction,
management, publicity, and the organization of
exhibitions.
3.        The Board of Directors of ONTT (which meets monthly) is chaired by
the Minister of National Economy and has five directors appointed by the
chairman in consultation with the Minister of Finance; six directors chosen
by him for their competence in the field of tourism; and the Director General
of the ONTT (also nominated by him) who presides in the Minister's absence.
The present Director General, Mr. Azzabi (former Governor of Nabeul) is
responsible for the day-to-day administration of ONTT. He is an active leader
of a competent team. The staff, however, in not sufficient to carry out the



ANNEX 1
proposed project, and a special "Direction des Travaux" is being not up and
staffed in ONTT to undertake this task.  This unit will cover aU aspects of
coordination and implementation of the project for which ONTT will be
responsible. The head of this unit will report directly to Mr. Azzabi.
4.        The ONTT is largely financed from the national budget through the 1/
Ministry of National Economy. The organization, wider the general super-
vision of the Minister, is empowered to contract loans, to participate in
tourist enterprises, and to pay expenses incurred from its own bank accounts.
It handles the state's aid to tourist enterprises; it contracts out, super-
vises and pays for the small infrastructure works ("branchements") under-
taken in cooperation with the appropriate agencies to link hotels to the main
infrastructure (water, telecomunications, electricity and roads). All hotel
projects in Tunisia are subject to QNTT regulation and approval, working
within the framework of the Interdepartmental Tourist Commission. 2/
ONTT is also responsible for setting up, administering and financing the
Government tourist offices abroad, undertaking tourist promotion, and for
the Government tourism training programs. The Government hotel, restaurant
and transport chain, Soci4ti Hdteliare et Touristique Tunisienne (SHTT) is
under ONTT supervision.
5.        The organization of ONTT (see attached chart) is divided into three
directorates eovering programs (all techaical and infrastructural work of
development prior to the operation of hotels), operations (statistics,
inspection of hotel projects, study of hotel operations, etc.), and promotion
(publicity at home and abroad); and two divisions covering administration
and finance, and training, respectively.  The organization benefits from the
assistance of a number of expatriate advisers in the fields of tourism and
engineering.
1/ The principal sources of funds for ONTT, other than the national budget,
are the rental of the Tunis Rilton Hotel, earnings from the SHTT chain,
and Equipment Bonds (Bons d'Equipement).
2/  This Comuission meets twice monthly to approve hotel projects under the
Code d'Investissements, usually under the chairmanship of the Director
General of ONTT, representing the Minister of National Economy.

TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF THE TOURISM INFRA8TRUCTURE PROJECT
Description of the Project Zones
1.        This Annex attempts to describe each of the six tourim project zones.
Tunis North
2.        Situated about 10 km from the center of Tunis, a city of almost one
million inhabitants, the Tunis North Project zone extends over approximately
2,575 ha and includes individual beache indented into natural coves against
the hilly terrain. Near the project zone, the picturesque city of Sidi Bou
Said offers fine shops, restaurants and cafes, as well as views of the Bay of
Tunis and the remains of ancient Carthage. Existing accoimmodations (7 hotels,
with 1x462 beds) occupy most of the coastline, but a broad plateau on the
opposite side of the coastal road remains to be developed. Bounded by a
magnificent wildlife park, this Government-owned property would be an ideal
site for a first-class hotel complex that could eventually be integrated into
the master plan for greater Tunis. Several investors have formally applied
to build a project of this type on it, but ONTT has reserved its decision
until definite physical plans for the zones are completed. Tunis North's
"saturation" capacity is estimated at 10,000 beds.
Tunis South
3.        The Tunis South Project zone, situated roughly 15 km from the center
of Tunis proper, extends over approximately 4,750 ha; it has approximately
14 km of coastline, with long stretches of sandy beaches. Generally flat, the
zone is limited to the south by the steep cliffs which border that part of the
Bay of Tunis. Amongst the promontories that characterize the area, the village
of Korbous overlooking the bay is a well-known tourist attraction because of
its hot sulphur baths. The Tunis South Project zone is at present devoted to
beachfront tourist-class accommodations and vacation cabins (6 hotels, with
1,538 beds). At saturation point, its accommodation capacity should reach
20,000 beds.
Hammamet
4.        About 60 km south of Tunis, HIamvmt is the largest and oldest of the
six project zones, and the main tourist center of Tunisia. Extending over
8,000 ha, this zone has 27.1 km of beaches along a total 31.4 km of coastline
and includes the villages of Hammamet, Nabeul (a renowned ceramics center),
Beni Khiar, Dar Chabane and Maamoura. Eavmamet proper, a picturesque fishing
village of about 12,000 inhabitants, is approximately 70 km from Tunis by road.
In Hammamet Park, adjoining the main beach, a month-long cultural festival is
held in an open-air theater during the souer. The zone, referred to as
Tunisia's Riviera, is rich in typically Mnditerransan flora, including the
citrus and orange groves which frame the hotels, villas and archaeological sites



ANNEX 2
Page 2
along the shore. During the last few years, the relatively well developed
Hammamet zone has shown the greatest increase in tourist activities of the
six project zones. Expanding ninefold between 1965 and 1971, it now has
12,363 hotel beds. -'urther detelopment, which will in the main be concen-
trated along the 5.3 lm of undeveloped coastline, should bring accommo-
dation capacity in this zone to a total of 50,000 beds at "saturation
point".
Sousse
5.        Situated about 140 km from Tunis, the Sousse project zone (4,475 ha)
stretcheas from the attractive fishing village of Hergla down to the edge of
SouBse proper, a town of about 60,000 inhabitants.  The two archaeological
sites of Monastir-Skanes and El Djem are within a short drive from this pro-
ject zone; the former has some of the beat preserved Roman mosaics extant,
and the latter the second largest coliseum after Rome.  Only a small
fraction of Sousse's tourism potential has been tapped so far. About 22 km
out of the project zone's 30 km coastline are still untouched and existing
hotel beds number 4,841,, as compared with 40,000 expected at "saturation
point". A large increase in accommodation capacity is currently planned for
this zone in the coming years, however. Cofitour has contracted out to con-
sultants the feasibility study for an integrated tourism complex to be
located on the rolling, olive-covered hills which back the Sousse beaches.
This complex would include 15,000 new hotel beds, an unspecified number of
villas to be sold or rented to tourists, and recreational facilities such
as entertainment centers, a golf course and a marina. Covering an area of
about 1,500 hectares, the proposed works would be phased over the period
1974-1985.
Dierba
6.        The Djerba project zone is on the northeast cape of the island of
Djerba, ancient land of the mythical lotus-eaters. Generally flat, the zone
covers about 9,600 ha and has 42 km of excellent beaches, 13 km of which are
yet to be developed. Access to this island is provided by Djerba-Mellita
international airport (on the island itself), a Roman causeway at 1l Kantara,
and two ports, Adjim and Houmt Souk. With scattered palm-trees, superb
mosques and white dome-shaped constructions standing out against an intensely
blue sky, Djerba s semi-tropical landscape is exotic and impressive.  Just
off    the Sahara, the island also has a particularly favorable climate which
allows year-round swimming. Djerba's comparative advantages are reflected in
the occupancy rates of this zone's accovmodatios (14 hotels with 4,538 beds),
which are markedly higher than thone experienced in general by hotels in
other areas of Tunisia. However, the island's further development, as well as
that of the nearby Zarzis project zon., in jeopardized by a scarcity of water.
By tapping more water from distant sources, the project will eliminate this
problem until 1979, but long-range solutions might have to be envisaged thereafter.
The "saturation point" for Djerba is estimated to be 30,000 beds.

Zarzis
7.        Located on the mainland  20 km southeast of the causeway to Djerba,
the Zarsis project zone (7,100 ha) enjoys a siAilar warm, dry year-round
clizate, with 320-340 days of sunshine per year.  Its 30 km long coastline
includes 12 km of broad, sandy beaches backed by lush vegetation. The town
of Zarzis, with a population of about 12,000, is a amall fishing port and
agricultural center. The accomodation capacity of the Zarzis zone increased
sharply in 1971 and now standa at 1,504 beds.  Zarzis' "saturation capacity"
is estimated to be 24,000 beds.

APPRAISAL OF TEE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
HIGHWAYS
A. Introduction
1.        The development of Tunisia's tourism industry relies on suitable
transport facilities to bring visitors to the country, to transfer them to
hotels, and to allow them to tour the country. On the whole, the transport
system has up to now been adequate to support the expansion of the tourism
industry. Sustained development of tourism, however, will require improved
connections between tourism areas and the main highway network, improved
communication within the tourism areas, and to individual hotels, facilities,
and points of interest.
2.        Modern air transport has brought Tunisia to within few hours' flight
from the large tourist market of Western Europe. The overwhelming majority
of tourists, about 80% of the total, arrive by plane, an increasing number on
chartered flights. Tunisia has three international airports: Tunis-Carthage
and Monastir in the north, and Djerba-Melita in the south. Arrivals by road,
and to a lesser extent by ship, account for the remaining tourist entries.
"Self-drivend' visitors account for a small percentage of total tourist entries,
but their number is expected to increase in the near future when ferry service
with Sicily is expected to start.
3.        Ultimate distribution of tourist traffic from points of entry to
destination is by road. Tourist generated traffic has contributed to the
general increase of road traffic, especially on the routes leading south from
Tunis. As witness to this fact, all the roads which are being improved under
the Bank-financed first highway project (Loan 746-Tun) carry significant
tourist traffic.
B. Description
4.        An integral part of a comprehensive program to develop tourism in
the six project zones, the proposed road works are specifically directed
both to eliminate existing backlogs and to satisfy projected traffic demand.
The roads planned can roughly be classified as (i) main roads either linking
project zones with the country's road network or ensuring improved communi-
cation between various centers of activity and attraction within each project
zone; and (ii) access roads connecting specific hotels and facilities with
the road network.



!t
ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        The road component of the tourist development project consists of:
(a)  improvement or construction, in the six project zones,
of about 113 km of main roads including two major bridges,
about 83 km of access roads, and bicycle paths; and
(b)  engineering services for detailed engineering and super-
vision of the above4road construction.
6.        A breakdown of the roads included in the project by tourist area
is summarized below and given in detail in Table 1.
Main Roads            Access Roads
(km)                   (km)
Tunis North                  8.2                   1.5
Tunis South                 11.5                    2.8
Hammamet                     6.7                   14.0
Sousse                      17.0                    6.5
Zarzis                      26.7                  28.6
Djerba                      42 5                   29-5
112.6                  82.9
Total, all roads                      195.5
Appraisal of the road program is based on preliminary engineering carried out
in 1971 by Studi-BCEOM (Tunisia, France) for roads in the Tunis North, Tunis
South, Hammamet and Sousse regions, and by SCET (France) for roads in the
Zarzis and Djerba regions. Although the Bank usually requires detailed
engineering for the approval of highway projects, in the present case prelimi-
nary engineering is accepted as a basis since the roads in the tourist project
are comparable to those under the Bank's current first highway project on
which we have recent and reliable cost experience.
7.        In Tunis North, the works consist of:  (i) paving the unpaved
portion of the road known as the RaouAd loop connecting GP 9, the direct road
to Tunis, and the coastal road; (ii) creation of a second "loop" connection
with the coastal road, at Gammarth, and (iii) construction of a corniche road
parallel with the coastal road but set back somewhat in the hills. The Tunis
South zone will be provided with a road branching off from the principal north-
south highway (GP 1) to serve the shoreline facilities. The coastline in the
Hammamet area is adequately served by the existing highway, MC 28. The new
road to be built in that region will lead from MC 28 inland where existing
plans call for an important tourism development, including Tunisia's first golf
club.
8.        In the Sousse zone, the existing road linking GP 1 with the picturesque
village of Hergla will be improved, and a bypass around Hergla will be built  The
gap in the existing coastal road at the El Menzel estuary will be eliminated by



ANNEX 3
Page 3
the construction of a bridge. The urban area of El Kantaoui will be relieved
of through traffic and enhanced by construction of a bypass with a panoramic
view, and the missing short link between the existing coastal road and Sousse
township will be established. In Zarzis, the existing earth road serving the
shoreline facilities will be improved and paved, and extended to link up at
Sidi Chemmakh with the highway MC 117 leading to Djerba. In Djerba, the road
from the Melita airport to Houmt Souk will be improved, a new, direct and
scenic road between Houmt and Midoun will be built, and bypasses around Houmt
Souk, Midoun, Sirenes-Meninx, Taguerness and Aghir will be established.
9.        The roads in the project generally run through flat or gently roll-
ing terrain and pose no major engineering problems. Alignments have been
selected with care to conserve recreational and esthetic values and to blend
harmoniously with the landscape. The design standards (Table 2) are con-
sistent with prevailing characteristics of the national road network and the
tourist function of the roads. Design speeds are moderate, from 60 to 80 km
per hour. The main roads will be 11 m wide with 6 m pavement which is a
minimum for this category. The only exceptions will be the Raoud loop in
Tunis North and the Houmt Souk bypass, which will be 12 m wide with a 7 m
pavement. The existing parts of the Raoud loop have already been built to this
standard. The access roads will be 9 m wide with 5 m pavement, which is a
minimum for two-way traffic. Pavements will be bituminous surfaced; their
structural strength will be designed to the national standard except for the
access roads where lower criteria will be applied. Intersections will be care-
fully designed for safe operation and where appropriate, executed with pro-
vision for upgrading in stages as future traffic may require. The design
standards are considered adequate and effective for their purpose.
C. Cost Estimates
10.       The total cost of the road component of the project including US$ 0.50
million for land acquisition is estimated at US$ 14.8 million, I/ with a foreign
currency component of US$ 7.2 million. Details of the estimates are given in
Tables 1 and 3 of this Annex. Construction cost estimates were prepared by the
consultants Studi-BCE0M and SCET based on quantities derived from preliminary
engineering. Unit prices used in the estimates were compared with those obtained
in recent bids under the Bank's first highway project, and subsequently some
adjustments were made.
11.       Construction cost estimates (Table 1) were established for price
levels prevailing at the end of 1971. To this base, allowances for price
escalation between the end of 1971 and the scheduled time of bidding of 5% per
year were added. Because of the great number of infrastructure projects being
initiated in Tunisia, the construction industry is likely to experience a
boom in the coming years, and an additional price increase allowance of 5% was
added to the estimates to account for this contingency. Finally, the estimate
was raised by 5% to allow for contractual price revisions during the anticipated
L/  The US$ 0.50 million of estimated land acquisition costs account for the
difference between the total cost of the road component presented in this
Annex and the total cost shown in Table III, para. 3.16 of the main
appraisal report.

two-year construction periods. Thus, the compound amount of price increase
allowances related to the 1971 price levels is 18.5%. Contingency allowances
for quantity variations amount to 20%, wfhich is appropriate since quantities
have been derived from preliminary engineering only. The cost of engineering
services for detailed engineering and supervision of the above construction
works is tentative and was estimated as a percentage of construction costs.
12.       The foreign exchange component of construction works is estimated
at about 50% for the two major construction lots, assuming that locally
established firms will share about half of the works, which is likely.  The
foreign component for the secondary access road contracts is about 45%, since
these works will most likely be let to small local contractors. The foreign
cost components of engineering services for the various contracts, as pro-
visionally estimated, range between 30% and 70%, depending on possible combina-
tions of local and foreign firms and personnel.
D. Execution
13.       Execution of the road component will be the joint responsibility of
ONTT and the "Direction des Ponts et Chaus6es" (DPC) of the Ministry of Public
Works. Essentially, the ONTT will have administrative and financial, and the
DPC technical responsibility for the road program. Upon completion of the
works, the roads will be turned over to the DPC for maintenance. An inter-
agency agreement defining the relative responsibilities of ONTT and DPC has
already been concluded and approved by the Council of Ministers.
14.       The road construction works have been divided into five contracts
(Table 1). The major contracts, designated as Lots 1 to 4, comprise the main
roads and those sections of access roads (about 50 km) whose alignments can
already be determined on the basis of the master plans of the tourism zones.
The smaller contract, designated as Lot 5, comprises those sections of access
roads (about 30 km) which will provide direct connection with hotels and other
facilities whose locations have not yet been determined. Consequently the
alignment of these road sections will be over the project period as hotel and
other facility plans become available. Lot 5 may be subdivided into phases
to be executed over the project period.
15.       The detailed engineering of the works under the four major contracts
will be prepared by consultants, most likely Studi-BCEOM and SCET who prepared
the preliminary engineering. Signature of the consultants' contracts is a
condition of loan and credit effectiveness. For the supervision of the road
works, the Government will establish a special unit ("Service des Op6rations
Speciales") within the DPC, similar to the "cellule de controle" which is
currently supervising the works under the Bank's first highway project.
Technical assistance to this special unit will be provided by consultants.
During negotiations, the Government agreed that, if the Service des Op6rations
Sp6ciales could not be established in good time, a consulting firm would be
employed for construction supervision.
16.       The smaller contract will involve small, scattered works requiring
much coordination in layout and timing with developers of hotels and other
facilities. The detailed engineering and supervision of these works will be



ANNEX 3
Page 5
entrusted to consultants. In order to relieve the Government agencies from
the numerous trivial tasks of dealing with developers and contractors which are
involved in such operations, the consultants will also be asked to assist in
the administration of the works. A local engineering firm is most likely to
be selected for this assignment; he signing of the consultant's contract is
a condition of loan and credit effectiveness.
17.       Lots 1 to 4 will be let on the basis of unit price contracts after
full-scale international competitive bidding. The lots will be subdivided
into parts and contracts will be permitted to bid for one or any combination
of the parts. This arrangement is designed to stimulate competition between
contractors of different size. Bids for the first two lots are scheduled for
the beginning of 1973, and for the third and fourth lots about one year later.
Construction of each lot will take about two years. Thus, the works are
expected to be completed in the first half of 1976.
18.       Programming of Lot 5 will be contingent upon the progress of con-
struction of hotels and other facilities. Thus, it will not be possible to
prepare detailed engineering in advance for sufficient works to make up an
attractive construction contract. The solution proposed is to estimate for
a given period, say one year or 18 months, the type, volume, spacial distribution
and timing of works, and to ask contractors to submit bids for unit prices
based on a detailed schedule of anticipated work quantities. This arrangement
would provide the flexibility needed to build the access roads consistent with
the progress in hotel construction. Since the works are small, bids will be
advertized only locally but will be open to foreign as well as local firms.
Lot 5 will cover the access road construction program for three years -- mid-1973
through mid-1976.
F., Economic Evaluation
19.       If the anticipated growth in the tourism industry is to be realized,
the facilities to attract additional visitors and the basic infrastructure to
support and accommodate them must be provided. While the proposed investments
will undoubtedly benefit not only tourism but also general traffic, their
economic justification hinges on the tourist development program in which they
find their origin and of which they form an integral part.
20.       Two criteria were utilized in assessing the justification of the
individual items in the road investment package: how effectively the works
proposed would serve existing and anticipated tourist requirements; and how
the attraction of the tourist area in question would be enhanced. In addition,
the adequacy of the proposed alignments was checked against the overall layout
of the development plan for each zone in terms of land use, site conservation,
and integration with the general road network. Using these criteria, the
individual elements of the proposed road investment package were found
appropriate for inclusion in the tourism project.

APPRAISAL OF THE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY COMPONENT
1.        The capacity of the major water supply facilities supplying the
regions in which the project zones are located are in the process of
being expanded by the Socift6 Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution
des Eaux (SONEDE), the national water authority. SONEDE's program is being
financed by a Bank loan (581-TUN) and by an IDA credit (209-TUN). Except
for the Djerba and Zarzis project zones, where supply capacity will have to
be expanded by new works included in the project, the expanded capacity
available when SONEDE's ongoing projects are completed will be sufficient
to meet the demand of the other tourism project zones until 1981. Only the
water distribution networks in these project zones will require new works.
The main elements of the proposed works were designed by Soci;ete Generale
d'Etudes Hydrauliques et Agricoles (SOGETHA), a French consultant, as part
of the SONEDE project financed by Credit 209-TUN. SONEDE has updated these
designs to reflect modification in tourisa development plans. The project
elements selected represent the least cost solution using a discount rate
of 8%.
A. Description
2.        The main items of this project component are (the completion of) a
second pipeline supplying Djerba and Zarzis, trunk distribution mains and
other distribution branches to the project zones, reservoirs, and lines to
connect hotels to the distribution systems. These elements are further
described below by project area.
Tunis North
3.        The existing facilities which supply the North of Tunis have
sufficient capacity to meet the demand created by hotel development in Raouad.
Only distribution expansions are necessary. Works would include 4600 m of 12"
distribution main; a 1000 m storage reservoir, and the connections from the
distribution mains to the 'hotels.
Tunis South
4.        The project zone will be supplied by the pipeline from Tunis to
Nabeul. The works will consist of:
(i)  a 12" supply main, 700 m long, from the Tunis-Nabeul
pipeline to a reservoir;
(ii)  a 1500 m3 reservoir at Bordj Cedria;
(iii)  about 10 km of distribution mains of 8", 10", and 12"
diameter, to serve Bordj Cedria and Soliman;



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(iv) Hotel connections
Nabeul - Hammamet
5.        Upon completion of the works in progress, the water supply and
distribution systems of this region will have sufficient capacity to meet
the demand due to the development of tourism in the project zone until 1981.
The only works included in the project are, consequently, hotel connections.
Sousse North
6.        This area is supplied by the Sahel regional water system.  This
system is being expanded from a capacity of 360 1/sec to 1100 1/sec
(Loan 581-TUN and Credit 209-TUN). The project would ensure that the local
demand of the tourist zone of Sousse North can be met, when 22,500 beds are
in operation. This requires that distribution antennae from the Sahel
system be extended and reinforced.
7.        The following facilities would be included in the project:
(i) a 12" to 161" coastal distribution main, about 16 km long;
(ii)  a 12" to 16" supply antenna (6 km long) from the Oued Laya
,Reservoir to the new reservoir at Sidi El Kantaoui;
(iii)  a 16" distribution main (25 km long) from the reservoir to
the coastal distribution line;
(iv) the Sidi El Kantaoui Reservoir of 5000 m3 capacity;
(v) a 16" distribution antenna, about 15 km long, connecting
the supply systems of central Sahel to the North Sahel,
thus reinforcing the supply capacity of the Sousse North area;
(vi) connection lines to the hotels.
Djerba - Zarzis
8.        The supply capacity to Djerba and Zarzis is presently being
expanded from 80 1/sec to 130 1/sec. This capacity is insufficient to meet
the demand of the tourism industry and the proposed works would therefore
develop all known groundwater sources and expand the capacity of the pipeline
serving Djerba and Zarzis to its ultimate capacity of 225 1/sec. Tourism
demand would be met until 1979; after that year desalting of sea water may
become necessary, if the planned exploratory drillings, 150 km from Djerba
are not successful. Water presently supplied to Djerba and Zarzis is of
adequate physical and bacteriological quality. However, the chloride content
at 750 mg/l and the sulfate content at 850 mg/l is higher than the maximum
allowed by the WHO standard. This means that the water has a salty taste and
a laxative action. The poor chemical quality of the water has not impeded
tourism development since tourists generally drink bottled water. The quality



ANNEX 4
Page 3
of the water sources to be developed by the project would not be better
than at present.
9.        The project works include the following:
(i) development and equipment of groundwater resources of
Hassi and Abdel Malek;
(ii)  supply mains from the sources to Lassifer (11.9 km of
20" pipe and 12.6 km of 12" pipe);
(iii) pressure valve structures at Lassifer;
(iv)  doubling a 40.2 km section of the main between Lassifer
and Djerba, by a pipe of 20" diameter;
(v) construction of reservoirs and pressure control valves
at Djerba and Zarzis;
(vi)  construction of 7.3 km of 10" distribution lines and
of hotel connections;
(vii) exploratory drillings for groundwater and prefeasibility
study for a desalting plant.
B. Cost Estimate
10.       The cost estimates and their breakdown are shown below in
summarized form per project zone. Detailed cost estimates for the water
supply component of the project are shown in attached Appendix 1.

11.       The cost estimates were developed by SONEDE and are based on
preliminary designs. The unit costs used are comparable to costs of similar
works recently designed and constructed under the supervision of SONEDE, and
are considered reasonable. Construction is expected to take two and a half
years.
12.       An item for physical contingencies, amounting to 15% of cost of
works and 10% of consultants' costs, has been included to allow for variation
in the scope of work. Price increases totalling 10% of cost of works, con-
sultants', and physical contingencies have been included and should be adequate
on the basis of past experience.
13.       Local as well as foreign contractors compete for civil works.  All
contracts for civil works, which include supply and installation of pipes, will
be awarded after international competitive bidding as is the normal practice
of SONEDE. Construction of the connection lines to the hotels, amounting to
about us$ 1.5 million would be done by SONEDE, either by force account or by
negotiated unit price contracts with local contractors.
C. Procurement
14.       A high percentage of the pipes and materials required for the
project are produced locally, but recent experience shows that foreign
suppliers can be competitive (even with 15% preference) for asbestos cement,
cast iron and steel pipes. The margin of preference for local manufacturers
would be 15% on the CIF cost of goods or the customs duties, whichever is less.
D.  Administration
15.       Administration and operation of water supply facilities in Tunisia
is entrusted to the National company, SONEDE. Project works would be financed
by the Government and funds would be channeled to SONEDE through Office
National du Tourisme et Thermalisme ,(ONTT), which has prime responsibility for
the tourisn project.
16.       A convention between ONTT and SONEDE, specifying the relationship
between the two authorities on matters of procurement and disbursement has
been approved by both parties.
E. Financial Aspects
(i) Financing of Water Supply Component
17.       The total cost of the water supply component (Appendix 1) is
estimated to amount to D4.0 million.  Major works undertaken by contractors
are estimated at D3.3 million and appear in the SONEDE cash flow as "Component
of Tourism Infrastructure". Extensions and connections to hotels for D 0.7
million are included in the general program of extensions and connections of
SONEDE.



Page 5
(ii)  Present Financial Position of SONEDE
18.       Financial statements covering the period 1969 through 1981 appear
in Appendices 2, 3 and 4; Appendix 5 lists the assumptions on which these
projections are based. SONBDE's financial situation is satisfactory.
Revenues have been increasing at an average annual rate of 7% since 1969
and operating expenses at a lower rate; hence with net fixed assets almost
constant, the rate of return has been improving from 4.1% to an estimated
5.2% in 1971. Agreed capital contribution for 1971 and arrears for 1970
have been paid by the Government in 1971 (D 2.3 million). SONEDE shows a
strong cash position (D 1.5 million) at the end of 1971 along with high
accounts receivable; arrears from the Government and local authorities
still represent about one year's billings for these customers, which
represent about 60% of the total arrears.
(iii) Financial Forecasts
19.       Financial projections for 1972 and 1973 are based on the existing
tariffs, which produce a national average of 62 millimes per m3; these
tariffs are sufficient to support SONEDE's investment program and produce a
rate of return slightly above 5% for these years.
20.       A nationwide increase in tariffs projected at the time of
appraisal of Loan 581-TUN is scheduled for 1974. Projections show that a
rate increase of about 18% from an average 62 millimes to an average of 73
millimes is sufficient for SONEDE to meet its covenant rate of return on
investment of 6% after 1975, service its debt and finance without government
capital contribution, its estimated D 38 million national investment program
for the period 1974-1981.
21.       An estimated cash surplus of about D 5.5 million is projected at
the end of the period which may be a protection for SONEDE against physical
and price contingencies of its investments projects. However, should
excessive cash balance accumulate, their utilization would be a matter for
discussion between SONEDE, the Bank Group, the Government and SIDA.
F. Pricing
22.       The present uniform nationwide tariff approximates, except in
southern Tunisia, the average costs in the various regions.
23.       The southern Tunisian Region, comprising the four areas of Djerba,
Zarzis, Medenine, and Ben Gardane, is now supplied with ground water from
distant wells. Demand from rapid tourism development in Djerba and Zarzis
has outgrown supply. Capacity will be increased in two stages. The first
will be financed under Credit 209-TUN and will begin in 1972, and the second
financed under the proposed tourism infrastructure loan in 1973. As local
water is saline and insufficient, additional water will be brought from wells
some 110 km away from Djerba. The scarcity of water in arid southern Tunisia



ANNEX 4
Page 6
will probably make desalting necessary around 1980 unless the present
exploratory drillings 150 km away from Djerba are successful. The cost of
water consuled will be rising rapidly, from a prelent level of some 130
millimes /m  on average to around 500 millimes /m  when desalting is intro-
duced.
2h.      In this context, economically efficient water pricing is important.
In order to serve as a proper price signal for future investment and dis-
courage hotel overinvestment, the true cost of water should be reflected in
the prices consumers pay. Price should also favor an even and high utilization
of existing capacity by encouraging the transfer of demand from peak periods to
off-peak periods. This objective could be achieved by the introduction of
seasonal differential pricing which would be substantially higher than in the
rest of Tunisia because of higher water costs in Djerba and Zarzis.
25.      Should water rates remain unchanged, investment misallocations and
probable water shortage are likely to follow. Tariffs should be raised to
approach the full economic cost, no later than in 1974. The tariff structure
should also differentiate between peak and off-peak periods and reflect the
different marginal costs during the respective periods.
26.      A subsidy to the tourism industry may be justified, as hotel entre-
preneurs are presently in a buyers' market where they may playoff subsidies
from various Mediterranean countries against each other. However, a subsidy
should not encourage consumption of a scarce resource such as water, for which
the long run marginal cost is rising steeply, and if it has to be provided it
should take the form of investment grants or tax concessions which are less
distortionary.
27.      During negotiations it has been agreed that SONEDE, upon completion
of the hydrogeological and water consumption studies it is presently under-
taking, shall introduce in Djerba and Zarzis, water rate schedules which
would reflect the higher marginal costs of supplying water to large consumers
during the peak periods. The detailed structure and level of such water rates
would be  evaluated   as part of the study ONTT shall make    to improve the
effectiveness of the current system of investment incentives to the Tourism
industry. The result of this study should be available before the end of 1973,
in time to serve as basis for the projected increases in SONEDEts water rates.

Assumptions for Financial Tables
Income Statements
1.        Sales of water, in cubic meters, are projected to grow at 7%
per year after 1975. An average rate of 62 millimes per cubic meter is
assumed until mid-1974, when a rate increase to 73 millimes becomes
necessary in order for SONEDE to meet its covenant rate of return of 5%
on net fixed assets in 1974-1975 and 6% thereafter.
2.        Other fees and charges are for maintenance and rent of meters.
3.        Tax on water sales is a special tax on water rates and a service
tax on other fees and charges. This tax on water sales is turned over to
the Government.
4.        Charges for new connections are calculated at a rate of D 42.3 each.
5.        Provision for bad debts is projected at 2% of accounts receivable
in line with past performance.
6.        Wages and salaries for 1971 and 1972 are as budgeted.  Thereafter,
they increase on the average at 3% a year to reflect seniority benefits.
It is assumed that expanding operations will not require any additional
staff as productivity would increase..
7.        Projections for Energy, Fuel and Chemicals consumption have been
made region by region to take into account differences in consumption patterns
for different systems. Materials are projected on a global basis. No changes
in the unit cost of power have been assumed as the power company STEG does
not intend to increase its tariffs, nor in the unit cost of chemicals and
materials for which economies of scale should balance any increase of unit
prices. These operating costs are assumed to rise in proportion to various
factors such as water sales, new connections, investments or otherwise as
appropriate to the type of expense and the region under consideration.
8.        Transportation, other supplies and services, office and miscella-
neous expenses, are assumed to remain fairly constant due to improved
efficiency.
9.        Taxes include taxes on water as mentioned in paragraph 3, and
various other taxes such as car taxes and vocational taxes.



ANNEX 4
Appendix 5
Page 2
10.       The sums shown as transfer to assets are operating funds used to
construct new fixed assets, such as extensions, and should be considered
as a capital expenditure.
11.       Annual depreciation is calculated at 2.5% of the average gross
fixed assets in service each year.
Cash Flow Statements
12.       Consumerst capital contributions relate to a fraction of the
expenditures for the extension of mains which is paid by the customers.
13.       Sfax water supply project is assumed to be financed 50% by a loan,
at 7% interest, repayable over 20 years from the date of completion of works.
14.       At the end of 1971, accounts payable included suppliers and con-
tractors, miscellaneous items such as advance payments received and the net
balance (D 1.58 million) of a Realization Account which SONEDE is administer-
ing on behalf of its predecessor, a government agency. In projections, the
first category is assumed to continue at the same level (about two month6'
charges) and miscellaneous to remain constant. As for the latter, it is
unlikely that SONEDE will remit the balance due to the Government for pre-
1968 operations before 1976 while SONEDE's cash flow needs still require
government capital contribution and a tariff increase. It is projected
that SONEDE will pay one third of the outstanding balance in 1976 and the
remaining in 1977.
15.       Interest and amortization are based on the new parity of the dinar
to the dollar.
16.       Long-term receivable, which are loans made to customers by SONEDE
for new connections and extensions, are shown net of the year's payments.
17.       Inventories are assumed to be slightly decreasing and then kept
constant because of improved inventory policies.
18.       Accounts receivable represent arrears of private consumers and
Administration. They are shown net of bad debts provisions. It is pro-
jected that accounts receivable will decrease gradually to average three
months' billings in 1976 and onwards.
Balance Sheet
19.       Consumers' capital contributions are shown net of depreciation,
as depreciation of extensions is not charged to income account but written
off against consumers' capital contributions.

APPRAISAL CF THE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
SEWERAGE AND WATER POLLUTION ABATEWENT C(MPONENT
A. Background
1.        In general, tourism accommodations in the project zones have
developed in ribbonlike fashion near cities or towns along the coast.
Large areas of these cities and towns are equipped with collective sewerage
systems. Combined systems (storm water and sewage) prevail in the older
central sections, while separate systems have been installed in most of the
newer sections. Individual systems, using septic tanks, are the rule in the
less densely populated residential areas.
2.        Construction of sewers has lagged behind the development of the
cities, overloading some main sewers. Operation and maintenance of the
sewerage network needs also considerable improvements. In spite of these
deficiencies, the inadequacies of the existing municipal sewer networks are
of minor importance compared to the occurrence of nuisances which could deter
tourism development. Once collected, untreated sewage is either discharged
into the nearest stream or near the shoreline through beach outfalls. As a
result, pollution of beaches, which is not yet really serious, will increase
rapidly as the tourism project zones develop and as urban areas expand.
B. Description
3.        The purpose of the proposed works is to abate pollution due to
sewage discharge by the collection and treatment of all sewage from the hotels
and from municipal sewerage systems in the vicinity of the project zones. The
degree of treatment provided and the location of treated effluent discharges
would ensure that the water of bathing beaches of the project zones would be
free from obnoxious conditions due to inadequate sewerage and treatment
facilities.
4.        The project would include in each project zones  (i) sewerage
facilities for the hotels, (ii) main sewers and pumping stations to convey
the bulk sewage collected by the existing municipal sewerage to treatment
plants, (iii) sewage treatment and disposal facilities, (iv) operational and
maintenance equipment, (v) services of coiEultants including a feasibility
study for treatment and disposal of greater Tunis sewage, and (vi) provisions
for training staff. The project facilities have a design capacity sufficient
to collect and treat the sewage flows through 1981, when second stage facilities
should be completed. The project elements are described by zone in the follow-
ing paragraphs and are shown on Maps Nos. 3859-3864.



ANNEX 5

-anis North
5.        Sewage collected from the hotels to be developed in Raouad as
well as sewage from four existing hotels of Gammarth,will be lifted by
booster pumping stations to a stabilization pond and the effluent will be
used for irrigation. Sewage from the neighboring munieipalities of Gammarth,
La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said will continue to be discharged through the
existing beach outfalls. A study of sea currents shows that the beaches of
Raouad, situated to the northwest of Cape Gammarth,would not be polluted by
these municipal discharges.
6.        Project facilities consist of about 7 km of sewers, 4 lift pumping
stations, a stabilization pond of about 10 ha, and the sewer connections
to the hotels.
Tunis South
7.        Facilities similar to those of Tunis North would be constructed
to serve the hotel developments along the beaches of Soliman and Bordj
Cedria. They would include about 10 km of sewer lines, 6 booster stations,
and a stabilization pond of about 10 ha.
Nabeul - Hammamet
8.        This zone will be served by five systems and five new treatment
plants (Hammamet South, Hamamet North, Sillonville, Nabeul, and Beni Khiar).
Project facilities include about 25 km of gravity sewers and 10 km of force
sewer mains, 11 low lift pump stations, and five treatment plants.  The two
smaller plants would use the extended aeration process more suitable to the
treatment of sewage from small communities, while the three other plants
would use the activated sludge process with aerobic digestion. Individual
treatment units for four hotels will remain in service. Existing municipal
sewers would be connected to the new systems.
Sousse
9.        The project zone a 11 be served by two systems:  one for Sousse,
a city of 60,000 inhabitants, and one for the zone near El Kantaoui. Exist-
ing municipal sewers would be connected to the system. A final choice
between two alternatives for treatment and disposal remains to be made. In
the first alternative, the sewage from the Sousse area would be treated in
a stabilization pond, and that from El Kantaoui in an activated sludge plant.
In the second alternative, sewage from Sousse and El Kantaoui would be
discharged through a sea outfall. The present costs of both alternatives are
similar, but the more detailed site investigations and studies of currents
that will be undertaken before the detailed design of the sea outfall might
modify the cost estimates, while the cost of stabilization ponds is likely



ANNEX-5
Page 3
to be reduced if higher design loads, to be derived from the operational
results of the pilot stabilization pond, (para. 24 (v)) can be used. The
cost of the solution that is finally selected should not exceed the present
estimate. It is recommended as a condition of the loan that the choice
between sewage treatment in a stabilization pond or disposal through a sea
outfall should be subject to Bank approval.
10.       Project facilities would include, in addition to treatment plants
or the sea outfall, about 22 km of gravity sewers, 16 km of force sewer
mains, 10 low-lift pump stations, and sewer connections to the hotels.
Dierba
11.       The Djerba hotels will continue to be sparsely spread over a vast
area with very little housing development in between. The little town of
Houmt Souk would not have more than 20,000 inhabitants in 1981 (about 10,000
presently), mainly in low density areas that cannot be sewered economically.
The zone would be served by five systems and five treatment units. Two of
the smallest systems would be linked to the existing hotel treatment units.
The three new systems would serve the main hotel zones and Houmt Souk.
Project facilities include about 4 km of gravity sewers, 9 km of force sewer
mains, 6 low-lift pump stations and 3 new treatment plants, the largest one
would use the activated sludge process and the two others the extended
aeration process.
Zarzis
12.       Population and densities are similar in Zarzis to those of Djerba.
The project would build two separate systems in the two hotel areas, three
and ten km north of Zarsis, each with a treatment plant using the extended
aeration process Station and including a total of seven low-lift pumping stations.
C. Cost Estimates
13.       The cost estimates and their breakdown are shown below in swuma-
rized form. Detailed cost estimates for the Sewerage and Pollution Abate-
ment Component of the project are shown in Appendix I.

a/  Includes feasibility studies for Tunis and pilot stabilization pond.
14.       The cost estimates were developed by Bureau Central pour l'Etude
et 1'Equipement d'Outre Mer (BCEOM), a French consultant,  on the basis of
preliminary design, reviewed during the appraisal and adjusted to the price
levels of Jarnary 1972. BCECO estimates are based on unit prices for civil
works contracts for similar works recently undertaken by the Ministry of
Agriculture's Hydraulic Department and the municipalities. These unit prices
have been adjusted by BCEOM to take into account a lack of construction
supervision by these agencies and the small size of the contracts. Estimates
for plant equipment are based on prices quoted by major European suppliers,
and adjusted to include delivery and erection in Tunisia.
15.       Physical contingencies average 17% of cost of works (13.3% of total
component cost).  Different percentages have been taken for civil works,
equipment and design and supervision.  For civil works these contingencies
average 22% of cost of works, reflecting the higher degrees of uncertainties
in the physical quantities estimate. Physical contingencies average 15% for
equipment and 10% for consultants.



Page 5
16.       Price contingencies are calculated on the basis of a 5% yearly
increase in costs. They represent 13.7% of total component cost.
D. Procurement
17.       All major contracts for civil works and for procurement of equip-
ment will be awarded after international competitive bidding. Construction
of the sewage connection lines to individual hotels will be done either by
negotiated supply and lay contracts with local contractors or by local
competitive bidding.
18.       Except for the supply of certain categories of sewer pipes, local
manufacturers are not expected to compete for equipment contracts. The
margin of preference for local suppliers would be 15% on the
C.I.F. cost of the goods or the customs duties, whichever is less.
E. Design of Works
19.       The project's feasibility study was prepared by BCEOM.  The study
was financed by a grant of the Swedish Goverment.
20.       BCEOM, using a computer model recently developed, prepared for
each project zones:
(i) the most economic sequence of investments for the
development of the sewerage system of the urban
areas and of the hotel zones;
(ii) the least cost solution regarding location and
number of treatment units;
(iii) the selection of the most economic type of treat-
ment or disposal. Alternatives considered included:
stabilization ponds (facultative type), activated
sludge (extended aeration with aerobic digestion,
and high-rate aeration with aerobic digestion).
It seems, however, that, given the Tunisian climatic
conditions, the design loads for stabilization ponds
could be higher than those used by BCEOM. To assess
the optimal design load, a pilot stabilization pond
will be constructed in the Tunis area and operated
for about a year. Results of these experiments would
be used for the detailed engineering of the project; and
(iv) the most economic staging of the phases of construction
of the facilities.



ANNEX 5

F. Execution
21.      Construction of the projectts sewerage component facilities would
be undertaken by a special projects division created by the Ministry of
Agriculture in the Hydraulic Department (H.A.R.). H.A.R. is presently
responsible for planning and construction of all sewage facilities financed
by the Government. Its performance has been sluggish due to its cumbersome
administrative budgetary system. Low salaries of professional staff coupled
with the deteriorating reputation of the department prevent the recruitment
in sufficient number of qualified professionals. Creation of a special
division within H.A.R., with its own budget provided by project funds
controlled by Office National du Tourisme et Thermalisme (ONTT), and with
staff exclusively assigned to the project would avoid delays in project
execution. It would also ensure that contractors and consultants be paid
within a reasonable period.
22.      The special project division was established by a decision of the
Ministry of Agriculture, which nominates the divisionts chief officer and
establishes its organization. The special division should be operative and
have its key professional staff in place before the loan and credit are made
effective.
23.      Technical assistance to the special division would be provided
through a general contract with consultants (BCEDM), who will assist special
division staff in all phases of project implementation. The extent of this
assistance will vary throughout the duration of the project so as to meet
the need for experienced staff that could not be recruited locally. Terms i
Reference for this contract have been reviewed by the Bank and finalized during
negotiations. Signature of the contract should be a condition of effectiveness.
24.      Final engineering is to be done by BCBDM, which has completed the
feasibility study. Terms of Reference for the final engineering have been
updated and expanded to include pilot plant study of stablization ponds. The
engineering contract have been finalized and reviewed by the Bank during
negotiations. Signature of the contract should be a condition of effectiveness.
25.      An agreement specifying the relationship between the tourism authority,
Office National du Tourisme et Thermalisme (ONTT) and H.A.R. on matters of
project preparation, construction supervision, procurement and disbursements
has been approved by ONTT and H.A.R. and their respective ministries.
G. Organization for Operation
26.      When completed, the sewage and pollution abatement facilities would
be operated by Socifte4 Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribtuion des Eaux
(SONEDE), the national water company. To this effect the law establishing
SONEDE had to be modified to enlarge the scope of SONEDE's activities. The
law enables SONEDE to operate, maintain and renew the project's sewage



ANNEX 5
Page 7
and pollution abatement facilities in each of the tourism zones and
eventually operate, maintain and review similar facilities throughout
the country. This law has been enacted.
27.       Governmental decrees would be required to define the geograph-
ical areas where SONEDE would be entrusted with sewerage facilities. It
has been agreed during negotiations that the project's sewerage and
pollution abatement facilities will be entrusted to SONEDE not later than
the date of completion of such facilities. The law also provides that a
general convention promulgated by decree would establish the framework and
the parameters for procedures, for charges and relationships between SONEDE
and the party concerned (government, municipalities, or private entities),
leaving only the specific values of parameters to be fixed in individual
agreements with each party.  A generalagreeiAemt  and related decree satis-
factory to the Bank should be signed and promulgated before the loan and
credit are made effective.
28.       To operate the project's facilities, SONEDE would have to establish
a new Technical Department. The organization of this department, its require-
ments in staff and equipment, have been evaluated by BCEOY. Total new staff
is expected to number 140, of whom four would be professionals and 30 super-
visors and foremen. The required funds for the training of specialists to
operate the facilities are included in the project. Specialized maintenance
equipment and vehicles would also be provided by the project.
H. Financial Aspects
29.       The total cost of the sewerage component is estimated to be D 8.0
million (Appendix 1). With regard to the unit responsible for the construc-
tion of the sewerage component, all its funds will be provided by the Govern-
ment through ONTT.  After completion, the works, which amount to D 7.7 million,
will be entrusted by ONTT to the Department of SONEDE established to operate
the sewerage and water pollution abatement facilities. This department would
receive from the Government a contribution of D 0.2 million for its working
capital.
30.       Sewerage service and water pollution abatement costs would only be
charged to hotels because the tourism industry will be the main beneficiary
of the treatment and disposal of the sewage that could otherwise pollute the
beaches and impede tourism development.
31.       The level of the sewerage charges would be set to cover at least
operating costs and depreciation. However, the incremental revenue generated
by the taxes levied on touriam expenditures would be sufficient to pay the
debt service and earn a return on the capital in sewerage works, (as well as
other infrastructure elements).  As mentioned in para.6.09 of the main report,
the internal financial rate of return to the Govermrent on total investment
would be 22%.



ANNEX 5
Page 8
32.      It is proposed that sewerage charges should be levied as an annual
charge. The sewerage charges would differ from one category of hotel to
another to take into account the different levels of water consumption for
different hotel categories. Appendix 2 shows that a yearly average rate of
D 10.5 per bed would be sufficient to cover operating costs and depreciation.
As an example of the implications of the annual charge, a rate of D 10.5 per
bed would represent 1.3% of the annual revenue per bed of a tourist hotel,
and 4.5% of the annual gross profit based on a 50% occupancy rate.
33.      It has been agreed during negotiations that sewerage charges be
established by SONEDE prior to the first year of operating the sewage and
water pollution abatement facilities of the project zones, which charges
should provide revenues sufficient to cover at least operating costs and
straight line depreciation on fixed assets in service.
34.      Financial statements covering the first five years of operation of
SONEDE's sewerage and water pollution abatement department, i.e. from 1976
through 1981, appear in Appendices 2, 3, and 4.
35.      The financial prospects of this new department are satisfactory.
In the first five years, internal cash generated from operation is estimated
at an average of D 0.5 million per year. It is sufficient to finance the
increase in working capital, all the works of the second stage program, which
amounts to D 1.10 million and renewal costs. It would leave about D 1.4
million in cash to be used for urban sewerage development and major renewals
of equipment later on.

AssMtions for Financial Tables
Income Statements
1.        In the first years of operation, operating expenses such as
electricity, energy, maintenance, and salaries will be taken as a percentage
of 1981 levels: for wghich they have been computed. Office and miscellaneous
expenses are assumed to remain fixed from 1976 on.
2.        Electricity consumption has been calculated for each facility,
based on electricity consumption of similar facilities in other countries.
The electricity rates are likely to remain at their present level throughout.
For a consumption regularly spread over time, the rate is 0,01035 D/kwh.
It is assumed that in 1976, electricity consuation will be 80 percent of
the full capacity year and will rise gradually.
3.        Fuel consumption is based on the number of vehicles in service.
It is expected to rise gradually like electricity. Fuel rates are assumed
to remain constant as Tunisia is slowly developing its own fuel resources.
4.        Maintenance expenses include the parts and maintenance materials
for facilities and the repair costs incurred for cars and vehicles. The
components of the sewerage system, and in particular the electromechanical
ones, are expected to need little maintenance in the first years of operation
so that expenses in 1976 are assumed to be only 65% of their projected level
in 1981.
5.        Salaries and wages are based on a detailed projection of 1976-1981
staffing requirements made by BCEOM. Salaries are rising gradually to take
into account that, though full professional staffing is necessary at the
beginning of the operations, full maintenance staff will be only needed in
1981.  A 3% yearly increase due to seniority has been assumed.  The salary
scale reflects the fact that the newly created department should attract high
caliber professional staff members and well-qualified technicians.
6.        Office and Miscellaneous Expenses.  It is expected that SONEDE will
bear additional expenses due to the creation of this new department.
These additional expenses are broken down as follows:
- rentals:                             D 188,000
- stamps, telephone:                   D  6,000
- insurance:                           D  7,000
- taxes on car:                        D  3,200

7.        Depreciation is taken to be at an average of 4.80% calculated on
the mid-year value of fixed assets. This 4.80% average depreciation rate
is based on the following accounting lives:
pipes:                                   50 years
connections:                             50 years
building and other structures:           25 years
electromechanical equipment:             15 years
other equipments                         10 years
maintenance equipment:                   10 years
vehicles:                                 5 years
This depreciation rate is relatively high because equipment represents about
30% of the total fixed assets.
Cash Flow Statements
8.        Government capital contribution includes in the first year of
operation, inventories and cash, and in later years new connections.
9.        Second stage works are the extension of sewage facilities in Nabeul-
Hammamet and Sousse.
10.       Other works and renewals include the renewal of vehicles in 1981.
Balance Sheet
11.       Accounts receivable  are assumed to be in line with SONEDE arrears
for customers other than Administration and amount to 3 months' billings.
They are net of bad debts which are assumed to be 2% of revenues.
12.       Inventories are expected to be in the magnitude of D 100,000 through-
out, as shown in a detailed study of the feasibility report. The inventories
will include treatment and maintenance materials, spare pumps and motors used
in the sewage treatment and in the pumping stations. There would be two units
of each item in order to avoid the inconvenience of long delivery delays when
ordering replacements.
13.       Accounts payable are calculated as 2 months' expense on electricity,
maintenance, administration and other expenses.

TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF THE TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENT
A. Background
1.        Electric power for public use in Tunisia is provided by
Societe Tunisienne de L'Electricitd et du Gaz (STEG), a government owned
autonomous entity created in 1962, which operates both the electricity and
gas services throughout the country.
2.        Although STEG is a relatively young entity it has made remark-
able progress during the past few years in improving its capability and
efficiency. It provides reliable service at reasonable cost and with the
assistance of consultants, has developed an economical plan for the ex-
pansion of its system to meet forecast system demands through 1976. Stud-
ies are also underway to prepare for system requirements after that date.
3.        Tn 1971, STEG received a Bank loan of US$ 2.5 million for a
gas pipeline. The Bank made a power system expansion loan of US$ 12.0
million to STEG last April, which includes the extension of high voltage
transmission lines to serve the tourism zones where necessary.
4.        STEG is fully capable of planning and constructing the re-
quired power systems extensions and to make electric power available
to tourist facilities planned as part of its normal day to day activities.
B. Description
5.        The zones planned for tourist development are already within
reach of STEG's main transmission system. Hence the only requirement to
bring electricity to new hotels will be to make extensions where necessary
to the medium and low voltage system and to install transformer stations
at the individual hotels.
6.        The estimate of electric power demand is based upon the present
average of 0.6 kW per hotel bed in air conditioned hotels now being served
by STEG.  Annex 1 shows the forecast power demand in each zone.  The total
forecast additional demand for all tourist zones is for example, only
26,000 kVA during 1972-76, which is less than STEG's average annual growth
in total system demand. Both total and zonal demand will therefore be
easily met under STEG's normal expansion program.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
C. Cost Estimate
7.        The facilities required to connect the hotels to the high vol-
tage system would consist essentially of the following:-
1) A 10 kv, 15 kv or 30 kv medium tension line extension depending
on the system voltage in each zone.
2)  A medium tension switching and metering point and an estimated
500 meter feeder line to substations at each hotel
3)  A transformer substation at each hotel with 2 - 400 kVA trans-
formers to deliver power at low voltage to the consumer through
an estimated 1 km underground cable.
8.        The lengths of line and cable mentioned above will depend on the
actual requirements at each location. Annex 2 gives the estimated total
length of line or cable and the number of switching and transformer sta-
tions required in each zone.
9.        It is estimated that the total cost of the power component would
be about TD 3 million, of which the foreign exchange cost would be about
TI 1.4 million (see Annex 3).  These estimates are based on STBG's unit
costs of making other similar system extensions and connections to consu-
mers. The costs are reasonable for the facilities required. In order to
take care of price increases and contingencies during the construction,
9% has been added to both foreign and local costs for physical contingen-
cies; 10% has been added to local costs and 15% to foreign costs to cover
price increases.
D. Execution
10.       The project's electric power component would be executed by STEG.
The amount of work involved to connect the new hotels is a very small part
of STEG's normal work and would be handled without any difficulty by its
own work force. No major delays are foreseen and no external supervision
or coordination of STEG's work is required. On completion of the proposed
works, facilities financed by ONTT will be handed over to STEG for oper-
ation.
E. Procurement
11.       The material and equipment required by STEG to connect the hotels
is normally carried in stock by STEG and replaced as it is used. Imported
equipment would be procured through international competitive bidding, al-
though the amount involved is small in comparison with STEG's normal re-
quirements and therefore most of it would form a part of STEG's periodic
orders for similar equipment.

APPRhAI, OF THE TOURIT( INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
TELECC MUNICATION WCRKS
A. Background
1.        The Tunisian Goverment has accorded high priority to the develop-
ment of telecorm-uDicatinr s. srnd Tunisian telecomunication services are
fairly satisfactorv as coMarei With those in other African countries. In
Tunisia, telecommur.4.xcatic.n_ are under th.e Jurtsdiction of the Ministry of
Post and Telecommunications, whose budget is incorporated into the national
budget.  This Ministry has been able to secure thus far sufficient monetary
appropriations.
2.        Tunisia's current network of open-wire carrier circuits, cables
and radio relay llinike 's adequate. A four-year plan (1969-72) is providing
switching facilities to substantially improve the quality of service, and
95% of the network shfuld be automatic by the end of 1972.  International
calls can be routel 'Jo Abidjan, Djeddah, Cairo, Geneva and Frankfurt over
HF radio links; to Algeria over land cables; to Libya over radio relay links;
and to Italy and France over submarine cables. These facilities provide a
good framework for routing international traffic to and from Tunisia's major
tourism supplier countries. Inadequacies in the local telecommunication
services would be remedied by the extensions to the local exchanges called
for by the project.
B. Descri&tion
3.        The proposed works consist of:
(a) Private branch exchanges (PBX) for all hotels included
in the project, and extension to the local public
exchanges.
(b) Telex equipment for the hotels in categories A and B.
4.        The equipment requirements are estimated as follows:
(a)  For hovels in category A, 10 main telephone lines,
one 300-line telephone switchboard, one telephone set
per rcom, and one telex machine.
(b)  For hotels in category B, 5 main telephone lines,
one 500-line telephone switchboard, one telephone set
per room, and one telex machine.
(c)  For hotels in category C, 2 main telephone lines and
one 100-line telephone switchboard (no telex service).

ANNEX 7
Fage 3
The tax component of these costs is estimated to be TD 0.29 million or
Us$0.60 million, and is included in the local costs.
6.        The cost estimates are based on similar works currently being
carried out in Tunisia. An allowance of 9% in local and foreign costs has
been provided to compensate for possible physical changes. An allowance of
12% has been included for price increases in local expenditure, while an
allowance of only 5% has been provided for price increases in foreign expen-
diture. Because of improved technology and heavy international competition
in the field, the international prices of tolecommunications equipment are
not rising very fast.
D. Execution
7.        The construction of the telecommunication facilities would be
carried out mainly by the contractors under the supervision of the Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications, The Ministry has the necessary planning,
engineering and supervisory capability to control the execution of the project.
E. Procurement
8.        All goods financed by the Bank would be procured through international
competitive bidding.
F. Organization for Operation
9.        The local hotel telecommunication facilities would be managed by
the hotel staff. Contractual arrangements for their training would be made
with the suppliers. The cost of this training is included in the project
cost.

TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF THE TOURISM IFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
ECOMMIC JUSTIF1CATION
1.        The project is a package of infrastructure investments serving
primarily the tourism, industry and covering widely separated geographical
areas. Since the project is part of a larger program of investments, its
economic evaluation has been made in terms of this larger whole.  The Zggs
benefits of these   nestments consist mainly of the additional revenues
earned or "saved'"i by hotel and other facilitiea used by tourists. Invest-
ment costs include not only the capital required to construct the proposed
infrastructure works, but also the costs of expanding other tourist facilities,
the most important being hotel accommodation.  Needed investments in facilities
such as shops and restaurants are also taken into account.
2.        In measuring cost8 and benefits, a distinction is made between
existing hotels or hotel proiects currently being executed and "new hotels 
"New hotels1' are defined to be those hotels that are expected to open betw'een
1975 and 15981, and all the costs and benefits associated with them are included
in the economic evaluation of the investments. "Existing hotels" are defined
to be those hotels that already exist in the six zones, as well as hotels that
will open before the end of 197h. The decision to treat hotels to be opened
before 1974 as "existing hotels" has been based on the knowledge that this
accommodation is now under construction and on the assumption that if hotels
are to open before 1974, the decision to invest in them has already been taken.
3.        The net benefits of the program of investments envisaged would be
the additional revenues generated or "saved' as a result of increased tourism
in the siX zones less the costs of operating the facilities and services to
be provided. Although properly chargeable to the program of investments,
revenues and costs associated with international air travel and other segments
of the travel industry have not been taken into account, since the benefits
would mostly accrue to foreign airlines and travel agents. The costs and
benefits of the planned facilities and the basic assumptions underlying the
estimates are more fully discussed below.
Revenue and Cost Calculations and AsuRmptions
4.        The investment envisaged may be broadly classified into three groups:
(i)  investment in infrastructure, in "new" hotel accommo-
dation and other facilities that will provide the
basis for future growth of tourism;
1/ X"Saved" means revenues of existing hotels which in the absence of the
project might be lost through lower occupancies (c.f. para. 11).



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(ii) investment in infrastruct;ure that will eliminate
current backlogs and benefit "existing hotels"; and
(iii) investment in infrastructure that will benefit the
local population.
Since the effects of these investments are differently calculated, they are
discussed separately below:
Revenues to Hotels and Other Tourist Facilities
(a)  New Hotels
5.        Investment in the proposed project would serve all the'hew hotels"
that are projected to open in the six zones between 1975 and 1981. The gross
benefits of this part of the program, which includes investaent in infra-
structure and hotel accommodation, consists mainly of the additional tourism
revenues earned by the'hew hotels"and other related facilities.
6.        In 1970, average daily expenditures of foreign visitors were
estimated to be US$17, broken down as follows:
US$       Percentage (%)
Room and Main Meals                                  9.73           57.3
Entertainment and Ertra Food and Beverages           2.07           12.2

7.        Due to the large proportion of group tourism in Tunisia, about 70%
of the average daily expenditure of US$17 is spent within the premises of
the hotel and 30% outside, on gifts, food, entertainment, etc. The absolute
amounts, however, vary from hotel to hotel, depending on the type and category
of hotel. Thus the average daily expenditures of visitors in a luxury class
hotel is almost twice that of visitors staying in holiday villages (Table 1).
8.        Forecasts of the additional revenues    Tunisia can expect to receive,
assume that the average daily expenditures of foreign visitors and their compo-
sition will remain the same. They also take into account the pattern of hotel
development likely to emerge in the future and allow for a two year "running-
in" period for hotels before reaching full operation. In addition, no
distinction has been made between revenues from foreign tourists and those
from domestic visitors, since the domestic component of additional traffic in
the six zones is considered to be negligible. Table I in para. 22, summarizes
the additional revenues from tourism growth in the six zones attributable to
the investment in new hotels, infrastructure, and other related facilities.

9.        All revenues and costs are in 1971 prices, including the invest-
ment costs of the infrastructure project.  This approach is an alternative
to inflating all revenues and costs at least until the proposed project is
completed in 197t.
(b) Benefits to Existinsi Rotels
10.       The present standard of sewerage facilities in some of the six
tourism zones is ver7- low. The pollution of the beaches and bathing water
in some of the zones is predicted to reach serious proportions unless the
proposed project is mnipIevent%ed. Recent experience has demonstrated that
the lack of proper facilities and careful physical planning could affect the
growth of tourisnt, not only te the six zones but also to the whole of Tunisia.
11.       The provision of better Infrastructure facilities included in the
program is expected to prevent occupancy of "existing hotels" from declining.
The mission assumed that without the program, average occupancy rates (and
consequently revenues) of hotels in the six zones would decline by at least
five percentage poirts.  The current occupancy rates of hotels are given in
Table 2. An alternative assumption regarding occvpancy rates was made for
3ensitivity testIng (c.f. para. 25). The revenues saved are given in Table
I, para. 22. It was assumed that the effects of the project on occupancy
rates and revenues of hotels outside the zones would be negligible. The
projections of revenues to "existing hotels" was made on the same basis and
assumptions used in calculating the revenues for "new hotels" discussed in
the preceding paragraphs.
(c) Iocal Population
12.       The expansion of infrastructure facilities in the six zones will
improve the standard of services currently available to some of the local
population in the six zones, especially with respect to the provision of
sewerage facilities. Roads to be provided will also serve the tourism needs
of the urban population in Tunis, since residents of the city would have
improved access to the beaches and facilities to be provided in Tunis Nord,
Tmnis Sud and Hammamet.  However, since this impact is difficult to quantify
and only a small proportion of the population is involved, benefits accruing
to the local residents have not been taken into account in the economic
evaluation, and to that extent the economic return is understated.
Operating Costs
13.       Net benefits of the program of investments have been calculated by
subtracting from gross revenues the economic costs of providing the goods
and services demanded by visitors. Since the program of investments is
defined to include both superstructure and infrastructure, operating costs
of infrastructure could either be separately estimated or derived from



ANNEX
Page . t
financial accounts of the superstructure facilities. To avoid double-
counting, operating costs taken into consideration include only those of
hotels, shops, etc. These costs already include payments which broadly
cover the approximate costs of operating some of the infrastructure
facilities to be provided../
14.       Since 70% of the expenditures of foreign visitors to Tunisia is
made within hotel premises, a wide variety of hotels in the six tourism
zones were analysed in great detail. On the basis of the information
obtained from their accounts, three financial models were built as being
representative of operations of all existing and future hotels in the six
tourism zones (Table 3). The revenues of these hotels are consistent with
the expenditure figures discussed earlier, while the operating costs reflect 2/
average past performance of existing hotels. Generally, gross operating costs-
as a percentage of gross revenues varies between 57% and 87%, depending on the
type of hotel and the occupancy rate it is likely to enjoy, assuming the
minimum level of occupancy would be 15%. The net revenues (i.e. gross revenues
minus operating costs) accruing to existing and future hotels have been projected
on the basis of these financial models and are summarized in Table 4.
15.       With regard to tourist expenditures made outside the hotel, little
is known about operating costs of the enterprises producing the many goods
and services demanded by foreign visitors.  The scarce data available, both
in Tunisia and elsewhere, suggest that operating profit as a percentage of
revenues varies enormously. In the case of Tunisia it is the Appraisal
Mission's judgement, based on a number of interviews, that the assumption
that average gross operating costs as a percentage of revenues would amount
to 60% is not unreasonable and net benefits of expenditures made outside the
hotel were projected on this assumption (Table 4). An alternative assumption
of higher gross operating costs Was made in the sensitivity testing (c.f.
para. 25).
Investment Costs
(a) Hotel Investments
16.       Projections of hotel investment costs were based on the targets
adopted as regards the amount, timing, type and location of hotel beds and on
the cost experience of building similar facilities in each of the six zones.
1/ While this approach is justified in the case of water supply, telecommuni-
cations and electricity, it would not hold true with respect to operating costs
of sewerage services and the maintenance costs of roads. Accordingly, the
evaluation included about US$750,000 a year to cover these costs.
v/ Operating Costs, excluding taxes, depreciation, interest and dividends.



ANNEX 8
Page 5
Generally, hotels in Tunisia have been imaginatively built with construction
costs averaging lower (except perhaps in the case of deluxe accommodation)
than in most of the other Mediterranean destinations.  The average invest-
ment costs per bed, (which include the cost of construction, equipment and
land, but are net of taxes) are given below:
Cost per Bed
Type of Accommodation              in US$ Equivalent
Deluxe                               10,350
First Class                            7,245
Tourist Class                         4,14o
Holiday Village                        4,140
Youth Hostel                           2,070
17.       The above average costs were used in projecting the expected annual
inmestments in hotels to be opened between 1975 and 1981 and are summarized
in Table 5. Investment in existing hotels and costs of hotel projects
currently being executed have been excluded from the economic evaluation.
(b) Infrastructure Investments
18.       Based on the projections of visitor traffic and hotel development
likely to take place in each zone, a careful assessment was made of the
minimum infrastructure required.  The facilities needed have been designed
on the basis of t'least-cost solutions" and form a part of the proposed infra-
structure project. There are certain investments, however, that have a direct
bearing on the growth of tourism in the six zones but are not included in
the proposed investment package. These investments are:
(i) Airports. There are currently three airports in Tunisia
catering to international visitor traffic (Annex 3).
With the exception of the airport at Tunis, the other
two have sufficient capacity to meet increased demand at
least until 1981. It is estimated, however, that Tunis
airport will require expansion to meet traffic increases
after 1976. The costs of expansion are estimated to be
US$15 million. However, since the airport is projected
to be financially self-supporting, the investment costs
of expanding the terminal building have not been taken
into account in the economic evaluation.
(ii) Water-Supply. The water supply component of the proposed
project will serve demand at least until 1981, except for
the system to be built in Djerba-Zarsis which is forecast
to meet water supply requirements only until 1978. Since
known sources of water supply will have been exhausted by
then, the economic analysis includes the investment costs
of a desalination plant (estimated at D 1.8 million) to
meet the increase in demand after 1978.



ANNEX 8
Page 6
(iii)  Hinor Infrastructures.' The minor infrastructure
items included in the proposed project will only
meet the requirements of existing hotels and hotels
built before 1976. Similar investments will be
needed for hotels built after that year. Although
not included in the proposed project, the cost of
these investments has been taken into account in the
economic evaluiation (Table 5).
(c) Other Investment Costs
19.       While the major investment will be in infrastructure and hotels,
there are other facilities catering to foreign visitors which may require
expansion. Same of the facilities now existing such as shops, restaurants,
taxi services, etc. could cater to increased traffic without expansion,
while others may require only marginal investments. However, it is dif-
ficult to estimate how much of this investment could be charged to tourism,
since these facilities wouldalso cater to the local population. An arbitrary
amount of US$12 million has been included in the analysis to cover these costs.
2o.       The proposed investment program also envisages the expansion of the
hotel school system. While this investment is a necessary and legitimate
expense, these costs, which are likely to be small, are not charged to the
program,on the assumption that the economic benefits of education fully justify
the investment in the schools.
21.       Since the zones are located near established semi-urban centers, the
housing for the additional workers is likely to be found in these centers.
Hence, the additional investments required are likely to be small and have been
excluded from the economic evaluation.
Summary of Revenues and Costs
22.       The Tables below summarize the operating costs and revenues of the
total program. Table 5 presents the investment costs of the program, by major
source of revenue and by zone. With regard to investment costs, it will
be noted that the proposed project would form the basis for the construction
of 43,000 additional beds by 1981, assuming an average investment of US$5,000
per bed. Thus, every dollar spent in infrastructure by the public sector should
generate four times that amount in hotel construction.

23.       The facilities to be provided have varying economic lives, but as
a whole it is estimated that the investments would have an economic life of 25
years. The need to make provisions for some replacement expenditures during
the period is considered to be offset by the life of the main assets beyond
25 years.
Rates of Return
24.       Based on the above estimates of revenues and costs, the internal
economic return on the total program of investments is 16.3%. To allow for
uncertainty and to test the sensitivity of the rate of return to a change in
the value of some of the variables, various rates of return were calculated
by modifying some of the key assumptions made in the economic analysis.
Results of this testing are shown in the following Table:
Resulting Rates of Return
(i) Rate of hotel expansion is 10%
less than forecast:                                   15.8
(ii) Investment in "other" facilities
50% higher than assumed:                              15.5
(iii) Tourist expenditures outside hotels
excluded:                                             11.6
(iv) Gross operating profits decrease
by 10%:                                               14.3
(v) Gross operating profits increase
by 10%:                                               18.0
(vi)  Investment costs increase by 10%:                       14.5
(vii) Expected decrease in occupancy rates
of existing hotels is 2 percentage
points instead of 5 percentage points:                14.3
(viii) Economic value of labor 25% lower than
current market wage rates:                            16.9
(ix)  Exchange rate:  US$1.0 - D 0.555                        20.7
25.       8ome of the above assumptions over-lap to some extent, and not all
of the variables are independent. Nevertheless, it is clear that the rate of
return is more sensitive to changes in some of the assumptions made, especially
with respect to a change in the foreign exchange rate. However, even on the
least favorable combination of assumptions (i.e. investment costs go up by 10%
and gross operating profits of the facilities fall by 10%), the rate of return
does not fall below 12.8%.



ANNEX 8
Page 9
26.       Separate rates of return were also calculated for each of the
tourism zones. As the Table below indicates, the rates of return vary,
with the highest on investments in Hammamet and lowest on investments in
Tunis Sud.
Rates of Return
Tourism Zone
Tunis Nord                                 12.4
Tunis Sud                                  10.9
Hammamet                                   19.4
Sousse                                     17.4
Djerba                                     17.6
Zarzis                                     15.0
27.       The reason for different rates of return between zones is mainly
threefold:
(a) the particular hotel category mix in each zone;
(b) marked divergencies in the degree of seasonality
and in occupancy rates; and
(c) important differences in the extent of the infra-
structure backlog.
28.       It should be noted that investments in one zone benefit not only
the development of tourism there, but the growth of tourism in other zones
as well. Accordingly, the somewhat arbitrary distribution of costs and
benefits between zones artificially accentuatea the differences in zonal
rates of return.
29.       Furthermore, although the project areas are geographically separated,
there is a close inter-dependence between them. The failure to provide basic
infrastructure facilities in one zone,such as sewerage,could adversely affect
the development of tourism in other zones. In addition, air charter companies
operate on the principle of "differential pricing" of tour packages, so that
by tapping various segments of the market, they would be in a position to
maximize the occupancy loads of their aircraft. For example, the existence
of very low-priced accommodation facilities in Tunis Sud enables European tour
operators to offer inexpensive vacations there, which complements higher cost
packages sold in other zones.



ANNEX 8
Page 10
Balance of Pa-yments and nM9mpljnent Effects
30.       Tunisia has experienced sizable deficits in the current account
of its balance of payments in recent years. Between 1965 and 1970, such
deficits averaged US$120 million a year or about 11 percent of GNP.  Imports
of capital and intermediate goods continue to rise under the impetus of
higher investment and increased industrial demand. Since the trade deficit
is not likely to decline, the growth of foreign exchange earnings from tour-
ism is vital to the development of Tunisia's economy.
31.       The facilities planned for the six tourism zones will be serving
foreign visitors, almost exclusively. The additional gross foreign exchange
revenues attributable to the envisaged program of infrastructure and super-
structure investments is estimated to be US$125 million by 1984, when facili-
ties have become fully operational. Since most goods demanded are locally
produced, the foreign exchange costs of servicing visitors is estimated to
be small, only about 15% of gross revenues.
32.       In order to calculate the net foreign exchange earnings generated
by the proposed program of investments, it was assumed that 57% of the
infrastructural works would be financed with Bank and German funds, and 30%
of the capital required for the expansion of hotel facilities would come from
abroad, compared to the estimated foreign investment in existing hotels of
only 10%. On this basis, it is estimated that nt foreign exchange earnings
due to the proposed program would amount to US$97 million in 1984. In other
words, the foreign exchange costs would amount to about 23% of total gross
revenues of US$125 million in that year.
33.       Although statistical evidence is insufficient, rough estimates
indicate that total employment in Tunisia has risen little over the last three
years, and the percentage of male unemployment has remained high (at 15 to 20%
of the labor force). The proposed program is important in this context. When
in full operation, it is estimated that the program of investments will provide
12,500 additional hotel jobs, one half of which will be for unskilled personnel.
In 1971 employment within the hotel industry for the whole of Tunisia stood
at 13,000. The additional employment created understates the full employment
effects of the project, since hotels represent only a part of the tourist
sector and since in addition to direct employment the program will indirectly
generate employment in other sectors. Furthermore, with the exception of
Tunis North and iouth, which account for only 15% of the investments, the
project is concentrated in semi-urban or rural areas where, according to the
1966 census, unemployment and underemployment rates were very high.
