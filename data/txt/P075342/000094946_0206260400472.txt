A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in reducing poverty and supporting inclusive patterns
of growtth and dev elopment. The name of the project, "Community Empowerment and Local Governance"
is based on the principle that projects will be produced by communities for community activities. Through
the strengthening of, and support for local development councils and groups, the CEP will:
(i)  build and reconstruct their basic economic infrastructure (such as farm-to-market roads, small
bridges, irrigation and drainage systems, clean water, and others, as determined by the
community, itself);
(ii)  support productive local economic activities and social infrastructure activities;
(iii) pilot a number of carefully designed mechanisms for providing assistance to disadvantaged
groups (widows, orphans, people with disabilities, etc.) at the community level;
(iv) provide assistance for the development of district level capacities, specifically in planning
development activities;
(v)  support cultural heritage and social reconciliation; and
(vi) support the development of grassroots media and local communications, particularly community
radio, through provision of training and equipment.
The grant is the third grant for CEP and will focus specifically on training, capacity building, and enabling
the consultant team to continue to ensure sustainability of project investments in the longer term.

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number:    Date of latest CAS discussion:
As yet, no CAS has been prepared for East Timor, but a Transitional Support Strategy was prepared on
November 28, 2000 (IDA/R2000-193), the objectives of which are supported by CEP. The
recommendations given in Section III on "Community Empowerment," from the Governance Background
Paper - one of five reports developed by the World Bank-led Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) to East
Timor from October to November, 1999 - formed the basis of the project design for CEP I.
East Timor was occupied by Indonesia in 1975 and formally annexed in 1976. In August 1999, the
population voted in a popular consultation to reject autonomy within the Indonesian state in favor of
independence. The announcement of the results of the consultation was followed by a campaign of
orchestrated violence which displaced over half the population of 800,000 people and destroyed
approximately 80% of social infastructure.
The United Nations established a Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to prepare the
transition to independence by Security Council Resolution 1272 (S/RES/1272) on October 25, 1999.
UNTAET transferred power to an independent East Timorese government on 20 May, 2002. As the
transitional authority, most reconstruction and development projects name UNTAET as the legal
counterpart. It has a mandate to oversee the country's reconstruction, develop Timorese administrative and
technical capacities, and implement a strategy to hand over functions to an East Timorese administration.
In July 2000 the process of "Timorization" of the transitional governing structure began with the formation
of the East Timor Transitional Administration (ETTA) and the appointrnent of five Timorese Cabinet
Ministers. Since then, an election was held on 30 August, 2001, which saw the formation of the second
transitional cabinet with the establishment of a Council of Ministers led by a Chief Minister, the East
Timor Public Administration (ETPA), and a Constituent Assembly of 88 members with a mandate to write
the country's constitution.
In September 1999 the World Bank hosted a meeting of donors on East Timor during the World
Bank/Interational Monetary Fund annual meetings. This was followed by a Joint Assessment Mission
(JAM) in East Timor in October 1999, co-led by the World Bank, UNTAET and Timorese leadership, and
with representation from major donors and UN agencies . The mission estimated three-year costs of basic
reconstruction, which were presented to a donors' meeting in Tokyo on December 17, 1999.
The IDA's (Intemational Development Association) Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) of November
2000 has four objectives: two that identify the activities for IDA support, and three that identify the way
that IDA works in East Timor. CEP Im is designed to take account of all of these objectives:
-3 -



(i) In: tihe short-tert, focus on tihe basics: The first objective of the TSS is supported by the
provision of sub-grants to communities for infrastructure investment projects in villages, credits
for income-generating, and social welfare activities. CEP III further provides sub-grants to
residents of Dili, previously excluded from the project. This is particularly important in order to
create a buffer to the economic dowvn turn expected following the United Nations departure in
May 2002.
(ii) As transition approaches, help preparefor independence: The development of local level
capacity to plan and implement development projects prepares the country for the transition to a
governance structure in which there will be very limited numbers of civil servants below district
level. Village and sub-district development councils will present an option that the new
post-independence government can review. A heavy emphasis in CEP is on capacity building,
both through forrnal training and hands-on experience, to large numbers of people - in the project
team, private sector and communities. Experience and training given in financial management,
technical skills, languages, and management skills will help build the country's human resources.
(iii) Build local ownership of the development process: CEP is the first of the TFET (Trust Fund for
East Timor) funded projects to be fully under Timorese management and leadership. The active
participation of Timorese leadership in the project design has continued, and the management
team has increased the ownership of the project by the Timorese. CEP goes further by building
ownership of the development process from the village level up. A major challenge is presented by
over twenty five years of dependency on government hand-outs under Indonesian rule. Principles
such as accountability, transparency, and inclusion are new to rmost communities and will take
time to develop.
(iv) Foster strong aid coordination: Coordination with other development projects is a critical aspect
of CEP, especially as technical expertise is limited. Technical experience is often found in sectoral
projects such as water supply and sanitation and, therefore, cooperation between projects and
sectors is essential to promote sustainable development. By its nature CEP can be instrumental in
fostering aid coordination. Councils should make decisions based on full information of different
options available. CEP III covers consultant and associated costs to ensure the effective
implementation of community sub-grants and the strengthening of village development councils,
particularly in areas of good governance, including empowerment, accountability, transparency,
inclusion and sustainability.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Poverty Reduction. The key issue for all work in East Timor is poverty reduction. Overall, 55.5% of East
Timor's population was classified as poor in 1999, implying that some 500,000 people lived in poverty.
The impact of the destruction and violence after the August 30, 1999 referendum on incomes and poverty
has yet to be systematically quantified. New data for this purpose, and to inform the poverty reduction
strategy, is being collected. The Government is currently preparing a National Development Plan for the
next five years in which poverty reduction will be a key element. A current concern is the anticipated
negative economic impact as a result of UNTAETs departure following independence. The impact will be
particularly felt around Dili, where the majority of international staff are based.
Local Governance. The Indonesian administrative system was top-down and highly centralized. As a
result, political accountabilities were mostly upwards. The government extended to the village level, with a
-4-



system of government-paid village admninistrators who had greater loyalty to higher levels of government
than the people they served. Independent East Timor will be unable to sustain the same number of civil
servants and future government administration is unlikely to go further than the district level. The numbers
and roles of civil servants at local level still need to be clarified, as will local structures outside government
and how they relate to government.
Vdilage Development The majority of East Timorese live in remote communities with litile or no access to
basic services. Providing access to services will be a major challenge for the independent government, but
will also need to be an essential element of the government's development plan. Experience has shown that
villagers are willing and able to take responsibility for their own development when provided with resources
to do so, although they still need access to technical services from government sector agencies.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project addresses all of the sector issues identified in the previous section.
Poverty Reduction. Decision-maidng processes in place in CEP have been found to be effective in ensuring
that the sub-grants to communities reach the poorest communities, although not necessarily the poorest
people in communities. In the previous grants rural areas were prioritized as an effective poverty reduction
strategy. However, the proposea TFET Grant will add a community sub-grant component for Dili
sub-districts in order to help mitigate against the economic impact of UNTAET's departure.
Local Governance. CEP Im will specifically strengthen the capacity of local councils and support activities
to improve understanding of accountability and transparency at the village level. During the
implementation period it is hoped that the CEP will act as a catalyst to encourage debate and discussion
regarding future local governance structures and necessary regulatory frameworks.
Village Development Extension of the contracts of the consultant teams will allow for improved support
during implementation of sub-grants provided in CEP II. Careful monitoring of the results and impacts,
supported by CEP HI, will feed 'into discussion of options for financing village development in the future.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
*   UNTAET Regulation 2000/13 will be rewritten to reflect ongoing discussions on local institutions and
good govemance.
*   The project will promote gender equality and women's empowerment according to international
-6 -



conventions adopted in East Timor, the policies of UNTAET (ETPA), and the Office of the Advisor
for the Promotion of Equality. It will do this through the equal participation of women on councils,
additional capacity building for women council members, and an integrated approach to gender in all
components
*   By empowering communities to plan and implement development activities. CEP will reduce the impact
of the much reduced civil service.
*   Discussions in component C will assist in policy and regulatory improvements such as the drafting of a
regulatory framework to establish the CRC as a legal entity.
*   Consultant salaries will be rationalized to reduce differentials with civil service salary structures.
3. Beneflts and target population:
The main benefits of CEP will be the empowerment of communities to plan and implement development
activities, and an increased understanding of accountability and good governance. Cultural heritage and
local media activities will help to increase social capital and social reconciliation, and to provide a voice to
the communities.
The current TFET Grant will support the implementation of the community sub-grants included in CEP II.
Physical benefits from the sub-grant activities include:
*   Social infrastructure such as water supply, roads, and irrigation systems.
*   Economic activities such as agriculture production, handicrafts, etc.
*   Social welfare activities such as orphanages, school feeding programs, housing for widows.
Target populations include council members and almost the entire population of East Timor. Community
radio is a particularly important resource for poor communities, particularly when illiteracy is high as is the
case in East Timor. Grassroots radio stations will be the vehicle for communities to share and discuss their
social concerns in a language they understand, get an alternative source of information and entertainment,
and explore and foster debate on issues that affect their lives. Community radio is non-profit, low-cost,
easy to operate, reaches members of the community in their own languages and, as a local, grass-roots
media, it maximizes the potential for development to be drawn from sharing information, knowledge and
skills within the community. Community radio informs, educates and entertains; it also empowers the
community by giving a strong public voice to the voiceless, which encourages greater accountability in
public affairs.
Earmarked sub-grants for Dili will also assist the population in overcoming the expected negative economic
impact caused by the departure of international staff following independence.
A secondary target population will be the project staff themselves who will receive training and capacity
building through the project. It is anticipated that some of the team may be absorbed into the civil service
in the future, while others will join the private sector or NGOs (Non-government Organization) - well
trained staff will help to build the capacity of all three sectors in the long run.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Overall coordination is with the Department of Internal Administration in the East Timorese Public
Administration (ETPA), with direct responsibility for implementation through the Project Management
Unit (PMU). The Director of the PMU reports directly to the Minister for Intemal Administration. A
governing board of the National Cultural Heritage Trust has been formed which oversees the Culture
Center (Uma Fukun Timor), and the culture activities under CEP. The manager of the Commnunity Radio
Center reports directly to the Project Director and oversees the community radio activities under CEP. The
community radio stations will be managed and operated by the communities through district-level
community boards or councils called Kliburs and the station management team.
Component A: The recent change in emphasis of Component A to one of strengthening councils,
supported by CEP m, necessitates a change in the structure of the team. Also, now that facilities are
available outside Dili, it would be more efficient to move from the current Dili-focused management
structure to one that is decentralized to region and district level. In the new structure technical,
communications, and training tearns providing support services to councils and community groups will be
established under regional and district coordinators. The changes were put in place during the first half oif
2002.
Component B: A Culture Board was formed in CEP I and has artists, performers, and representatives of
the church, women's organizations, and other relevant groups in it. The Culture Board appointed a
management team in April 2001. The management team reports to the Culture Board on all their activities
including those funded by sources outside of CEP, and administratively regarding the CEP-funded
activities to the Project Director.
Component C: The manager of the Community Radio Center manages all aspects of the component and
reports to the Project Director. The community radio stations will be managed by district-level community
boards or councils called Kliburs and the stations management team. Kliburs are small representative local
structures, elected by their respective community, tasked with developing proposals to establish community
radio in their district (and later managing it if established) and deciding on proposals for Component B's
small sub-grants program.
Component D: As the project evolves and components B and C become more autonomous, and with the
regional and district teams of Component A, the role of the Dili-based PMU will change. The PMU will
maintain administrative and monitoring oversight over all components, and will be comprised of the Project
Director, with small teams responsible for Finance, Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation, and
Reporting.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Community Sub-Grants Component: The altemative considered was to keep a reduced team focusing on
delivery of the CEP II sub-grants without additional capacity building activities to strengthen local
governance. The decision to focus on capacity building of the councils was made given the strong
commitment from government to retain some sort of local council in the future, and also strong demand
from-the communities and councils, as reflected at a large workshop held in September.
With the change in focus, and also the improved conditions in the country with regard to infrastructure and
communications, the option to decentralize the team was made. The new structure will (i) give regional and
- 8 -



district teams more autonomy to adapt procedures and inputs to local conditions; (ii) provide field staff
with better and closer support (e.g. for motorbike maintenance, administration, etc.) and (iii) make a more
varied range of skills available to councils and conmnunities by pooling resources at district and regional
levels.
Dili was not initially included in the project as there was significant investment already in Dili and focusing
on rural areas was a better strategy for poverty reduction. However, with large numbers of intemational
staff about to leave Dili, a decision was made to include it iri order to help mitigate against the negative
economic impact of their departure. Provision of credit facilities to residents of Dili through sub-grants
was considered, but rejected as facilities for credit in Dili District will be available through ADB's
micro-finance bank and other NGO micro-credit facilities.
Cultural Heritage Component: An option was to add funding to the small sub-grants component and for
other cultural activities, or to continue to support the management team for a longer duration. The
management team has already started to leverage resources from other sources to fund different activities,
exhibitions, etc. However, until they have proper offices and a functioning culture center they are unlikely
to sustain funding to cover their recurrent costs. Therefore, it was decided to cover their costs from CEP
III for the maximum time to allow them to explore options for future funding. Funding for cultural
activities is provided by, amongst others, the Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese governments.
Community Radio Component: An option to provide the national radio station with extra capacity to
broadcast to districts was considered, but was rejected in favor of supporting community radios which
would have the capacity to broadcast in the local vemacular and, with better understanding of local issues,
would better serve local communities. Supporting independent community radio stations will have the
added advantage of maintaining the independence of the media, as stations would be owned and managed
by the communities. Providing additional capacity to broadcast nationally was also rejected because the
Govermment of Portugal has already pledged major support to the development of national radio and
television in East Timor.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,
ongoing and planned).
Given the cross-cutting nature of the Community Empowerment Project, all projects irnplemented at the
community level relate to it. One of the principles of CEP is open choice, and there is only a short negative
list of activities that cannot be funded using sub-district grants, including illegal, dangerous, or harmful
activities, and the funding of government or religious buildings and staff salaries. This means that
communities have an open choice on proposals they submit, and councils on decisions they make on the use
of allocated funds. In some cases this may lead to competition between, for exarnple, CEP and sectoral
projects. Competition can be healthy and gives the communities the chance to judge different approaches
and decide for themselves the one they prefer. The concept that commnunities have the right to choose is a
key element of the empowerment principles of CEP. However, from the beginning, the design of CEP has
included features that encourage communities to use their money effectively and efficiently. For example:
*   Project rules: One of the project rules states that health and education facilities can only be funded if
the communities have received a commitment from the relevant authorities that staff and resources will
be provided in the future. Communities must therefore coordinate with the authorities first and present
their case - it may be that another project already has plans to build the facility they were proposing
and therefore they can use the funds to address a different need. Project rules also state that there must
be repayment to the councils of money used for economic or income-generating activities, thus, a
requirement for market rates of interest, lending to previously existing groups only, and a maximum
-9-



repayment period of eighteen months, ensures that CEP does not compete unfairly with micro-credit
projects run by NGOs or with Asian Development Bank's (ADB) micro-finance project.
*   Competition: Councils receive far more proposals than they can fund. There is therefore a need to look
at altemative sources of funding to lessen the number of proposals competing for village development
grants. However, this depends on councils having access to information on other development
activities.
* Verification: All proposals are verified for technical, economic, and environmental feasibility before
they are submitted to the councils together with a report from the verification team.
*   Selection criteria: Sub-district councils must decide on selection criteria to evaluate and prioritize
proposals for funding. The criteria is not dictated by the project, but typically includes "benefits the
poorest", and "amount of contribution from the community" etc.
Other projects are limited in resources they provide and it is hoped that, by cooperating, CEP can extend its
capacity to achieve its objectives e.g. by working with the water supply sector. However, CEP does not
have specific sectoral skills and the provision of adequate technical assistance is a major challenge. The
project team will explore all the opportunities for cooperating across projects to maximize the development
effectiveness of the combined funding.
One of the findings of the Joint Donor Supervision report was that there was insufficient coordination
between projects at district level, and insufficient inforrnation disseminated to communities below district
level. Communities have little information on different projects and where they can best get support. The
councils need information on all of relevant projects in order to make the best decisions regarding the use
of allocated grants. Councils are also a source of bottom-up informnation regarding communities' priorities.
This information can play a critical role in helping other projects become demand-, rather than supply-
driven. The role of councils and CEP staff in coordinating village level development initiatives and
maximizing the use of skills and resources has yet to be fully realized.

3. Lessons learned and reflected In the project design:
Several lessons have been learned during implementation of the Community Empowermenit and Local
Governance Project, justifying the need for design changes of additional components during this phase of
CEP:
*   Role and Capacity of Councils: The role of councils is unclear to communities as well to council
members themselves. Capacity of councils, especially women members, to be effective in
decision-making meetings is weak. To address this, more emphasis will be placed on capacity building
for council members and for increasing understanding of councils' roles within communities. A special
program of capacity building for women council members has been proposed and sev'eral other donor
agencies and local women's organizations are keen to assist.
*   Accountability and Transparency: One of the key challenges so far in CEP has been to develop an
understanding of accountability within conmmunities. Communities should be able to hold elected
representatives, or those acting on their behalf, accountable, however, this can only happen if they
have: i) full access to information on decisions and use of funds, ii) a choice of channels for making
- 13 -



complaints, and iii) a complaints investigation and resolution process. CEP III will focus on
developing each of these.
*   Improved Access to Technical Services: The lack of technical assistance within the country proved. to
be a major constraint in earlier stages of CEP. In the next cycle of sub-grants there will be a much
greater emphasis on coordinating with technical departments, NGOs, and other projects, in order to
make effective use of limited technical skills in the country.
* Donor Coordination and Sectoral Approach: Although different projects have their own objectives
and sometimes different policies are justified, there is a need to bring project policies and practices
more in line through better project coordination. Donor coordination on community development is
needed to ensure that communities and decision-making bodies are provided with information,
processes, and procedures that give them the capacity to be more involved in development planning and
implementation. Through the establishment of the Community Development Working Group (CDWG)
donors, government and national and international NGOs have a forum to better coordinate activities;
and share experiences.
4. Indications of borrower cornmitment and ownership:
CEP was the first donor-financed project for the new administration initiated on formal written request by
UNTAET. Stakeholder support for the project concept has been very high. Project preparation and
implementation has continued a consultative process that includes local NGOs, the Church, UNTAET, and
Timorese leadership. East Timorese support for the project remains high, both at the political leadership
level and amongst villagers. The current TFET Grant was requested by Timorese leaders at the Oslo
meeting of the TFET donors.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The value added of IDA support has been high. First, the Bank has worldwide expertise in implementing
community-driven investment funds. In Asia alone, the Bank has experience with lending projects that
strengthen local governance and support village development - including in post-conflict areas - in four
countries. Exchanges between the teams in the different countries will provide excellent
transfers-of-experience opportunities. Second, the role of the Bank in the management of the TFET funds,
places it in a unique position to work not only with different sectors of government but also with other
donors in the community development sector as lessons are leamed and transformed into a more sustainable
approach to local govenmment in the future. A recent review of community development, coordinated by
the Bank, involved 25 people, of whom 80% were Timorese, from government, donor agencies,
intemational and national NGOs and civil society.

1. Economic (see Annex 4):

* Other (specify)
Revolving Funds. The situation in East Timor is still far from being a market economy; there are few
sources of credit for rural communities or small businesses outside of the TFET-funded Small Enterprises
Project (SEP), CEP and some small scale NGO microcredit providers. A $4 million ADB-managed
microfinance project is just starting to be implemented however, the project will initially only cover a few,
- 14 -



major towns. Following a study in June 2001, the interest rate for the CEP loans was increased to 1.5% per
annum. The change was made in order not to crowd out smaller providers who are offering higher interest
rates. However, in CEP III only those sub-district financial management units that can prove they have
managed funds well, have good repayment rates, and have either an exit strategy or a plan for ensuring
sustainability, will be able to add additional resources to their current revolving funds. Furthermore, Dili
sub-districts will not have access to credit through the sub grant as credit facilities will be available to Dili
residents through other sources.
Cost/Benefit of Infrastructure. In November 2001, a cost benefit study of the infrastructure built in CEP
was carried out. The main findings of the study were as follows:
Summary results of the cost/benefit study
_         Water Project              Road Project
Average NPV                    $3,338                     $2,997
Average IRR                    20%                        26%
Average No. Beneficiaries            502                        1206
Average Cost Of Project             $7,925                     $6,883
Impacts of Wage Policy. There is still discussion over the impact of different wage policies in community
development projects. While most donors are now requiring that unskilled labor be a community
contribution, communities continue to request payment. In CEP, there have been examples of communities
agreeing to contribute labor during proposal preparation and selection, and then refusing to work for free
during implementation. On the other hand, there have been examples of significant labor contributions to
projects, and also examples where although there is no labor contribution in the CEP Grant-funded activity,
once the Grant was finished the communities have continued to expand the work initiated using their own
contributed labor. Despite the difficulties involved, CEP will continue to leave the payment of wages up to
communities, and attempt to reinforce the contribution element through the competitive process. Further
study on wage policies of community-based projects is needed.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=USS million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
Fiscal Impact:
Over the next-few months the government will need to decide on sustainable strategies for funding village
development. Early results from CEP indicate that communities have the potential to plan and manage
their own development activities, and that this is an effective way for allocating resources for village
development. Several models for future options have been calculated. Depending on variables such as
salary scales of staff, and sub-grant sizes, the cost of an annual cycle of sub-grants to all sub-districts in
East Timor would be between $1.8 million and $4.9 million. The option exists for some or all of this to be
funded by donors, and the-rest to come from the national budget. More details of the different scenarios
can be found in Annex 4.
3. Technical:
During the first and second cycles, District Technical Facilitators (DTF) provided oversight of the Village
Technical Facilitators who were paid by communities from sub-grants to help with planning and
- 15 -



implementation. The issues that arose were (i) the tendency to divide money equally so that every hamlet
had an activity meant that there were too many small projects for the DTF to adequately supervise (ii) the
capacity of the village technical facilitators was very weak, (iii) the capacity of the DTF was weak, and (iv)
there were no standards for acceptable work. The result was that technical quality during these cycles was
weak.
A series of workshops held in the field at the site of the projects for technical facilitators, the completion of
manuals, and additional training, have been some steps taken to improve technical capacity. A technical
audit will take place before the next cycle commences, and remedial measures made using some of the
funds remaining from this cycle.
In the next cycle, technical staff will be based regionally with mixed skills in the team so that they can
respond more appropriately to community needs. Also they will recruit technical facilitators at sub-district
level to assist them instead of the village facilitators for each project. A much greater emphasis will be
placed on coordinating with. other projects and agencies, including sectoral departrnents, to try and ensure a
better linking of skills with needs at community level.
For the community radio component, intemational trainers were recruited to provide technical and
journalism training to a group of young Timorese at district level, now functioning as district reporters.
Training focused on basic communications, broadcast joumalism, reporting and management skills. For
this next phase, other intemational advisors were recruited to provide project management (i.e, planning
and implementation), capacity building and technical support to the CRC team and future community radio
members. Technicians will also be trained as an integral part of the equipment installation package.
4. Institutional:
Within ETPA there are ongoing discussions on the level of decentralization that will form the basis of the
future govemment. At the moment there is almost no fiscal decentralization and the sectoral allocations of
funds are heavily centralized. Time will be needed for policies and approaches to be discussed and
developed. The existence of elected representative bodies up to sub-district level prepares the way for the
formation of bodies of elected representatives at district level should this be in accordance with future
directions. In the meantime, there is a strong demand for greater coordination with sub-district
development councils at the district level because of the opportunity for them to bring infornation from the
villages up to the district, also as a means of sending information from the district to the councils. Until
decisions on decentralization are made, CEP will support flexible approaches to district coordination with
council members. Building the capacity of the councils and encouraging the development of accountable
and representative institutions at the lower level is one of the main aims of CEP.
4.1 Executing agencies:
The Director of the PMU now reports to the Minister for Internal Admninistration in the East Timorese
Public Administration (ETPA).
4.2 Project management:
The PMU is fully staffed under Timorese management. The team works out of a specially renovated
building and adequate office equipment and transport has been purchased both for them, and for district
offices. The Timorese team have done a remarkable job in the first stage of the project, but are a young
and relatively inexperienced team. The new managers have themselves identified the international
assistance they feel they need and are in the process of recruiting the advisors to help them. A major focus
of CEP Im will be to build the capacity of the Timorese management team through language training,
management training and special skills training for example in the technical field. The main issues facing
- 16 -



the team are firstly, difficulties caused by the conditions, for example the lack of power supply for much of
the day; secondly, several of the senior staff have left either to take up high level civil service positions, or
to return to university to complete interrupted studies.
4.3 Procurement issues:
Procurement will be largely contracting Technical Assistance (TA) companies or organizations, like NGOs,
as well as individuals, to assist with capacity building, particularly around strengthening village
development councils in areas of good govemance and technical skills. Procurement will also entail
contracting groups or individuals to provide training on all aspects of community radio operation and
management. Small equipment will also be purchased and some small works projects will be undertaken for
the rehabilitation of buildings to house the community radio stations. Community contributions and other
sources such as donors or NGOs working in the different districts are also expected to contribute to the
rehabilitation of the structure. Procurement has been an on-going issue throughout the project, and United
Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) has assisted in the procurement of large goods and works
contracts under CEP H. The team has built up some capacity in procurement, and are currently recruiting a
personnel and procurement officer for the administrative team.
4.4 Financial management issues:
With the possible exception of the lack of adequate accounting and financial management procedures at the
sub-district and village council levels, the overall financial management of CEP remains adequate and
acceptable. The Chief Financial Officer CFO) has established a satisfactory accounting system and
provides adequate periodic reports on use of IDA funds. The District Project Accountants (DPAs) have
performed well to ensure that IDA Grant funds reach the intended beneficiaries, that these are recorded at
the sub-istrict level and generally keeping misuse of funds to a minimum. IDA disbursernents have
proceeded reasonably well; final disbursements and adjustments under CEP I are expected to be resolved
soon. Financial statements of CEP I as of December 2000, and for the period January to June 2001 were
audited with no significant problems identified. Future audits will be in line with the Government fiscal
year.
The main emphasis of financial management at CEP-HQ has been on (i) management of TFET Grant funds
from the Special Account to the sub-districts and villages; (ii) preparing timely withdrawal applications to
replenish the Special Account and keep the funds flowing; (iii) maintaining adequate accounting records
and documents on use of TFE T Grant funds for audit verifications and (iv) providing periodic information
required by IDA on flow of funds. Possibly because of heavier workload for these tasks than previously
anticipated, ensuring that simple but adequate accounting and financial management procedures at
sub-district and village levels has remained a secondary concem in the overall financial management of the
CEP projects. CEP HI will pay special attention to this aspect of its financial management systems by
designing more appropriate systems that can be easily understood and implemented at the sub-district and
village levels. A new senior financial team will be recruited with systems design and training written in as
a major components of the tenns of reference
5. Environmental:                 Environmental Category: B (Partial Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
The only community sub-grants to be included in this Project will be for communities in Dili. The same
negative list as in the previous CEP I and II will apply, and the same screening process will be used by
verification teams to confirm that there are no environmental impacts.
Although no community activities are funded by this Grant, the technical staff supervising the
- 17-



implementation of activities already covered in the previous Grant will be paid from CEP III. Continued
efforts to increase awareness of environment and land acquisition issues have been maintained. Also there
will be efforts to link better with the government's new environment department.
5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?
Several features have been included in the project design to ensure that negative environmnental impacts are
mitigated:
* an environmental checklist is included in each proposal package, the list is completed by the village
technical assistant,
* the proposals are verified by a team including appropriate technical skills, the environmental checklist
is verified along with other aspects of the proposal and the technical person has an opportunity to add
comments,
*   District technical facilitators are trained in environmental management skills,
* Technical manuals include chapters on environment, including criteria for flagging projects that may be
harmful to the environment so that these projects can be identified for greater attention from the more
senior engineers on the team.
In the second cycle of CEP 104 wells were dug and some 131 km of pipe for water supply were installed,
mainly from natural upland springs. During this cycle villages have also built 39 bridges and 214 km of
road. Several issues were identified: i) the technical skills, including in environmental management, on the
team were weak - resulting in weak technical quality, especially of roads; ii) checklists had sometimes
failed to help identify potential problems because of the weak skills; and iii) some new roads were built up
to villages in the mountains from which communities had been forced to move under Indonesian times.
Increased training, technical audits, and remedial works were undertaken to address some of these issues.
Links have been built with the new Environment Department within the government, but they are
overloaded, and also have weak skills as yet so the team will not rely on them for much assistance.
Another aspect that may emerge with more works being undertaken in Dili is contact with asbestos.
Asbestos was used in many buildings that were subsequently destroyed in Dili leaving asbestos dust in the
rubble and ruins. Procedures will be developed to deal with this safely, and special training will be given.
5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status of EA:
Date of receipt of final draft:
N/A
5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a) environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment management plan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were used and which groups were consulted?
The community group preparing the proposal will assist in the initial screening using the checklist, together
with the village technical assistant. The District Technical Facilitator will work with the group if further
mitigation works are needed.
5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results of the EMP?
Completed works are inspected by the technical consultants and certificates are issued if the works have
been completed satisfactorily, including the environmental aspects. Every supervision mission looks at
technical quality and environmental aspects of the activities visited.

6. Social:
6.1 Sumrarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
Three social issues may have an affect on the project's outcome: (i) the extent to which democratically
selected councils could come into conflict with traditional leadership and/or the resistance movement
structures, which are still strong; (ii) the extent to which the one-man, one-woman voting requirements
may be reconciled with institutionalized and cultural issues of gender discrimination, present in both the
modem and traditional parts of'Timorese society; and (iii) the extent to which local councils can be
integrated into the formal civil service structures, which until now have only existed at the district level.
An anthropological study commissioned in September 2000 has now been published and has helped inform
the project on relationships between councils, traditional leaders and village chiefs. This will feed into and
inform decisions on the revision;of UNTAET Regulation 2000/13, which established the councils.
The key issue regarding the democratically elected councils is how much these structures will contradict
local organizational patterns which are already present. Traditional authority in many parts of East Timor
eroded under the Indonesian administration. Furthermore, many of today's villages are a product of coerced
settlement and may not hold together following independence. Some administrative boundary adjustments
have already taken place. Because the core groups in this dynamic are kin-based and operate within more
or less homogenous hamlets, the project design recommends that each hamlet receive equal representation
in the village council. Existing village leaders need to be treated with respect during the election process
while encouraged to refrain from intervening. Guarding the integrity of the electoral process is a key role
for the facilitators.
Gender issues are an issue of shared concern for UNTAET and the Timorese leadership, both of which
have gender equity policies. In a context where reconstruction must begin with basic needs, women's lack
of institutional access distorts both poverty efforts and the designs of many large projects, which will
misgauge priorities and targeting unless beneficiaries are directly involved. Adding equal numbers of
women to the representative councils will not solve the gender problem, but not having women on them will
ensure that there is no progress at all. Ensuring this balance is therefore a strict condition conceming the
validity of the village and sub district council elections. After one year, there is less controversy over the
50% rule than was initially anticipated. One of the reasons for this is that everyone selects two people: one
man and one woman, hence women compete against women, and men against men for positions on the
councils. Both Timorese men and Timorese women are comfortable with a situation where women do not
have to compete against men.
Much of the solution for the project's social issues will lie at the level of practical procedures, rather than
theory. The project's staff, especially the facilitators, must be well-trained in participatory techniques so
that community's natural organizations enter into the decision-making process and real needs get expressed.
Experience prior to independence highlights the critical role that the village and sub district facilitators will
play, particularly during the startup periods of the project. Planning methodologies for this project draw on
both field ethnographies and several current studies on social capital and development. N'evertheless, a
learning curve is expected here since the communities' historical experience is anything but one of
self-deternination in development Care must be given in the project's earliest stages that credibility gets
established and a full sense of ownership given to the communities. To ensure effective community
development, TORs and evaluation criteria for the project's technical assistance reflect the need for
top-quality experience in specialized training. The project design, by not linldng planning or disbursements
to integrated timetables, gives participating communities the flexibility to reach decisions when they are
ready.
19 -



Achievement of the project's governance objectives will be through a range of strategies, however, special
emphasis will be given to the promotion of transparency. At the village level, transparency will begin with
the initial election processes which will require minimum times for preparation, public identification of
candidates and posting of results. In all financial transactions two members of the proponent group and the
paymaster of the supervising council will be required to both sign for, and collect, sub-grant fimds. The
financial details of all projects approved will be displayed publicly as will the subsequent receipts and
payments related to that project. All council meetings will encourage observation of non-elected members.
To ensure councils can record and publish meaningful figures, the project will provide basic
bookkeeping-training to all councils and will also provide each with a safe in view of the absence of
banking facilities.
To encourage public scrutiny and reporting of suspected anomalies, at the commencement of the project
facilitators will disseminate a "Bill of Rights"i which will explain the villagers' rights to information and
access to all project details. Limited funds will also be provided to support local NGOs. Their job will be
to scrutinize project operations and outputs and to publicize their observations. Comparable measures will
be used to ensure transparency at the sub-district level.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
This project draws strongly on participatory methodologies. Project principles of empowerment and
inclusiveness underscore the importance of participation by primary beneficiaries. Facilitators are trained
to consult with all members of the community, especially those that normally do not participate. All
community members participate in the election of their representatives on the councils, and it is these
councils that make the decisions. During the planning stage of the first cycle participatory planning
approaches were developed and tested and the facilitators trained in them. A key element of participation is
communications, and the project includes a communications component, linked to the training component,
that focuses on getting information to all sectors of community in order to strengthen their participation,
and the quality of their participation in the community. The component for widows and vulnerable groups
was added to give special opportunities to participate to those groups that normal do not participate in, nor
receive project benefits.
Other project principles such as transparency and accountability rely on individuals taking responsibility
not just for participating, but for monitoring the activities, and holding their representatives accountable to
them. This is an unfamiliar concept to most people and will only develop over time.
All supervision missions undertaken look at the level of participation, the degree of inclusiveness of the
project and the strategies adopted to include people. As yet the level of beneficiary participation in
monitoring and evaluating has been slow, but during CEP m methods will be developed to ensure that this
happens such as procedures for receiving complaints from communities, and participatory assessments.
A series of consultations held with women facilitators were of special relevance to the current design.
During these consultations better methodologies for involving poor women in project activities have been
discussed and have led to (i) improvements in the training modules for facilitators and technical specialists;
and (ii) the development of a separate track to give the necessary flexibility for the widows' work.
The cultural heritage and community radio components also draw strongly on participatory methodologies.
The Kliburs were elected after a series of consultation meetings with the communities in the different
districts, for example. Community radio, to be effective, requires participation of all groups in the
community to ensure ownership, transparency, and local govemance, principles very much in line with the
objectives of the project. Participation in these activities and processes will also result in empowerment and
- 20 -



long-term sustainability.
6.3 Hdw does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
At the macro-level, all key stakeholders were consulted during preparation and supervision of the project,
and most were originally involved in different aspects of the project's design. These include UN agencies,
international and national NGOs, the Church, CNRT's national and regional commands, and the
UNTAET-NC transitional planning council, and now ETPA. The outcome of initial consultations with key
Timorese leaders was the current regulation establishing local governance structures. Project
methodologies call for additional consultations at each administrative level, beginning with the first
overview of the project and continuing on a regular basis throughout implementation. These consultations
are part of the project staff's formal terms-of-reference. Timorese leaders have been consulted throughout
and with the project now under Timorese management, the leadership are providing direct support and
advice to the team - this is especially essential for dealing with sensitive and potentially controversial
issues.
Other stakeholders for this project include most of the donor and NGO community. Consultations have
been held with donors in a broad range of fora. There is strong support for the single-window local
governance framework that this project provides. Developing within-village facilitation skills and a
bottom-up planning processes has been seen as an important pre-condition for many of the subsequent
programs that will be funded by bilateral and NGO agencies.
Several senior Timorese women and the Women's Network REDE (including most of the women's
organizations and NGOs in their membership) have been consulted throughout. They have participated in
activities to strengthen the women council members, and the design of the component for high]y vulnerable
groups. The community radio component has consulted and collaborated with the national broadcaster, the
local joumalists association, and other stakeholders involved in media development in East Timor.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The primary institutional arrangement to ensure the project achieves its social development outcomes is the
establishment of democratically selected village and sub-district councils who will be the main
decision-makers regarding the selection of.activities and allocation of Grant resources.
From the project side, the sub-district facilitators will take the main responsibility for ensuring that the
principles'of empowerment, inclusion, and accountability are understood by the communities and upheld in
the implementation of the project (this is now included in the TOR and also in the performance evaluations
of all project staff). The role of the communications team and the training team is critical and hence the
decision to strengthen them by creating teams down to regional and district level so that local needs and
conditions can be better taken into account. The involvement of Timorese leadership and artists in the
culture board, and the establishment of the community boards to manage the community radio stations are
other institutional arrangements that ensure social development outcomes will be achieved.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
The key performance indicators monitored through regular monthly reporting of the projects will include
information on the councils, participation of women, transparency processes, participation of'widows and
vulnerable groups, cultural events and participation of villages in the documentation of oral histories.
Monitoring by journalists, NGOs, university faculties and other independent groups will be included in the
- 21 -



project, and methods for beneficiary monitoring will be introduced. Workshops to bring together the key
players such as the councils to discuss their experiences and ways forward are planned.
7. Safeguard PoUcies:

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies.
Details of methods introduced to mitigate negative impacts on the environment were given in paragraph
5.2.
The project is designed to ensure that minority ethnic groups will have the opportunity to participate fully.
During the first cycle a team of anthropologists studied three ethnically different areas of Timor to assess
the impact of different project rules on the local communities. The recommendations from their report were
integrated into project manual changes, and were used to assist in preparation of communications methods,
and in the training components that followed. The equal representation from sub-villages, and emphasis
on local consultation and participation are designed to ensure equal opportunities for all groups. Even so,
some groups may be excluded, and the special component for Highly Vulnerable Groups helps to ensure a
second opportunity for those that are normally excluded. A bigger issue will be the reintegration of
individuals or families who have been in refugee camps, or ex-combatants and militia, into their
communities. Discussions have been held with UNTAETs Human Rights Department and the Reception,
Truth and Reconciliation Commission to explore ways in which CEP and the CEP institutions and
processes may be adapted to assist in this process.
The approved Guidelines for Land and asset acquisition are included in the training for facilitators, and the
project manuals.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Community Sub-Grant and Local Governance Structures: The first aspect of sustainability is that of the
local govemance structures strengthened under CEP. At a workshop of council members, traditional
leaders, and national Timorese leaders, in September 2001, there was general agreement that some form of
village and sub-district councils were needed in the future, although the composition and role of the
councils may need to be redefined from the current definition in UNTAET regulation 2000/13. Ongoing
discussions through consultations for the national Constitution, and for preparation of the national
development plan, are expected to help identify changes that need to be made. Further discussion on the
relationship between councils and traditional leaders, and between councils and government needs to take
place. Also there need to be decisions on the modus operandi of the councils, including, fo:r example,
whether there will be some form of compensation for council members.
The second aspect is the sustainability of a financial fund stream directly to the communities. Several
different models have been costed and will be discussed over the next few months with government and
donors. These models include options for i) allocations for both community sub-grants and supporting
management and service deliveiy teams from the national budget, ii) funding for both the sub-grants and
support teams from donors, and iii) some combination of funding from the national budget and donors.
The third aspect of sustainability is the sustainability of the activities themselves. To improve
sustainability of the activities in the third cycle, some slowing down of the delivery of sub-grants is
necessary in order to maximize the opportunity to leam from experience and train technical staff, village
technical assistants and community and council members, in technical aspects; and the financial
management units in the management of revolving funds.
Cultural Heritage Component: Sustainability of the activities begun under the CEP Cultural Heritage
component depends upon two factors: commitment and longevity of the management entity, and
development of a robust financial base outside of the TFET Grant for CEP. Both of these factors are
already well underway. From the outset, the motivating force behind the Cultural Center, Uma Fukun
Timor, has been Timorese. The local enthusiasm and commitment to the cultural heritage activities are
such that in the first phase of CEP, when only a small amount of TFET Grant funds were available to
support early cultural activities, Timorese individuals and groups undertook a broad range of
performances, exhibitions, and events at the designated Cultural Center site without funding from CEP.
The Culture Board is working with UNESCO to help build a proper endowment fund that will support a
wide range of activities envisioned after the CEP seed monies are spent. Already, significant contributions
have been made by the Japanese, Portuguese, and South Korean governments.
Community Radio Component: CEP Ill does not include direct support for district reporters. Radio
UNTAET, the current national broadcaster, has established a District Reporters Desk in Dili to coordinate
and support the district reporters, who report on a variety of issues that air on national radio. Radio
UNTAET has included requests for continued funding of both the district reporters and the District
Reporters Desk in their proposals to other donors. In fact, a large number of the district reporters are
currently being funded by USAID/OTI until September 2002, and a smaller number are being funded by
UNDP. The latter group of district reporters covers the civic education program.
Sustainability of the CRC and the community radios stations fall mainly under two broad categories,
institutional and financial. By nature, community radio is non-profit, low-cost, and easy to operate, but
- 23 -



there will always be operational costs that require funding and the need for effective institutional
anrangements. Sustainability of the CRC will depend on continuing demand for their support services and
the staffs ability to raise funds outside of the TFET Grant for CEP. The CRC is expected to function
similarly to other community radio center or network in other parts of the world. For each community radio
station, it is assumed that those involved will mainly be volunteers (there could be one or two paid staff)
capable of raising funds or soliciting sponsorships to keep the radio station on the air. The CRC, which will
serve as a support structure to the comnmnunity radio stations, can form a network that would enable stations
to share programming (balancing a station's own content with shared programming is considered to be a
good practice that can save money), and jointly broker advertisement deals and raise funds. Coupons and
fees for fulfilling music requests and announcing community events are also potential sources of revenue
for community radio stations. Community radio stations will also have the ability to generate revenue
through commnercial advertising, which is not prohibited by existing laws. Selling advertising space
between, or even during, programs should be considered as another possible means of raising revenue.
Some donors, PMUs (such as the ones for the agriculture and education projects, respectively), and
government departments have expressed interest in posting information bulletins through the community
radio stations for a fee, or for buying studio or air time to produce or broadcast longer information
programs. These PMUs are waiting for the establishment of these community radio stations to provide
information and key messages to specific target audiences such as farmers and fishermen, and educators,
parents and school-aged children, respectively. Government subsidies for community radio broadcasters
might be acceptable as long as the law adequately protects the broadcasters from any inappropriate
govemment control of content.
Institutional issues such as the ability of the Kliburs and management teams to run the stations and
maintain a high level of interest and participation are critical to sustainability. The decisions regarding the
running of the station and its programming must be democratic and transparent, and meet the needs of their
listener community. Continued access to training in management, reporting, programming, and technical
skills can serve as an incentive that can reduce staff turnover. The CRC team is seeking expert advice as to
whether it should follow the South African model of drawing up contracts with the community radio
stations in which the stations will only retain possession of the equipment if they pass a rigorous
performance evaluation after one year. Ongoing monitoring of activities at different stages of development
will help long-term sustainability.
It is important to note that this component is working in the context of East Timor's development of its
media sector. At the moment, all commercial radios and the vast majority of community radio stations are
concentrated in Dili, while the national broadcaster has yet to establish district or regional bureaus. Hence,
these community radio stations will have a captive market, while continuing the process of community and
nation building.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Salaries of consultants: There is currently a substantial difference between the salaries of the consultanis
and that of civil servants. While some of the gap is justified due to the short term and temporary nature of
the consultants' work, there is a need to rationalize the difference. Any reduction of salaries may lead to
unrest in the consultant team.
Independence of community radios: The community radio stations-are based on the principle of
independence. This is in line with current moves towards democracy in the country, however, following
independence the government's approach to independent broadcasting may change.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
EAST TIMOR: THIRD COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE
PROJECT
The objective of CEP is to reduce poverty and support inclusive patterns of growth and development. The
name of the project, "community empowerment," is based on the principle that projects will be produced by
conununitiesfor community activities. Through strengthening of and support for development councils and
other local groups, the CEP will:
(i) build and reconstruct their basic economic infrastructure (such as farm-to-market roads, sniall
bridges, irrigation and drainage systems, clean water, and so on -- as determined by the community, itself);
(ii) support productive local economic activities and social infrastructure activities;
(iii) pilot a number of carefully designed mechanisms for providing assistance to disadvantaged groups
(widows, orphans, people with disabilities, etc.) at the community level;
(iv) provide assistance for the development of district level capacities, specifically in planning development
activities;
(v) support cultural heritage and social reconciliation; and
(vi) support the development of local media, in particular popular district level radio, through provision of
training and equipment.
Underlying the design, implementation and management of the entire CEP program are the project
principles of empowerment, transparency, inclusiveness, open choice, accountability, and sustainability.
There are four components in CEP m: Component A - Community Sub-Grants, Component B - Cultural
Heritage, Component C - Community Radio, and Component D - Project Management Unit.
In the previous TFET Grants (CEP I and II) three sub-components of Component A have been funded:
Sub-grants to sub-districts, widow, and vulnerable groups, and district planning and initiatives. Under
component B, CEP I and II are funding sub-components for reconstruction of a National Performance and
Culture Center, and also a small sub-grants component, and funding for the management team. CEP I and
H funds for Component C have been allocated for (i) training and mobilizing district reporters, (ii)
procurement of community radio equipment and initial training, and (iii) management team. The overall
project is managed by the Project Management Unit which reports to the Minister for Internal
Administration. There are separate management teams for Component B and C, and a service delivery team
supporting Component A activities. Each member of the management and service delivery teams is
recruited on an individual contract to UNTAET.
The project description provided in the PAD for CEP II describes the activities of the main project. The
following description covers only the additional activities to be funded by this third TFET Grant.
By Component:
Project Component 1 - US$0.70 million
Component A -Community Sub-Grants
The core of this component is the provision of development funds through the auspices of democratically
selected development councils at village and sub-district level (conselho de suco and conselho do posto) .
The purpose of the councils is to represent the communities in the development planning process and while
their formation was supported under CEP I, and II, their roles go beyond to encompass all development
activities at those levels as detailed in UNTAET regulation 2000/13. Under CEP Im, three activities
additional to those funded previously will be supported: (i) an additional nine months of fees and operating
costs for the sub-grant support team, and one year for the council strengthening team. (ii) additional
- 31 -



training and communication activities, and (iii) provision of sub-grants to Dili sub-districts.
Village and Sub-District Councils. Projects funded under the community sub-grants component of CEI' I
and II are chosen through democratic procedures using development councils. At the end of 1999, the near
total elimnination of the previous administrative apparatus provided a unique opportunity to rebuild local
govemance structures that encourages democratic accountability from the bottom up. The regulation on the
establishment of the councils was fonnalized by UNTAET prior to effectiveness of CEP I. The first
activity of the community empowerment program was to work with villagers to elect an interim
development council made up of equal numbers of men and women at the village and sub-district levels.
Each sub-village group picked equal numbers of men and women to become members of the Village
Development Council, and then from the village council a man and a woman were chosen to participate in a
Sub-district Development Council that represents all of the villages within the sub-district. The sub-district
councils then appointed an independent group to manage sub-district financial affairs, and maintain records
concerning sub-district funds. To ensure greater independence and objectivity, these Financial Management
Units have remained outside of the council structure (council members were not eligible to become involved
in these units).
In the longer terin, the development councils would have at least four key functions: (i) preparing and
executing village development plans that address local needs in agriculture, health care, education,
communications, income generating, and other projects as determined by the community; (ii) managing
sub-district and village funds; (iii) relaying the priority development needs that cannot be met through local
efforts to sub-districts and districts; and (iv) strengthening participation and democratic practices.
Given the newness of the concept of elected councils, a second round of elections was held roughly one year
after the first, in mid 2001. This allowed for changes in the council membership after the communities and
the council members had gained a better understanding of the role and functioning of the councils. The
councils have shown that they have the potential to provide effective development planning and resource
allocation mechanisms that can operate throughout the country regardless of distance from government
service providers. However, their capacity still needs to be improved, especially now that so many
members are new following the second elections. There is still one cycle of sub-grants funded under CEP
II to deliver, but the project needs to focus now on strengthening council capacity, and developing better
understanding among communities regarding the roles and responsibilities of the councils and other leaders,
especially with regard to the accountability of elected representatives.
Capacity Building. A program of capacity building for council members, will be implemented throughout
CEP m. In particular a special program for strengthening the capacity of women council members will be
implemented. More emphasis will be placed on the following:
*      including other leaders and government staff in the training activities;
*      increasing information sharing between the councils themselves, and between the councils and
other actors in development (NGOs, government, donors);
*      developing partnerships with other organizations that can provide training and support to councils
and communities.
Capacity building activities will be provided in several forms:
*      Training from extemal sources funded by partner organizations: CEP alone will not bring about
all of the changes necessary to establish local govemance structures and downward accountability, it is
hoped that partners can be found to join in the effort.
*      Training funded by the sub-grant but outsourced to consultants or NGOs more experienced in the
- 32 -



specific topic than the consultant team
*      Training provided by the consultant team
*      Horizontal training based on sharing experiences between councils, through workshops, or
exchange visits.
Project Consultants. A team of nearly 150 Timorese consultants have been recruited on individual
contracts to ETPA to help implement the sub-grants component. Under CEP I and H the management of
the team was heavily centralized, with small district teams and facilitators in each sub-district. The
weakness in this organization was that it did not sufficiently empower or support the field staff, nor did it
allow for efficient matching of skills with needs. For CEP III, the team will be restructured and move to a
more decentralized organization in three regional and 12 district offices. By clustering skills in the regional
and district offices, it will allow them to be more effectively managed and allocated to where they are most
needed. For example, water supply engineers can deal with all of the water supply projects in a district or
region, while a roads engineer can deal with roads project, rather than expecting a district engineer to be
multi-skilled in different aspects. At each level the team will have two main objectives - to deliver the
sub-grants efficiently, and to strengthen capacity of councils and the services provided to them. Hence the
teams will also have on them people responsible for training and networking, and communications.
Monitoring and Evaluation. Regular reports will be submitted by the field teams. Technical audits will
also be undertaken periodically. A reporting system has already been established to receive complaints
from members of the communities and a system set in place to investigate and follow up on these actions.
Several workshops will take place including the donor and NGO community, project staff, and council
members, to evaluate the progress and plan future strategies. Other monitoring initiatives to be undertaken
will include reporting by journalists, an independent audit by NGOs and participatory assessments in the
communities.
Sub-Component: Sub-Grants to Dili Sub-Districts
Preparation of an implementation plan will be a condition of disbursement of this component. Issues that
still need to be resolved are which specific locations to include, the allocations by posto (or suco), how the
councils will be formed and what their function will be in the urban context, information dissemination and
facilitation.
Eligible Activities: Two types of activities can be proposed: (i) social infrastructure activities, (ii) social
welfare activities.
Negative List: No sub-project shall: (i) include expenditures intended for a military or paramilitary
purpose; (ii) relate to the manufacture or use of environmentally hazardous goods (including asbestos and
pesticides), arms or drugs, (iii) include the financing of government salaries, (iv) include civil works for
government administration or religious purposes, (v) include civil works on buildings where ownership is
disputed or unknown; (vi) include renting of buildings where ownership is disputed or unknovn, or (vii)
include land acquisition.
Sub-Grant Proposal Verification and Technical Review: Verification of the village proposals for a
community sub-grant takes place in three stages: first, a review by a team appointed by the development
council; followed later by a technical review made by the technical assistance approved by the technical
team. Verification includes site visits by the verification teams. The written report by the reviewers is read
out in the public development council meeting which is attended by all sub project proponents and other
community members. The council discussion evaluates competing proposals on criteria such as the basis of
- 33 -



their ability to reach the poor, their reflection of local contributions in cash or in kind, and the group
opinion of their technical soundness and relative merits. Once the council has decided on which proposals
merit funding from the sub-grant, a final meeting is held to explain the results of the discussion, and to
begin preparation of implementation.
Sub-Projects: Once community sub-grant monies are awarded to fund a particular proposal, it becomes a
sub-project that is managed by its proponent group or sub-village (aldeia), with support from the technical
specialists. Sub-projects are prepared with details such as the sub project's purpose, cost requirements, and
technical needs. Up to four proposals may be submitted by a village on behalf of sub-villages and
community groups to the sub-district councils, at least half must come from women's groups. All sub
project proposals for the second and third phases must include cost estimates, schedules of fund needs,
operation and maintenance plans, estimated community contributions (including "in kind" contributions),
and notes conceming compliance with safeguard policies regarding aspects such as envirommental impacts,
and written assurance that no compensation will be required from project funds. Standard formats for these
requirements are provided in the Project Manual.
Sub-Grant Procurement Procedures: "Open menus" limited only by a small negative list of items
prohibited by law and project conditions (pesticides, arms, etc.). Goods worth $7,500 or less can be
procured by communities themselves following evaluation of at least three bids using standard simplified
bid forms. Small works procurement can be used for works up to a maximum value of $25,000, labor and
local goods are procured under the procedures for community participation in procurement. Purchases over
$7,500 assistance must be made with assistance from the project management unit. The procedures for
procurement by communities are given in Annex 6.
Technical Assistancefor Communities: Technical skills tend to be focused in Dili, therefore there should
be sufficient skills available. The mechanism by which the communities will access the skills will need to
be defined before implementation.
Flow of Funds: There are now a few banks in Dili accessible to communities. Flow of funds will be by
Bank transfers to accounts established by communities. The exact mechanisms, sign off procedures, etc.
will need to be defined before implementation.
Sub-Grant Funding Transparency: Transparency of community sub-grants is a central feature of the
project. Information needs to be accessible and easily understood by villagers. All financial information
must be publicly posted, and facilitator teams are expected to use a variety of media to convey information
about the project and its progress. Community councils and facilitators are responsible for publicly postinlg
project information on large signboards. These signboards are updated monthly, and more regularly during
the sub-project implementation period. The national team will develop a computerized management
information system and a registry of project complaints and their resolution, which will also be public
domain information.
Project Component 2 - US$0.20 million
Component B - Cultural Heritage Component
Previous TFET Grants are financing the reconstruction of a National Performance and Culture Center
(Uma Fukun), and the implementation of a small sub-grants, and oral history collection programs. All of
the activities funded in Component B are managed by the management team of the culture center. The team
includes a general manager and directors of the museum, and arts/culture. The management team reports
to the Culture Board of Uma Fukun, a body comprised of Timorese leaders, artists, performers, and other
stakeholders. The Culture Board and management team receive technical advice from UNESCO under a
-34 -



contract funded throug]h CEP II. The management team also reports administratively on the
implementation of the CEP-funded activities to the PMU. The management team is now also receiving
funds from separate sources for specific activities such as museum reconstruction, training, or to support
specific exhibitions. However, while they are without a permanent office, and until the culture center can
be opened, they are limited in their ability to function at their most effective. By covering salaries and
operating costs from CEP m, the management team will have sufficient security to establish themselves
fully and develop a plan for long term sustainability of the culture center. The first few months will be
taken up with moving into the culture center and establishing permanent and temporary exhibitions. The
team will present monthly reports to the PMU on progress, and will have a long term business plan
prepared by the end of the year.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.40 million
Component C - Community Radio Component
The establishment of community radio stations in the districts will help strengthen social capital at the local
level, and as a particularly important communications tool for poor communities, it will be the vehicle for
communities to share and discuss their social concerns in a language they understand, get an alternative
source of information and entertainment, and explore and foster debate on issues that affect their lives.
Aside from the obvious desire to bring informnation to the poorest segments of society, which often includes
a disproportionate share of those who cannot read and write, there are other reasons to support such an
initiative. Community radio is non-profit, low-cost, easy to operate, reaches members of the community in
their own languages and, as a local, grass-roots media, it maximizes the potential for developmnent to be
drawn from sharing information, knowledge and skills within the community. Community radio informs,
educates and entertains; it also empowers the community by giving a strong public voice to the voiceless,
which encourages greater accountability in public affairs. Local news programming, documentaries, media
campaigns, and educational programs can greatly enhance transparency, a comerstone of democracy.
Better knowledge of projects promotes higher levels of participation and discourages corruption. Higher
levels of participation, in turn, will promote sustainability and a strong sense of ownership.
Community Radio Center: This project component will establish a CRC in Dili that will provide technical,
management, and programming support to the fledgling community radio stations. The CRC will also
explore future funding options and organize fund-raising activities. In order to provide these services, the
staff of the CRC will require training. The staff will also develop linkages with community radio programs
in other countries through exchange visits.
Establishment of Community Radio Stations: The equipment is expected to arrive in Dili in late June or
early July 2002. Preparations for establishing the stations in selected districts started last November 2001.
This included: (i) a series of consultations with the communities at the district and sub-district level; (ii) the
formation of Klburs (small representative local structures, elected by their respective community, tasked
with developing proposals to establish community radio in their district-and managing it if
established-and deciding on proposals for Component B's small sub-grants program); and (iii) the ongoing
development of proposals for the establishmer4t of community radio stations in selected districts. Each
proposal will be rigorously evaluated for the community's readiness to own, operate, and maintain a
station. If necessary, funds for small works will be included in the initial sub-grant. Before the community
radio stations can be set up in the selected districts, the teams that will run them will receive training in the
operation and management of stations. Additional training in different aspects of community radio
operations and maintenance will be provided during the first year of operation. Some coverage of operating
costs (but not salaries) will be paid initially but will then be phased out.
Technical Assistance. The technical assistance for the component will be in the form of provision of
- 35 -



equipment and training. A number of different experienced and skilled specialists in community radio will
be required to train managers, reporters and radio operators, as well as the CRC team.
The CRC team, who will be contracted as individuals to UNTAET in the same way as the consultants
working on other components are, will carry out the following tasks:
*   Manage the Community Radio Center in Dili, which will function as a hub for a number of supportive
services for the community radio stations.
* Monitor the implementation of the Telecommunications Regulation Law and the Public Broadcast
Corporation regulation and watch for possible impacts on community radio stations.
*   Coordinate training efforts and exchanges for community radio station staff.
*   Organize national and district level workshops to build support for community radio.
*   Coordinate the establishment and proper functioning of community radio management boards (Kliburs)
at the national and district levels.
Institutional Arrangements. The Community Radio Center management team is responsible for
implementing the component. The team reports to the PMU, and coordinates its activities with those of the
national radio station and other radio and media stakeholders. The community radio stations will be
established as independent entities owned by the community, and will be operated and managed by Kliburs
and the stations management teams. The community radio stations and the national broadcaster could
eventually form a network or affiliation among them, but we should let it evolve, and create room for it to
find its own shape. National radio and community radio have distinctly different roles, though they
complement each other in serving the audience. However, neither cannot be substituted with one another.
Their program approaches, modes of operation and broadcasting access are different from one another.
It is important to note that this component is working in the context of East Timor's development of its
media sector. At the moment, all commercial radios and the vast majority of community radio stations are
concentrated in Dili, while the national broadcaster has yet to establish district or regional bureaus. Hence,
these community radio stations will have a captive market, while continuing the process of community and
nation building.
Project Component 4 - US$0.20 million
Component D - Proiect Management Unit
The project management unit will be comprised of a core group of people who will oversee all of the
project components. The much reduced Dili-based team will handle the combined oversight functions of
coordination, financial management and monitoring, and will also provide central administrative support to
each of the three component teams.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
Economic Analysis
A study of the costs benefits of infrastructure projects was carried out in November 2001. The results of
the study are shown in the Table below. On the whole, the results show that the community empowerment
projects sampled as part of this study are beneficial to the economy.

The NPV is read from the left hand scale in dollars and the IRR is read from the right hand scale in
percent The projects shown in blue all have negative NPVs and the ones in yellow have the positive NPVs
with average being in black and white oblique stripes. The projects represented in blue stripes were
unfinished which explains their large negative NPVs. The other projects represented by the negative blue
bars were negative because they were not sufficiently well built and technically sound to supply water in a
cost effective manner, in sufficient volumes to the community. In some cases, the community was too small
in comparison to the cost of the project and in addition, the benefit (in terms of time saving) may have been
too small. Hydrological and cost effectiveness investigations were seldom undertaken to con irmn viable
options.
The main lesson for the CEP is that there is a need to improve liaison with line ministries and NGOs who
have the technical capacity to advise on appropriate design guidelines.
In addition to providing appropriate design guidance, the involvement of the WSS (Water and Public
Works) would ensure that systems at village level become part of water resources management and water
supply master plans defined by the Ministry in consultation with communities and sector stakeholders.
Such "broad picture" is usually not taken in consideration by the communities at the design stage but
should be for several reasons. Firstly, communities can easily duplicate water supply systems (see Tapo
Oeleu system in Bobonaro) imposing inefficient design, high costs and unsustainable O&M commitments
which all result in the systems breaking down very quickly with no long term benefits to society.
Road and bridge projects:
The road and bridge projects visited during the survey showed stronger results. All NPVs were positive as
were the IRRs calculated from the data collected on site during discussions with local people in the villages.
Figure 2 shows the details.
The benefits from road and bridge projects are typically derived from time saving resulting from better
roads, increased number of trips and saving in Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC). In addition, one could
argue there is a value to the economy in improved access of villages to markets and dollar value of
employment to the economy. In the cases examined in East Timor, the roads were small village unsealed
roads frequented mostly by pedestrians with occasional motor bikes. Thus, VOCs were zero for most of the
projects, there were some increases in the number of trips and some time saving or reduction in hardship.
By far, the benefits of the roads came out of the employment benefit to the local economy where it was
assumed that 50 cents to the dollar earned on the road projects were spent at the local market. In addition,
improved access of village people to markets was thought to also have conferred some benefit to the local
economy. Defining these factors was difficult and estimates were adopted based on discussions with other
economists.

ProJect locations
The infrastructure was thought to require 10% of the initial capital investment annually in O&cM to keep it
operational for five years and this was defined as the life of the project. After five years, 50% of the value
of the initial capital investment in the infrastructure would be left. In some cases (such as bridges) this
5-year life might be a liffle short but in other cases (such as steep mountain roads), the assumption might be:
appropriate because of the rainy season damages to the road and so overall, a 5-year life mnight be
representative. By way of comparison, the cost/benefit analysis for large irrigation projects assumed
complete reconstruction after 10 years.
Road projects are naturally less technically demanding than water supply systems especially at the village
scale and so this may explain the better results. In addition, it may be that communities see more
advantages in roads than in water supply and so there is better community participation. Many roads and
bridges conveyed clear benefits to the aldeias allowing agricultural goods to reach markets or connecting to
the main roads which then would lead on to the markets and other towns. In some cases, roads are thought
to be built to "connect" the small aldeias and sucos psychologically to the rest of the country. Pride of the
Chefe de Suco would be to connect his people to the country on a road trafficable at least in the dry season
by some vehicle. One man told us with pride that UN Police vehicle now could reach his Suco. Perhaps
increased security and safety (ambulance reaching the village) could be also included in the perceived
benefits.
Cost effectiveness of CEP projects in comparison with other implementing agencies.
The cost effectiveness of the CEP projects was determined for the water projects and compared to the water
projects implemented by WSS (Water and Public Works). Cost effectiveness shows the cost of supplying
water per household. However, there is no notion in the benefits conferred on the community and so it is a-
more incomplete analysis of the value of a project. One system may be expensive but confer more benefits
on the community perhaps due to larger time saving, more water supplied and larger gains in public
-40 -



benefits. However, in a cost effectiveness measure, this would be factored in.
Cost effectiveness is included here to show that in relation to other aid delivery mechanism, CEP is not out
of range and in fact is quite competitive. One reason is that CEP has little overheads in the rural areas.
Offices, if they exist, have little or no furniture or computers, printers, etc. There are no vehicles for staff.
All funds go direct to the communities. This compares with line ministries who typically have large
expenses in vehicles, offices etc.
Figure 3 below shows clearly that based on the information received from WSS, CEP is not out of range
and is comparable in cost/household ($92 for CEP vs $152 for WSS). There is no suggestion that the
benefits conferred by the systems; are comparable. In fact, it is likely that WSS systems are more complex,
perhaps requiring water treatment, pumps etc. and the quality of the system may be better, at least in the
major rural centers which require more reliable supply for paying customers. Nevertheless, small rural
systems built by CEP are competitive in terms of cost.

Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
EAST TIMOR: THIRD COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE: PROJECT
Procurement
The proposed Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project m (CEP E1I) is the third
TFET Grant for the Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project in East l'imor. The
first CEP has been completed while the second CEP project is ongoing and is facing delays in
implementation and collection of repayments of sub-grants. Therefore in designing CEP1 m, lessons
learned and experiences gained during the implementation of CEP I and CEP II have been
incorporated.
Project Components
The project includes the following components: (a).Commmunity Sub-Grants (US$0.70 million) which
includes sub-grants for (i) capacity building for village and sub-district councils; (ii) a team of
consultants to provide technical, information, and training services to communities and (iii) additional
sub-grants for Dili communities; (b) Cultural Heritage (US$0.20 million) to support the management
and procurement of small equipment of the Cultural Center; (c) Community Radio (US$0.40 million)
to support (i) establishment of CRC and community radio stations, (ii) management and operation of
the CRC and community radio stations, and (iii) training of the management teams and volunteers;
and (d) Project Management (US$0.20 million). The Community Sub-Grants program will be
implemented by the community councils with guidance of the PMU. The Cultural Heritage
component will be implemented by the Cultural Board of Uma Fukun Timor with guidance from the
PMU. The PMU will implernent the Community Radio and Project Management components. The
PMU will be responsible for the overall monitoring and coordination of the proposed Project on behalf
of the Government, and providing progress reports and other relevant information to the Government
and IDA.
Procurement Capacity Assessment
CEP HI will be implemented by the existing PMU established for CEP I and CEP II. The
procurement capacity of the CEP I and CEP II is weak for procurement through ICB and NCBs.
The PMU required additional assistance from a procurement agent and the Central Administrative
Services Central Procurement Unit to procure two large contracts that were beyond the existing
capacity of the PMU. The PMU is actively recruiting a National Procurement Specialist, with
qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to fill the procurement position. The National
Procurement Specialist will most likely have limited exposure to international procurement.
The risk rating remains high for CEP m. To mitigate the risks, the procurement of limited amount of
goods and consulting services will be carried out by the National Procurement Specialist supported by
the CFO, and the international consultant hired to support the radio component of CEI II, who both
have international procurement experience. If and when necessary, the PMU will seek assistance from
the Central Administrative Services Procurement Unit to assist with the procurement. 'From time to
time additional procurement guidance will also be provided from the Procurement Specialist in the
Dili and/or Sydney office.
In 2001, a separate procurement capacity assessment was carried out for both the PMU and the
communities for activities under CEP II. The overall risk assessment of the projects was rated as
high. The findings in the capacity assessment are as follows and remain valid for CEP m.
-43 -



A. Assessment of PMU Capacity
In summary, the assessment found that a procurement regulation is in place that together with the
supplemental letter which is compatible with Bank guidelines (see paragraph below). The PMU
staff are young and inexperienced but with the exception for the lack of a national procurement
officer and personnel officer, who are being recruited, all positions in the PMU are filled. Several of
the senior management team, including the Project Director, have participated in procurement training
and gained significant hands-on experience in the last two years although their main function are not
procurement The PMU has been reorganized to improve, among other things, the capacity to i)
monitor and support the community procurement, ii) recruit, contract, and manage individual
consultants, and iii) carry out national and international shopping. An audit for the period December
2000 to July 2001 has been carried out, this is the second audit of the Community Empowerment
Project. Support and control systems are in place. In this regard the Association has approved the
position and the PMU is recruiting the international district financial officer (DFO) to work with the
districts in setting up accounting systems. The PMU is equipped and records and filing systems are
well maintained.
The project has experienced a high rate of attrition as many staff have left to complete their education
which was disrupted while others have left to join the civil service. However, the most senior
members of the team have been consistent throughout and their experience and capacity is
considerably greater now than at the start of the project. Advisors will be employed to transfer
knowledge and train PMU staff and members of community. On-going training and support will be
required. Due to the inexperience of most of the national staff the overall risk assessment of the PMIJ
is rated as high.
Additional procurement training will be offered to the staff in World Bank procurement procedures
shortly after independence (June 2002). The DFO will be hired in June 2002 as well.
B. Capacityfor Procurement by Communities
UNTAET regulation 13/2000 establishes the village and sub-district councils as legal entities capable
of carrying out procurement and handling funds. Over 400 village councils have now had experience
in procuring goods and services with CEP sub-grants, and the results have exceeded expectations at
appraisal. A great deal of assistance is required from facilitators and the capacity of the 80
facilitators is increasing. District Project Accountants are now in place in each district to support the
facilitators, train financial management teams and councils, and carry out spot checks on the books
kept in the villages. The CFO has been involved in the development of the forms for procurement and
financial management. Project manuals include sections on community procurement, and a handboolk
for communities and facilitators is currently being developed. The promotion of the culture of
accountability is at the core of the project, and transparency is ensured through regular updating of
notice boards located in public places in all participating sub-villages. As indicated above, a DFO is
being recruited to work with the districts and community leaders in setting up a transparent
accounting/record keeping systems.
Risks associated with community contracting were also rated high. Risks include the fact that all
parties lack experience in the concepts and procedures in CEP. CEP m will fund District Facilitators
who will provide continuous capacity building to minimize the risk. The communities are subjected to
political influence which may impact the transparency of procurement and financial management at
-44 -



vilage level as political parties jostle for power. The team is developing a strategy to protect the
project from interference, and also a code of ethics for project staff. Checks and balances to prevent
corruption depend to a large extent on the ability of communities to understand their role in
monitoring, and the records posted on the notice boards. The project will insist that boolcs are kept,
purchases are fully documented and carried out in an open and transparent basis, and information
campaigns are initiated to inform communities and to increase their understanding of project
principles and ethics. CEP III wiU also explore ways to integrate traditional leaders and local laws
and sanctions into the process of monitoring community procurement.
C. Action Plan to Improve Capacity of Project Staff and Communities
Actions that will be introduced in CEP m to ensure honest and fair community procurement wil
include:
* Develop community procurement and financial management guidelines. Detailed guidelines for
community procurement for the district facilitators and communities acceptable to the
Association have been prepared and will being followed by the Project. FM guidelines will be
finalized in July with the arrival of DFO. Training plan has been developed and iraining is
scheduled to re-start in July 2002.
* Follow up training of the DPAs, who will train sub-district and village facilitators, council
members, treasurers, and implementing teams will be undertaken by the training team in
accordance with materials from the CFO. The follow up training is scheduled to be held in July
with the arrival of the DFO.
*   Improve interaction and evaluation between the DPAs to discuss problems and develop their
skills in monitoring procurement. Regular meetings have been scheduled and will continue.
*   Develop a community communications strategy. Strategy has been developed and is being
implemented.
*   Develop a code of ethics. Strategies for dealing with the elections and code of ethics for project
staff during the campaigns have been developed and are being implemented.
Additional procurement training will be offered in the Administrative Services Capacity Building
Project (PCF funded). It is anticipated that training will be offered in September 2002
Procurement Related Legislation
The Transitional Administration in East Timor regulation UNTAET/REG/2000/10 dated 6 March
2000 entitled "On Public Procurement for Civil Administration in East Timor" was prepared with the
assistance of World Bank funded consultants. To amplify the provisions Regulation 2000/10 relating
to the procurement of goods, services and works in East Timor, UNTAET has developed a "Public
Procurement Manual (PPM) for Civil Administration in East Timor". Section 10 of the PPM entitled
Procurement Methods states that all procurement shall be conducted through the open tendering
process. The PPM includes procedures for all types of procurement methods including International
and National Competitive Bidding, national and international shopping, as wel as direct and restricted
contracting in exceptional cases. The regulations and procurement procedures will be addressed in
more detail by EDA during die preparation of the Country Procurement Assessment Rqeort (CPAR)
scheduled to be completed in June 2002. A supplemental letter has should be included in the Grant
Agreement which modifies regulation 2000/10 to compliance with WB guidelines for NCB. The
modifications included in the supplemental letter foUlow.
(a)    The procurement entity shall procure goods in accordance with Section 5.1 of the
- 45 -



Regulation. The exceptions provided in Section 5. shall not be valid for NCB.
(b)    Section 9.1 shall be modified to provide for advertisement in the national press. Bidders
shall not have less than 30 days from the date of availability of the bidding documents or
advertisement in the press, whichever is later to prepare their bids.
(c)    Section 14.3 (g) shall be modified to read "the criteria to be used in evaluating proposals
and their relative weight, shall be expressed in monetary terms."
(d)    Under Section 15.6 the procuring entity may request extension of the bid validity period,
but suppliers shall not be required toe extend such date, after bid submission.
(e)    Under Section 16, the bid security shall be set in such a way as to not unduly deter bidders
from participating in the bidding process and
(f)    Section 18.4 shall not apply.
For the selection of consultants, there is no conflict between the Bank's Consultant's Guidelines and
the Regulations. However, the Regulations do not require inclusion of the draft contract form in the
Request for Proposals. They meet the Bank's requirement. The Bank's Standard Request for
Proposals: Selections of Consultants (includes Standard Forms Contract) dated July 1997, revised
April 1998 and July 1999, shall be used while inviting proposals.
Project Procurement Procedures.
Procurement of goods, works and consulting services for the project will follow the "Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", dated January 1995, revised in January and August 1996,
September 1997 and January 1999, and Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers dated January 1997, revised September 1997 and January 1999. The procurement of
consultants will use the World Bank Standard Request for Proposals- Selection of Consultants dated
July 1997, revised April 1998 and July 1999, Standard Bidding Documents Procurement of Works
(smaller contracts) dated January 1995, revised October 1996.
Procurement Methods
A. Procurement Under the Community Sub-Grants (US$ 0.20 million)
Two hundred thousand dollars is allocated for sub-grant under components A. The sub-grants can be
used by the communities to procure services, technical assistance, goods, training, labor, and small
works, as these are needed to prepare and implement sub-projects. Proposals are prepared by village
councils and submitted to sub-district councils where the best proposals are selected for funding
according to criteria decided on, and notified to the village communities at the beginning of the
process. The use of the sub-grants between the categories depends on the proposals submitted by
villages: no targets can be set by the PMU for minimum or maximum proportions of the sub-grants
used for different purposes (for example loans versus sub-grants). No Sub-project shall: (i) include
expenditures intended for a military or paramilitary purpose; (ii) relate to the manufacture or use of
environmentally hazardous goods (including asbestos and pesticides), arms or drugs, (iii) include the
financing of government salaries, (iv) include civil works for government administration or religious
purposes, (v) include civil works on buildings where ownership is disputed or unknown; (vi) include
renting of buildings where ownership is disputed or unknown, or (vii) include land acquisition.
Complete procurement procedures are contained in the Project Manual which has been approved by
IDA. A separate manual for facilitators and communities is being prepared and, after approval by
IDA, will be issued prior to the irplementation of the 3rd cycle of sub-grants. This manual will be
finalized after receiving inputs from the CFO and the other members of PMU team. Except for the
- 46 -



initial emergency reconstruction sub-grant (which has already been provided), proposals will be
attached to an Implementation Agreement signed by the members of the sub-project proponent and the
sub-district facilitator.
The following procedures will be followed to procure goods, services, technical assistance and works
under sub-grants.
Goods and Services: Goods and services include generators, building and water supply materials,
bore holes, etc.. For the purposes of this paragraph the term "services" is defined as installation,
commissioning, transportation, drilling of bore holes, etc. and not hiring of consultants to provide
technical assistance."
(i)      For goods and services estimated to cost under US$7,500 or equivalent per contract, the
recipient of the sub-grant shall obtain a minimum of three written price quotations, in
accordance with Articles 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits.
(ii)      For goods and services estimated to cost more than US$7,500 or equivalent per contract,
or where the aggregate amount provided by a specific supplier to an individual sub-project
will exceed $7,500 or equivalent, the service delivery team will assist the communities with
procurement and there will be prior review by a representative approved by the CFO prior
to obtaining three written quotations in accordance with Articles 3.5 and 3.6 of the
Guidelines.
(iii)    For goods and services estimated to cost less than US$2,500 or equivalent: per contract, to
an aggregate of US$5,000 per individual sub-project, when justified due to lack of
alternative supplier/firms, may be procured by direct contracting in accordance with
Article 3.7 of the Guidelines
(iv)     Civil Works estimated to cost less than US$25,000 or equivalent per contract may be
contracted through lump sum contracts awarded on the basis of written quotations
obtained locally from at least 3 local contractors (including NGOs) in response to a written
invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic
specifications, start and completion dates, a basic agreement format acceptable to the
Bank and relevant drawings. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the
lowest price quotation and is evaluated to have the technical capacity for the required
work. The district Technical Facilitator will review the specifications, quotations, and
contract.
Community Participation: Communities are encouraged to participate in, and contribute to, the
sub-project activities, however, there are no upper or lower limits for the amount of their contribution,
and there is no requiremenit to contribute anything. Incentives to contribute are built in through the
process of proposal selection. Councils will select criteria to help them evaluate proposals and the
amount of contribution is usually one of the criteria they select Contributions from communities will
usually be in the form of labor and materials, but may also include land. In some cases the
communities may choose to include full or partial labor costs in the proposals and pay salaries for
work done on the project. Transfer of funds to individuals, while they work to build a public good, is
acceptable under the project rules. It is not possible to predict in advance what the amount of
community participation vill be, the communities first have to decide whether they want to contribute
labor or be paid, and the councils have to decide whether they will accept paid participation in the
proposals they select. Community participation procedures and guidelines for selecting and paying
labor have been prepared and are in accordance with clause 3.15 of the Guidelines.

B. Procurement of Goods by the Project Management Unit (US$0.06 million)
International Shopping: Goods and services costing less than $25,000 equivalent per contract to an
aggregate value of $ 25,000 (computers, office, audio and video equipment, etc.), will be purchased in
accordance with clause 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines.
National Shopping: Goods and services costing less than US$25,000 equivalent per contract to an
aggregate value of US$ 30,000 for printing of communications materials, spare parts, office supplies,
will be required. A rninimum of three quotations will be sought from local suppliers and the contract
awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder in accordance with articles 3.5 and 3.6 of the Guidelines.
Goods estimated to cost less than $5,000 equivalent per contract to an aggregate value of $5,000 and
which must be provided from one particular supplier due to lack of alternative local suppliers may
with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured in accordance with the provision of article 3.7 of the
Guidelines.
C. Procurement of Small Works (USS0.025 million)

NGOs if appropriate) in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed
description of the works, including basic specifications, start and completion dates, a basic agreement
fornat acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings. The award shall be made to the contractor who
offers the lowest price quotation and is evaluated to have'the technical capacity for the required work.
D. Procurement of Consultants (S 1.03 million)
Consultant Qualifications: Several small training contracts are included in the project where
experience has shown that there are others more qualified to provide specific training than the project
team themselves. In this case, the contracts valued at less than $100,000 each will be awarded to
firms and non-government organizations on the basis of consultant qualifications, in accordance with
clauses 3.7 of the Guidelines.
Single Source Selection: Where very specific skills are required and there is only one company with
the specific skills contracts valued at less than $50,000 will be awarded in accordance with clauses
3.8 to 3.11 of the guidelines and with the Bank's prior approval.
Individual Consultants: Several individual consultants valued at less than $75,000 each to support
communities in mnicro-finance, language training/translation, water supply engineering, marketing,
community radio training, etc. may be needed to provide very small (less than one month) inputs
during the project implementation. Terns of reference will be prepared and consultants will be
selected in accordance with clauses 5.1 to 5.3 of the Guidelines.
In addition, nearly 200 Timorese service delivery staff and consultants have been contracted as
individuals under direct contracts with UNTAET. No firms are involved. Some of the consultants are
recruited into the project management unit including a Financial Management Team, an
-48 -



Administration Team, and a Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation Team. Also based in Dili are a
Training and Communications team, a Widows and Vulnerable Groups team, and the team leaders of
the service delivery teams: the Field Operations team and the Technical Team. Three regional
coordinators will head regional teams of five or six people, and district coordinators will head district
teams of about the same size. The consultants and service delivery staff were recruited in CEP I from
hundreds of applicants responding to advertisements posted locally on the regular UNFrAET
recruitment boards. The evaluation of the candidates took into account of the qualifications and
experience of each, and the overall composition of the teamn in terms of gender balance, regional
diversity, range of languages covered etc. The staff selected were evaluated after an initial trial period
and the contracts of only those staff who had performed well were extended. Before any further
extensions of the contracts at the end of this period, there will be a performance evaluation process in
which the team will participate. Further extensions of contracts for each individual will depend on
their results in the performance evaluation. The selection criteria to extend contracts of the service
delivery staff and consultants will be determined during negotiations. The selection criteria will
include but is not limited to minimum performance requirements, level of experience, method of
selection, etc. If additional consultants are required they will be recruited as individual consultants in
accordance with articles 3.19 and Section V of the Guidelines. The salaries for the positions in the
service delivery teams will be fixed by the PMU prior to project appraisal. The aggregate value of
these consultant and service delivery contracts is $530,000 for CEP m.
Least cost: Auditing firms will be contracted to perform annual audits on a least cost basis.
Aggregate value for auditing contracts will be under $ 20,000.
E. Recurrent Costs (US$0.19 nillion)
Recurrent costs includes the vehicle and motorcycle expenses (fuel, insurance, repairs) required for
the district administrators, stationery and consumables for district and the project office and materials,
communications, consumables, and photocopying for training courses and workshops financed by the
project. Estimated value of the recurrent costs is US$0.19 million and will be handled on and SOE
basis.

Annex 6(B) Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
EAST TIMOR: THIRD COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE
PROJECT
Financial Manauement
1. Summary of the Financial Management Assessment
With the possible exception of the lack of adequate accounting and financial management procedures at the
sub-district and village council levels, the overall financial management of CEP remains adequate and
acceptable. The Chief Financial Officer has established a satisfactory accounting system and provided
adequate periodic reports on use of IDA funds. The District Project Accountants (DPAs) have performed
well to ensure that IDA Grant funds reach the intended beneficiaries, that these are recorded at the
sub-district level and generally to keep misuse of funds to a minimum. IDA disbursements have proceeded
reasonably well; final disbursements and adjustments under CEP I are expected to be resolved soon.
Financial statements of CEP I as of December 2000 were audited, for the first time, with no significant
problems identified. The next audit was for six months, January to June 2001 to bring future audits in line
with the Government fiscal year.
The main emphasis of financial management at CEP-HQ has been on (i) management of grant funds from
the Special Account to the sub-districts and villages; (ii) preparing timely withdrawal applications to
replenish the Special Account and keep the funds flowing; (iii) maintaining adequate accounling records
and documents on use of grant fuids for audit verifications and (iv) providing periodic information required
by IDA on flow of funds. Possibly because of heavier workload for these tasks than previously anticipated,
ensuring that simple but adequate accounting and financial management procedures at sub-district and
village levels has remained a secondary concern in the overall financial management of the CEP projects.
CEP m will pay special attention to this aspect of its financial management systems by designing more
appropriate systems that can be easily understood and implemented at the sub-district and village levels. A
new senior financial team will be recruited with systems design and training written in as a major
component of the terms of reference
2. Audit Arrangements
The audit of CEP I for the period January - July 2001 has just been completed. From now orn audits will
be submitted by end of December each year for the period up to July that year in accordance with the Fiscal
Year of the government.

Withdrawal of Grant Proceeds:
No withdrawals shall be made under the TFET Grant in respect of: (a) payments made for expenditures
prior to the date of this Agreement; (b) payments made for expenditures under Category I unless and until
the Dili Sub-grants Manual, acceptable to the Trustee, has been adopted;
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursement from the TFET Grant Account can be made on the basis of statements of expenditure for:
(a)Sub-Grants and Credits; (b) goods and works costing less than $100,000 equivalent per contract; (c)
incremental operating costs; (d) training; and (e) contracts for the employment of consulting finms valued at
less than $50,000 equivalent each and contracts for the employment of individuals valued at less than
$25,000 equivalent. Supporting documentation is retained by the PMU and subject to post review during
supervision missions.
Special account:
A Special Account has been established at the Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU)
denominated in US$, with an authorized ceiling of $250,000. This amount, higher than the standard 10%
of the Grant was approved taking into account that if one of the Dili sub-grants are disbursed,
disbursements of up to $100,000 for the Grants alone may be made in within a very short time. The
account will be managed by the PMU and replenishment requests will be made monthly, or when 20%/o of
the authorized ceiling has been disbursed, whichever occurs. The proceeds of the TFET Grant will be
disbursed in accordance with the guidelines in the "Disbursement Handbook".
