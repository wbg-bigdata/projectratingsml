MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A NORTHEAST RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IN THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS
1.        The following report on a proposed rural development loan to the
Federative Republic of Brazil for US$55.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. It would help finance Brazil's Northeast Rural
Development Program (NRDP) in the northern portion of the State of Minas
Gerais.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Brazil has traditionally been the main
source oz exports and employment, though a relatively small contributor to
GDP. In 1985, agriculture accounted for 13% of GDP, 30% of the economically
active population and 31% of total exports. Throughout the 1970s, there was
rapid expansion in Brazil's agriculture (5% per annum); during the recession
in the early 1980s, output and investment stagnated and then recovered in
1984 and 1985. The performance of the sector in the 1970s masked sharply
disparate rates of growth among regions, farm types and individual crops.
The Northeast of Brazil covers 18% of the country's total area and has been
the nation's foremost problem region since the late 1800s. In 1985, the
Northeast had a population of 39 million, or about 29% of the country's
total, growing at 2.3% per annum. Half the population lives in the rural.
areas and over 50% of the work force is engaged in agriculture. Drought and
uncertain rainfall, highly skewed land distribution, illiteracy, endemic
diseases, and limited urban employment opportunities have resulted in high
levels of poverty and underemployment, particularly in rural areas. Despite
the constraints, Northeast agriculture continues to play an important role in
the national economy. The Northeast contributes about one-fifth of the total
value of Brazilian crop production; many regionally produced commodities
(cotton, sisal, cassava and sugar) represent significant shares of national
production.
3.        In 1982, the Government requested Bank assistance in preparing a
new regionwide rural development program, the Northeast Rural Development
Program (NRDP). This initiative was stimulated by the recognition that
previous rural programs had achieved limited results in alleviating poverty
and increasing agricultural production. The NRDP, simpler in design than
previous efforts supported by the Bank, focuses on eliminating key
constraints on small farmer development, such as land tenure insecurity,
drought vulnerability, and limited access to credit and use of modern
technology. The program is complemented by the Northeast Region Land Tenure
Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR) which finances cadastral activities in all
ten Northeast states. It will be further complemented by a series of sector
projects in education, health, water supply and sanitation. Regional program
guidelines have established (a) unified and streamlined funding and
administrative procedures, and (b) mechanisms for increased beneficiary
participation and improved institutional performance.
4.        Project Ob4ectives.  The proposed project would:  (a) increase
agricultural production and productivity; (b) generate income and employment
opportunities for the low-income rural families; (c) promote water resource



- 2 -
a-velopment and technology generation and diffusion to decrease small
farmers' vulnerability to recurring droughts; (d) increase community
participation in all phases of the development process; and (e) strengthen
the State of Minas Gerais' capacity to provide efficient agricultural
services to small farmers.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project would include:
construction of two state-managed irrigation schemes totalling 2,840 ha and
benefiting 750 farm families; studies for possible future irrigation
projects; construction or rehabilitation of about 170 simple rural water-
supply systems; adaptive agricultural research and basic seed production;
extension services to about 38,000 small farmers; investment credit for about
12,000 farms including 3,250 irrigated farms; marketing support services for
private traders and small farmers; funding for community subprojects; project
administration; and training. With the exception of the Xakriaba Amerindian
Reservation, there are no Amerindian or environmental issues associated with
the project, and improved land use and soil and water conservation would have
a favorable environmental impact. Overall, some 50,000 low-income rural
families in the 42 municipalities of the Northeast region of the State of
Minas Gerais would benefit from the project. In 13 of these municipalities,
land cadastral and regularization activities would be carried out under the
Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR). These 13
municipalities would receive more intensive extension and credit support.
6.        The project, to be carried out over eight years  provides funds for
civil works, equipment and furniture, rural investment credit, a development
fund for community subprojects, training, and related administrative and
operating costs on a declining basis. Thp total cost of the project is
estimated at US$113.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$16.2 million (14%). Retroactive financing of about US$2.6 million
would be provided for project expenditures (other than agricultural credit)
incurred after appraisal, but prior to loan signing. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
6669-BR dated May 26, 1987, is also attached.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's lending strategy in
Brazil aims to promote and assist structural reform; to develop and maintain
essential infrastructure; to increase the productivity and improve the living
conditions of the rural and urban poor; aad to protect the environment and
the local populations affected by the execution of investment projects. The
Government of Brazil attaches high priority to decreasing regional
disparities.  Incomes in Northeast rural areas are less than 35% of the
national average. The NRDP, of which the proposed project is a part, forms a
central part of the Government's imrestment strategy to narrow the gap
between the Northeast region and the rest of the country and to alleviate
rural poverty. Bank financing in support of the Program has already been
approved for six state projects, one of which includes regional coordination
activities, and the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project.



8.        Agreed Actions.   During negotiations, the Government agreed on the
following: (a) as conditions of loan effectiveness: satisfactory staffing
of SUDENOR and RURALMINAS' Technical Coordinating Unit; (b) as specific
conditions of disbursement: (i) for each public irrigation subproject, proof
ot land acquisition and satisfactory detailed engineering des.gns and
settlement plan; and (ii) for each additional storage facility, satisfactory
feasibility study and draft agreement between SUDENOR and the cooperative;
and (d) as other covenants: (i) availability of at least 89,000 ha, by March
31, 1989, and an-additional 93,000 ha by March 31, 1990, for redistribution
to project beneficiaries; (ii) satisfactory cost recovery provisions for
state public irrigation and domestic water supply; and (iii) close monitoring
and review of the resettlement of former non-Indian squatter families and
prompt taking of appropriate corrective measures as required to prevent
further '4uatting on the Xakriaba Amerindian Reservation.
9.        Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from increases in agricultural production as a result of:
(a) Increased productivity through better cultivation practices; (b) crop
diversification; and (c) expansion of the cropped area through irrigation and
increased use of animal traction. At full development, about 64% of the
value of yearly incremental marketable production would come from subsistence
crops, vegetables and fruits, and 36% from livestock products; the internal
rate of return is estimated at 13%. Improved domestic water supply and
community activities would also provide substantial benefits to the rural
population, especially women. Expanded agricultural activities would create
employment equivalent to some 14,000 man-years annually. Finally, improved
farming practices and soil and water conservation would have a beneficial
impact on the environment.
10.       Risks.  Possible risks include: (a) insecure land tenure;
(b) inefficient delivery of project services; (c) lack of sufficient
interinstitutional cooperation; (d) recurring droughts and cotton pest
outbreaks; and (e) delays and shortfalls in counterpart funding and credit.
The project has been designed so as to itinimize these risks. Progress will
be closely followed by Bank staff through review of annual operating plans
and improved supervtision, monitoring and evaluation. Implementation of the
Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project and the Government's
agrarian reform would increase land tenure security. Streamlined
administrative procedures, measures for institutional strengthening and
technical assistance for selected agencies would improve efficiency and
project coordination. Crop diversification and intensified technology
generation and diffusion would make farmers less vulnerable to drought and
pest outbreaks. The Government adopted new measures 'n 1986 to ensure the
timely availability of counterpart funds and credit. In addition, the
regional scope of the Northeast Program and the support the Program enjoys
among government and local leaders should help secure adequate funding and
satisfactory implementation of the proposed project.



11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
