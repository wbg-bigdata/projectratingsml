3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.1.1   The project's development objectives, as stated in the SAR, were to: (i) provide the modem energy
form of electricity to rural customers who can not be served economically or in a timely manner by
conventional rural electrification; (ii) facilitate participation by the private sector in advancing renewable
energy conmmercialization; (iii) promote environmentally sound energy resource development in Indonesia



and reduce the energy sector's dependence on fossil fuels; and (iv) strengthen Indonesia's institutional
capacity to support and sustain decentralized rural electrification using solar photovoltaics. The project's
global objective was to protect the global environment by mitigating emissions of CO in Indonesia.
3.1.2  These objectives were clear and realistic, and reflected Indonesia's as well as the Bank's priorities
for rural development and rural electrification at that time. In particular, Indonesia's Outlines of State
Policy (1993) recognized the importance of meeting the country's rapidly increasing energy requirements
efficiently - including through conservation and diversification of primary energy resources and their more
efficient utilization - and minimizing the adverse environmental impacts of energy use. Further, the GOI
viewed rural electrification as a key and integral part of rural development, and Indonesia's long-term goal
was to electrify all villages and enable the basic services provided by electricity.
3.1.3  The objectives had clear links to the Bank's prevailing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as well
as the ongoing Bank lending operations. The CAS supported energy development, including renewable
energy, and highlighted: (a) achieving poverty reduction through increased funding for regional
development, and a shift towards smaller and regionally oriented projects targeted at the reducing
urban-rural disparities in the quality of life; and (b) striking the appropriate balance between public and
private roles in energy distribution. Contemporaneous to the SHS project, the Bank also approved the
Second Rural Electrification Project (which financed grid-based rural electrification), and the Renewable
Energy Small Power Project (which financed grid-connected renewable energy power generation), and was
preparing rural/renewable energy projects targeted at Eastern Indonesia.
3.2 Revised Objective:
3.2.1  The project objectives were not revised during project implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1  The project's central elements were a private sector based and market conforming supply, delivery
and financing mechanisms, with a key role for the Government in raising technology awareness and
promoting quality equipment and performance by setting standards and certification - building upon the
positive experience with solar PV in Indonesia, while taking account of the lessons learned from the past
Bank and non-Bank experience with rural electrification and renewable energy operations.
3.3.2  The project consisted of two components, which were clearly linked to the project objectives.
*   A credit component consisting of an IBRD loan and a GEF grant. Under the credit component,
the project aimed to provide electricity to about 1 mnillion rural people in three provinces -
West Java, Lampung, and South Sulawesi - through the sale and installation of 200,000 solar
PV systems for homes, and in commercial establishments such as small shops. The sales of
SHS units would be undertaken by private enterprises ("SHS dealers"), who would extend
credit to rural households to enable them to pay for their units in regular monthly installments.
The SHS dealers would access credit, on normal commercial terms, from participating local
commercial banks ("Participating Banks" - PBs), who would refinance their loans from the
IBRD loan. The GEF grants would be provided to the SHS dealers on a per SHS unit basis,
after a unit had been sold and installed.
*  A technical assistance (TA) component, for (i) implementation support - to establish a Project
Support Group (PSG) to provide assistance to SHS dealers and end-users, to monitor and
- 2 -



evaluate project progress and to conduct limited SHS related training to government officials
and private sector organizations; (ii) policy support - to carry out and prepare a Decentralized
Rural Electrification Strategy Study and SHS Action Plan; and (iii) institutional development -
to assist GOI in building Indonesia's institutional capabilities for the dissemination of solar PV
technology.
3.4 Revised Components:
3.4.1  While the original basic components were retained during project implementation, soon after the
project became effective (October 1997), it became clear that some realignments would be needed in
response to the deterioration in the general economic situation in Indonesia.
*   Bank loan closed ahead of schedule, while GEF grant reduced and extended: As only less
than $0.1 million of the Bank loan was utilized and none was expected to be utilized in the
future, the IBRD loan was closed on January 31, 2001, fifteen months ahead of the original
schedule. The project was reconfigured as a stand-alone GEF-funded project, with the GEF
grant reduced from $24.3 million to $11 million, and the project closing extended by two years
to April 30, 2004.
*   Sales targets reduced: from the original level of 200,000 units of minimum 50 Wp to 70,000
units of minimum 30 Wp, and performance indicators were revised accordingly.
*   TA study changed: The TA for a Decentralized Rural Electrification Study and the Solar
Home System Action Plan was replaced by a Renewable Energy for Rural Transformation
Study and Action Plan. This change, arising from the increasing focus in Indonesia and the
Bank on poverty reduction, will focus the study and plan on utilizing renewable energy for
social and economic development of rural communities.
The Grant Agreement amendment reflecting the above changes became effective on June 12, 2001.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1 Quality at Entry is rated satisfactory, based on the strength of: (a) consistency of objectives with
priorities of the Govemment and Bank CAS; (b) successful experience and lessons leamed from Bank
operations and intemational experience; and (c) innovative project design with private sector participation
on a commercially oriented basis, with performance linked subsidies. The essential elements of this project
design have since been incorporated, with appropriate changes and refinements, in a number of
Bank/GEF-financed solar PV projects in Asia (Sri Lanka and China) and Africa (Uganda).
3.5.2 A QAG assessment carried out in 1998 (it was the QAG's first such assessment) rated the project's
Quality at Entry as "Good". Out of the eight areas defined by QAG for assessment, the project received
"Good" ratings in five areas, namely, project concept, objectives and approach; technical, economic and
financial aspects; environmental aspects; social and stakeholder aspects; and Bank inputs and processes.
Based on this review, the project team was honored for Excellence in Quality by the Bank senior
management in 1998.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
-3 -



4.1.1  The achievement of project objectives has been mixed.
4.1.2  On the physical side, the achievement has not been satisfactory. The project became effective in
October 1997, just as the economic crisis hit Indonesia. In the macro-economic environment of high
inflation, high interest rates, falling incomes, and uncertainty about the future, it was virtually impossible to
start new businesses that would introduce, on credit terms, a new consumer good into the rural areas.
Further, the country's financial sector was basically paralyzed, and the participating banks were unable to
provide any credit to the SHS dealers, as envisaged in the project design. Details are discussed in the
section below for Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome.
4.1.3  Consequently, the project implementation has been very slow. As of end 2000, a total of 1,349
SHS units were installed. All the installations were carried out by one dealer, instead of the 5-6 qualified
dealers identified at the appraisal; further, only one of the four top-rated participating commercial banks
has been able to provide financing, and that too of a very limited amount.
4.1.4 The supporting TA component of the project, particularly the implementation support and
institutional development activities, has been implemented satisfactorily. As a result, the foundations for the
Indonesia SHS project were successfully built, and this has provided the basis for continuing it as a
stand-alone GEF project. In addition to establishing strict technical criteria and procedures for testing and
certification of SHS units, the project has also helped develop domestic testing and certification capabilities
within the Technical Implementation Unit and Energy Technology Laboratory (LSDE) of the Indonesian
Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT). The project has also established an
effective Project Support Group (PSG) staffed with qualified personnel who carry out field audits and other
monitoring responsibilities, provide capacity building technical assistance and training to various
participants in the project. With gradual picking up of SHS sales, the project should be able to benefit fully
from these gains.
4.1.5 Although improvement of quality of life was mentioned in the SAR as an outcome, it was not a
performance indicator and the monitoring & evaluation system was not designed to collect data for this
purpose. However, beginning in 2001, the PSG will conduct baseline and impact surveys to improve the
understanding of the changes resulting from the use of SHS. These surveys are expected to generate
insights into economic and social benefits of the SHS.
4.1.6 Overall, in spite of the very slow rate of implementation of SHS sales, the project has had many
beneficial effects that go beyond the project itself. First, the relatively ambitious scale of the project and the
Bank/GEF's continued support for the project in difficult economic times has sent a clear signal to solar
PV promoters (client country governments, multilateral/bilateral agencies, NGOs) and potential solar PV
providers (international and local) that the Bank and GEF are seriously committed to solar PV in particular
and renewable energy in general. This has facilitated the preparation and implementation of similar projects
in other countries.
4.1.7 Second, some of the innovative design features of the project have since been utilized in other
Bank/GEF-financed projects. These include a transparent and simple to administer system of calculation
and payment of GEF grants to dealers, linked to market based sales performance within a commercial and
competitive framework, with a project scale that enabled a clear commercial exit strategy. This system
also provided for end-user audits to verify and monitor dealer performance. In contrast, prior to this
project, most solar PV projects used a government procurement approach, even in situations of widespread
recognition that governance structures were weak and corrupt; further, most projects had a small scale and
a technology demonstration orientation, which could not lead to a self-sustaining commercial solar PV
-4 -



market. Other features include reducing commercial risks by the provision of business development
services to potential dealers to assist them in formulating their plans, and to obtain training in direct sales,
financial management, inventory controls and other good business practices.
4.1.8  Third, project-supported activities (along with the devaluation of the rupiah) have led to a
significant decline in the international prices of some of the locally manufactured key components used in
SHS - the so-called the "balance of systems" excluding the solar PV panels. The project encouraged local
Indonesian firms to manufacture, these components, had them tested on a grant basis at international
laboratories to check whether they met the project's technical specifications, and arranged for technical
support from interested international organization to improve their quality. Two companies who were
assisted with component design and testing have, partially in response to the collapse of Indonesian markets
in 1998-99, developed export market sales. One of these companies, while still relatively small, is now the
leading international exporter of integrated balance of system components for SHS, contributing, for
example, to sales in Sri Lanka under the World Bank supported Energy Services Delivery Project and to
commercial sales in Kenya, and has received offers of second stage financing from IFC/GEF-supported
Solar Development Capital. Another company whose development has been supported has sold systems in
rural areas under the Kecamatan Development Project and other provincial and local government-supported
rural energy programs.
4.1.9 Fourth, the technical standards formulated for this project are now being used, with adaptations, in
a number of other countries (Sri Lanka, China and Uganda). Further, these standards also formed a base
for the activities of an international NGO, Photovoltaic Global Approval Program, which is developing a
widely accepted Seal and Mark of quality.
4.1.10 Fifth, technical assistance provided through the project has enabled the Photovoltaic Testing
Laboratory of BPPT to obtain ISO 25 accreditation for PV components testing. This denotes that the
laboratory has achieved intemational standing for testing and certifying balance of system components. The
laboratory has tested and certified products from the USA and the Netherlands that have been accepted for
use under the SHS project.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Credit Component:
4.2.1  The single participating dealer has sold:
* 92 SH units in 1999
*   1,257 SHS units in 2000
*   150 SHS units during January and February 2001.
The dealer has continued to expand its rural distribution in South Sulawesi and Lampung market areas, and
now has two branch offices, 13 village level site offices and 32 marketing representatives in rural locations.
Most (90%) of its sales under the project are of 40 Wp systems sold with two-year loans from the dealer at
a retail price equivalent to approximately $7.7 per Wp. A company wide training program in direct selling
methods and product knowledge was held during January 2001 with PSG assistance.
4.2.2  The results of the PSG's end-user audits of this dealer's sales have been satisfactory. The 1,168
audits completed as of early 2001 have found consistently high consumer satisfaction levels, with the main
qualification being the desire for larger systems capable of powering color televisions.

4.2.3  A second dealer submitted its business plan for approval in January 2001, and two other dealers
are in the process of preparing their business plans. An international PV marketing company is making
exploratory market entry investigations.
Technical Assistance Component:
4.2.4 Technical assistance components of the project, particularly the implementation support and
institutional development sub-components, have been successfully carried out in spite of the adverse
macroeconomic situation in Indonesia. In terms of implementation support, the PSG has successfully setup
an effective system for approving dealers, monitoring the actual performance of SHS, auditing sales data
for GEF grant release and extending technical assistance to banks and dealers (particularly on market and
business development matters).
4.2.5 In addition to establishing strict technical criteria and procedures for testing and certification of
SHS components, the project has also developed excellent in-country testing and certification capabilities
within the BPPT-LSDE. State of the art testing facilities have been installed at the BPPT-LSDE facilities
and all staff training activities have been completed on schedule. Data-loggers have also been procured for
installation in the field to monitor system performance. LSDE received ISO 25 accreditation in June 2001.
4.2.6 Under the policy support sub-component, the planned decentralized rural electrification strategy
study and SHS action plan has not been undertaken at the request of the Govenmment in light of changes
anticipated from the ongoing power sector reform. Instead, a "Renewable Energy for Rural
Transformation Study" will be carried out. The change in title and corresponding scope of work reflects a
greater recognition by the Govenmment of the critical role of modem energy in meeting the developmental
needs of rural communities. The objective of the study will be to prepare an action-oriented plan for
enhancing social and economic development of rural communities by ensuring that essential energy needs
are met using renewable energy, where appropriate.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
4.3.1 The SAR showed an IERR of 12% without and 39% with GEF payments being included as
benefits. The total costs were measured by the capital and replacement costs over the lifetime of the PV
systems, while the benefits were measured by the (i) customer payments to SHS dealers - consisting of the
down payments and the monthly installment payments needed to finance the loan over a period of four
years; and (ii) customer expenses incurred to maintain the systems. The SAR noted that the estimates of
benefits were biased downwards because of the exclusion of the consumer's surplus from the benefits.
4.3.2 The calculation of the IERR for the target of sales of 200,000 SHS units was based on the
standard approach that there would be:
- 6 -



*   Initial net negative benefits - costs exceed revenues - arising from investment costs in SHS
units, while revenues from down payments would be relatively small.
*   Later net positive benefits - revenues exceed costs - as investment costs reduce while revenues
from monthly installment payments increase.
4.3.3   During the project, the total sales were of only about 1,349 units. However, this did not have the
expected effect of depressing the IERR for two reasons. First, unlike conventional power projects where
investtnents often need to be of a significantly large minimum size - investments are "lumpy" - in SHS, the
investments are modular, and SHS dealers can reduce their investment costs in response to an anticipated
slowdown in sales. Second, in the case of this project, the macroeconomic crisis hit Indonesia in 1997 just
as the project became effective, so that the dealers were able to avoid undertaking investments in SHS units
until economic conditions improved.
4.3.4 When economic conditions did improve in mid 1999, the solitary participating dealer focused on
the least risky segment, i.e., the "upper end", of the potential market - where it was possible to recoup the
investmnents quickly, and there were good prospects of significant profits. In the uncertain economic
environment prevailing at that time, and given the novelty of SHS sales in the selected provinces, this was a
prudent strategy that gave the dealer a workable entry point into the SHS business, even though it did limit
the total SHS sales that could be achieved.
4.3.5  The outcome of this strategy was that, on an annual basis, there was no negative cash flow in either
of the two years in which SHS sales took place - the dealer made good profits which has encouraged him to
expand the business, and also attracted other potential dealers into the business. Given the positive cash
flow in each year, i.e., in the absence of an initial negative cash flow, it is not possible to calculate an IERR
for the few sales that actually took place.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1. The project's institutional development impact is substantial. The project has successfully helped
strengthen BPPT-LSDE's capability to technically certify SHS by carrying out system testing as well as
product testing, and to monitor systems in the field. The testing and certification facility at BPPT-LSDE
has been successfully installed and is currently operational. All proposed training activities for staff of
BPPT-LSDE have also been successfully carried out. As noted above, as a direct result of the project's
support, LSDE was awarded ISO 25 accreditation in June 2001 - which goes beyond the original TA that
required only a plan to be prepared for obtaining accreditation.
4.5.2  In addition, institutional strengthening services have also been extended by PSG to other
stakeholders such as participating banks and dealers/suppliers. For participating banks, the focus has been
to familiarize them with the SHS technology, the market being targeted and how to handle loans for SHS
vendors and isolated rural end-users. For SHS dealers/suppliers, particular attention has been given on
market and business development, e.g., business model development, business plan elaboration, training of
marketing, technical and credit staff, developing linkages with financial sources).

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1  Banking sector crisis blocked entry of dealers into project. In late 1997, when the project
became effective, Indonesia was engulfed in a deepening economic and political crisis. The near total
paralysis of the financial sector largely blocked implementation of the credit component up to mid-2000.
The entry of SHS dealers into the project requires a credit agreement with a participating bank (PB). Two
of the expected PBs were prevented by their financial situations from participating, while the other two PBs
were not able to issue fresh credits until their recapitalization were completed in May and June 2000. A
condition of a cash deposit equivalent to 100% of the face value of the credit was the basis of the two PBs
to offer credits to SHS dealers. Only one dealer was able to accept such offer.
5.1.2 Market collapse, depreciation, and other factors reduced the affordability of SHS, sales
plunmneted, the one successful dealer went out of business. With SHS dealers unable to borrow from
the banks, the dealers were unable to offer any significant credit to their customers, which was a main
strategy of the project to increase affordability. At the same time, sharp depreciation of the Rupiah
contributed to a significant increase in the retail prices of SHS units. At appraisal in September 1996, the
Indonesian Rupiah was valued at Rp. 2,341/US$; by January 1998, it had declined to Rp. 17,000/US$.
The SHS retail price rose from Rp. 1.0 mnillion at appraisal to more than Rp. 4.0 million in mid 1998.
Consumers willingness and ability to pay were reduced by increase in prices of many essentials. During
1998, there were no reported commercial sales of SHS units; the only dealer whose established SHS
business had been based on consumer credit was out of business in end 1998. The fall in the Rupiah value
had cut the dollar value of the one PV dealer's some 5,000 customer accounts by more than 75%. This
company subsequently went out of business.
5.1.3  Proactive actions by project team have kept the project going. To some extent, the above
adverse impacts on PV market and the project were offset by the effective and proactive supervision
approach of the Bank project team and the PSG, which has resulted in a realignment of the project. QAG
found the overall quality of Bank supervision effort to be highly satisfactory: "The performance of the
Bank supervision team was notable in its commitment to focus on ultimate development effectiveness and
not merely the mechanical implementation of the project as initially designed." Without these efforts, the
project would most likely have been ended as a matter of routine portfolio adjustment in response to the
macroeconomic crisis, which would result in a loss of the market momentum that is currently building and
also a loss of the benefits that have accrued in the technical and institutional capacity that has been built up
in the country.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.2.1  Continuing subsidies for kerosene and diesel lowered the competitiveness of SHS. The
competitiveness of SHS versus kerosene (e.g., for lighting using a petromax) and versus diesel for
operating a small genset, and versus battery charging by a grid-connected station or at an isolated diesel
has weakened, as fuel and electricity tariff subsidies have been maintained. In comparison with the 400%
increase (in rupiah terms) in the price of an SHS, by the end of 1999, the retails prices of kerosene and
diesel, which were Rp. 250 and Rp. 380 per liter in 1997, had risen to Rp. 280 and Rp. 600, or 12% and
58% higher respectively.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
- 8 -



5.3.1 A Project Support Group (PSG) has been established and it is providing effective business
development services, conducting end user verifications and ensuring transparent grant releases.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1  The estimated total project cost at appraisal was US$118.1 million, including the IBRD loan ($20
million), the GEF grant ($24.3 million), and the local counterpart funding from GOI/BPPT ($1.5 million),
the participating banks (5.0 million), the subborrowers (dealers) and end-users ($67.3 million).
5.4.2  The actual/latest estimate up to the Bank loan closure shows that the project cost was $3.4 million,
only 2.9% of the original estimate. This is in line with the much delayed project implementation and very
low level of the Bank loan/GEF fund utilization. This $3.4 rnillion total cost consists of: $0.1 million of the
Bank loan, $2.3 million of GEF grant, $0.3 million of GOIl/BPPT contribution, $0.1 million from the
participating banks, and $0.6 million from dealers/endusers.
5.4.3 Out of the Bank loan, two partial loan proceeds cancellations were made, one in August 1998 with
an amount of $2.5 million and the other in December 1999 in the amount of $17.0 million, which reduced
the loan amount from the original $20 million to $0.5 million. Out of the net loan amount, $0.08 million
have been disbursed, and the balance ($0.42 million) has been canceled upon closure of the loan account.
The two partial loan proceeds cancellations were part of a broader restructuring of the IBRD loan portfolio
for Indonesia in responding to the economic crisis and no commercial bank demand of the IBRD loan. The
local funds mobilization rate of the banks is 10.6-12.7%, while the refinancing rate of the IBRD loan
funds, which is linked to the rate for the three-month SBI, is 13.6% (September 2000). Also, there is less
demand for commercial bank credit by the SHS dealers, as they have shifted strategies to lower their
exposure to currency and inflation risks, namely by using longer deferred payment trade credit from
suppliers, a higher rate of self financing, revised consumer credit arrangements (based on a higher
percentage down payment and terms of 12 - 24 months rather than 48 months), sales of smaller size, more
affordable units, and a larger proportion of cash sales.
5.4.4 As a result of the project realignment in early 2001, the GEF grant has been reduced from the
original amount of $24.3 million to $11.0 million, of which, $5.7 million as grants to dealers and $5.3
mnillion to fund various technical assistance activities. As of the Bank loan closure, $2.3 mnillion of GEF
grant has been disbursed.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
6.1.1  In spite of the past slow implementation rate, and the continuing economic uncertainties in
Indonesia, the project sustainability is rated as likely for a number of reasons. First, as a result of the GEF
support, considerable capacity has been developed and a solid base for future SHS development has been
established. Significant commercial sales of SHS were recorded in 2000, and the momentum is expected to
continue in 2001 and thereafter. Second, the need and increasing demand for SHS in target markets is
clear. The increased demand stems from two main causes: (a) greater realization by unelectrified
consumers that PLN is unlikely to provide grid electricity services in the foreseeable future; (b) increased
rupiah income of farmers growing export crops in Lampung and South Sulawesi. The pace of household
grid-based rural electrification has slowed in Indonesia from 1.8 million consumers/year to about one tenth
this rate, thus effectively reducing the competition from potential grid extension in the future.
-9-



6.1.2  Third, one dealer aggressively entered the market and its success during 2000 has had high
example-setting value for market development, encouraging other companies to enter in 2001. Fourth,
participating commercial banks have showed a renewed interest in providing credit for SHS sales.
Adjustments made to the project design in response to market conditions have maintained affordability and
increased the interest of dealers and banks. Fifth, national quality standards and certification procedures,
domestic testing and certification capabilities to ISO 25 standards have been established, and quality
certified products from several local suppliers at intemationally competitive prices are available. One of
the qualified suppliers has become a major exporter of SHS lights and controllers on the basis of support
provided and quality certifications awarded under the project.
6.1.3 Nonetheless, this is a market-based project, and sustainability will be largely determined by market
conditions and the overall business environment, including improvements in the frameworks for enforcing
contracts and for transparency in official transactions, which affect the willingness to invest.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1  With continued GEF support to April 2004, it is anticipated that enough dealers and banks would
participate, dealer distribution infrastructure investments would continue to grow to support market
expansion and consumer service. The PSG will continue the business capacity building and quality and
service compliance monitoring, which is important to building the confidence of the banks and consumers.
6.2.2  During the extended GEF support, it is expected that appropriate transition arrangements to the
post-project phase would be provided. Specifically, support will be given to strengthen dealers' intemal
controls, marketing, business and technical capabilities. The support will assist companies link with
commercial investors and funding sources, including the Solar Development Capital which is currently
discussing investments in three of the companies that have participated in the project. Under the
restructured project, the grant levels will scale down over the balance period of implementation, and this is
expected to contribute to the companies' transitions to fully commercial operation.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
7.1.1  Bank performance can be rated as highly satisfactory. As mentioned earlier, the project was rated
"Good" by QAG at its first assessment of Quality-at-Entry in 1998. The project design was creative with
private sector participation mechanism. The risks were properly identified and relevant.
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1  Bank performance for project supervision can be rated as highly satisfactory. The project
supervision was rated "Superior" by QAG in its Second Rapid Supervision Assessment (RSA2) which
assessed the quality of Bank's supervision in FY98. RSA2 sampled 200 projects across the Bank. SHS
was among the 27 projects (of which 6 were in EAP) identified as having been particularly well supervised
in FY98. The project supervision was rated "Highly Satisfactory" by QAG in its QSA4 in FY2000.
7.2.2  The Bank team paid particular attention to project sustainability, not merely the mechanical
- 10-



implementation of the project as initially designed. During mid-2000, the Bank and GOI assessed progress
and prospects to achieve the project's development objectives in light of the financial/banking crisis, and
concluded that prospects were limited. The Bank team then recommended to management to agree to
canceling nearly all the line of credit and advancing the closing date for the loan and GEF grant to January
2001. The Bank team then initiated an orderly closing down of the project with concurrence of Bank
management. However, the Bank team kept in close contact with the SHS dealers and the PSG which kept
on working towards the institutional and market development goals. By the time of October 2000 mission,
market conditions appeared to have improved significantly and, new, independent assessments suggested
that there are good prospects for meeting GEF development objectives, even if there is little interest in
drawing down the Bank loan. Finally, the Bank agreed to the client's request to keep the GEF grant open
as originally scheduled, while closing close the Bank loan on January 31, 2001, fifteen months ahead of the
original closing date (April 30, 2002). The project has subsequently been realigned as a free-standing GEF
operation with a new closing date of April 30, 2004.
7.2.3 Procurement of SHS units was handled under commercial practices which has resulted in lowest
unit price in the area, an example of best practice. The Bank team has enjoyed continuity, an appropriate
skill mix to suit the nature of the project. The supervision reporting has been complete and candid in all
aspects. The supervision record indicated that the client clearly benefited from Bank technical assistance
under supervision, and the relationship with the client is open and effective.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
7.3.1  Overall Bank performance during the project cycle can be rated as highly satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1  The Borrower's performance in lending is assessed as satisfactory. There was close cooperation at
the time of preparation between the Government and the Bank, and the leadership and vision provided by
the main counterparts in GOI ensured that the project was appropriate to Indonesia's needs.
Representatives from all the counterpart agencies and private sector were involved in the preparation of the
project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1 The performance of BPPT, the government implementing agency and main recipient of the
technical assistance of the project is deemed satisfactory, as it was able to successfully meet (even exceed)
the objectives it was directly responsible for. The performance of DGEEU, another government
implementing agency, is also deemed as satisfactory, notwithstanding the protracted delay in can-ying out a
policy study. In light of the anticipated power sector reform, agreement has been reached with DGEEU to
conduct the study under a new title and with corresponding changed scope of work. Such change reflects a
greater recognition by DEGGU of the critical role of modem energy in meeting the development needs of
rural communities.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1  The performance of the private sector participants (dealers, banks) is considered unsatisfactory
because of the slow progress of the SHS sales, weak investment in rural distribution networks and inability
of the banks to make loans to SHS dealers, although such was caused mainly by factors beyond their
- 11 -



control, including the collapse of the banking sector, civil unrest and the sharp depreciation of Rupiah.
7.6.2 On the other hand, the performance of PSG is highly satisfactory. It has provided high quality
services to various participants under the project as noted previously.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
7.7.1  The overall borrower performance is deemed satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1    Market-based projects should provide broad scope for companies to adjust product lines and
business models to meet changing market signals. The thrust of the changes and the eventual
realignment of the project were to increase the scope and time for companies to adjust products and
business models in response to changing market conditions. The dealers responded with product lines that
maintained affordability and a variety of revised business models in line with local capabilities and
opportunities.
8.2    Significant market entry support for firms as well as performance based grants that scale
down over time are necessary. While the project design did provide for upstream business planning and
promotion assistance, the emphasis was on performance-based grants to companies after the sales and
installations of systems. In practice, the support for business planning and market development has been
greater than anticipated, given the steep learning curve and high market entry costs. This type of upstream,
cost-shared support is necessary to assist induce the market entry of dealers and assist them to develop
distribution operations in remote areas. Also, the performance-based grant initially was to remain at the
sarne level for the life of the project. This was insufficient to induce companies to develop sales in the early
years, and would likely be an insufficient basis for them to transition to a fully commercial operation at the
end of the project. The project realignment provides for a scaling down of the grant level over time, with
some flexibility linked to the pace of market development.
8.3    A convincing end-user audit program and transparent grant releases encourages dealers to
participate in the project and follow the consumer protection requirements. The SHS project has a
strong, independent end-user audit facility and assists the dealer with the processing of their performance
based grants. The end-user audit facility, in addition to ensuring compliance with consumer protection
requirements, assures that there will be fair competition among the companies. The arrangements for
transparent grant releases minimize the time and transactions costs of the companies, encouraging them to
focus their learning and marketing efforts on rural consumers, rather than on processing paperwork for
grant payments.
8.4    Upstream and monitoring support to financial organizations is necessary to increase their
knowledge of the sector. The high costs of market entry that confront dealers are mirrored by the costs
that confront organizations that would finance them, especially the high costs of informnation about the
market and dealer performance in remote rural areas beyond the reach of the branch networks of Indonesia'
s financial institutions. Facilitating initial field visits and providing information on dealers and sales
performance, much of which is generated as a by-product of the end-user audits, reduces the transaction
costs of financial institutions, thus partially lowering a barrier to their financing of SHS dealers.
8.5    A cross sectoral approach focused on both the consumer and institutional PV markets
provides greater potential for sustainability and development impacts. The main emphasis originally
- 12 -



was on sales of SHS to rural households. While the evidence for this lesson is not yet significant, the
realigned project, with its shift to a per Wp grant basis, provides the basis for sales to community based
projects of varying scale. With the community driven development approaches, this is an opportunity for
dealers to increase sales volurnes in areas in which they have sales and service networks. It is also an
opportunity to spread the development benefits to families that may not be able to afford to purchase an
individual household unit. Weak procurement methods and the application of other subsidies, often
bilateral, for PV through institutional channels have often had negative impacts on market development.
But with competitive arrangements and community driven approaches, there is scope for
institutional/community sales to contribute to the development of a sustainable PV market.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
As the Project is continuing under the GEF financing, Borrower comments were not sought at this time, nor
was the Borrower invited to prepare its own separate evaluation. When the project is fully completed in
2004, a more comprehensive ICR will be prepared, with comments from the borrower, implementing
agencies, local participating banks, private dealers, and end-users. Borrower will also be invited to prepare
its own evaluation report at that time.
(b) Cofinanciers:
