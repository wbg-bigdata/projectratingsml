withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish 
to the Bank a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the 
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account

Page  17
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower shall

Borrower shall have requested and as shall have 
been shown by 
said documents and other evidence to have been paid out of the

Category, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the 
Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the Project, shall equal the equivalent 
of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Category shall follow such procedures as the Bank 
shall specify by notice
to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent 
that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in 
the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments 
for eligible expenditures.

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account:

was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the 
Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as 
the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the 
Special Account (or, if the Bank 
shall so request, refund to the Bank) an

payment or the portion thereof 
not so eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank

shall 
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)

in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for eligible 
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the
