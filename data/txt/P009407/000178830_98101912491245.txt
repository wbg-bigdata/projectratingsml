CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
In August 1979 the Bangladesh Taka was officially devalued
relative to the Pound Sterling, to a rate of Tk 34.7 to the Pound. Since
then the Taka exchange rate has been determined through a basket of major
currencies, with the Pound Sterling as the reference currency. Consequently,
the Taka-US dollar rate has been subject to change. The rates below have
been used throughout this report except when otherwise stated.
US$1         =   Tk 15.5
Tk 1         =   US$0.065
Tk 1 million =   US$64,516

APPRAISAL OF THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Bangladesh (the Government) has requested an
IDA credit of US$29 million to finance (i) the rehabilitation of the three
operating fertilizer plants at Ghorasal, Chittagong and Fenchuganj (the Plant
Improvement Component); (ii) the setting up of training facilities at Ghorasal
(the Training Component); and (iii) the essential spare parts, catalysts and
chemicals needs of the fertilizer industry for about two years (the Spares,
Catalysts and Chemicals Component). The plants to be rehabilitated (Map
IBRD-14866) are at present operated by the Bangladesh Chemical Industries
Corporation (BCIC), a wholly government-owned corporation. The Government,
however, is implementing steps to form the three fertilizer plants into
separate corporate entities retaining BCIC's overall coordination role (para
4.09). The proposed IDA credit of US$29 million would include US$19.7 million
for the Plant Improvement Component covering along with Dutch assistance of
DFl 10 million (equivalent of US$4.7 million) all of the estimated foreign
exchange needs and about 75% of the estimated total financing requirements
(excluding taxes and duties) of US$32.3 million; US$1 million for the Training
Component covering 100% of the foreign and local costs; and US$8.3 million
covering 100% of the estimated import needs of the Spares, Catalysts and
Chemicals Component. The-remaining Project financing would be provided by
the Government.
1.02      The Project includes additions and replacements of equipment and
plant modifications as well as the provision of maintenance and other imported
materials at the three fertilizer plants to enable them to operate at close
to their rated capacities and to minimize losses in production due to plant
interruptions. Due to the nature of the Project, the investment required for
an additional annual ton of fertilizer production will be significantly lower
than for building fresh additional capacity. The proposed training facilities
at Ghorasal are crucial to help ensure an adequate and competent work force
for the operation of the fertilizer plants in Bangladesh.
1.03      The proposed credit is to finance one of three operations under con-
sideration by IDA to assist the Bangladesh fertilizer sector. The other two
now under appraisal would (i) provide a fertilizer import credit which is to
include a component to ensure timely supply of rock phosphate and sulfur to
the Chittagong Triple Superphosphate (TSP) plant; and (ii) improve the trans-
portation facilities required for inland fertilizer movement and distribution.
1.04      The Project was identified in July 1979 by a mission consisting of
Messrs. H.P. Gassner of South Asia Programs Department and S. Venkataraman of
the Industrial Projects Department, and appraised in October 1979 by Messrs.
K. M. Loos and S. Venkataraman (mission chief) of the Industrial Projects
Department.

II. THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A.   Existing Plants
2.01      Domestic fertilizer production started in Bangladesh with the
commissioning of the Fenchuganj plant in 1961 for the production of urea and
ammonium sulfate. Two other plants have since then been set up, one at Ghorasal
in 1970 for the production of urea and the other at Chittagong in 1969/70 for
the production of TSP.  The three plants have a combined installed capacity
of 489,500 tons per year (tpy) of urea, 13,200 tpy of ammonium sulfate and
152,000 tpy of TSP. The installed nutrient capacity corresponds to 228,000
tpy of nitrogen and 70,000 tpy of P 0 5.  The nitrogen production is based on
abundant domestic natural gas and tAe sulfate and the phosphatic production on
imported sulfur currently being procured from Iraq and rock phosphate currently
being procured from Jordan and Morocco.
2.02      Capacity utilization achieved by the Fenchuganj plant was close
to 90% during its first nine years of operation but declined after 1971.
Following a rehabilitation program completed in 1978, production has sub-
stantially improved since :979. The Ghorasal plant faced difficulties from
the beginning and a serious explosion in late 1974 put the plant out of
commission for most of 1975. Production has recently improved; the FY1979
average capacity utilization of 63% corresponded to 80% of the capacity for
the ten months during which the plant was in operation in FY1979. The
Chittagong plant, though completed before Bangladesh's independence in
1969/70, began trial runs only in 1974 and 1975 and has been facing technical
problems and raw material shortages. Despite recent improvements its annual
production is unlikely to exceed 60% of rated capacity. All the above plants
are owned and operated by BCIC, with fertilizer accounting for about 40% of
the BCIC production (para 4.01).
B.   Additional Capacity
2.03      A large fertilizer plant with an installed capacity of 528,000 tpy
of urea is currently under construction at Ashuganj. The plant was initially
financed with the assistance of seven international and national agencies:
IDA, ADB, USAID, ODA, Government of Iran, KfW and Government of Switzerland
(Report No. 598-BD dated December 18, 1974). The Project encountered substan-
tial delays and cost overruns and the Association, together with most of the
other original lenders, along with EEC, IFAD and OPEC Special Fund, helped
to cover the foreign exchange cost increase, with the Government providing
the additional local financing required (Report No. P-25-68-BD dated May 18,
1979). Construction is now progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be
completed within the revised time schedule (March 1981) and only slightly over
the cost as presented to the Executive Directors in May 1979.
2.04      During the Ashuganj project appraisal the Government and the lenders
agreed that it would be preferable to create a new entity which could devote
its full attention to the implementation of the project. Subsequently, a new
government-owned company, the Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical Company (AFCC),



- 3 -
was formed to construct, own and operate the facilities. In extension of this
principle, the Government now intends to transform the three existing plants,
to be rehabilitated under the proposed Project, into separate corporate
entities (para 4.09). At the time of the Ashuganj appraisal, the need to
identify and implement measures to improve production from the existing plants
was also recognized and IDA financed studies for this purpose under the First
and Second Technical Assistance Credits (Credit No. 409-BD dated June 29, 1973
and Credit No. 622-BD dated April 8, 1976). The final recommendations form-
ulated by the consultants in August 1979 form the basis for the proposed Project.
2.05      Presently BCIC is setting up further new facilities at Ghorasal for
the production of 100,000 tpy of urea with technical and financing assistance
from the Peoples' Republic of China. The plant is expected to come on stream
by early 1984. The Government is also considering construction of another
large fertilizer plant at Chittagong which is to have an installed capacity
of 561,000 tpy of urea. This project is expected to be implemented by a new
company with possible private equity, both local and foreign. The lender
assistance for the Chittagong project is being coordinated by ADB. IDA
has reviewed the project and indicated willingness, in principle, to consider
cofinancing if requested in time to permit staff participation in preappraisal
and appraisal. IFC has also been approached by the Government to assist in
identifying possible private equity participation. The Chittagong urea plant
is now expected to start implementation in mid-1981 and be in operation by
late 1985.
2.06      With expected implementation of these projects, Bangladesh would
have an installed capacity by 1985 of about 1.63 million tpy of urea, 13,200
tpy of ammonium sulfate and 152,000 tpy of TSP, corresponding to 753,000 tpy
of nitrogen or about 240% above the country's present nitrogen capacity.
There would however be no change in the phosphate capacity. The four signi-
ficant factors that will affect the performance of all the fertilizer plants
in achieving capacity production are (i) removing current bottlenecks to
efficient production (which is to be achieved under the proposed Project);
(ii) adequacy of the factory gate fertilizer prices to ensure reasonable cash
flow; (iii) adequate foreign exchange availability to procure the required raw
materials--rock phosphate and sulfur--and the spares and components needed to
maintain the plants in good condition; and (iv) availability of a well-trained
and competent work force. These factors are discussed below.
C.   Factory Gate Fertilizer Prices
2.07      The fertilizer produced by BCIC is pooled with imported fertilizers
and distributed by the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC).
The domestic product is taken over by BADC at a transfer price fixed by the
Government on the basis of BCIC's costs. The Government-fixed price is
intended to cover budgeted cash costs, depreciation and a profit element.
Adequate pricing norms have not, however, been clearly defined especially
for determining an appropriate capital base and return criteria. The prices,
though periodically revised, lag behind changes in costs of inputs by several
months, often with substantial adverse impact on producer's cash flow and
operations.



2.08      Under the Ashugani Fertilizer Project (Credit No. 527-BD), the
Government is required to establish an ex-factory urea sales price which
will enable AFCC to earn a reasonable return after taxes on its net worth
after meeting all costs including depreciation and interest on debt. A
reasonable basis for the above purpose is to establish the fertilizer prices
at a production level corresponding to 80% of the plant's installed capacity.
However, during the two initial years of operation of the new plant and until
the rehabilitation measures in the three existing plants are implemented, the
pricing could be based on realistically achievable production levels. This
would provide the plants the required cash flow and also adequate incentives
to improve their profitability through better performance. The Government
has agreed to review at least once each year the ex-factory fertilizer prices
of the three existing plants and establish the prices for each plant for the
following year to obtain revenues sufficient to cover operating and adminis-
trative expenses including adequate provision for maintenance and deprecia-
tion and provide a minimum return of 10% on the equity after interest on
borrowings and taxes. For purposes of determining the fertilizer prices,
the equity will be determined as net fixed assets, suitably revalued from
time to time, plus current assets for normal operation less accounts payable
and borrowings. The Government has also agreed to extend the above pricing
mechanism to the Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemicals Company.
D.   Foreign Exchange Constraint
2.09      An important factor affecting the operations of the existing fer-
tilizer plants has been the uncertain and often inadequate availability of
foreign currency funds for the import of raw materials, sulfur and rock
phosphate as well as spares and components. As a result, the Chittagong TSP
plant remained idle for several days in 1979 due to lack of raw materials
and all the fertilizer plants have had inadequate preventive maintenance.
As noted previously, the Chittagong TSP plant operates on imported rock
phosphate and sulfur and with production at 80% of nameplate capacity,
requires imports of about 200,000 tons of rock phosphate and about 44,000 tons
of sulfur annually. The foreign exchange required for the purchase of these
raw materials at the above production level will be about US$20 million per
year (in 1979 dollars). In addition, due to the relatively underdeveloped
Bangladesh industrial sector, the fertilizer plants need to import spares
and components, catalysts and various other chemicals (such as caustic potash
and arsenic oxide). The annual import costs of these materials is estimated
at US$4.0 million (in 1979 dollars). In addition, when commissioned, the
Ashuganj plant will require imports of similar materials at an annual cost
of about US$3.0 million. While a large part of the spares and components
will have to come from the original equipment suppliers, the catalysts and
chemicals are competitively procured internationally.
2.10      IDA has, in a series of program credits, provided foreign currency
to finance the import of fertilizer raw materials, spares and components.
As part of the Eighth Program Credit (Report No. P-2664-BD dated January 22,
1980) approved in February 1980, the Association will provide up to US$10
million for the same purpose. Additional financing for fertilizer raw mate-
rials is under consideration as part of a proposed fertilizer imports credit.
To assure adequate availability of spare parts, catalysts and chemicals beyond



- 5 -
the period intended to be covered under the Eighth Program Credit, the
credit presented here includes US$8.3 million to cover about two years'
import requirements. For this purpose, BCIC will prepare before December 31,
1980 a maintenance program satisfactory to the Association, and the new
fertilizer companies will carry it out in accordance with appropriate
engineering standards and practices. The preparation of the maintenance
program will be a condition of disbursement of the spares, catalysts and
chemicals component. The annual foreign exchange requirements of US$24
million to cover the operational import requirements of the existing plants
will contribute fertilizer production of about US$100 million in value based
on present fertilizer CIF prices. The Government has agreed to take all
necessary steps to ensure adequate and continuing provision of foreign
exchange funds to meet the plants' requirements for imported raw materials,
spares, catalysts and chemicals.
E.   Staffing and Training
2.11      The three existing fertilizer plants have a total employment of
about 3,600, about half of them with technical skills. The limited avail-
ability of experienced plant operators and technicians due to the low
Bangladesh industrial base continues to affect the performance of these
units adversely. The absence of an adequate program and related facilities
to hire and train skilled workers in required numbers has been an important
constraint. The problem is further aggravated by the low salary levels
allowed in the government-owned corporations and the drain of skilled workers
to much higher paying jobs in the Middle East. The drain of trained technical
personnel, which had stabilized after initial large departures, is once again
causing concern to the plant managements. During early 1980 alone, the three
existing plants and AFCC are expected to lose about 200 technicians to the
Middle East. While the Ghorasal unit is now implementing a training program,
the facilities and the training plans are still inadequate.
2.12      Under a UNDP financed project, a contract has been signed with
UNICO International of Japan (UNICO) to provide operations assistance to the
Ghorasal and Chittagong plants. This project provides technical management
assistance to develop the BCIC management skills and will train each year
approximately 4 managerial, 7 supervisory, 14 skilled technical and 25
operative staff. In addition, the project includes training advisers who
will assist BCIC in developing proposals for the setting up of an adequate
training center and in assessing the equipment and facilities needed for the
purpose. In addition, the Ashuganj Credit (Credit No. 527-BD) and the IFAD
Credit (Credit 31-BA) have provided funds for the import of training aids
to be used initially for training technicians for the Ashuganj project and
later to be made available for training technicians for the other fertilizer
plants. Since the UNDP project does not finance the setting up of the train-
ing center, the Government has requested IDA financing under the proposed
Credit. Thus the proposed training component would complement the assistance
provided to Bangladesh in this crucial area through other UNDP and IDA projects.
2.13      While the setting up of the training facilities will improve the
available Bangladesh skills, it will be possible to increase and adjust the
training plans and maintain an adequate work force in the fertilizer plants
only if annual staff losses are limited to a small part of total availability
and are spread over the various skill levels and over time reasonably evenly.
While the high salaries available in the Middle East are an important factor



- 6 -
in attracting Bangladesh's skilled manpower, the plant managements are also
concerned with the Government decision to maintain government-owned company
pay scales on par with those of the civil service. This is especially serious
since promotion opportunities within the fertilizer companies are limited.
Under similar circumstances elsewhere, incentives to skilled technicians are
offered in the form of a special allowance linked to different skill levels.
2.14      In the proposed Credit documents, BCIC has agreed to furnish its
detailed training plans for review by the Association before December 31,
1980. Completion of training plans acceptable to the Association will be a
condition of disbursement of the training component. Further, the Government
has agreed to introduce procedures and schedules governing the recruitment
of fertilizer technicians and engineers from Bangladesh to work abroad. For
this purpose, the Government will require newly recruited and trained fertil-
izer technicians and engineers to continue in service in Government-owned
plants for an appropriate period. The Government will also take measures to
minimize, with the cooperation of relevant agencies, the departure of
fertilizer technicians and engineers to such numbers as can reasonably be
replaced without adversely affecting the operation of the fertilizer plants.
BCIC has agreed that the three fertilizer plants will establish by December
31, 1980 and maintain subsequently an appropriate program of incentives for
their skilled technicians in order to retain them in service.
III. FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
3.01      The proposed Project, aimed at improving production by the existing
fertilizer plants, will add to domestic supply about 68,000 tpy of urea and
31,000 tpy of TSP. Since the additional supply will form only about 5% to
6% of Bangladesh's 1985 demand and the country can be expected to remain a
significant importer of fertilizer for years to come, this section reviews
Bangladesh's fertilizer market only briefly. Also, detailed review of the
fertilizer market and marketing aspects is contained in Report No. P-2588-BD
of June 8, 1979 (Fertilizer Imports Credit) and therefore fertilizer market
and marketing has not been discussed in detail in this report.
3.02      The agriculture sector dominates the Bangladesh economy.  In 1979
it accounted for 55% of the GDP, 75% of the total employment and over 80%
of the country's exports. Bangladesh's agriculture is characterized by the
predominance of rice, which forms about 80% of the gross cropped area and has
a high cropping intensity, generally averaging 135%. Thus increased food
production required to achieve self-sufficiency even at a relatively low
nutritional level will have to come mainly from higher yields which, in turn,
depend mostly on the increased and complementary use of inputs such as fertil-
izers, irrigation, high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, pesticides and improved
cultivation/farm management techniques. To achieve and maintain a 3.5-4.0%
agricultural production growth rate required in Bangladesh as an absolute
minimum, fertilizer application will have to increase by about 15% per year.
Surveys in 1978 indicated that fertilizer is used by as many as 64% of the
owner-cultivators and between 43% and 63% of the tenants. Since fertilizer
application techniques are relatively simple and the results well known to
most Bangladesh farmers, the above growth rates are considered achievable.



- 7-
A.   Fertilizer Consumption/Demand
3.03      Past Consumption.  Use of chemical fertilizers in Bangladesh started
in 1958. Fertilizer consumption has grown rapidly since the formation in 1962
of the East Pakistan Agricultural Development Corporation--now the Bangladesh
Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC). Urea accounts for 62% of the
fertilizer consumption, wtth TSP and diammonium phosphate (DAP) forming 29%
and potash 9%. Urea is the main nitrogenous fertilizer used, except for small
tonnages of ammonium sulfate used mainly in tea plantations. Since 1966,
fertilizer consumption has been increasing at an annual average rate of 16%,
as indicated in the table below and Annex 3.

Between FY77 and FY78, total fertilizer consumption increased by 40% due
to improved paddy support pricing and the Government's promotional efforts.
Actual consumption in FY79 was about 740,000 tons of product, well below the
earlier projected figure of 900,000 tons due to severe drought in that year
when fertilizer application levels were below normal under the excessively
dry soil conditions. With this unexpectedly sharp drop in consumption
growth, the mid-1979 stocks were about 370,000 tons of product resulting
in inadequate storage capacity to handle the additional imports ordered
previously and domestic production. Fertilizer consumption growth continued
to be depressed by drought conditions during early FY80.
3.04      Future Demand.  The estimated demand for FY80 for all fertilizers
is between 850,000-900,000 tons, though the BADC target is 1,000,000 tons.
The projected offtake for FY81 ranges between 1.05 and 1.15 million tons with
urea forming about 61% of total demand, TSP/DAP about 31% and the remaining 8%
being made up of potash. Based on historical trends and planned agricultural
irrigation programs, demand for all fertilizers and urea is projected to
increase by about 15% per annum between FY81 to FY85, and by at least 10% per
annum during the rest of the decade as shown in the following table. This
would compare to actual growth rates for urea (para 3.03) of 14.6% during
FY66-79 and 15.7% during FY76-79 and even slightly higher growth rates reached
for all fertilizers combined. The projected consumption of all fertilizers
in FY85 is slightly lower than the latest Planning Commission estimates.
The Planning Commission, however, expects the nitrogen demand growth rate to
be significantly lower than the average for all fertilizers, which appears
unlikely.

The urea requirements based on these assumptions would be about 1.13 million
tons by FY85 and 1.80 million tons by FY90. The present use of phosphatics
forms about 31% of the total fertilizer product. Even if the phosphate
consumption grows only at the same rate as that of urea, maintaining the
present ratio with nitrogenous fertilizers, the TSP/DAP consumption could
reach 574,000 tpy by FY85 and 924,000 tpy by FY90.
B.   Fertilizer Supply
3.05      Past.  Before independence of Bangladesh, local supplies were
limited to production from the Fenchuganj plant with annual production capa-
cities of 115,500 tons of urea and 13,200 tons of ammonium sulfate. Since
then, as mentioned, the plants at Ghorasal and Chittagong have been completed.
Production, however, has been erratic and well below the rated capacities
(paras 4.11 to 4.29). In FY79, the best production year in the recent past,
local production reached 55% of rated capacity. Against BCIC's target
production in FY80 of 449,000 tons (about 69% of rated capacity), the actual
production in the first six months was 218,000 tons, or about 67% of the
capacity, despite some reduction in production due to the inability of BADC to
move the fertilizer because of the transport priority assigned by the Govern-
ment to emergency food distribution and the inadequate raw material supplies.
Revised projections of FY80 local supply indicate that it should reach about
430,000 tons, giving a 65% capacity utilization rate for the industry.
3.06      Future.  The shortfall in supply continues to be met by large
imports which are expected to be close to 600,000 product tons in FY80,
despite the reduced offtake due to drought in the early part of the year.
With the completion of the large new projects at Ashuganj and Chittagong,
assuming satisfactory operation of the existing plants at Ghorasal, Chittagong
and Fenchuganj and excluding any additional fertilizer production facilities
that may be set up, domestic supply of urea is expected to increase to about
930,000 tons by FY85 (82% of the projected demand) and 1.30 million tons by
FY90 (77% of the projected demand), based on an average capacity utilization
of 80%. The expected TSP production of about 122,000 tpy would be equivalent
to about 21% of the FY85 projected TSP/DAP consumption. The future fertilizer
supply and demand balance based on the above assumptions is given in the table
below:

C.   Fertilizer Sales Prices
3.07      Domestic and imported fertilizers are pooled and marketed by BADC at
a farm gate price fixed by the Government, keeping in view the crop/fertilizer
price ratios necessary to promote fertilizer use. BADC purchases fertilizer
at the Government fixed ex-factory prices from BCIC and at international
fertilizer prices in the case of imports. The Government provides a subsidy
to BADC to cover the difference between procurement and distribution costs and
the sales revenues. As shown in the following table, the level of subsidy has
grown substantially over the recent years and is now about Taka 1,376 (US$90)
per ton, equivalent to about 40% of the farmer price.

1979                     1,301              1,950                 50.0
1980 (est.)              1,170              1,376                 40.0
The Taka 1,301 million (US$84 million) subsidy in FY79, (and for that matter
in the previous years) imposed a heavy burden on the Government budget.  If
unaltered, the burden would further increase as fertilizer consumption is
expected to rise in the coming years. Government policy, agreed with IDA
(Report P-2588-BD dated June 8, 1979) and USAID in the context of financing
fertilizer and foodgrain imports, is to gradually reduce the fertilizer
subsidy, and the Government has stated its intention to eliminate it altogether
by 1985.  As a first step, average farmer fertilizer prices were increased by
about 28% in August 1979 reducing the average per ton subsidy from Taka 1,950
per ton in FY79 to Taka 1,376 in FY80.  The Government's food procurement
program is also being structured to ensure attractive foodgrain prices to the
farmer so that fertilizer application continues to be economic despite in-
creases in farm fertilizer prices. The present paddy/fertilizer price ratio
of 1.3 in Bangladesh continues to be attractive (India 0.60, Philippines
0.80). In periods of scarcity, significant amounts of fertilizers are
reportly sold at black market prices substantially higher than the official
prices. These factors indicate that fertilizer prices can be further
increased without adversely affecting consumption growth rates.
D.   Marketing Arrangements
3.08      Distribution.  BADC, an autonomous government-owned body, is respon-
sible for the procurement, storage and marketing of all agricultural inputs,
including fertilizers.  While the major constraint to increased consumption
has been inadequate supplies, the fertilizer distribution system has also been
handicapped by inadequate planning and coordination and lack of transport and
storage facilities. An IDA-financed fertilizer marketing and distribution
study, completed in 1977, provides the basts for BADC to formulate a compre-
hensive and improved marketing and storage program. BADC's marketing system



- 11 -
has traditionally handled wholesale distribution and limited private parti-
cipation to the retail dealer level.  In 1978 BADC introduced wholesale and
retail competition among fertilizer dealers--private and cooperative--in a
pilot project in Chittagong division, where about a third of the Bangladesh
fertilizer sales are effected. The new system has had a reasonably successful
start and has been extended to the Dacca and Khulna divisions from January 1,
1980. About three-fourths of the fertilizer market is covered now by the new
distribution arrangements.
3.09      Transport and Storage.  Even though fertilizers form only a small
part of the total freight movement (about 3% at ports, 8.5% rail freight and
8% of inland water cargo), transport and storage system inadequacies have
limited fertilizer availability and use. While the Government is taking
several steps to remedy these inadequacies, improvement can only be gradual,
particularly in the railways. Current fertilizer storage facilities totalling
about 440,000 tons are not adequate even for FY81 and would continue to be
inadequate even after completion of the additional 63,000 tons of capacity
currently under construction, including about 35,000 tons of capacity with
USAID financing. An additional 173,000 tons of storage is programmed under
USAID financing and is expected to be completed by 1981-82. While the above
program will meet the requirements in the next few years, there would still be
need in the near future for some additional storage at particular locattons
and inaccessible areas and for substantial additional capacity to meet long-
term needs.
3.10      Due to the inadequacies of the transport and storage facilities,
strained further by the unforeseen foodgrain crisis in 1979, BADC could not
move adequate quantities of fertilizers from the BCIC warehouses during the
early part of FY80, resulting in excessive stock accumulations and forcing
production levels below capabilities. While the problems were caused by
factors specific to the period, BADC and BCIC did not anticipate the problems
and evolve alternative solutions in time. Even when such emergency situations
are not present, coordination between fertilizer production and its movement
has not been adequate. In order to improve such coordination, the Government
has agreed that BADC will enter into agreements with the three fertilizer
plants by October 31, 1980 covering arrangements for the pick-up of fertilizers
by BADC. The agreements will include provisions for (a) BADC to compensate
the fertilizer plants to cover the additional costs of warehousing or higher
stacking incurred by the plants on fertilizers not picked up by BADC in
accordance with agreed arrangements; (b) the fertilizer plants to compensate
BADC for failure of the plants to supply the fertilizer as per agreed sched-
ules; and (c) evolving arrangements which would permit the plants to sell
the fertilizer directly to private sector wholesalers. Additional measures
are under discussion in connection with a proposed fertilizer transport credit
appraised in January/February 1980. Assistance to transport operators is
expected to be included in proposed Development Finance Corporation and small
industry credits scheduled for consideration in the near future.

IV. BANGLADESH CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES CORPORATION
4.01      Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the Project
sponsor and proposed beneficiary of the Credit, is a fully Government-owned
corporation. It is one of the country's major manufacturing companies with
a total work force of 27,000 and projected sales revenues of Taka 3.2 billion
(US$207 million) for FY80. It presently operates 30 operating entities which
are engaged in 10 different major product areas in the chemical industry,
i.e., fertilizer, pulp and paper, soap and detergents, safety matches and
rubber products, to mention the most important. A full list of BCIC's present
production units and their respective revenues are given in Annex 4-1.
A.   History and Organizational Structure
4.02      BCIC is an autonomous public sector enterprise formed in July 1976,
when the Government decided to combine its numerous holdings in the chemical
sector 1/ into one major chemical corporation. Many small and medium-sized
companies had suffered enormously during the liberation war of 1972 and after
independence were in shaky financial condition, often without effective
management/owners. Subsequently, a large number of these companies were
nationalized to avoid bankruptcy. After this takeover, the Government became
increasingly aware that many of the small, often inefficient and inadequately
managed operations under BCIC imposed an evergrowing burden on the Government's
fiscal budget. Furthermore, it was extremely difficult to coordinate and
manage activities of the 89 independent companies, which often competed with
each other, and to bring them in line with the Government's major objective
of optimal allocation of resources. The Government decided that a strong
commercially oriented corporate management team, operating from a centralized
headquarters, was required to develop and implement successfully a program
for streamlining and consolidating of the various Government interests in the
chemical sector. BCIC was assigned this responsibility.
4.03      Since the formation of BCIC, its management has been primarily
occupied with two tasks: (i) restructuring the accumulated assets into
manageable and self-sufficient operating units; and (ii) improving the operat-
ing efficiency and levels of capacity utilization in various plants. During
this process, about 60 of the companies acquired earlier were either dis-
invested to the private sector, integrated into existing or newly created
units, or shut down where no other economic solution could be found. At
the end of this first phase of reorganization in mid-1979, BCIC's corporate
structure had improved considerably limiting the company's activities to 10
mainly chemical related product areas and 30 operating units (Annex 4-1).
I/   The merger involved in total 89 companies, of which the 4 most important
were the following: (a) Bangladesh Fertilizer, Chemical & Pharmaceutical
Corp.; (b) Bangladesh Paper & Board Corp.; (c) Bangladesh Tanneries
Corp.; and (d) Sylhet Pulp and Paper mills.



- 13 -
4.04      From the administrative and operational points of view, these
remaining units are decentralized in their day-to-day operations. Each
unit operates as a separate profit center and maintains individual--though
standardized--accounts. However, all policy decisions regarding capital
expenditure and budgeting are taken by the corporate management in Dacca,
in close consultation with the Government. In addition, all support func-
tions, such as finance, procurement, planning and development, are carried
out in BCIC's corporate headquarters. Headquarter staff comprises of only
a relatively small number of professionals and is organized according to its
supportive, supervisory and coordinative functions as shown in the organogram
on the following page.
B.   Financial Performance

Considering the difficult circumstances and often adverse operating conditions,
BCIC's financial performance has been quite reasonable. During 1977-80, the
company achieved revenue growth rates averaging about 25% in a period of
relative price stability. 1/ Operating profit margins averaged a reasonable
level of about 20%--with the exception of 1978 when it was 12%. However,
profit before taxes suffered due to the heavy burden of interest charges on
borrowings (averaging about one-third of operating profit) required because of
the under-capitalization of the company, its debt/equity ratio was 88:12 in
1977 and 70:30 in 1978. Although some progress has been made in strengthening
the capital structure, as a result of a substantial capital infusion in 1978,
BCIC is still well below the preferred debt/equity ratio of 60/40. While
the working capital ratios appear reasonably acceptable, as indicated by
the current ratio of 1.4 at the end of 1979, BCIC is suffering from inflated
working capital requirements. At the end of 1979, current assets had reached
about 18 months of sales primarily as a result of high inventory and accounts
receivables (each equivalent to about 8 months of sales). Since accounts
payable amount only to about 4 months of sales, the balance of about 14 months
of sales is financed through other short-term sources.
4.06      Part of the problem lies in unusually high stocks of raw materials
and spare parts, considered by BCIC as necessary to ensure sufficient supply
due to long delivery times. Despite the recent substantial increases of
inventory of spares and components--mainly towards imported spares, chemicals
and catalysts--there is still a noticeable need to complement and to replace
the present stocks with specialty items in the forthcoming years. Inventory
of finished products is relatively low with about 1.8 months of production
costs (excluding depreciation). While the above observations are, in general,
also valid for the three individual fertilizer units, their capital structure
and profitability are better than that of the consolidated company, as shown
in the table below and detailed in Annex 4-2:
1/   While 1977 experienced a deflation of 5%, the inflation rates for 1978
and 1979 were 6% and 15%, respectively. However, many of the company's
product prices were hardly or not at all increased. Ex-factory fertil-
izer prices, for example, have remained practically unchanged since
April 1976.

The above table shows a significant drop in average capacity utilization in
1978 due to the operating problems discussed in paras 4.11 to 4.29. The
capacity utilization staged a recovery in 1979, slightly above the 1977
levels and continued to improve during the first half of 1980, though it is
uncertain if the target for the full operating year will be achieved. This
trend in operating performance is closely reflected in the profits generated
by each unit. As a result of improved capacity utilization in 1979, BCIC's
fertilizer units were able to maintain their profit level, despite increased
input costs, while ex-factory sales prices remained unchanged.
C.   Restructuring of BCIC
4.08      With the formation of separate profit centers and the assignment
of competent management to the operating units, the first phase of the Govern-
ment's efforts to restructure the chemical industry was completed in mid-1979.
However, the wide range of products of the industry and the relative scarcity
of managerial capabilities at corporate level have made it difficult to res-
pond quickly to the day-to-day requirements of the individual units, especially
in the technologically difficult fields like fertilizer and paper. The Govern-
ment has recognized the need to implement a second phase of reorganization to
overcome inefficiencies associated with the rigid nature of centralized proce-
dures. To give unit management maximum entrepreneurial initiative, decisions
requiring quick responses should be taken as far as possible at the plant unit
level.
4.09      In an effort to decentralize and delegate responsibility, the
Government has, therefore, decided to form unit-wise Boards of Directors by
restructuring each of the operating units into independent companies. It
is understood that the implementation of the restructuring will be a gradual
process which will start with the fertilizer units in mid-1980. The result-
ing fertilizer companies will be the final beneficiaries of the plant
rehabilitation component of the Credit. The Government is currently working
out the capital structure of the individual companies based on a 60/40
debt/equity ratio for each. BCIC is also preparing a detailed plan describ-
ing the powers to be delegated to the individual boards. The Government
expects to continue using BCIC's corporate staff for coordinating the
overall budgeting and investment plans of the units. BCIC is expected to
perform this coordinating role either by holding equity in the units or as
an agent of the Government. The Government has yet to take a decision on
this. The Government has confirmed that the Ghorasal and Chittagong com-
panies will be registered by May 30, 1980 under the Companies Act. The
formalities for making the Companies Act applicable to the Natural Gas
Fertilizer Co. Ltd. Fenchuganj will also be completed by the above date.
The present Enterprise Management Boards will become Boards of Directors of
the three companies by June 30, 1980. The Boards of the new companies will
be empowered adequately to take decisions on production planning, financial
operations and production management. The powers provided to the companies
under the draft Memorandum and Articles of Association are adequate for per-
forming their responsibilities. The establishment of the three fertilizer
companies will be a condition of credit effectiveness.
4.10      The following three sections of this Chapter give a brief description
of the history, major technical features, recent performance, current operating
problems and major plant improvement needs of the three existing fertilizer
plants at Ghorasal, Chittagong and Fenchuganj.

D.   Ghorasal Plant Facilities
4.11      The Ghorasal complex (Map IBRD-14866), located in Dacca district
on the Sitalakhya river bank, includes a 660 tpd ammonia plant and a 1,137
tpd urea plant along with gas turbine power generators, cooling towers,
maintenance shops and other auxiliary facilities. The ammonia plant uses
the conventional steam reforming process with the Giammarco-Vetrocoke Process
for the decarbonation of the raw synthesis gas and a centrifugal system to
compress the gases to the ammonia synthesis pressure. The urea plant is based
on the Mitsui-Toatsu Process and produces prilled urea. The plant facilities
were engineered and constructed by Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC) of Japan
and were completed in 1970.
4.12      The natural gas required for ammonia, steam and power production
is supplied from the Titas gas fields by a pipeline which delivers gas at
pressure to the plant. The raw water needed for the process and cooling tower
make-up requirements are taken from the Sitalakhya River, and the effluent
water is returned after treatment to the river. The steam requirements are
met from the process waste heat boilers and a gas-fired auxiliary boiler.
The fertilizer plant requires approximately 12.6 MW of power. At present,
two gas turbines installed as part of the Ghorasal facilities, each with a
rated capacity of 8 MW, supply the plant's power requirements. The system has
been engineered to use the national grid power if one of the turbines is under
maintenance. Urea is shipped both through a five-mile rail spur to Tongi and
from the plant's river wharf using barges and the inland waterways.
4.13      Following the test run in 1970, the Ghorasal complex suffered two
major shutdowns--in FY72, during the war of independence, and in FY75,
following an explosion in the control room. Urea production touched a peak of
236,000 tpy in FY79 against the rated capacity of 374,000 tpy. The production
performance of the Ghorasal plant since start-up in FY71 is shown below:

Ammonia production continues to be the major constraint and there have been
difficulties in reaching and maintaining rated levels of production as well
as in achieving consistently even 300 annual operating days, while the annual
production capacity is based on the general industry practice of 330 operating
days per year. FY79 has been the best performance year so far and production
could have been significantly higher but for interruptions due to events
outside plant management's control. Of the FY79 total ammonia plant downtime
of 103 days, nonavailability of gas supply (25 days) and national grid power
supply interruptions (17 days) together accounted for 42 days of downtime; 61
days of downtime was due to normal and unforeseen maintenance. The gas supply
was interrupted due to the fall in hydel power production following the
drought and the resulting priorities assigned to gas supply for increased
thermal power generation. The excessive downtime for maintenance was due
primarily to the lack of appropriate preventive maintenance, spare parts and
poor physical condition of some equipment. During the first six months of
FY80, urea production was about 143,000 tons. The FY80 urea production is
expected to be 240,000 tons, equivalent to a capacity utilization rate of 64%.
4.14      Under the First and Second Technical Assistance Credits (Credit Nos.
409-BD and 622-BD), Bresler and Associates, Inc. (BAI) of the US carried out
studies to review the performance of the Ghorasal facilities and to recommend
specific measures to improve their operation and maintenance. The findings of
the BAI study presented in the consultants' final report submitted in August
1979 (Reference B - Prolect File) were reviewed by IDA staff with the plant
and BCIC managements. Several of the recommendations have been implemented
during the latest plant shutdown for maintenance in 1979 and some others will
be during the scheduled shutdown in the next few months. The performance of
the facilities was also reviewed in April 1979 by Toyo Engineering Corpora-
tion, who formulated their preliminary recommendations in their report dated
September 12, 1979 (Reference C - Project File). The recommendations of the
consultants proposed to be implemented as part of the present Project are
summarized in Annex 4-4.
E.   Chittagong TSP Facilities
4.15      The Chittagong fertilizer complex is located about 2 miles south
of Chittagong City on the Karnaphuli River. The complex consists of two
separate TSP plants. The TSP-1 plant consists of a 100 tpd sulfuric acid
plant, a 31 tpd phosphoric acid plant and a 100 tpd Run-of-Pile (ROP) TSP
plant. The TSP-2 plant consists of a 400 tpd sulfuric acid plant, a 135
phosphoric acid plant and a 450 tpd ROP-TSP plant. The TSP-1 facilities were
engineered and constructed by Pan American Consultants (US) and Technique
Chimie (France) and were completed in 1968. The TSP-2 facilities were
engineered and constructed by Hitachi Zosen (Japan) and were completed in
1970. The rock phosphate and sulfur required by the complex are imported in
shiploads, unloaded at BCIC's own wharf on the Karnaphuli River and conveyed
by a belt conveyor to the plant storage facilities. The plant power require-
ments are met from the public grid. The waste gypsum is moved and dumped into
a 20-acre pond within the plant area.

4.16      The TSP-1 plant, first commissioned in 1969, almost immediately
ran into difficulties due to the use of Jordan rock phosphate contaminated
with sea water instead of the Moroccan rock for which the plant had been
designed. As a result, several of the pumps and agitators were badly corroded
requiring plant shutdown for replacements. A legal dispute over the contractual
liabilities for the replacements led to the plant remaining shut until April
1977, except for intermittent operation of the sulfuric acid plant to produce
sulfuric acid for sale and for use in the TSP-2 plant. Since April 1977, the
plant has been in operation except during overhauls in late 1977 and 1979.
The TSP-2 plant, though completed in 1970, was not commissioned until 1974--
after the war of independence. The TSP production has generally been around
40,000-45,000 tpy against the combined installed capacity of 152,000 tpy. The
TSP production reached a maximum of 62,300 tpy in FY79 as indicated below:

4.17      The FY79 production was only equivalent to 41% of the rated annual
capacity, primarily due to the very low plant operating days of 150. During
the days the plant was operating, production averaged 75-80% of the daily
rated capacity.  Factors responsible for the plant downtime and their share
in total operating days lost are summarized below:

Equipment failures and maintenance problems accounted for 53% of the total
lost days. Shortage of raw materials, power supply interruptions, and BADC's
difficulties in moving fertilizers, all of which were outside the control of
the plant authorities, were also important factors accounting for 47% of the
lost days. These same factors are expected to adversely affect the FY80
production which may be only about 70,000 tons of TSP. Production during the
first six months of FY80 was only about 23,000 tons mainly due to shortage of
raw materials.
4.18      The BAI study mentioned earlier also included the Chittagong TSP
plants (para 4.14). These facilities were reviewed by Jacobs Engineering
Group, Inc. (JEG) of the US under a subcontract with BAI. The Chittagong TSP
complex was also studied by Cremer and Warner Ltd. of the UK in January 1978
and recommendations made to the UK Ministry of Overseas Development (Reference
D - Project File). The rehabilitation and conversion options for the TSP
complex were studied by JEG in April 1979 (Reference E - Project File) under
a separate subcontract to Soros Associates Consulting Engineers of the US as
part of the study on bulk shipment and unloading of fertilizer imports in
Bangladesh. In addition to the major technical recommendations, the various
studies highlighted the need for: (i) adequate and acceptable quality water
supply; (ii) more reliable power supply; (iii) long-term arrangements for
gypsum disposal; (iv) resolutions of other environmental problems; and (v) a
study of the economics of continuing TSP production at Chittagong. These
aspects are discussed further in the following paragraphs.
4.19      The two TSP plants were initially designed to use water drawn from
tubewells within the plant area and having a salinity not exceeding 100 parts
per million (ppm) of chlorides, for the process and boiler feed water require-
ments. The quality of the tubewell water has deteriorated with salinity
increasing up to 1,400 ppm and as a result the water treatment and demineraliz-
ing facilities have proved inadequate. Limiting the use of the tubewells to
periods when the quality is acceptable and supplementing the supplies with
public utility water have not been adequate to meet the plant process water
requirements. Hydrological surveys have also not identified possibilities of
improved water supply with new tubewells. BCIC studies have, however, con-
firmed that Karnaphuli river water has acceptable salinity during 1-2 hours
per tide. BCIC has, therefore, already made arrangements to meet most of the
plant process water requirements by pumping water from the river during low
salinity periods and thus providing adequate plant raw water storage; con-
sidering the small size of the plants which require modest amount of water,
this solution would not require construction of large storage capacity. BCIC
supplements the water supply by stand-by arrangements with the public water
supply authority. With these arrangements the plants are assured of adequate
water supply.



- 22 -
4.20      Power interruptions are mainly due to the failure of the Chittagong
grid supply. The deficiency of the Chittagong grid supply is recognized by
the Government and a project is currently being implemented to improve the
supply by installing additional substations in the area. The Chittagong TSP
plant has two diesel generators which provide emergency power supply to keep
the vital plant units (such as the agitators in the phosphoric acid reaction
vessels) in operation during grid power supply failures. The diesel generator
capacity however is not adequate to provide emergency power to all those units
which should be kept in operation during power failures. To minimize produc-
tion losses and limit equipment damage, BCIC intends to install additional
diesel generating capacity which, along with the expected improvements in
the Chittagong power grid quality, will make the power supply situation
satisfactory.
4.21      After the TSP production gets stabilized at an annual rate of
122,000 tpy (or about 80% of rated capacity), the Chittagong plant is expected
to produce about 230,000 tpy of waste gypsum. Gypsum is at present slurried
and pumped to a 20-acre pond where it is allowed to drain. About 15,000-
20,000 tpy of gypsum is manually recovered from the pond and sold for cement
manufacture. According to current estimates, the land for gypsum disposal
will be adequate for another 3 or 4 years. Additional land required for
subsequent gypsum disposal would be expensive and could find better uses
in the industrially developed North Patenga area. Alternative arrangements
for the use or disposal of gypsum have to be identified and implemented before
the disposal develops into a serious problem. Gypsum could be useful for
direct application as a soil conditioner and for land reclamation but these
applications require considerable promotional and marketing efforts.  Under
a UNDP financed study, other alternatives for gypsum utilization have been
evaluated and the findings are being reviewed by BCIC.  These include (i)
production of ammonium sulfate using the conventional Merseberg process; (ii)
cement and sulfuric acid production based on the Chemie Linz technology; and
(iii) to a limited extent production of gypsum wall boards. With the planned
expansion of cement production, the use of gypsum for that purpose could
increase to about 75,000 tpy or about one-third of the total. The consultant
analysis, confirmed by preliminary studies by IDA staff, indicates that use
for cement/sulfuric acid manufacture could be an economic alternative. There
is, however, concern with the limited commercial experience available with the
technology and its sensitiveness to gypsum quality. Unless uniform quality of
rock phosphate supplies can be maintained with long-term contractual arrange-
ments, it would not be possible to maintain the required gypsum quality.
4.22     If economic utilization of gypsum cannot be developed, gypsum would
either have to be pumped to the Bay of Bengal about 3 km away or disposed of
in the present area developing high banks of gypsum material to increase the
capacity. Disposal to the sea would have to be planned carefully to reduce
any adverse impact on marine life, but it would be a relatively permanent
solution. The second alternative is expected to enable BCIC to continue to
dump gypsum in the present area for another 6 to 7 more years and is possibly
the cheapest one at least in the short term. In view of the importance of



- 23 -
gypsum disposal to the continued operation of the TSP plants, satisfactory
assurances have been obtained that the Government will complete by December
31, 1980 the evaluation of alternatives for gypsum disposal or utilization
and review with IDA the findings and recommendations of the study and the
plan for their implementation.
4.23      The major environmental problems at the Chittagong TSP plants
result from (i) sulfure oxide emissions; and (ii) dust emissions. The sulfur
oxide emission problems are mainly the result of equipment conditions and
power outages. With completion of the plant renovation program, improved
power supply and better operating procedures the sulfure oxide emissions can
be maintained within acceptable levels. Further improvement would be possible
by converting the sulfuric acid plant to the double catalysis/double absorp-
tion process which would be economically justified if adequate markets are
identified for approximately 60,000 to 100,000 tpy of additional acid that
would then become available.
4.24     Good plant maintenance and better operating practices would be
adequate to minimize dust pollution in the sulfur and rock phosphate handling
and storage areas. Since the Chittagong facilities produce and market a
run-of-pile product, the bagging and storage areas are very dusty as in other
similar facilities. The working conditions in this area are unpleasant and
present health risks. The atmosphere in which the shovel drivers and bagging
personnel work is so heavily laden with dust that visibility is limited to a
yard or so and the workers are inhaling dust. While no sickness statistics
are available, the dust inhalation damage causes symptoms only after some
years. From the point of view of obtaining an acceptable working environment,
it is essential to granulate the TSP and thereby reduce dusting. The plants
were initially planned to include granulation facilities which were not built
due to financing constraints. According to JEG, the dust problem can be
minimized adequately by building semi-granulation facilities. However,
farmers find fully granulated TSP easier to apply and have shown a marked
preference in their purchases for the imported TSP and DAP-which are fully
granulated. The Project will, therefore, include provisions for the somewhat
costlier full granulation alternative. If engineered around the existing
facilities and by using as far as possible the available equipment, this
option would improve product quality and farmer acceptance without substantial
additional cost.
4.25      Finally, there is the question of whether it is economical to con-
tinue production of TSP at Chittagong. Production of one ton of TSP requires
about 0.36 tons of sulfur and 1.64 tons of rock phosphate--both of which are
imported and generally without the benefit of long-term supply contracts.
Since about two tons of raw materials are required per ton of TSP, the produc-
tion of phosphatic fertilizers based on imported rock phosphate and sulfur
must be reviewed carefully, taking into account the freight costs. While fresh
investments in Bangladesh for phosphatic production based on imported rock
phosphate would for this reason probably not be an economic investment, con-
tinued operation of existing facilities with marginal renovation investment
offers better economics. Economic production cost estimates included in
Annex 8-1 indicate that, at an annual production level of 121,600 tpy (80%



- 24 -
capacity utilization rate) after renovation, the annual economic cost of TSP
production would be lower than the import cost by about Taka 104.5 million or
US$6.7 million (in 1979 dollars). It is, therefore, considered economically
advantageous to Bangladesh to continue with the Chittagong Plant TSP produc-
tion. This conclusion differs from the findings of a study carried out by
Soros Associates in April 1979 on the economics of bulk import of fertilizers
through the Chittagong and other Bangladesh ports (Reference F - Project File)
that there could be economic advantages in shutting down TSP production to
permit the plant's wharf, handling, storage and bagging facilities to be used
instead for bulk fertilizer imports. This study concluded that the savings
from import of bulk fertilizer (instead of bagged fertilizer) using the
factory's facilities would be greater than the savings from continued TSP
production in Bangladesh vis-a-vis imports. However, a further detailed study
by a Bank consultant has concluded that the plant facilities have adequate
capacity to handle fertilizer imports without shutting down TSP production. A
recent IFAD project (Report 2729-BD) includes a component to quickly upgrade
existing facilities at the TSP jetty to handle small bulk ships, lighters,
mini-bulkers and, if the river were dredged, large bulk ships. The IFAD
project bulk unloading component would assist in meeting immediate requirements
while long-term solutions such as an offshore unloading platform or use of
shuttle bulkers with wharf bagging are being investigated and carried out.
4.26      In summary, continued TSP production at Chittagong is economically
advantageous provided the bulk unloading project at Chittagong will be imple-
mented in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IFAD project agree-
ment. Satisfactory assurances have been obtained from the Government to
this effect.
F.   Fenchuganj Plant Facilities
4.27      The Fenchuganj complex, located about five miles from the Fenchuganj
town in Sylhet district, includes a 200 tpd ammonia plant, a 333 tpd urea
plant, a 35 tpd sulfuric acid plant and a 40 tpd ammonium sulfate plant. The
facilities also include steam turbine power generating facilities, cooling
towers, maintenance shops and other auxiliary facilities. The plant and
facilities were supplied and erected by Kobe Steel (Japan) based on ammonia
and urea technologies from Chemical Construction Corporation (US) and the
sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate technologies from Lurgi-Mitsubishi (FRG-
Japan). The ammonia and urea plants were completed in 1961 and commenced
commercial production in 1962. The sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate plants
were completed in 1969 and began commercial production in 1970. Natural gas
for process and energy needs are met from the Haripur gas fields. Most of
the urea is shipped via rail spur to the main rail system through Maijgaon.
4.28     Urea production at the Fenchuganj plant in recent years is shown

4.29      During 1962 to 1970, urea production average 87% of the rated
capacity with ammonium sulfate production often exceeding capacity.  The
production levels, however, declined thereafter and in FY77 the capacity
utilization was only 67%. The decline in production was mainly due to the
absence of thorough inspection and overhaul of the facilities from the time
they were erected till 1974. Under a contract with Kobe Steel, the facili-
ties were fully renovated during the summer of 1978. Since the recommis-
sioning af"ber renovation, the plants operate at rated daily capacities and
the monthly average production has increased from 5,000 tons of urea and 510
tons of ammonium sulfate before renovation to 8,700 tons of urea and 760
tons of ammonium sulfate after renovation. During the first six months of
FY80, urea production was about 52,500 tons. Production is expected to be
about 95,000 tons in FY80. The present major need of the facilities is to
maintain an adequate and competent work force, so that downtime can be
minimized by proper operation and preventive plant maintenance. However,
some of the recommendations of the consultants for improving instrumentation
have not been carried out during the renovation. There is also need to
replace some of the heat exchangers for critical duties and provide a spare
set of turbine blades for the power generation unit to ensure continued
satisfactory production levels.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The Project has been designed to improve the performance of BCIC's
existing fertilizer plants. It consists of three components: (i) improve-
ments to be carried out at Ghorasal, Chittagong and Fenchuganj (Plant Improve-
ment Component); (ii) construction of a training center at Ghorasal to ensure
availability of skilled staff to operate the plant facilities (Training
Component); and (iii) import of critical plant spares, catalysts and chemicals



- 26 -
to meet the needs of the plants for the next two years (Spares, Catalysts and
Chemicals Ccmponent). The specific modifications and improvements required at
the three plants for better performance were identified by consultant studies
(para 4.11 to 4.29) and further reviewed by a BCIC Technical Committee for
preparing feasibility reports. In formulating the details of the improvement
programs, the Technical Committee has taken into account the more recent
performance experience of the plants and the modifications already carried
out or planned to be carried out in turnarounds before the implementation of
the proposed Project. The three project components are described below.
A. Plant Improvement Component
1. Ghorasal Plant Improvement Program (Estimated Cost US$17.8 million)
5.02      As mentioned, the requirements of the Ghorasal Plant were identi-
fied by the BAI and the TEC studies (para 4.14). Parts of the requirements
have been implemented in May/June 1978 and BCIC has arranged to carry out
further improvements during early 1980. The program to be carried out as part
of the proposed Project (Reference G - Project File) are given in Annex 4-4.
The program covers generally the following categories of improvements: (a)
modifications to remove equipment inadequacies; (b) replacement of equipment
having difficult maintenance problems; (c) improvements to the water and steam
supply systems; (d) improvements to the power generation system; (e) modifica-
tion of the vetrocoke system; and (f) revamping the instrumentation of the
trip system.
2. Chittagong Plant Improvement Program (Estimated Cost US$15.0 million)
5.03      The requirements of the Chittagong plant were identified by the BAI
and Cremer and Warner studies (para 4.18).  Parts of the requirements were
implemented during late 1979. The improvement program intended to be carried
out under the proposed Project (Reference H - Project File) includes the
following categories of works: (a) provisions of replacement and standby
equipment where required; (b) improving plant utilities including steam, power
and treated water facilities;  (c) improvements in instrumentation; and (d) TSP
granulation facilities (Annex 4-4).
3. Fenchuganj Plant Improvement Program (Estimated Cost US$4.5 million)
5.04      The Fenchuganj facilities were fully renovated during the summer
of 1978 (para 4.29) and the present program (Reference I - Project File) is
limited to: (a) improvement of the present instrumentation for better process
control; (b) replacement of heat exchangers for some of the critical duties;
and (c) a set of turbine blades and diaphragm for the power generation unit.
These items would improve reliability and reduce downtime.
B. Training Component
5.05      Under UNDP financing, technical assistance has been made available
to BCIC in the preparation and implementation of training plans at Ghorasal
(para 2.12). The UNDP project does not include financing for setting up the
training facilities. IDA staff will review the training plans prepared by



- 27 -
BCIC and its consultants and will finance the setting up of training facili-
ties identtfied in the above plans under the proposed Project. The training
component estimated to cost US$1.0 million will include (a) equipment and
training aids required for the setting up of the training center at Ghorasal;
(b) construction of the training center and the workshop; and (c) trainees'
hostel.
C. Spares, Catalysts and Chemicals Component
5.06      Inadequate foreign exchange availability has been a major constraint
to domestic fertilizer production (para 2.09). The existing BCIC plants
require annually about US$4.0 million of imported spares, catalysts and
chemicals for maintaining and operating the existing fertilizer plants. The
proposed component would provide US$8.3 million to finance the import of the
essential spares, catalysts and chemicals during the fiscal years (ending
June 30) 1981 to 1983. As part of this component, BCIC will prepare before
December 31, 1980 a maintenance program satisfactory to the Association
(para 2.10).
VI. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTION
A. Project Management
6.01       Implementation of the Plant Improvement Programs at Ghorasal and
Chittagong will be the responsibility of the individual General Managers
of the plants, assisted by their Material Control Managers and separate
Project Managers. The engineering contract management, procurement coor-
dination and material planning will be the responsibility of the two Project
Managers. The civil works and construction will be carried out by the
existing maintenance departments of the plants, each of which will have a
coordinator/material controller to coordinate the renovation work. A material
management cell will be formed to receive, store and issue, as required, the
renovation materials. In critical areas, specialist erectors and technicians
would be drawn from equipment suppliers or engineering firms. Overall tech-
nical coordination will be provided by the selected expatriate engineering
ftrms, Toyo Engineering Corporation (Japan) for Ghorasal and another suitable
engineering firm for Chittagong. All the BCIC managers and staff required for
the program implementation will be organized from persons already with BCIC.
The proposed organogram is given in the following page. The Fenchuganj plant
improvement program, which is by far the smallest, will be carried out by the
plant's operating, maLntenance and material managers without a formal implemen-
tation organization.
6.02      The training component will be Implemented based on proposals
prepared with the technical assistance of the UNDP-financed consultants and
reviewed with IDA (para 2.12). BCIC will appoint by June 30, 1980 a training
manager reporting to the Ghorasal General Manager, to coordinate the implemen-
tation of the training component. The facilities will be engineered by a
competent architect firm and constructed as part of the Ghorasal Improvement
Program.

6.03      The annual requirement of spares, catalysts and chemicals will be
assessed by the technical managers of the three existing BCIC plants, along
with the UNDP consultants taking into account the present inventories, and
further reviewed by BCIC's Production Director. The plant material managers
will procure the items to match the plant's requirements.
B. Engineering Arrangements
6.04      BCIC intends to contract Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC) to
assist in implementing the improvement program at Ghorasal. Since the plant
facilities were engineered, supplied and constructed by them, TEC has access
to the full design and engineering details and is best equipped to carry out
the program. TEC is also expected to find it easier to obtain equipment
supplier participation in studying the plant and developing improvements. The
agreement to be negotiated between BCIC and the TEC will include TEC services
for required engineering, supply of proprietary equipment, procurement of
other supplies and providing specialist technicians as required.
6.05      For the Chittagong TSP plant, BCIC intends to negotiate an agreement
with a competent engineering company to provide the engineering, procurement
assistance, and implementation coordination services. No external engineering
assistance is proposed for the Fenchuganj component. The proposed credit will
require engineering services for Ghorasal and Chittagong on terms acceptable
to the Association, and the signature of appropriate contracts will be condi-
tions of disbursement for each of these respective components.
C. Project Schedule
6.06      The project schedule for Ghorasal and Chittagong are determined
by two factors: (a) the speed with which BCIC can finalize the engineering
arrangements for Ghorasal and Chittagong and (b) the need to carry out the
modifications with minimum production interruptions and therefore mostly
during scheduled annual overhauls. BCIC has already asked TEC to present
its proposals for Ghorasal and will invite proposals for Chittagong after
Credit negotiations. BCIC expects to receive the technical and commercial
proposals from the engineering consultants by October 30, 1980 and finalize
the engineering arrangements by January 31, 1981.   The equipment and supplies
are expected to be delivered to the site by March 31, 1982 and the program
should be completed by August 31, 1982. Due to the nature of the supplies
and the involvement of experienced engineering firms in engineering and
procurement, the above time schedule is considered reasonable. The program
at Fenchuganj can be completed in about 15 months after the procurement
bid invitations are issued or by December 1981. With finalization of the
training plans by end of 1980, the facilities including setting up of the
workshop and installing the training aids can be completed by March 1982.
The procurement of spares, catalysts and chemicals will occur during the
fiscal years 1981 to 1983 to match the plant requirements.

VII. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost
7.01      The total financing required for the plant rehabilitation component
is estimated at US$37.3 of which US$24.4 million equivalent is in foreign
exchange. In addition, the financing includes a training component of US$1
million and a program component of US$8.3 million for import of spares,
catalysts and chemicals. The capital cost estimates for plant rehabilitation
are detailed in Annex 7-1 and summarized below:
Plant Improvement Component - Summary of Capital Cost

7.02      The base cost estimates are in December 1979 prices and were pre-
pared by Bank staff, based on BCIC staff's estimates following preliminary
designs and information submitted by engineering firms combined with the
Bank's own cost information obtained from contractors' budgetary quotations.
Physical contingencies are calculated generally at 15% of the base cost
estimate, in light of the rehabilitation nature of this project component.
Price contingencies are based on annual escalation rates for equipment and
materials of 12% for 1980 and 10% thereafter, slightly higher than the
latest CPS guidelines.  These estimated escalation rates were used for both
local and foreign expenditures (when expressed in US dollars) on the assump-
tion that differences in the international and domestic inflation rates will
be accounted for by changes in the exchange rate which is periodically
repegged. It is estimated that all equipment and materials will be imported
and that about 60% of engineering and management assistance will be provided
by foreign suppliers. The cost of engineering services are expected to form
about 5% of the base cost estimate, excluding duties for Ghorasal and



- 31 -
Chittagong, and would total about US$2.0 million. TEC services requirement is
esttmated to be about 70 man-months and would cost about US$12,000 per man-
month whLch includes salary, social costs, international travel and subsistence.
In addition to these personnel costs, the contract cost will include home
office costs and other minor items. The man-month requirement of engineering
services for Chittagong is roughly estimated at 15 man-months.
7.03      The capital cost breakdown by project components is as follows:

Total Financing Required          13.8     32.8       46.6   100
About 80% of the total financing required is estimated to be needed for the
plant improvement component mainly in the Ghorasal and Chittagong plants and
another 18% for the import of essential supplies for the sustained operation
of the three works. The balance of 2% would be required for the training
facilities.
B. Financing Plan
7.04      The financing plan for the plant improvement component is shown below:

The above component will be financed with 40% equity and 60% debt. The
Government will provide as equity US$12.9 million equivalent to finance
local project costs. The terms of on-lending of the Dutch financing (US$4.7
million) have not yet been determined. The project debt financing of US$22.4
million equivalent is assumed to be financed with Dutch and IDA assistance
on-lent by the Government to the new fertilizer companies. To the extent
such on-lending may bring the ratio of debt financing to equity financing
for any of the new companies above 60:40, a part of IDA assistance now esti-
mated at US$2 million may be passed on as equity. The proposed IDA credit
portion of US$19.7 million will cover 53% of total financing requirements and
is equivalent to 81% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the Plant
Improvement Component. US$18.7 million out of an IDA credit totalling US$20.7
million for the Plant Improvement and Training Components would be on-lent by
the Government on standard terms to the new fertilizer companies at a rate of
interest of 10%, for 10 years including 3 years of grace. The exchange risk
will be borne by the new fertilizer companies.  These terms are comparable
with the terms currently being applied to other foreign currency loans presently
on-lent to BCIC and other similar enterprises.  Finalization of satisfactory
on-lending agreements for the plant improvement and training components will
be a condition of credit effectiveness.
7.05      IDA funds for the spares, catalysts and chemical component totalling
US$8.3 million will be made available by the Government to the new fertilizer
companies against payments in local currency.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
7.06      The proposed credit covers plant improvements in the three existing
plants, the setting up of training facilities and imports of spares, catalysts
and chemicals for the operation of the three existing plants. The proposed
procurement arrangements have taken into account the specific needs of the
three components and procedures most appropriate for them. The procurement
packages for the plant improvement component will generally be of small value
and in large part of proprietary nature. It is expected that only about 15
packages will exceed US$50,000 in value and several of them are best procured
from the original equipment vendors. Only 7 packages with total value of
about US$3 million may be appropriate for international competitive bidding
(ICB). The rest of the equipment and supplies totalling about US$13 million
in value will include proprietary items (about US$8 million) and small value
items (about US$5 million) procured following Bank procurement guidelines.
The same arrangements will also cover supplies for the training component.
In view of the nature of the project, such procurement procedures are
appropriate to ensure timely and efficient plant renovation.
7.07      The engineering services will be provided by selected engineering
firms most appropriate for the nature of the services involved. For Ghorasal,
BCIC has selected Toyo Engineering Corporation who engineered and constructed
the present facilities. For Chittagong BCIC intends to select a firm that
can provide efficiently the required services. The engineering agreements
will be negotiated with the selected firms.
7.08      The plant improvement component has only limited civil works,
foundation and construction requirements (about US$2.6 million) and these
will be carried out by the respective plant maintenance personnel using local



- 33 -
subcontractors when required. The civil works for the training components
will be implemented with local civil subcontractors selected following com-
petitive bidding procedures.
7.09      The catalysts and chemicals will be imported following international
shopping among a representative list of suppliers. Spares and components will
be procured internationally following BCIC's normal procurement procedures for
such supplies, which provide for limited competition whenever possible. These
arrangements are considered satisfactory.
7.10      The existing plants were mostly engineered and constructed by
Japanese engineering firms with large part of the equipment coming from
Japanese suppliers. As a result, spares and components required for revamping
moving machines would probably come from the same suppliers. However, equip-
ment replacements for heat exchangers, etc. will be procured internationally.
The total supplies are expected to be shared about 60% from Japan, 25% from
Europe and 15% from other countries.
7.11      The allocation of the proposed credit of US$29 million will be as
follows:

The credit includes about US$1.0 million to finance local currency expendi-
tures mainly under the training component.
7.12      The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 1983 as
indicated in the disbursement schedule given in Annex 7-2.

VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. General
8.01      Since the nature of the Project is the rehabilitation of existing
operating plants, an incremental approach has been used for the financial
and economic evaluations; only the increments in cost and revenue as a result
of the proposed rehabilitation program are considered in the financial and
economic analyses. The production increases assumed for the three plants
are summarized below:

a/   Target capacity utilization after renovation is completed in 1978.
While, as noted before, the capital expenditures of Chittagong and Ghorasal
are aimed to raise substantially the operating level of the respective plants
by means of debottlenecking, the investments at Fenchuganj are aimed towards
preventive measures in order to avoid or at least shorten potential operating
interruptions which might impair achieving continuation of the present level
of capacity utilization. Since the plant improvement expenditure for Fenchuganj
forms only a small portion (10%) of the total project cost and is of a
"preemptive character," it is difficult to reasonably quantify potential
savings in the future and no financial analysis for this project component
has been undertaken.
B. Operating Costs and Revenues
8.02      An estimated operating cost breakdown for each plant at the expected
capacity utilization rates upon project completion (para 8.01) is given in
Annex 8-1 and summarized on the following page:

a/   Excluding financial charges.
b/   As of December 1979.
As a result of the low cost of the abundantly available natural gas (between
US$0.30 and US$0.40 per Mscft), urea production costs including depreciation
are very competitive at Ghorasal with similar plants elsewhere. Although
Fenchuganj costs are substantially higher than Ghorasal because of smaller
plant size and the use of power-intensive technology, they are nevertheless
well below international prices. While the current price of natural gas
permits the covering of operating expenses and capital charges of related
facilites, it is on the low side considering the present costs of developing
new gas fields and providing transport facilities. The Bank is currently
appraising a pipeline project in Bangladesh and the issue of an appropriate
gas price for commercial users will be reviewed in the context of that project.
Natural gas accounts for only about 20% of urea production cost--as indicated
in the table above--so that even a 50% rate increase would not significantly
affect the project's financial viability.
8.03      With regard to TSP production at Chittagong, Bangladesh is less
favorably endowed with raw materials, and depends entirely on imports of both
sulfur and rock phosphate. Consequently, raw material costs account for
two-thirds of its production costs, causing production costs to be equal to
international FOB prices. The production costs, however, would be lower if
the investments already made were treated as sunk costs. Domestic TSP produc-
tion costs are, nevertheless, still significantly lower than the landed cost
of imported TSP (Annex 8-1).

8.04      Since the Government is still to finalize the ex-factory fertilizer
prices based on the negotiated pricing arrangements (para 2.08), the revenue
estlmates are based on current ex-factory prices. Due to the proposed forma-
tion of independent companies within BCIC which will also involve a substantial
revision of the present capital structure of the three fertilizer units and in
consideration of the relatively small amounts of capital expenditures allocated
to each plant, detailed financial statements of BCIC and the fertilizer units
have not been presented in this report. Instead, it appeared more appropriate
to prepare projections of key income data in constant 1979 terms for the
individual plants. Based on the above revenue and cost assumptions, financial
key data are projected for the three plants as follows:

b/ Defined as total assets minus non-interest bearing current liabilities.
c/ Corporate tax rate is 55%.
d/ Amount of debt service is notional, based on 1979 balance sheets.
8.05      The operating profits for both plants at Ghorasal and Chittagong
are expected to improve substantially, i.e., by 58% and 67%, respectively,
after completion of their plant improvement projects. Similarly, the return
on assets before interest and after tax will increase from 10% to 13% for
Ghorasal and from 7% to 10% for Chittagong, which are considered as acceptable



- 37 -
levels of income. In both cases the cash flow after debt service will approxi-
mately double. With regard to Fenchuganj, the project will help sustain the
estimated operating profit. The return on assets of 7% is lower than for the
two other plants, mainly as a result of higher operating costs which are not
adequately covered by the present FenchuganJ ex-factory price of urea. A
price increase of about 10% to Taka 2,635 per ton of urea would achieve a
return on assets of approximately 10x. The relatively small cash flow after
debt service at Fenchuganj is a direct consequence of high requirements of
net working capital which by requiring large short-term debt substantially
increases the debt service.
C. Financial Rate of Return
8.06      The financial rates of return before tax, in constant 1979 terms,
on an incremental basis for the plant improvement components at Ghorasal and
Chittagong are calculated at about 30% and 22%, respectively. The cost/benefit
streams for the base cases are given in Annex 8-2 and the results of the
sensitivity analysis are summarized below:
Sensitivity Tests on Before-Tax Financial Rate of Return
(in percent)

(b)  Capital Cost up 25%                     23                 16
(c) Capacity Utilization Improvement
75% of Target                         21                14
(d)  Combination of (b) and (c)              15                  9
(e)  Gas Price up 50%                        25                NA
The financial rate of return is most sensitive to changes in the assumed rates
by which the capacity utilization is projected to improve. Nevertheless, even
in a severe case of a combination of a capital cost increase of 25% and an
improvement of capacity utilization 25% below target would result in a still
satisfactory rate of return of 15% for Ghoras4l and a marginally acceptable
rate of return of 9% for Chittagong. However, due to commercially proven
technology, experienced contractors and increased operating training assis-
tance, the likelihood of a combination of such adverse sensitivities appears
to be remote.
D.   Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
8.07      BCIC has agreed that the three new fertilizer companies to be formed
under BCIC's restructuring plan (para 4.09) will follow prudent financial
practices and conform to the following financial covenants: (i) maintain at
all times a debt/equity ratio of 60/40 or better; (ii) maintain a current



- 38 -
ratio of at least 1.3:1.0; (iii) not incur any additional debt if by doing so
the projected debt service coverage would fall below 1.4; (iv) not pay at any
time any dividends, prepay any debt or effect any other cash distributions,
including to affiliated companies, if by doing so the current ratio would
drop below 1.5; and (v) obtain prior agreement of the Association for all new
projects requiring capital expenditures in excess of US$1.5 million until
project completion. In addition, the Government has agreed to supply the
companies with adequate funds to ensure a timely completion of the Project
and to cover promptly any justified unexpected cash needs over and above the
agreed budget.
8.08      BCIC has agreed that the successor companies will submit:  (i) annual
audited financial reports within six months of the closing of each fiscal year;
and (ii) monthly progress reports and periodic financial statements and pro-
jections according to a schedule and form satisfactory to the Bank.
E. Major Risks
8.09      The Project faces only limited technical risks since the technology
associated with the plant improvement component is commercially proven and
will be supplied by internationally experienced firms. However, the sustained
performance of the plants at the projected operating levels will depend to a
substantial extent on the availability of an adequate and competent management
and work force. The availability of sufficiently experienced personnel is
expected to be reasonably ensured by including a training component in the
credit and by other measures that would help to retain the trained manpower
at technical and managerial levels (para 2.14).
8.10      The Project also would face some potential financial risks if not
for the pricing arrangements proposed. The continued satisfactory financial
performance of the sponsoring companies is largely dependent on the recommended
change in the Government's present fertilizer pricing policy at producer level
and subsequent implementation of a pricing mechanism which allows for timely
price adjustments during periods of rapidly rising production costs. This
risk is expected to be adequately met by the proposed agreements with the
Government, which will allow the companies to earn a minimum agreed return
on their assets (para 2.08).
8.11      There is also a potential, though limited, marketing related risk,
mainly due to the need to improve the effectiveness of the present distribu-
tion system as a result of inadequate transportation capacity. However,
this risk is within acceptable levels and will be further reduced by likely
investments to be financed under a Fertilizer Transport Project recently
appraised, and by facilities in Development Finance Corporation and small
industry projects for providing funds to the private sector for financing of
barges and trucks. In addition, an improved coordination of transport and
marketing arrangement between BADC and BCIC is being stipulated (para
3.10).

IX. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
9.01      For the economic analysis, costs and benefits are divided into
tradeable and non-tradeable items. The economic costs and benefits of the
tradeables are calculated by using projected long-term international prices,
while those of non-tradeables are determined by using domestic prices after
making necessary adjustments for local taxes, except for natural gas for which
a higher opportunity cost of US$1.00/Mscft is used (Annex 8-1). Bangladesh has
adequate gas reserves to meet the country's and the Project's needs. In
addition, Bangladesh has a small fuel oil surplus thus preventing its economic
substitution by natural gas. Therefore, the opportunity value of natural gas
used by the Project should be based on the higher of (i) economic cost of gas
productions and delivery, or (it) anticipated value of exports of natural gas
in the form of LNG. Bangladesh is in an unfavorable position for the produc-
tion and export of LNG due to its somewhat limited gas reserves relative to
the very substantial gas requirements for an economically sized LNG plant, its
inadequately developed infrastructure base and the limited port capabilities.
Furthermore, studies carried out tn the past on possible LNG projects in
Bangladesh have not established the economic viability of such a project.
As a result, the gas price at which LNG can be exported competitively from
Bangladesh would be lower than in other possible locations. Even with the
increasing international LNG prices, the netback for natural gas from a
possible project in Bangladesh is, therefore, not likely to exceed US$1.00
per Mscft in 1979 terms. The economic cost of gas production and delivery
to Chittagong is estimated at about US$0.66 per Mscft (Report No. P-25-68-DP
dated May 18, 1979). While the base case uses US$1.00 per Mscft, a sensitiv-
ity analysis was undertaken for Ghorasal applying a 50% increase above the
apparent maximum value of US$1.00 per Mscft. The Project's economic cost is
derived from the financial capital cost estimate after deducting applicable
import duties and taxes on equipment and are expressed in US Dollar based on
an exchange rate of US$1.00 - Taka 15.5.
9.02      Except for natural gas, which is supplied from indigenous sources,
Bangladesh is an importer of all major raw materials as well as of the output
products urea and TSP. The economic costs for raw materials delivered at
factory and output prices are derived from the latest price forecasts for
the mid-1980s by the Bank's Commodities and Export Projections Division. The
projected costs and prices reflect the most recent price increases for hydro-
carbons, energy and phosphate rock, expected improvement of current bottle-
necks tn distribution of sulfur and higher capital costs of new capacities.
It is assumed that the raw materials sulfur and phosphate rock will be Imported
from the Middle East, while the alternative sources of supply for the finished
products urea and TSP would be Europe 1/ and Mexican Gulf, respecttvely. For
1/   It is conceivable that on a spot contract basis urea could be also pro-
cured from the Far East. In this event, however, it is assumed that the
savings in transport cost are likely to be compensated by higher FOB
prices.



- 40 -
urea an FOB price of US$245/ton 1/, US$40/ton for ocean freight and US$10/ton
for port-handling and inland transportation differential are assumed. In the
case of TSP, a FOB price of US$195/ton is assumed with ocean freight and port
handling cost of US$50/ton and US$10/ton, respectively. The computation of
economic costs and prices are shown in Annex 8-1 and its results are given
below:

B. Economic Rate of Return
9.03      The economic rates of return, calculated on an incremental basis,
for the Ghorasal and Chittagong plant improvement programs are 92% and 18%,
respectively. These satisfactory returns reflect the Project's rehabilitation
nature which results in substantial revenue improvements through relatively
small capital expenditure. Ghorasal's economic rate of return is considerably
higher than its financial return of 30%, mainly due to the fact that domestic
urea ex-factory prices as discussed earlier are presently substantially below
world market level and the financial return is calculated on the basis of
current prices as explained in para 8.04. In the case of Fenchuganj, the
relatively small improvement program is "preemptive" in nature and aims to
maintain operating reliability (para 5.04). No economic rate of return has
been computed for this part of the project due to the difficulties in esti-
mating with reasonable accuracy the inefficiency costs that may result from
excessive downtimes and consequent loss of production without the proposed
investment. However, the investment would be economically justified with the
savings realized even if the annual downtime would be reduced by only one week
over the plant's economic life.
9.04      The cost/benefit streams used for calculating the economic rates
of return are given in Annex 9 and results of the sensitivity analysis are
summarized below:

The economic return of the Ghorasal plant improvement component is of such
magnitude that even under a combination of adverse circumstances--within
reasonable limits--its economic viability is more than ensured. Although
the Chittagong component is more exposed to adverse conditions than that of
Ghorasal, due to its lower base case return, it also does not face any undue
risk jeopardizing its economic viability.  Sensitivities of a 25% capital cost
increase and of a 25% below projected capacity utilization increase show still
satisfactory economic returns of 13% and 11%, respectively. It is unlikely
that a combination of these factors will occur.
C. Other Benefits and Foreign Exchange Savings
9.05      At Chittagong, the present TSP plants have no granulation facilities
and thus create problems of severe dust hazard not only for plant workers but
also for farmers using mainly hand distribution. The implementation of
granulation facilities as part of the proposed Project will eliminate the
current dust problem, which could become otherwise--in the long run--a serious
health hazard.
9.06      The economic output value of the plant improvement component is
estimated at US$17 million annually, and its net annual foreign exchange
savings after provision for principal and interest payments on the foreign
loans are estimated at about US$12 million expressed in constant 1979 US
dollars. The related foreign exchange costs of about US$24 million will thus
be offset by the foreign exchange savings in about two years after Project
completion.
9.07      Removing production bottlenecks which limit output at the existing
fertilizer plants will also have a significant effect on the morale of
fertilizer industry workers, and are expected to set standards for attainable
production efficiency for other fertilizer plants. Bangladesh has abundant
and cheap natural gas resources for which few other economically attractive
uses are available. In the long run, as Bangladesh gains experience in
urea production and improves its productivity, it should be able to compete
effectively in producing urea for export. Improving the productivity of its
plants producing for the domestic market is an important first step.

X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     Satisfactory assurances and agreements have been obtained from the
Government that it will:
(a) review at least once each year the ex-factory fertilizer
prices of each of the three existing fertilizer plants and
establish prices for each of the plants which would provide
after interest and taxes at least 10% return on equity
(para 2.08);
(b) agree to take all necessary steps to ensure adequate and
continuing provision of foreign exchange funds to meet
the plants' requirements for imported raw materials spares,
catalysts and chemicals (para 2.10);
(c) introduce procedures and schedules governing the recruitment
of fertilizf"r -echnicians and engineers from Bangladesh to
work abroad so that the departures are restricted to such
numbers as can reasonably be replaced without adversely
affecting the operation of the fertilizer plants (para 2.14);
(d) cause BADC and the three new fertilizer companies to enter
into a satisfactory agreement before October 31, 1980 on
arrangements for pick-up of fertilizers from the plant
warehouses with provision that BADC payment will include
an agreed compensation to cover additional cost of higher
stacking or renting additional warehouse space if fertilizer
is not picked up according to a predetermined schedule and
that arrangements will be evolved to permit BCIC to sell
fertilizers directly to wholesalers, as well as to BADC
(para 3.10);
(e) complete the evaluation of alternatives for gypsum disposal
or utilization, and review with IDA the plans by December 31,
1980 (para 4.22); and
(f) cause the Chittagong bulk unloading project to be implemented
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the IFAD project
(para 4.26).
10.02     Satisfactory assurances and agreements have been obtained from
BCIC that:
(a) it will furnish its detailed training plans for review before
December 31, 1980 (para 2.14);
(b) the three fertilizer plants will establish by December 31,
1980 and maintain subsequently an appropriate program of
incentives for their skilled technicians in order to
retain them in service (para 2.14);



- 43 -
(c) it will form the three new fertilizer companies to the
agreed time schedule and with powers delegated to the
three fertilizer entities to ensure efficient management
on corporate and plant levels (para 4.09); and
(d) the three new fertilizer companies will follow prudent
financial practices and conform with the financial covenants
and meet reporting requirements described in paras 8.07 and
8.08.
10.03     Establishment of the three new fertilizer companies (para 4.09),
Government approval of the Project proforma and finalization of satisfactory
on-lending arrangements (para 7.04) for the Plant Improvement and Training
Components would be conditions of credit effectiveness.
10.04     The preparation of the detailed maintenance program would be a con-
dition of disbursement for the Spare Parts, Catalysts and Chemicals Component
(para 2.10). The presentation of BCIC's training plans to the Association
for review and agreement would be a condition of disbursement for the training
component (para 2.14).   The signature of the appropriate contracts for engi-
neering services, acceptable to the Association, for Ghorasal and Chittagong
plants would be conditions of disbursement for these respective components
(para 6.05).
10.05     With the above assurances and agreements, the Project is suitable
for an IDA Credit of US$29 million equivalent under on-lending terms as
discussed in para 7.04.
