PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
FERTILIZER INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1023-BD)
PREFACE
1.      On May 20, 1980, IDA approved a credit of US$29.0 million equivalent
to assist in rehabilitating several existing fertilizer plants 'n
Bangladesh. The Credit became effective on September 8, 1980. The Credit
closed on June 30, 1986, 30 months after the original schedule. US$5.6
million equivalent was cancelled.
2.      The Fertilizer Industry Rehabilitation Project was developed in
response to the high cost of new fertilizer investments in Bangladesh, when
at the same time existing capacity was greatly underutilized. The project
was designed to correct the major constraints facing the fertilizer
industry, concentrating on technical rehabilitation and modernization of
existing facilities.
3.      The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by ASTIF based on a
mission to Bangladesh in October/November 1988. Information prepared by the
Borrower was used in the preparation of the PCR but did not institute a
formal Borrower PCR. The draft PCR was sent to the Government for comments,
and they are reproduced as an Attachment.
4.      The project has been reviewed by OED but will not be subject to a
full audit at this stage.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
FERTILIZER INDUSTRY REhABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1023-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The expansion  and modernization  of  the  fertilizer industry in
Bangladesh ?as high priority given the country's comparative advantage in
low-cost gas supply and the predominance of agriculture in the economy.
Overall fertilizer supply has improved, in part due to the project, and
Bangiadesh is now exporting urea.
Obiective
2.       The main objective of the  project was to rehabilitate and improve
the performance of existing fertilizer plants in Bangladesh. The project
was identified in the course of technical assistance provided from previous
IDA credits, and focussed on technical rehabilitation (paras. 2.1, 2.3 and
2.6). The project apprais I identified further quality of management and
pricing policy as add!tionil major constraints facing the sector (para.
2.7). The creation of a training center vas subsequently dropped, and is
being implemented through bilateral assistance (paras. 2.12, 3.28).
Xœalementation E-rperience
3.       The  project  experienced   difficulties   in  preparing  adequate
specifications and in firming up the project scope (para. 3.25). Also, the
project suffered from poor coordination among project teams at various
levels and slow decision taking between government authorities and the
project entities. A more clearly defined project implementation plan and
larger use of external, experienced consultants would likely have improved
implementation performance.
4.       A management reorganization was agreed  by the Government, and the
fertilizer compaies were organized under a holding company, the Bangladesh
Chemical Industry Corporation  (BCIC,  para.  2.7).    However, the holding
company is not legally established and, as a result, enterprise autonomy
and, by extension, managerial performance, are adversely affected (paras.
3.8, 3.16, 7.3). On the other hand, the senior management of BCIC has
proved to be relatively effective.
5.       Actual  project  costs  (251  overrun)  and  implementation period
(about 55 months overrun) were well in excess of appraisal estimates. Cost
and time overruns were due to changes in project scopo, impact of project
delays, and increased cost of engineering and management following the
expanded scope of work and price escalation (paras. 3.2, 3.3, 3.12, 3.14,



- vi -
3.20, 3.23, 3.26). Cost underrune in the Fenchunganj plant (24Z) were due
to lower bid prices of foreign equipment than original estimates and lower
local currency capital costs in terms of US Dollars (para. 3.27).
Results
6.       The  rehabilitation  program vas  well-defined,  albeit following
significant changes in scope (paras.  2.9-2.11).   The economic benefits of
the project were not as high as originally anticipated. The realized
economic return for Ghorasal and Chittagong components were 232 and 92,
respectively,  compared  to  the  appraisal   estimates  of  922  and  182,
respectively, due to lower world fertilizer prices, higher economic costs
of inputs (natural gas and imported raw materials), higher capital costs
(change in scope), and delays in project implementation (para. 6.2). Rates
of return were not calculated for Fenchunganj since its rehabilitation was
more in the form of extensive maintenance than modernization.
7.       Financial  returns  were  also  below  the  levels  anticipated at
appraisal, for essentially the same reasons as cited above. Realized
financial returns for Ghorasal and Chittagong were 72 and 82, respectively,
compared to appraisal estimates of 302 and 222, respectively (para. 5.2).
'While economic rates of return are acceptable, financial rates of return
are not satisfactory. The poor financial performance was due, in part, to
the inefficient system of adjusting ex-factory prices in the face of rising
costs of inputs (paras. 4.1-4.3).
Overall Asseesmeut and Lessons
8.       The project has succeeded in  improving the overall performance of
the three plants through replacement of obsolete equipment, correcting
problems in plant utilities and instrumentation, and provision of foreign
exchange for the importation of parts and consumables for operation and
maintenance.   Production  at  the  Ghorasal  plant  exceeded  902 of rated
capacity in 1985-88, average energy consumption per urea/ton dropped 152,
and estimated production costs fell 212 per ton (paras. 3.6, 3.13).
Capacity utilization rose from 402 to 902 in the Chittagong plant (para.
3.21), while in the Fenchunganj plant from 702 to over 902 (para. 3.25).
Nevertheless, even if it can be assured that the facilities will be well-
maintained and that the quality of management will continue to improve, the
projects show poor prospects of long-run financial viability (para. 7.1).
Finally, although an organizational restructuring took place, it is still
not fully effective, thereby affecting enterprise autonomy and quality of
management (paras. 3.1, 7.3) -- a more general and deep-rooted issue 'which
is part of on-going public enterprise reforms that are being implemented
very slowly. All in all, the project was a partial success.
9.       IDA has been  instrumental  in  impressing  on  the Government the
expediency of improving the capacity utilization of the existing plants
through a rehabilitation program before venturing on to large investments
in new production facilities, and played a major role in mustering all-
round support for the project and in its preparation. At IDA's suggestion,
the Government agreed to spin off the individual plants as separate



- vii -
corporate entities to improve the decision-making process -- an experiment
which has been partially successful.   Furthermore, IDA has been urging the
Government to base ex-factory pricing on a direct link to border prices and
drop the cost-plus formula (paras. 8.1-8.3).
10.      The experience  with  this  rehabilitation  effort  suggests that:
rehabilitation projects require detailed preparatory work, organization and
scheduling; successful implementation depends on efficient decision-making
processes;  and  external  technical   assistance  requirements  should  be
identified early on and be made available without restrictions (para. 9.2).

BANGLADESH
FERTILIZER INDUSTRY REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1023-BD)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Agriculture has remained the mainstay of Bangladesh's economy,
accounting for about 50% of the gross domestic product and providing
employment to about 60% of the work force. The Government of Bangladesh (GOB)
gives high priority to increasing agricultural production to achieve food-
grain self-sufficiency. Fertilizer use began to increase significantly in the
middle of the 1970s, and since then total use has increased at an annual
growth rate of over 9%. In 1987/88, total use reached 1.5 million tons, with
urea constituting 68% of total products, triple superphosphate (TSP)
accounting for 26%, and muriate of potash amounting to 6%. With the
successful discovery of natural gas supplies, domestic fertilizer production
was begun in 1961 with the Fenchuganj Urea Factory, followed by Ghorasal
(1970), Ashunganj (1984), Polash (1986), and, just recently, the Chittagong
Urea (1988). In addition, Chittagong TSP came into production in 1974. These
factories, owned by the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC),
have a combined production capacity of about 1.8 million tons. Domestic
production has doubled in the last five years, mainly through additional urea
capacities at Ashunganj and Polash and through improvements in output from
existing factories attributable to the completion of the rehabitation project
financed by IDA (Credit 1023-BD). Total production of fertilizers in 1987/88
was about 1.4 million tons, with 1.3 million tons of urea and 0.1 million tons
of TSP. Bangladesh has historically had a fertilizer supply gap and has had
to rely on imports for a substantial share of total fertilizer consumption.
When the Chittagong urea facility is fully operational, domestic urea
production will be expected to exceed 1.32 million tons. Since this increase
has resulted in urea produciton in excess of demand, Bangladesh has the
capacity for substantial urea exports. In 1987/88, urea exports were 223,000
metric tons (MT) (17% of production) and earned about US$24 million in foreign
exchange.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Identification. PreRaration. ADpraisal and Credit Effectiveness
2.1      The Fertilizer Industry Rehabilitation Project (the Rehabilitation
Project) was first identified in July 1979 to solve two of the main problems
of the fertilizer sector in Bangladesh, namely, the low capacity utilization
of the operating fertilizer plants (55% of rated capacity on average in 1979)
and the inadequacy of the transportation system for the timely movement of the
fertilizers from the plants, ports and warehouses to the farmers. During
appraisal in October 1979, it was found that two components, plant
rehabilitation and transport improvement, would require greater than expected
investments, therefore it was decided to proceed with them as separate
operations. The Rehabilitation Project was designed for the rehabilitation of
BCIC's three fertilizer plants and the Fertilizer Transport Project was
intended to assist the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC)



- 2-
in improvement of transportation to facilitate fertilizer movements. In view
of the increasing demand of fertilizers, then projected at 15% annually for
1980-85, and saving foreign exchange by improving output of fertilizers, the
Rehabilitation Project was given a high priority by GOB.  During this time,
USAID was concentrating on improving the fertilizer marketing system, and a
fertilizer transport project, as such, did not proceed.
2.2      At the time of appraisal Bangladesh had two operating urea plants,
Fenchuganj and Ghorasal, and one operating TSP plant at Chittagong. The
Fenchuganj plant was built in 1961 as the first fertilizer plant in Bangladesh
with a design capacity of ln6,000 tons per year (tpy) of urea and 13,000 tpy
of ammonium sulphate. Following satisfactory operation of the first nine
years, the plant operated much below rated capacity since 1971. Major plant
overhauls took place in 1975, and in 1978 and afterwards the plant ran at a
satisfactory level. The Ghorasal plant was built by a Japanese engineering
company, Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC) in 1970 with a design capacity of
about 340,000 tpy of urea. The plant encountered mechanical and safety-
related problems in carly stage of operation and operated at well below its
rated capacity. Major overhauling was implemented in 1979 by TEC. The
production improved only to 70* of the rated capacity, but that was the
highest annual production achieved at the Ghorasal plant.
2.3      In order to meet the growing needs of phosphate fertilizers in
Bangladesh and to save the foreign-exchange costs of imports of TSP, the
Chittagong TSP plant (based on imported raw materials, rock phosphate and
sulfur) was completed in 1970. The Chittagong TSP plant consists of two
separate TSP units with total design capacity of 152,000 tons of TSP per year.
TSP-1 unit was built by Pan American Consultants of US. It consists of a
100 ton per day (tpd) sulfuric acid plant, a 31 tpd phosphoric acid plant and
a 100 tpd TSP plant. The TSP-2 unit was constructed by Hitachi Zosen of
Japan. It consists of a 400 tpd sulfuric acid plant, a 135 phosphoric acid
plant and a 450 tpd TSP plant. The TSP plant could not start trial runs until
1975 due to mechanical problems and initial raw material shortages. Since the
start of production the plant continued to suffer from equipment and
maintenance problems which caused the plant to operate well below capacity
(40% of the rated capacity in 1979). While the Rehabilitation Project was
being prepared the issue of continuing TSP production at Chittagong was
raised. A study by Soros Associates Consulting Engineers of the US (which was
not accepted by GOB), recommended to close of the factory with a new
investment for bagging of imported bulk fertilizers instead of rehabilitation
of the existing plant.
2.4      The three fertilizer plants employ a total of about 3,600 staff,
about half of them with technical skills. The limited availability of
experienced plant operators and technicians together with the absence of an
adequate program and facilities for training was a constraint for improving
production. The problem was further aggravated in the late 1970s and early
1980s by the exodus of skilled workers to much higher paying jobs in the
Middle East. To meet the increasing needs of training, UNDP financed a
training project to provide technical management assistance and training for
skilled technical and operating staff at Ghorasal and Chittagong plants. In
addition, the IDA Credit for Ashuganj Fertilizer (Credit 527-BD) provided
funds for import of training equipment. Since the UNDP project did not



- 3 -
finance the setting up of the training center, the training component was
included in the Rehabilitation Project.
2.5      As in the case of Chittagong TSP plant and other fertilizer plants,
the inadequate availability of foreign exchange for the import of raw
materials as well as spares and components often hampered better utilization
of capacity. To address these problems, IDA provided a series of program
credits to finance the import of fertilizer raw materials, spares and
components. A part of the Imports Program VIII (Credit 980-BD) was provided
for this purpose. In addition to the Import Program Credit to assure adequate
availability of spare parts, catalysts and chemicals for maintaining
operations at three plants, foreign exchange of US$8.3 million to finance two-
year import requirements was identified and included in the Rehabilitation
Project.
2.6      In assisting the planning of rehabilitation of the existing plants,
IDA financed under the First and Second Technical Assistance Credits (Credits
409-BD and 622-BD) a Fertilizer Factory Improvement Study designed to identify
equipment and spares for debottlenecking of plant operation. Based on the
result of the above study prepared by Bresler and Associates, Inc. of USA
(Bresler) and a preliminary proposal on rehabilitation of Ghorasal urea plant
by TEC, BCIC prepared the plan for the rehabilitation of the three fertilizer
plants and formally presented to GOB as the Fertilizer Industry Rehabilitation
Project.
2.7      During the IDA appraisal of the Rehabilitation Project, issues of
restructuring BCIC and the ex-factory prices of fertilizers were also
identified as significant factors that would affect the performance of all the
fertilizer plants. BCIC operates 30 units in 10 different major product areas
in the chemical industry. In view of the limited management capabilities and
with the objective of improving the operating efficiency at the unit level,
GOB decided to form each subsectoral set of companies into independent
companies with BCIC in charge of overall coordination. The individual
companies were to be structured financially based on 60/40 debt/equity ratio
with unit Boards of Directors to be empowered adequately for the management of
the companies. The establishment of the three fertilizer companies including
Urea Fertilizer Factory Limited (UFFL), Natural Gas Fertilizer Factory Limited
(NGFF) and TSP Complex Ltd. (TSP Complex) was agreed as a condition of credit
effectiveness. The ex-factory prices of fertilizers were to be set by GOB on
the basis of BCIC's cost estimates. The basis for pricing was not clearly
defined especially for determining the capital base and return criteria.
Moreover, in practice price adjustments often lagged considerably behind
changes in costs of inputs. With the formation of the three units into
independent companies, it was agreed to establish specific standards for
fertilizer pricing as a pricing covenant under the proposed credit to ensure
the financial viability of three units.
2.8      Following agreement on the Project's scope, an IDA appraisal mission
visited Bangladesh in October 1979. On May 20, 1980, IDA approved a credit of
US$29 million equivalent to GOB, to be on-lent to the new fertilizer companies
at a rate of interest of 10% p.a. for 10 years, including 3 years of grace
with the exchange risk to be borne by the new fertilizer companies. The



Credit Agreement was signed on June 4, 1980, and it became effective or,
September 4, 1980.
P. Prolect Obiectives and DescriDtion
Plant Rehabilitation Component
2.9      Ghorosal Plant Rehabilitation Program.  The main objectives of the
plant rehabilitation program were to increase annual output to the rated level
and to improve production efficiency. Factors affecting excessive plant
downtime were the lack of appropriate preventive maintenance, spare parts and
poor physical conditions of some equipment. The scope of the rehabilitation
requirements were identified by the Bresler and TEC studies and then reviewed
by BCIC and IDA. The program covered the following categories of
rehabilitation: (a) modifications to remove equipment inadequacies;
(b) replacement of equipment having difficult maintenance problems;
(c) improvements in the water and steam supply systems; (d) improvements in
the power generation system; and (e) revamping instrumentation.
2.10     Chittagong TSP Plant Rehabilitation Program.  The program aimed at
removing production bottlenecks of the plant and thereby improving production
and operation efficiency so that continued TSP production at Chittagong would
be economically advantageous. Since one consultant had already recommended
closing the TSP unit, its viability was critically reviewed during the
appraisal process. The Chittagong plant was reviewed by Jacob Engineering
Group, Inc. of the US and also by Cremer and Warner, Ltd. of the UK. Factors
affecting the poor operation were summarized as: (a) equipment failure and
maintenance problem; (b) shortage of raw materials; (c) power supply
interruptions; and (d) marketing constraint partly due to powder TSP produced
at Chittagong. The requirements of the Chittagong plant rehabilitation were
identified by the above studies as follows: (a) provisions for replacement of
obsolete equipment and stand-by equipment; (b) improving plant utilities
including steam, power and treated water facilities; (c) addition of TSP
granulation facilities; and (d) improvement in instrumentation.
2.11     Fenchuzanj Plant Rehabilitation Program.  Since Fenchuganj plant had
been fully renovated in 1978, the objectives of the program were to maintain
production at a high level level and to prolong plant life. The program was
limited to: (a) improvement of the instrumentation for better process
control; (b) replacement of heat exchangers; and (c) other preventive
maintenance.
Training ComDonent
2.12     Under UNDP financing, technical assistance had been provided to BCIC
for training plans at Ghorasal, but without financing for setting up the
training facilities. In order to supplement the training plans, the training
component was to finance setting up a training center at Ghorasal together
with trainees' hostel.



- 5 -
Snares. Catalysts and Chemical Component
2.13     The three fertilizer plants required annually about US$4.0 million of
imported spares, catalysts and chemicals for operation and maintenance. The
component was to provide US$8.3 million to finance the import of essential
spares, catalysts and chemicals for two years (from fiscal year 1981 to 1983).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Overall Project
3.1      BCIC, a fully government-owned company, owns and operates six
subsidiary fertilizer factories of which five (except for the TSP facilities
at Chittagong) produce ammonia/urea based on domestic natural gas. Each of
these plants, as an independent fertilizer company, is managed by a
government-appointed Board of Directors and a Managing Director. Management
powers have been delegated from BCIC to the Board of Directors of each
company. But in practice each company is responsible only for day-to-day
operation. BCIC, through its functional directors still has considerable
control powers in the management of the individual companies. In addition,
the Ministry of Industry continues to exercise considerable influence over the
management of BCIC.
Capital Costs. Financing Plan and Disbursements
3.2      The capital cost estimates were reappraised twice, in February 1982
and January 1984, due to changes in project scope and project time overrun.
The capital cost breakdown for the total plant rehabilitation component is
summarized in the table below and presented in more detail for each plant in
Annex 1-1.

the use of funds from IDA's Supplemental Assistance Credit (1504-BD)
(US$3.3 million) for financing the project and use of funds from UK Commodity
Grant (US$4.7 million equivalent) for financing the procurement of a turbine

B. Ghorasal Urea Plant
3.6      Achievement of Prolect Objectives.  Since its commissioning in 1970
with an installed capacity of 340,000 tpy of urea, the Ghorasal urea facili-
ties 1/ could not achieve more than 240,000 tpy of production. During
1975-79, the plant achieved only an average of 61% of capacity utilization.
As a result, the energy consumption was high, exceeding 48 Mscf/ton of urea,
compared with the design consumption of 34 Mscf/ton of urea. Ghorasal, there-
fore, had a high urea production cost compared with the international price
levels. The rehabilitation project aimed to improve the production levels and
efficiency, through removing inadequacies in the utility systems and through
necessary plant modifications. With the completion of the major components of
the rehabilitation program by May 1985, the plant performance has improved
significantly and daily production exceeded the rated capacity for the first
time on August 20, 1985. During 1985-88, annual production exceeded 90% of
rated capacity, reaching over 318,000 tons in 1986-87. The average energy
consumption has come down to about 41 Mscf per ton of urea and further
improvements are expected when plant operations are further stabilized. The
cost of production of Ghorasal urea in 1986-87 was Tk 2,566 per ton as
compared with the estimated likely cost of Tk 3,252 per ton had the
rehabilitation program not been implemented. The BCIC and UFFL management are
now confident that the Ghorasal urea facilities are capable of operation at a
daily rated capacity of 1,137 tpd and with a stream efficiency which will
enable the annual production to be maintained at not below 300 thousand tons
of urea.
3.7      Encouraged by the performance of the Rehabilitation Program,
UFFL/BCIC, with the assistance of TEC, studied the scope for further plant
modifications and a project has been taken up for implementation with Japanese
financial assistance. This project, estimated to cost about US$65 million
equivalent, is expected to increase urea production to about 1,424 tpd through
plant modifications. At the same time, energy consumption is exp&cted to be

(UFFL).



-9-
reduced to 30 Mscf per ton of urea, and plant effluents will be reduced. The
project will also include investments on replac~ements to extend plant working
life.
3.8      Project Management and Execution.  The project was based on studies
by Bresler and TEC followed by discussions with UFFL/BCIC technical managers.
TEC provided all the necessary overall plant engineering services and the
proprietary supplies. In view of the importance of coordinating the project
activities with plant operation, the project was implemented by a UFFL project
team headed by an experienced UFFL manager reporting to the UFFL managing
director. The implementation of the different project components was
coordinated by a BCIC project team, headed by an experienced BCIC executive
director. This arrangement was adequate, but results were mixed. The project
team had difficulties preparing acceptable bid specifications and as a result
there were delays in procurement. Project management was through two groups,
one located at the plant site and and the other at Dhaka. This split resulted
in some coordination problems and delays. Overall, however, the projects were
completed and the main objective of high capacity utilization was achieved.
3.9      HanMower Develolment and Training.  When work on the project was
initiated, UFFL/BCIC were facing difficulties in maintaining their trained
manpower due to excessive loss of personnel to the private sector and to the
Middle East. An in-house training program and the subsequent slackening
industrial activity in the Middle East has reduced the staffing problems. The
project has made a major contribution to staff morale, boosting their
confidence in operating the facilities at good operating levels on a sustained
basis. As further explained in a subsequent section, the training center
component was dropped from the project and is now being implemented with other
funding.
3.10     Performance of Consultants and Engineering Contractors.  The initial
project preparation work was carried out by Bresler under an IDA Technical
Assistance Program (Credits 409-BD, 622-BD). The consultants carried out
their tasks satisfactorily, working closely with the UFFL/BCIC technical
managers. Further work on project preparation was carried out by TEC, who
were the original contractors for the facilities and who could, therefore,
more easily develop an implementable project than a new contractor. TEC
provided UFFL/BCIC with all the needed support and technical help. TEC also
provided all the necessary system engineering services. The design and
engineering of the individual systems were provided by the system suppliers.
All the engineering contractors performed satisfactorily.
3.11    Procurement and Performance of Suppliers.  All the system engineering
services and proprietary supplies were obtained under a single contract with
TEC. All the other supplies were procured following ICB contracting and
procurement procedures. Among the foreign suppliers to .he project, Japan
accounted for the largest share of IDA financed contracts (84%). Denmark
(12%), Korea (3%), and the Netherlands (1%) were the other supplying
countries. There were some delays in the delivery of the ammonia converter
since the supplier needed several technical clarifications during its
manufacture. On the overall, the performance of the suppliers was
satisfactory.

La Excluding installation of ammonia converter.
All items of the rehabilitation project except Ammonia Converter were com-
pleted by May 1985 and with installation of the Ammonia Converter the project
was finally completed in December 1986. Major factors which caused consider-
able delay in project completion, more than four years in comparison with the
appraisal schedule, are:
(i) protracted contract negotiation (over 18 months) with the engin-
eering contractor, TEC;
(ii) changes in scope during the implementation of the project
including installation of ammonia converter and turbine genera-
tor; and
(iii) delay in procurement and shipment particularly for proprietary
items.
ODerating Performance
3.13     A major part of the plant modifications were carried out during the
13 weeks starting from February 1, 1985. Commissioning of the modified
facilities started by end of April 1985 and urea production was achieved in
May 1985. Full production could not, however, be achieved due to power supply
constraints. The new gas turbine generator was commissioned in August 1985
and the plant achieved rated capacity in August 1985. Due to delays in
delivery and overhauling schedule, the ammonia converter could be installed
only at the end of 1986. In 1985-86, urea production reached 307,000 tons.
As plant operations stabilized, production improved in 1986-87 to 318,000
tons, the highest achieved so far, exceeding 93% of the rated capacity.
Production in 1987-88 was only slightly less, reaching 312,000 tons. Domestic
urea production is now in excess of requirements. As a result, while most of
the UFFL output was marketed locally through BADC, significant amounts of urea
has been exported to neighboring countries--Nepal and Sri Lanka. The urea
export in 1987-88 was 39,000 tons, corresponding to about 13% of the UFFL
production.

Financing required for the Ghorasal plant improvement was US$22.1 million, 24%
higher than the appraisal estimate of US$17.8 million. The increase in cap-
ital cost was mainly due to:
(i)  change in project scope resulting in additional installation of
equipment and construction work of 22 items including gas
turbine generator and ammonia converter;
(ii)  impact of project delays causing more price escalation of equip-
ment and services than estimated at appraisal and increase in
interest during construction; and
(iii)  increased cost of engineering and management due to expanded
scope of work and price escalation.
C. Chittagong TSP Plant
Prolect Imnlementation. Management and Performance
3.15     Achievement of Project Objectives.  The plant modifications were
originally proposed to be carried out by the TSP Complex based on the findings
of the Bresler and other studies aind the company's own findings. However,
faced with difficulties in spe.:ifying and procuring the needed supplies, the
company decided to engage the services of Hitachi Zosen, the original TSP-2
plant contractor, to assist in identifying and implementing the project.
Contracting with Hitachi Zosen was concluded only in February 1984. Further
thinking within BCIC also resulted in two major scope changes. BCIC decided
to setup phosphoric acid import facilities to enable TSP capacity to be
increased to 150,000 tpy. Also, to ensure reliable power supplies to the



- 12 -
complex, the company decided to set up gas based captive power generation
facilities. The project was substantially completed in June 1987 except for
the captive power unit which was commissioned at the end of 1988. With the
implementation of the various components of the project, the complex now
produces granulated TSP which finds acceptance with the Bangladeshi farmers.
The dust effluent from the plant has also been substantially reduced with
increased TSP efficiency. The complex has greater flexibility enabling TSP
production based on either rock phosphate and sulfur or intermediate
phosphoric acid depending on relative international prices. The availability
of facilities for importing phosphoric acid enables the complex to operate at
a much higher level of production.
3.16     Project Management and Execution.  As with all the other components,
the project was planned to be implemented by an adequate TSP Complex project
team reporting to the BCIC project coordination group, based on the various
consultant studies that were already available to BCIC. However, even
initially, there were difficulties in specifyine and procuring the needed
supplies. BCIC, therefore, decided to request Hitachi Zosen, the original
TSP-2 contractors, to study the facilities and prepare a proposal for plant
modifications. Hitchi Zosen was contracted to assist the TSP complex with the
system engineering services and supply of proprietary supplies. In the imple-
mentation of the granulation facilities, the company was assisted by a Dutch
grant financed consultant. The project has been completed adequately,
although with significant delays.
3.17     Manpower Development and Training.  The TSP complex carries out a
variety of training programs, both within the country and abroad, for upgrad-
ing and maintaining staff skills. The opportunities that were available to
the complex staff to work with the various consultants engaged for the project
has also provided them with additional skills. The complex is now being
operated and maintained efficiently.
3.18     Performance of Consultants and Contractors.  The project was
originally identified in the Bresler study. However, in view of the
continuing poor performance, the TSP complex has been studied by a large
number of consultants, whose suggestions and proposals have gone into
preparing the final project. All the consultants performed satisfactorily
especially towards transfer of skills and technology to the TSP complex staff.
In retrospect, there were far too many consultant studies, and the combination
of the several (often conflicting) studies and the lack of decisive management
within the Bangladesh public sector system contributed greatly to the delay in
implementing hte TSP modernization component. Hitachi Zosen also served as
overall engineering contractor and performed satisfactorily.
3.19     Procurement and Performance of the SuDDliers.  Hitachi Zosen provided
proprietary supplies. All the other IDA-financed supplies and services were
obtained following acceptable contracting and procurement procedures. Among
foreign suppliers contracted for the execution of the project, Japan won the
largest share (71%).  The rest of the contracts were won by USA, France,
W. Geimany, Italy, UK and Netherlands. Overall, the suppliers performed
satisfactorily both in terms of delivery and in providing follow-up service.

is shown below:

La Does not include the captive power unit, which was com-
missioned at the end of 1988.
Installation of the TSP granulation plant, a major part of the project was
carried out successfully almost within the envisaged project period under
turnkey contract with a Dutch contractor. Rehabilitation of the sulfuric acid
plant and other facilities, including phosphoric acid import facilities, was
completed in June 1987 resulting in substantial time overrun of more than four
years. Delays in project completion were mainly due to the following:
(i) change in the manner of implementing the rehabilitation of TSP-2
plant due to needs of assistance from Hitachi Zosen, the
original contractor (para. 3.16);
(ii) change in project scopo including installation of phosphoric
acid import facilities to increase TSP capacity to 150,000 tpy
and set-up of gas based captive power generation facilities to
ensure reliable power supplies to the complex (para. 3.15);
(iii) overall poor coordination within BCIC and slow decision making
when changes in scope emerged; and
(iv) delay in government approval for contracts and budget resulting
from change in project scope.
Operating Performance
3.21     Commissioning and Production.  The project was completed in June 1987
except for the captive power plant. However, since most of the modifications
were carried out during different plant shut-downs, the effect of the
rehabilitation project was felt even earlier. TSP production exceeded 100,000
tpy for the first time during 1985-86. With the commissioning of the
phosphoric acid import facilities TSP production reached 136,500 tons in
1986-87, with about 34% of the output coming from imported acid. The 1987-88
TSP production was only 117,000 tons due to the difficulties generally faced
by Bangladesh in obtaining supplies of rock phosphate and phosphoric acid.
The company expects to produce about 140,000 tons of TSP in 1988-89. The



- 14 -
entire TSP production is now from the TSP-2 facilities. The TSP-1 phosphoric
acid plant was shut down since it is uneconomical to operate this small plant.
The TSP-1 sulfuric acid and TSP plants are now being operated to produce
single superphosphate, which could provide part of the badly needed sulfur
requirements of the Bangladeshi soil.
3.22     Marketing.  Since the total TSP output of the complex is well below
the country's TSP requirements, the entire output is easily marketed through
BADC. The plant TSP inventory level is reasonable. Also, with the
commissioning of the granulation facilities the entire output is available in
an acceptable form similar to granulated urea. The earlier reluctance of the
Bangladeshi farmer to buy TSP is, therefore, no longer there. With better
recognition of its usefulness, there has been an increasing demand for gypsum
for use both as a soil conditioner and as a source of secondary nutrient
sulfur.
Capital Costs
3.23     Financing required for the Chittagong plart rehabilitation in compar-
ison with the appraisal estimate is presented in Annex 1.1 and summarized
below:

Financing required for the Chittagong plant rehabilitation was US$21.3 mil-
lion, 42% higher than the appraisal estimate of US$15.0 million equivalent.
The increase in capital costs was mainly due to:
(i)  change in project scope involving additional installation of
equipment and construction work including facilities for
imported acid and a turbine generator of 5 MW which accounted
for 44% of capital costs increase; and
(ii)  impact of project delays causing higher costs of equipment and
services and also increase in interest during construction



- 15 -
These types of changes in costs are typical for such modernization work and in
themselves did not affect project viability.
3.24     The Rehabilitation Project had envisaged at its preparation stage
that the disposal of gypsum cons crained the TSP production and thus GOB was
required to prepare an evaluation study for gypsum disposal and utilization
(Section 4.06, Development Credit Agreement). In the last few years gypsum is
being widely used by farmers as a fertilizer supplement to correct sulfur
deficiency in the soil. Sales volume of gypsum has increased drastically from
5,000 MT in 1981/82 to 57,000 MT in 1987/88 and in 1988/89 85,000 MT of gypsum
is expected to be sold at the price of Tk 1,000 per ton. With full production
of TSP at Chittagong factory 80,000-90,000 MT per year of gypsum will be
produced as by-product. Thus, under the emerging demand for gypsum, disposal
of gypsum is no longer a constraint to TSP production and this study is no
longer required.
D. Fenchuganj Urea Plant
Project Implementation. Management and Operating Performance
3.25     The Fenchuganj facilities,/  commissioned in early 1962, had an
initial period of satisfactory operation but production started declining and
reached a low of 37% of capacity in 1973. The plant was rehabilitated with
Japanese assistance in 1978-79 based on needs identified during the early
1970s. Further investments were, therefore, required to strengthen the
facilities and stabilize continued operation. As with the other components,
there were implementation delays due to difficulties in preparing adequate
specifications and in firming up the project scope. The project was completed
in May 1986. The results of the project were immediately evident with urea
production reaching 111,500 tons in 1986-87, corresponding to 105% of rated
capacity. Production in 1987-88 was slightly lower, about 104,000 tons,
corresponding to 98% of rated capacity. It is expected that the facilities
can produce satisfactorily on a sustained basis of at least 90% of rated
capacity. Natural gas feedstock consumption has decreased from about 68 Nscf
per ton before rehabilitation to about 59 Mscf per ton after rehabilitation.
hiie project was, essentially, implemented by the NGFF staff with minimum
external assistance. Japanese contractors provided the largest share of
supplies and services to the project (55%). Switzerland, Austria and Belgium
were the other important suppliers. The consultants, contractors and
suppliers to the project generally performed satisfactorily.

With considerable delay in bid preparation and procurement, most of the items
for the plant rehabilitation were installed during scheduled shut down in
March-April 1986 and the plant started its operation in May 1986. Major
factors causing the three-year delay are:
(i) delay in definition of project scope and in preparation of
technical specifications and bid documents due to shortage of
technical manpower;
(ii)  delay in procurement of some equipment items due to obsolescence
of the existing model of the equipment/machinery at the plant;
and
(iii)  lack of engineering experience and poor decision making within
the BCIC implementation team and management.
CaRital Costs
3.27     Financing required for the Fenchuganj plant rehabilitation in compar-
ison with the appraisal estimate is presented in Annex 1-1 and summarized

- 17 -
Financing required for the Fenchuganj plant rehabilitation was US$3.4 million,
24% 1'ower than the appraisal estimate of US$4.5 million. The decrease in
capital costs was mainly due to (a) lower bid prices of foreign equipment than
the original estimate for procuring most of items on international tender; and
(b) lower local currency capital costs in terms of US dollars which resulted
from change in exchange rate fi'r Bangladesh taka from Tk 15.5/US$, at
appraisal, to the actual weighted average rate of Tk 26.6/US$ over the main
execution period of 1982-86. There were no problems related to availability
of financing.
E. Training Center
3.28     The setting up of the national training facilities at Ghorasal has
been substantially delayed. The changes in project scope after negotiation
and the resultant substantially larger financing required resulted in a delay
of the training center. Subsequently, this component was dropped from the IDA
project and is being implemented with financing of all the foreign costs with
Dutch grant funds. As envisaged now, this component is expected to cost
Tk 82.5 million including foreign component of Tk 46.7 million. This cost
excludes facilities to be provided by BCIC. The present scheme envisages
training facilities for 128 apprentices over a period of two years and for
this purpose provides about 47,000 ft2 of covered training facilities and
15,000 ft2 of hostel facilities. The training areas will include process
engineering, instrument and control engineering, mechanical engineering,
electrical engineering and chemical control. The faculty will include 27
trainers with appropriate management and support staff. It is expected that
the facilities will be made ready in a phased manner, with the first batch of
trainees starting in early 1989, and the full scheme scheduled to be in
operation by early 1991. The overall scheme has been prepared and is being
implemented in cooperation with Stamicarbon of Holland.
IV. PRICING POLICY
4.1      Retail prices of fertilizer have been deregulated progressively since
April 1983 under GOB's price reform to eliminate subsidy. Although progress
has been slow and erratic, and full decontrol has not yet been reached, prices
paid by farmers are linked to average international prices and are formulated
in principle under market forces. Ex-factory prices received by BCIC and
wholesale prices charged by BADC are still administered by GOB. Wholesale
prices are set at the level of ex-factory price plus marketing cost and BADC's
margin which are currently Tk 4,575 (US$145) per ton for urea and Tk 4,725
(US$150) per ton for TSP. Ex-factory price of urea has been decided based on
production costs of each factory while the ex-factory price of TSP has been
based on its landed (imported) cost. In the past, due to the Government's
policy to maintain fertilizer price relatively low, adjustments of ex-factory
prices have lagged behind considerably in spite of the increased cost of
natural gas, power and other inputs. The ex-factory price of urea was raised
to Tk 4,025 (US$127) in Nay 1988 after three year price freeze and ex-factory
price of TSP (Tk 6,619) remained unchanged. BCIC's proposed price for TSP of
Tk 7,460 is being reviewed by the GOB for adjustment. In accordance with a
proposal by the Technical Committee on Pricing Policy for Public Enterprise



- 18 -
new pricing for the ex-factory price of urea was established by GOB in May
1988.  Outline of the pricing policy is summarized as follows:
(a) Uniform ex-factory price (Tk 4,025/ton) is established for all urea
delivered to BADC from factories. The uniform price is decided based
on estimated production costs including return on equity of each
factory. Ex-factory prices reflecting production costs of each fac-
tory are now introduced within BCIC for its accounting and monitoring
purposes.
(b) Capital restructuring is to be made to ensure 60/40 debt/equity .atio
excent for Chittagong Urea Factory which is not yet decided. BCIC
shall maintain 4.75% of return on equity on average among various
factories (see separate PCR on Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Project).
(c) Production cost estimates will be based on the following:
(i) operating rate: 80%; (ii) natural gas cost in Tk 25/Mscft; and
(iii) depreciation: 20 years for plants and equipment.
4.2      BADC lifts locally produced fertilizers from factories and together
with imported fertilizers distributes products to wholesalers and dealers.
Under the Fertilizer Distribution Improvement Project I of USAID a free market
system of fertilizer wholesalers and dealers has been established nationwide.
As a result wholesalers and dealers now are able to sell at any price they
wish anywhere in the country. The private marketing system is now being
expanded through direct lifting by wholesalers from ports and BCIC factories.
Since September, 1988 the GOB has, on a trial basis, authorized the Chittagong
Urea Factory to sell directly to private wholesalers at prices administered
by GOB.
4.3      During the implementation of the Rehabilitation Program, GOB failed
to meet the pricing covenant which was to review and establish ex-factory
prices to cover all production costs and agreed rate of return (10%) on equity
(Section 4.01, Development Credit Agreement). BCIC thus had difficulty to
meet financial covenants to maintain debt/equity ratio (60/40) and current
ratio (1.3:1.0) particularly for Chittagong TSP factory (Section 3.03, Project
Agreement). However, more recent events have demonstrated the willingness of
GOB to move toward free-market pricing. In line with this change of policy,
IDA has recently made a recommendation to GOB on pricing of fertilizers under
Bangladesh Fertilizer Sector Review (Report No. 7145-BD) dated August 31,
1988, that would be based on a direct link to border prices and drop the
present cost-plus policy. Combined with the GOB's continuous efforts to
liberalize fertilizer marketing, IDA's pricing recommendation proposed
adjusting the ex-factory price of urea to the level of the international price
and capital restructuring as required for economically viable units. GOB's
recent decision to set uniform ex-factory prices for all units (except
Chittagong) is a step in the right direction, but there is a need for further
changes to reflect international prices.  With these developments, it would be
counterproductive for IDA to pursue its original pricing covenant objectives.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
5.1      The assumptions used in the calculation of the financial rate of
return (FRR) as well as the economic rate of return (ERR) are given in
Annex 4-1. The financial rate of return has been calculated using prices
adjusted to 1988 constant basis. The operating costs and revenues are given
in Annex 4-2. Since the project was rehabilitation of existing operating
plants, only the increments in cost and revenue as a result of the
rehabilitation program are considered in the financial and economic analysis.
Since the plant improvement expenditure for Fenchuganj forms only a small
portion (less than 10%) of the total project cost, finar.- Lal and economic
calculations have not been undertaken for Fenchuganj.
5.2      The FRR for the Chorasal subproject is now recalculated at 7%
compared to the appraisal estimate of 30%. The considerably lower FRR is
mainly due to (a) higher capital cest, (b) increased cost of natural gas than
projected at appraisal, (c) relatively insufficient adjustment of ex-factory
price to cover increasing production costs, and (d) the long delay in project
implementation. The Chittagong TSP subproject also shows a lower rate of
return at about 8% compared to the original estimate of 22%. The difference
is also due to (a) higher capital costs, (b) increased relative prices of
imported sulfur and phsophate rock, (c) introduction of a part of production
of TSP by using high-cost imported acid, land (d) implementation delays.
B. Financial Results and Covenants
5.3      Income statements and balance sheets for the project beneficiary
companies, UFFL, NGFF and TSP Complex as well as BCIC, are shown in
Annexes 5-1, 5-2, 5-3 and 5-4. The following table shows selected data for

While the operating rates of these companies have improved substantially after
the Rehabilitation Project, the level of profits has been well below those
projected at appraisal. Profit at UFFL and NGFF in 1987/88 remained at 6% and
9%, respectively, of operating margin compared to projected ratios of 32% and
20%, respectively. TSP Complex showed only 4% in 1987/88 compared to an
expected 32%. These low levels of profits largely result from the slow
adjustment to ex-factory prices. Price increases in late 1988 should
substantially increase profit levels of these companies to acceptable levels.
5.4      Two companies, UFFL and NGFF, are basically in compliance with
financial covenants as listed in para. 8.07 of the SAR. Although debt/equity
ratio of UFFL shows higher than required ratio of 60:40, it would be
acceptable based on the accounting procedures to record the outstanding long-
term foreign exchange loans converted at exchange rate prevailing at the end
of the financial year while the share capital, expressed in taka terms,
continues to be shown at its face value. If the urea price covenant had been
maintained, the financial condition of the two companies would have been much
better than indicated in the table. The TSP Complex has been a consistent
loser and has had difficulty in maintaining both debt/equity ratio and current
ratio. Particularly as to debt/equity ratio the company has lost nearly its
entire equity. The poor financial condition of the companies is mainly
explained by:
(a) the unwillingness of GOB to timely increases in the ex-factory prices
to reflect production cost increases;
(b) unsatisfactory operation and financial performance of these plants
during the implementation of the Rehabilitation Project.
During 1988, the GOB decided to raise fertilizer prices to cover production
costs and also to start capital restructuring of fertilizer companies. It is
expected that the financial situation of the three companies will improve
progressively to a satisfactory level. However, some financial restructuring
may be required, particularly for the TSP Complex. To adjust the debt:equity
ratio to 60:40 would require converting about Tk 220 million from debt to
equity. This restructuring would also adjust the other financial ratios to
acceptable levels.
5.5      During project implementation, UFFL and NGFF met their obligations
under the subsidiary loan agreements regarding terms and conditions of the on-
lending of the IDA credit (10% p.a. interest for 13 years inclusive of 3 years
grace). However, the TSP Complex could not fulfill its repayment obligations
due to its financial difficulties.
5.6      With respect to reporting obligations as outlined in para. 8.08 of
the SAR, all reports, particularly financial reports, were submitted with
substantial delay. However, quality was generally adequate to determine
progress and/or identify problem areas.

VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.1      For the economic analysis, tradeable items have been priced on the
basis of projected international prices adjusted for transportation and
handling charges. The economic price of natural gas is valued at its long-
term marginal cost (Tk 35/Kscft). The price of urea based on international
price and TSP based on its landed cost are projected to increase at 1988 real
terms as follows:
ECONOMIC PRICES OF UREA AND TSP
(in US$ in 1988 real terms)
1987/88        1988/89         1989/90        1994/95

imported TSP)             217             213            232             254
/a Export price minus inland transportation cost of $5/ton.
6.2      The project cost and benefit streams for the ERR are shown in
Annex 6-1.  The ERR for the Ghorasal subproject and the Chittagong subproject
are now calculated at 23% and 9%, respectively, which are considerably lower
than the appraisal estimate of 92% and 18%. The difference is mainly due to
(i) lower world fertilizer prices than projected at appraisal, particularly
for price of urea; (ii) higher economic costs of inputs, natural gas or
imported raw materials than projected; (iii) higher capital costs as discussed
in paras. 3.15 and 3.27; and (iv) delays in project implementation.
6.3      The following table shows estimated economic costs of production of
urea at Ghorasal plant and Fenchuganj plant on "sunk capital cost" basis.

La Does not include depreciation and interest charges.
/b Export price (US$169/ton) minus inland transportation of $5/ton.
6.4      The economic production costs of urea at Ghorasal and Fenchuganj are
below the export price of urea at Tk 5,166 per ton (US$164 per ton at the
prevailing exchange rate), thus the production of urea a: both plants are
economically viable and should continite to operate. The Ghorasal plant in
particular with the economic production costs of about half of the export
price is very competitive for export to the international market. The ability
of both plants to continue sustained, viable operation will depend on how well
the facilities are maintained, access to foreign exchange for needed inputs
and ultimately the quality of the management. Present indications are that
both these factors are satisfactory.
6.5      Estimated economic costs of production of TSP at Chittagong are
summarized in the following table.

/a  Does not include depreciation and interest charges.
6.6      The economic viability of domestic TSP production has been volatile
depending upon relative prices of imported sulfur and phosphate rock, interme-
diate phosphoric acid and finished product TSP. Production of TSP based
either on locally produced or imported phosphoric acid was not economically
viable in 1986/87 when prices of TSP were internationally depressed at around
US$144 per ton (Tk 4,440 per ton at the then prevailing exchange rate). With
changes in relative prices favorable for domestic production since late 1987,
with TSP prices at more than US$200 per ton, economic production costs of TSP
at present indicate that continued operation of the existing TSP facilities
should be economically viable.
6.7      The above economics of production are based on continuous production
at around 140,000 tons per year which has been made possible as a result of
the Rehabilitation Project. Among the investments, installation of facilities
for imported acid has increased the production capacity of TSP to that level
and also provided some flexibility in managing production costs when relative
prices of imported, sulfur and rock phosphate, phosphoric acid and TSP
fluctuate. This fluctuation is expected to continue and at times it will be
profitable to product TSP locally as is the case now based on phosphoric acid
imports or phosphate rock imports. When TSP prices decline, there can be
periods when it would be more economical to import than to produce it locally.
In that event, the company should temporarily cease production until prices
recover. The company now has the flexibility to change its production profile



- 25 -
to adjust to changing international prices. Given the history of the TSP
Complex, its very narrow economic margin, it is difficult to predict the long-
term sustainability of the operations.
B. Foreign Exchange Savings
6.8      The foreign exchange savings (Annex 6-2) over the 10-year life of the
project at Ghorasal and Chittagong before debt service on the foreign loens is
estimated at about US$136 million with annual savings of US$14 million in
constant 1988 dollars, which is about 54% of the appraisal estimate, due to
reasons explained in para. 6.2. While most of the materials used for
production of TSP are imported, production of urea at Ghorasal is almost
entirely based on locally obtained materials, earning 73% of total foreign
exchange savings. In the last three years (1985/86-1987/88) Gborasal plant
has actually exported about 28,000 tons of urea per year on average, realizing
about US$3 million of annual foreign exchange earnings.
C. Technology Transfer
6.9      The Project was managed and implemented by local management and staff
involving a large number of middle-level officers and workers. Working with
foreign process licensors and engineering contractors during the entire period
of the implementation, the project staff were able to absorb technology in the
various fields. Although considerable time was required for completion of the
project, positive results of the projeet have a significant effect on the
morale and confidence of plant managers and workers. The further development
of the fertilizer industry of Bangladesh should gain considerably from the
experience of the Rehabilitation Project.
D. Environmental AsDect
6.10     Major environmental problems at the Chittagong TSP plant including
(i) dust emission, (ii) sulfur oxide emissions and (iii) disposal of gypsum
have been solved through the Rehabilitation Project. The problem of dust
emission has been removed by installation of granulation facilities and
improved power supply and better equipment conditions solved sulfur oxide
emission problem. The disposal of gypsum is no longer a problem as discussed
earlier.
VII. SUSTAINABILITY
7.1      Data are not available for a full cost analysis necessary for a clear
assessment of the three projects' long-term sustainability. But from a
financial point of view, both Chorasal and TSP Chittagong show poor prospects
as their re-estimated incremental IRRs are only 7% and 8%, respectively.
Based on economic analysis, where the price of urea is based on international
export price and TSP price on landed cost (para. 6.1), the Ghorasal project
may be sustainable in the long run, but the TSP complex's long-term viability
is questionable at this stage. Calculated on a sunk cost basis, the ERRs of
Ghorasal and TSP Chittagong are 23% and 9%, respectively.



- 26 -
7.2      lhe IRR and ERR are not calculated for Fenchuganj as the improvement
expenditures for this plant were only a small portion (less than 10%) of the
total project cost and represented primarily maintenance expenditures. The
long-term sustainability of this rehabilitated plant will depend on its
ability to produce urea at the export equivalent value. To achieve this
performance, Fenchuganj will have to be well maintained. At present, the
projection of ammonium sulfate at Fenchuganj is not viable and has been
recommended to be stopped..2/
7.3      In the final analysis, the long-term sustainability of Ghorasal,
Fenchuganj and particularly Chittagong TSP will depend very much on the
management quality which in turn would depend on the ongoing restructuring of
BCIC and its individual fertilizer units. That restructuring is still not
fully effective.
VIII. IDA'S ROLE
8.1      From the time of its first involvement in the Bangladesh fertilizer
sector, IDA's major objective has been to stress to the GOB and the industry
managers the importance of priority for investments on the existing plants
that wouled maximize their output and improve their efficiency. IDA believed
that it is important for Bangladesh to stabilize production in existing
fertilizer plants in Fenchuganj, Ghorasal and Chittagong (TSP) through
appropriate investments before venturing on too large investments in new
production facilities. Possibly due to their uncertain confidence on the
benefits of such additional investments in these plants and the inherent
difficulties in adequately preparing such projects, there has been hesitation
in supporting a substantial rehabilitation program in the fertilizer
production sector. IDA played a major role in the preparation of the project
and in getting all-round support for it. The benefits of such a project to
the Bangladesh economy have already been established through improved
performance and confidence among the sector managers. It is believed that
this additional confidence will go a long way to achieve quicker commissioning
and improved performance with the newer projects.
8.2      As part of the preparation for this project, the GOB and IDA agreed
that it would be advantageous to improve the decision making powers of the
individual plants by spinning them off as individual companies with BCIC still
retaining overall coordination. This experiment has been partially successful
with the individual plants operating autonomously within agreed targets and
budgets. However, much more needs to be done to improve corporate management
and decision making.
8.3      The Government had agreed to a product pricing arrangement which
would require the Government periodically to review and set individual ex-
factory prices based on costs of production plus an appropriate return on
capital. Under a USAID project, it was agreed that ex-factory fertilizer
pricing would be based on average costs plus 4.75% return on capital employed.
a/ See Bangladesh, Fertilizer Paper Review, IBRD Report No. 7145-BD,
August 31, 1988, para. 4.22.



- 27 -
Based on subsequent rethinking and discussions, the Government is now moving
ex-factory fertilizer prices to border prices and carrying out restructuring
of the capital base as appropriate. However, actual movement in this
direction has been slower than desirable. IDA has endorsed this move toward
nonsubsidized, market-oriented pricing in the recent Fertilizer Sector Report
on Bangladesh.
8.4      Sharing the concern for providing the sector with well-trained and
experienced staff, the Government is implementing a program for setting up a
large national training center to cater to the needs of the entire chemical
and related industries. However, this component was dropped from the IDA
project due to excessive delays and is now being implemented through Dutch
aid.
IX. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
9.1      The economic benefits are considerably less than envisaged at the
time of appraisal. The project experienced considerable implementation
delays, and there were significant changes in project scope. But the project
has succeeded in achieving the objective of improving the overall performance
and efficiency of the plants at Fenchuganj, Chorasal and TSP Complex. There
was a longer delay in the implementation of the training component mainly due
to the desire of the Government to have a larger center and the wish to
finance it with grant funds. The compan%/BCIC staff gained considerable
confidence by undertaking direct responsibility for project execution using
consultant support where appropriate. They also became conversant with
international practices in design, engineering, procurement and project
management.
Lessons Learned
9.2      Major lessons learned during the implementation of the Fertilizer
Industry Rehabilitation Project are:
(a) For successful implementation, such a project requires efficient
decision making by both the Government and the project entity so
that there are minimum delays in the required approvals.
(b) The difficulties in preparing and implementing a rehabilitation
project should be fully recognized, and appropriate consultants
should be in place before the commencement of each component.
(c) The extent of such external help to be used for successful
project implementation should be identified during project
preparation and this help should be available to the project
without further constraints.
(d) Substantial delays between project identification and
implementation could result in significant scope changes since
the actual rehabilitation needs can change over time due to
changing prices and technology. Both the project entities and
the financing institutions should recognize this situation and



28 -
allow much more flexibility in scope and implementation schedule
in their plans and procedures.
(e) Since the projects are best implemented during scheduled
shutdowns so as to minimize losses in production, the
implementation schedules are likely to be somewhat stretched out
and there is need for more careful scheduling.
(f) There could be delays in the implementation of such
rehabilitation projects if the senior company managers are busy
with other larger projects--as in this case with the Ashuganj
and Chittagong Urea projects. This workload should be provided
for in structuring the project implementation organization.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Assumptions for Economic and Financial Rate of Return
1.   The financial price of natural gas is Tk 28.5 per Mscft, and the economic
price of natural gas is assumed to be Tk 35 per Mscft as the long-run
marginal cost in Bangladesh.
2.   Local variable costs are converted to September 1988 prices and assumed
to remain constant in 1988 terms.
3.   The plant facilities are assumed to operate for seven years after 1988.
Estimated production rate is 140,000 tons per year (tpy) for Chittagong
TSP plant and 310,000 tpy for Ghorasal plant. Production of TSP at
Chittagong is assumed to be 50? by own phosphoric acid and 50? by
imported acid.
4.   Economic costs of imported raw materials for TSP, sulfur, phosphate rock
and phosphoric acid (542 P205) are assumed as US$130/ton, US$60/ton and
US$232/ton, respectively.
5.   Economic prices of urea and TSP are based on the Bank's projected inter-
national urea prices and TSP prices. FOB price of urea (bagged Europe in
constant 1988 USS) is projected to change from the 1988 level of US$148/
ton to US$169/ton in 1989, US$213/ton in 1990 and US$198/ton in 1995.

Deducted from FOB prices an inland transportation costs (US$5/ton), thus
the economic prices of urea in 1988 terms is US$143 in 1988. US$164 in
1989, US$208 in 1990 and US$193 in 1995. FOB prices of TSP (bulk, US
gulf in constant 1988 US$) is projected to change from the 1988 level of
US$157/ton to US$153/ton in 1989, US$172/ton in 1990 and US$194/ton in
1995. Added to the FOB price are sea freight (US$35/ton), bagging costs
(US$15/ton) and port handling and unloading charges (US$10/ton). The
economic price of TSP thus calculated at 1988 terms is US$217/ton in
1988, US$213 in 1989, US$232 in 1990 and US$254 in 1995.

Coments on Urnft Project Completion Report on Fertilzer
Industry i(ehabiliatiozt Project ( Credit 1023 - OD ).
The draft Project Completion Report on FIRP (CredJit No. 1023-3D)
prepared by World Bank has been revicaed and our comments aro given helow s
1.   Financial and Economic Rate of Return s
In calculating tile FIPR & EIRR in the draft PCB of the World Dank
the assumptions made were realistic. The cumulative licremental production
was, however considered from 1988 to 1995, which resulted tn poor finan-
cil and economic rate of returns. It should be from 1983 to 1995 since
DCIC started acruing the benefits of FlRP from 1983.
2.   Sustainability of Rehabilitated Project :
Sustainability predicted in the draft PCR of World Daik may not
r6flect the actual situation, as the prgdiction was made on the basis of
low FIRR & EIRR calculated for 1988-1995 productive years instead of
1983 to 1995 production-years as mentioned earlier.
Furtler, taking Into account the present trend of development
towards more economic and efficient management of various enterprises
under BCIC and based on custilative experiences of operating sophisticated
fertilizer industries In this part of the world, there are definite
reasons to be optimistic In sustaining economic operation of the plant
under discussion.
3.   GENERAL COMlIENTS s
a) Fencbuganj Fertilizer Factory experienced difficulty in procuring
equipment which ore at present more or less obsolete in natuie.
This bad appreciable Impact on project completion time.
b) The objectives,nof all the three improvement projects were
fulfilled after lmplementntion and the benefits derived have been
discussed in details in tle PaR of respective project.
c) It is worth mentioning here that the problems or plant deffiie-n-
cies, Identified by the in-plant personnel were realistic and as
a result, the achievement after implementation was up to the
desired level.
4.   CONCLUSION :
We have no other comments to make in the draft PCR.
