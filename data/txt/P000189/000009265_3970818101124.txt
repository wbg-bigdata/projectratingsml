I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01         Burundi (see Map IBRD 18509) is a small landlocked country
situated south of the equator in Eastern Africa between Zaire and Tanzania,
about 1,400 km from the Indian Ocean.  The country has an area of only
27,800 square kilometers and its terrain is dominated by a hilly central
plateau giving way to marshy valleys In the north and east and a low-lying
plain in the west.  There is sufficient rainfall in most areas to support
agriculture. The generally rugged terrain, the scattered settlement pat-
terns as well as its landlocked position have contributed to shaping its
transport infrastructure.
1.02      With approximately 4.3 million population growing at a high rate
of 2.7% p.a.- Burundi is one of the most densely populated countries in the
world (155 inhaBitants per sq. km). About 95% of the population live in
rural areas as small farmers who depend mainly on subsistence agriculture
and on one principal cash crop, coffee, which provides the major source of
foreign exchange Sor the country. Almost half of the population is concen-
trated in the Bujumbura-Ngozi-Muyinga-Gitega area which produces most of
the country's coffee. Gross National Product (GNP) per capita, estimated
at US$240 in 1983, is among the world's lowest. Agriculture is the main
economic activity contributing about 60% of GNP. Mining and industrial ac-
tivity is very limited (about 1OZ of GNP).  Burundi export earnings (90% of
which come from coffee) are insufficient to cover the foreign exchange re-
quirements of the economy and have to be supplemented by substantial exter-
nal aid flows.
1.03      Recent economic performance has not been impressive.  During the
implementation of the Third Development Plan (1978-1982) per capita GNP
grew on average at less than 1.0% p.a.; in 1983, the first year of the
Fourth Plan (1983-1987), per capita GNP fell in real terms and Burundi has
been facing serious economic difficulties. Budgetary funds to finance in-
vestment expenditure are becoming scarce, including those for counterpart
financing. Financing of recurrent costs has also been affected. The prin-
cipal causes of the financial problems are: (a) the deterioration of the
external terms of trade (by 75% between 1977 and 1982) reflecting the fall
in the international price of coffee which used to represent about 3O0 of
Government revenues (in 1982 it fell to less than 5%) and the doubling in
import prices; and (b) delayed response of the Government to the changing
economic environment.



-2-
1.04      Increased demand for hard currencies for infrastructure projects
and for import substitution industries have resulted in large deficits in
the external current account. These deficits have only partially been off-
set by external aid flows; the rest have been covered by a rundown in
foreign reserves.  Current expenditures have grown fast and the budgetary
surplus, which in 1977 had financed about half of the public investment
program, declined in 1981-82 to 10-12% of public capital expenditures. The
Government is trying to confront these problems and has requested IMF as-
sistance.   Nevertheless, both the public finance and the balance of pay-
ments problems are likely to remain for several years, as they are caused
by internal structural constraints (e.g. scarce resources, small market,
weak economic management) and external constraints (e.g. deterioration of
the terms of trade, poor prospects for external aid growth) which can only
be remedied in the long run.
1.05       The prevailing economic situation in Burundi has been taken into
consideration in designing the proposed program and its financing.  At a
time of financial austerity priorities in the transport sector need to be
c0refully determined. Maintenance of existing transport infrastructure has
became a very high priority resulting in the road strengthening/maintenAmce
program which is included in the proposed program (para. 2.02).
B. The Transport System
1.06       The transport system in Burundi consists of about 5,400 km of
roads and tracks, of which 2,900 km represent the classified road network,
the port of Bujumbura and an international airport at Bujumbura. There are
no railways or navigable rivers. Lake Tanganyika is mostly used for inter-
national transport .o and from the port of Kigoma (Tanzania).   National
transport is therefore entirely dependent on the highway network. Being a
landlocked country far from ocean ports, Burundi's economic development de-
pends to a great extent on its external transport links.
External Transport
1.07       Burundi's external trade is mostly with developed countries and
to a much lesser extent with its neighbors. The country's external trade
has grown markedly in recent years; however, its volumes are still rela-
tively small and during the 1980-82 period imports averaged about 175,000
tons p.a. while exports totalled about 32,000 tons (coffee, 26,000 tons)
p.a.. The clear imbalance between the in-bound (85Z) and out-bound (15%)
traffic and highly seasonal nature of coffee exports affect transport
costs. External trade is expected to grow at about 3-4% p.a. and the trade
flow will continue to be imbalanced.
1.08         The major transport problem for landlocked Burundi is its
dependence on neighboring countries' transport facilities for access to the
Indian Ocean ports.  Two main corridors are now used:  the northern all-
road or a road/rail route via Kigali-Kampala to Mombasa (2,022 km by road,
or 2,273 km by road/rail); and the southern lake/rail connection via Bujum-
bura and Kigoma to Dar-es-Salaam (1,428 km). Historically, four-fifths of



3-
Burundi's international traffic had moved along the shorter southern
route. However, because of capacity problems and bottlenecks on the Tanza-
nia railways and in the port of Dar-es-Salaam, over 50X of Burundi's exter-
nal trade has been routed through Mombasa in recent years.  The northern
route also has problems.  Efficient operations are constrained by cumber-
some administrative procedures, while the railway through Uganda has not
been reliable.  Recent improvement ln Tanzanian rail service may attract
more traffic; in December 1982 direct trains exclusively carrying Burundi
traffic between the port of Kigoma and Dar-es-Salaam were Introduced, al-
though not on a regular basis.
1.09         The bottlenecks on the access routes serving Burundi have
increased the cost of transport (FBu 24,000-29,000 per ton of general car-
go), but Burundi itself cannot improve the efficiency of either route
since:   (i) only a fraction of the transport infrastructure is within
Burundi's control; (ii) the volume of Burundi traffic is too low to give it
meaningful leverage in transport decisions on the international routes. In
order to further assist Burundi (and Rwanda) in assessing the relevant ad-
vantages of their existing and potential routes and in identifying the ac-
tions and investments required to improve the performance of those routes,
the Bank in 1980 prepared a study of the external transport connections of
the two countries. A more extensive study covering turundi, Rwanda, Uganda
and eastern Zaire has been carried out by UNCTAD.  The findings and recom-
mendations of these studies have assisted the countries concerned and donor
agencies to agree on 'ction and priority investments.  Several bilateral
and multilateral mee.ings led, inter alia, to the Northern Corridor Transit
Agreement reached in Kampala in September 1984. For the immediate future
the agreement will result in significant simplification of customs proce-
dures at border crossings.  The agreement also created the framework for
resolving other matters which would facilitate international transport on
the corridor. For Burundi priority attention should now be given to ii-
proving operations on the southern corridor. IDA is currently preparing a
report which will update and review the actions taken so far and will try
to define priority policies and investments in regard to international
transport (para. 1.44).
Highways
1.10      Details of the highway subsector are given in Subchapter C.
Port and Lake Transport
1.11      The port of Bujumbura (POB) is run by a private, mostly foreign-
owned, enterprIse.  Fixed installations at the port are state-owned while
the handling facilities and the warehouses are owned by POB. According to
a convention signed by the two parties, the Government is to take over the
port in 1997.  At present, there are three expatriates in POB (general
manager, chief accountant, and workshop head).  POB operates under the
supervision of the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications (MTT) and
utillzes about 30? of the estimated annual port capacity of 450,000 tons.



-4-
In the period 1980-83 the traffic In the port stagnated at the level of
140-150,000 tons p.a. (Annex 1. Table 1).  POB is adequately managed aad
operating at a profit which was FBu 18 million (US$200,000 equivalent)1/
in 1983, 14% of total port revenue for the year.
1.12         Trarsport on Lake Tanganyika betwpen Bujumbura and ports in
Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire is handled by ARNCLAC, a private company 102
owned by the Government.   The share of traffic on the lake is as follows:
672 Tanzania, 202 Zambia and 13% Zaire. The fleet is old and unsuited to
modern transport; it consists of five tugs (90 h.p. - 700 h.p.) and ten
barges with a total capacity of 4,300 tons. ARNOLAC is adequately managed
and is operating at a profit which in 1983 reached FBu 23.5 million
(US$261,000 equivalent).
1.13        Under the Fourth Development Plan, the Government intends to
undertake major livestments In port and lake transport, which would permit
greater use of the southern route via Tanzania; the investment program Ia-
cludes a ferry boat project, repair of exieting fixed Installations
(berths), and contalner/handling facilities, construction of a shipyard and
new storage area (Table 1.5).  A port master plan study financed by France
is expected to be completed In 1985. At negotlations, It was agreed that
the Association will be given an opportunity to comment upon the findings
of the port master plan study and that the Government will ensure that any
investments in the port and lake transport are economically justified
(para. 4.01(a)).
Civil Aviation
1.14      In view of the small size of the country, air transport primarily
serves Burundi's extermal transport needs. There is an international air-
port near Bujumbura, capable of handling wide-body aircraft; a new terminal
building to replace the existing small one is being completed.   Another
small airfield is located near Kirundo in the north (tourist area), but
there are no scheduled flights. Bujumbura airport is equipped for 24 hour
operations and provides service to Europe and the capitals of neighboring
African countries.  The airport is served by seven European and African
airline companies.   In the period 1980-1983, passenger traffic has been
growing at a modest annual average rate of 4Z, reaching about 44,000 pas-
sengers in 1983.  Frelght traffic, however, has been increasing at a rate
of 11% p.a. and reached 7,500 tons in 1983 (Annex 1, Table 2).  Neverthe-
less, in absolute terms the volume remains small.
1.15       The international airport Is run by a parastatal company under
MTT authority. The company Is assisted by seven expatriates provided under
bilateral aid programs from Belgium and France. Air Burundi (AB), the na-
tional airline, created in 1977 is owned by the state. AB also operates
under MTT authority and owns two Twin-Otters providing service to Kigali
(Rwanda), Kalimi (Zaire) and Kirundo. Seat occupancy rate is around 50-602
and is not satisfactory. Nevertheless, AB operates at a profit mostly due
to Its monopoly on aviation fuel sales in Burundi. Total profit made in
1/ Rate of US$1 - FBu 90 was applied In SAR for the period prior to the
end of 1983.



-5-
1981 and 1982 combined was about FBu 107 million (US$1.19 million equiLva-
lent).
C. The Highway Subs ector
(i) The Network
1.16       The classified road network totals about 2,900 1=, of which 744
km (26Z) are paved and 486 km (17%) -are of low engineered gravel standard;
the rest are earth roads and tracks. In addition, there are about 2,500 km
of unclassified earth tracks (Table 1.1). During the period 1979-84 due to
an Intensive road construction/improvement program the standard of the road
network has Improved markedly; the paved road network increased by 2.6
tines while the earth road network was reduced by 870 km or by 34%. Road
density Is about 0.2 km/km2 or 1.3 km per 1,000 Inhabitants; the latter is
somewhat below the average for East Afrlcan countries.

1.17      The classified road network, under Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
responsibility, is divided into national roads (all paved), roads of gene-
ral interest (secondary roads), and provincial roads. The classified net-
work has adequate length and coverage but its condition is not satisfacto-
ry, varying from poor to good. The network consists of extensive mileage
of urengineered earth and gravel roads of varying widths ranging from four
to seven meters.  The paved road network is relatively new and most of it
is presently in fair to good condition; to avoid costly repairs and recon-
struction in the future, early attention to road maintenance is required.
Due to the country's difficult terrain, geotechnical conditions and heavy
rains, construction and maintenance costs are high. To protect past road
investments and prevent vehicle operating costs from rising excessively,
road maintenance operatioLs should be sustained.   Maintenance   efforts
started under tae Second and Third Highway Projects (paras.1.47-1.47), are
to continue on a larger scale under the proposed program (para. 2.02).
(ii) Road Use
Vehicle Fleet and Traffic
1.18     The motor vehicle fleet reached 15,500 vehicles in 1983, of which
about 1,500 were owned by the Government (Table 1.2). In relation to the
size of the population, there were 3.6 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants which
is on the low side for East African countries. Over the 1978-83 period the
fleet was growing at a high average annual rate of 10.32. The privately
owned vehicle fleet in 1983 was dominated by passenger cars, situated mainr
ly in Bujumbura, making up 53Z of the fleet, pickups and station wagons
24Z, trucks 102, buses 5Z, while the balance were four-wheel drive vehi-
cles. The major increase in the period was recorded for buses which had
been in short supply; they increased over eight fold in the five year peri-
od.

1.19       There were no regular traffic counts until 1982, when under the
Third Highway Project systematic traffic counts started on the national and
secondary roads.  The counts cover about 1,800 km of the classified network
and are carried out by the General Directorate of Roads (GDR).  The traffic
volumes are generally light, rarely exceeding 500 vehicles per day (vpd).
The highest traffic levels are found on the paved roads radiating from
Bujumbura. A significant part of the network, however, has traffic volumes
of less than 200 vpd.
Fuel Consumption and Price
1.20      Over the period 1979-83 the consumption of gasoline increased at
an average rate of 5.5% p.a., while consumption of diesel fuel grew at a
high rate of about 14.4% p.a. (Annex 1; Table 3), mostly due to a major in-
crease in the number of buses.   Import of fuel is done by foreign-owaed
companies (BP, Mobil and FINA) from the refinery in Mombasa (Kenya). Fuel
storage capacity in Burundi exceeds 20 million liters and is adequate.
1.21       The retail fuel prices in Burundi are high, mostly due to the
high transport cost caused by the country's distance from the ocean ports.
The retail price of gasoline (super) is US$0.85 per liter, or US$3.21 per
US gallon, and of diesel fuel US$0.76 per liter, or US$2.87 per US gallon
(Table 1.3). There are no Government subsidies of the price and its inter-
nal taxation appears moderate. Import duties and taxes on fuel, about 32Z
of CIF Bujumbura price for gasoline and about 20% for diesel fuel, are im-
portant -sources of Government revenue from road users.

Road Transport Industry
1.22        The industry is dominated by about 250 small private trucker/
traders carrying mixed loads of goods and passengers.  In addition, the
Government owned company TOB (Transport Office of Burundi) provides both
freight and passenger transport and since 1981 has been undertaking inter-
national road transport service as well. Entry in the transport industry
is free and routes are not regulated except for TOB. Although the Govern-
ment sets official tariffs, those for freight transport are not observed by
private carriers and are determined by supply ana deasnd; TOB, however,
whose internal freight transport is only a fraction of its aperations, ob-
serves the tariffs.
1.23        TOB handles about 25% of passenger transport, 5% of internal
freight transport and a part of Burundi's long distance freight transport;
the balance is made up by private carriers. TOB also provides in-city bus
services in the capital as well as in the second largest town - Gitega -
and between several regional centers.  Its fleet of 60 buses has an average
seat occupancy of about 75L  Its passenger transport operations have accu-
mmlated losses which in 1983 reached F3u 110 million (US$1.24 million equi-
valent), while the internal freight department had a loss of about 28 mil-
lion FBu (US$311,000 equivalent); the Government intends to phase out the
latter operation. However, in its international transport operations TOB
is breaking even. It has 34 truck trailers and 21 tankers; the average age
of the fleet is about three years.  However, its capacity utilization is.
barely over 50 and is not satisfactory.



-9-
1.24      Although low tariffs (from 1981) set by the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry are a significant factor in explaining the losses, inefficient
operations and other problems (foreign exchange controls, lack of well or-
ganized freight forwarding operations in Mombasa, etc.) are also responsi-
ble for TOB.s Door financial performance.  The international freight de-
partment of TrGz is presently assisted by four expatriates (in operations,
planning, finance and in workshop management) under an aid program from
Germany (FRG); the technical assistance is scheduled to last until 1987.
For long distance transport, however, truckers from neighboring countries,
particularly Kenya, dominate Burundi's export/import traffic on the
northern route. It is est-iated that only about one quarter of the total
freight transported on the route is handled by TOB and a dozen private
Burundian carriers. The situation in the industry is expected to improve
in the future. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is to revise tariffs
for passenger and international long-distance transport. TOB intends to
improve its long distance freight transport by establishing a clearing
agency In Mombasa. Furthermore, In order to further facilitate its inter-
national transit traffic, Burundi will need to continue negotiating appro-
priate agreements with neighboring countries.
Vehicle Regulations
1.25      There are no major problems with vehicle weight and dimensions in
regard to the road network, since trucks tend to be small in size on most
roads. Heavier vehicles are used, however, on the Bujumbura-Rwanda border
road (RNI) to Kigali and Mombasa which handles Burundi's long distance
traffic. To control the weight on that road there is a weighing station.
Under the present Road Act the maxlmum permissible load per single axle is
8 tons. New vehicle welght legislation is being prepared in coordination
with relevant legislations in Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya which will allow 10
tons per axle. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government
will furnish to IDA by June 30, 1986 the proposal of new legislation on
axle-load limits; the Government also agreed to take measures satisfactory
co the Association to enforce the axle load limits approved by the Associa-
tion (para. 4.01 (b)). Technical inspection of vehicles is adequate and is
under the responsibility of BTA (Burundi Transport Association); a parasta-
tal company under MTT authority. The inspection is done annually except
for public passenger transport vehicles (taxis and buses) where the inspec-
tion is required four times per year.
(iii) Administration, Staffing and Training
1.26       The MPW through its General Directorate of Roads (GDR) has full
responsibility for design, construction and maintenance of the classified
road network and the urban roads in Bujumbura. The GDR has three Technical
Departments (see Chart 1): (a) the Department of Design and Control (DDC)
in charge of carrying out and supervising feasibility and detailed engi-
neering studies and supervising construction works; (b) the Department of
Works (DW) in charge of road and bridge maintenance and the improvement and
maintenance of urban roads in Bujumbura; and (c) the Department of Admini-
stration and Finance (DAF) in charge of finance and personnel. The organi-
zational structure of the GDR is sound. The remaining network of approxi-
mately 2,500 km of the unclassified earth tracks Is the responsibility of



- 10 -
the district authorities. Maintenance and improvements of these roads are
carried out on a voluntary basis, with GDR providing some assistance in
emergency cases.  These arrangements, although not optimfal, are adequate
for the existing and foreseen low level of traffic carried by these roads.
1.27      GDR employees number about 2,700 including 1,760 daily unskilled
laborers and 936 on contract. Of the latter, about 784 are semi-skilled
and unskilled laborers, 134 technicians and 18 managers. There are only
five engineers in DGR who occupy managerial positions.  CDR is  short of
qualified staff and needs at least 20 engineers to staff its technical
divisions with nationals.  To fill this gap in the medium term, GDR uti-
lizes technical assistance from France, Belgium, FRG and that provided un-
der IDA-financed projects.
1.28        All five engineers and most of the technicians were trained
abroad; a few technicians were trained in Burundi institutions such as the
Public Works School (PWS) created under the IDA Second Education Project
(Credit 1976-BU). The Government is making efforts to overcome the short-
age of Burundi nationals for higher level positions by offering scholar-
ships abroad to qualified high school students. The Technical Institute at
the University in Bujumbura, created in 1982, is scheduled to graduate
starting in June 1987 about 10 to 15 engineers a year in each of the fields
of civil, mechanical and electrical engineering. Under the three previous
highway projects, efforts were made to assist GDR in training its person-
nel. Technical staff have been trained in the Rushubi and Gitega training
centers,created under the previous projects; about 100 technicians (equip-
ment operators, mechanics and drivers) were trained in the Rushubi Center
and about 300 semi-skilled laborers in the labor-intensive center in
Gitega.  In addition, about 50 technicians in civil engineering and land
survey graduate each year from PUS. However, these efforts are being ham-
pered by the fact that most of the returning engineers and more than half
of the personnel trained in Rushubi and Gitega have joined the private sec-
tor where salary levels are higher or have set up their own businesses.
Therefore, there is still a shortage of trained personnel in GDR, and sus-
tained training efforts would thus continue under the proposed project
(para. 2.11) to fill the needs of both the public and private sectors of
the economy.
(iv) Planning
1.29        The Ministry of Public Works, through GDR, is responsible for
planning construction and maintenance of the classified road network and of
urban roads and streets in the capital. Through its recently established
Planning Unit in DDC, GDR is gradually improving its capacity to prepare
the road maintenance and construction programs; under the proposed project
further assistance would be given.
1.30       Under the Third Highway Project a transport economist was pro-
vided in 1983 to assist the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications in
transport planning and coordination.  It was agreed that as part of his
two-year assignment the expert would also assist GDR in providing economic
expertise as required.  GDR, however, has no adequate counterpart staff



(economist, statistician). At negotiations the Government agreed therefore
to appoint adequate local staff to serve as counterparts to technical as-
sistance staff included in the project (para. 2.17).
(v) Finaucing
1.31       Revenues from road user charges have been growing at about 14%
per annum in the period 1979-83, reaching FBu 888 million (Annex 1, Table
4) in 1983 (US$9.86 million equivalent). The total revenue exceeds actual
annual expenditures for road maintenance as well as the recommended in-
creased local funding of road maintenance (para. 1.33). In general, the
revenues are also sufficient to cover the Government's small participation
in funding of new road constructiou.  However, with the exr-eption of the
Road Fund Tax (para. 1.34) all these revenues go to the Government's gene-
ral budget.
1.32      In the period 1980-83, including external aid, about 832 of total
expenditures for roads were made for new construction and only 172 for road
maintenance.  Since the road network is generally well developed, while
roads conditions are not satisfactory, a change in empbasis in the Govera-
ment's policy towards the road subsector is therefore warrauted; couse-
quently, iwvestments in new road construction need to be screened carefully
(para. 1.42).  The Governmeat agreed at negotiations that it wllI give
priority to maintenance over new construction in allocating funds to its
highway sector (para. 4.01(c)).
1.33       New road construction, for which a high proportiou of the cost
(over 901) is met by external sources, is financed from the capital
budget.   Routine maintenance of the classified road network is fiuanced
from the recurrent budget, while periodic maintenance, construction of
workshops and training are funded through the capital budget. Expenditures
for highways in the period 1980-84 are shown in Table 1.4.  During the
period 1983-84, the annual local funding of road maintenance was only about
FBu 310-320 million which covered about 50Z of estimated road maintenance
needs; additional fundiag was made available from external financing.  In
1985 the Government's funding of road maintenance is expected, however, to
be markedly increased, siace about FBu 410 million was allocated in the
budget for road maintenance. At negotiations it was agreed that in the
last quarter of each fiscal year the Borrower will consult with the Asso-
ciation oa increasing its annual road maintenance recurrent budgetary allo-
cation for the next fiscal year as well as the level of the Road Fund Tax
in order to ensure that expenditures for maintenance reach adequate levels
with a minimum of US$4.0 million equivalent (FBu 468 million) in 1985
prices and that the minimum amount will be appropriately increased in sub-
sequent years. The Association will also be given an opportunity to review
GDR annual budgets for the coming fiscal years (para. 4.01 (c)).

1.34       Routine aud periodic road maintenance is financed by the recur-
rent and capital budget and by the Road Fund created in 1979. As of Janua-
ry 1, 1984, the financial procedure for channelling the portion of funds
given to GDR was simplified. A special account for GDR was created in the
Central Bank to directly receive *esenues from the Road Fund tax (FBu 5.0
per liter of fuel). The Road Fund tax is small (about 5% of retail fuel
price) and its total annual revenue is about FBu 170 million. To cover the
increasing participation of the Government in road maintenance, at negotia-
tions the Governmeut agreed that it wlll consult IDA on the level of in-
crease of the tax in order to ensure that expenditures for road maintenance
will reach adequate levels. The future Road Fund tax increase should not
.necessarily affect the retail price of fuel, since restructuring of various
taxes on fuel could be carried out. Furthermore, in order to make the use
of available funds more efficient, at negotiations the Governmant agreed
that all funds for road. maintenance will be chagmelled to the special ac-
count opened in the Central Bank and that the proceeds of that account
would be used to finance Government counterpart funding of the proposed
project (para. 4.0i(d)).

(vi) Engineering, Construction and Maintenance
1.35      DDC is responsible for road design and is headed by a Burundi en-
gineer.  Due to the shortage of local engineers and skilled technicians,
DDC is supported by technical assistance staff from France, Belgium and FRG
and those financed under IDA projects. Its design and supervisory capacity
is limited to .raall and medium-scale projects. The studies for large pro-
jects as well as construction supervision are carried out by expatria.e
consultants.  It is expected that the ongoing trainD-g program at the PWS
In Gitega will provide DDC with more trained staff. Goverment's National
Laboratory of Public Works (NLPW) is now carrying out most soils and mate-
rials studies for design and construction supervision of civil works both
f-r the public and private sectors.   NLPW has been improved under the
Second Highway Project (Credit 773-BU) which financed, inter alia, a new
soils laboratory, an administrative building and equipment.   French aid
wbich has funded training of NLPW staff will continue to provide technical
assistance and training to NLPW for another three years.
1.36      Road construction Is generally carried out by contract awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding.  Some improvement and betterment works
are carrIad out by DW brigades (para. 1.37). The construction industry is
dominated by foreign contractors who carry out most of the building and
road works.   Domestic contractors carry out some building construction
and are involved in supplying materials and constructing minor drainage
structures and road protection works. They obtain contracts through either
joint ventures or sub-contracting from foreign contractors or DW brigades.
This practice would continue under the project. The Government encourages
the use of labox-intensive methods for the construction of feeder roads.
USAID is providing organization and financing of these works while IDA, un-
der the Third Highway Project (Credit 1132-BU), has provided technical as-
sistance.   So far about 60 km of feeder roads have been satisfactorily
built. The USAID is continuing its support under its second project for
the execution of another 60 km; the proposed project would fund necessary
technical assistance (Para. 2.16).
1.37      DV carries out all road maintenance works by force account except
periodic resurfacing of paved roads. Maintenance of earth roads is carried
out by four mobile brigades based and managed from Bujumbura. Two of these
brigades carry out regravelling and Improvement operations while the other
two do routine maintenance, spot regravelllug and improvement and regrading
and vaintenance of drainage structures. Most of the equipment for the bri-
gades was provided under the three previous highway projects financed by
.IDA, Japan Overseas Economic Cooperation and United Nations Capital Deve-
lopment Pund.   These projects financed operating costs of regravelling/
improvement brigades, while the operating costs of the routine maintenance
brigades were funded by the Government. The patching and reseallng works
on paved roads are sporadically carried out by an ill-equipped brigade. As
the paved road network is relatively new, the previous IDA projects did not



- 14 -
provide for its maintenance.   However, a study was carried out under the
Third Highway Project to assess road maintenance needs. The 3tudy identi-
fied the priority road network to be maintained, works to be carried out by
contract and by force account, the needs for equipment, materials and sup-
plies, the training needs of GDR personnel and technical assistance re-
quirements. The study's findings were reviewed by the Government and IDA,
and were used to design a three-year program under the proposed project
(para.  2.02).    The  entire  road  network  sporadically  receives  labor-
intensive "cantonnage"  routine maintenance works including filling pot-
holes, cleaning ditches and culverts, painting bridges, and cleaning shoul-
ders.
1.38       The maintenance operations are hampered by: (a) the costly and
disruptive practice of basing all the brigades in Bujumbura and dispatching
them to the regions; and (b) lack of funds for rperations. The Government
has been compelled to reduce by one half the 'cantonnage" labor force. The
reduction of materials and supplies has resulted in the rapid deterioration
of equipment.  Therefore, maintenance of the road network is now insuffi-
cient. The proposed project would thus strengthen and expand the efforts
begun under the previous projects by permanentlv basing the brigades In the
country's four regions, i.e., Bujumbura, Gitegu, Bururl and Ngozi and pro-
viding the necessary equipment, materials, supplies and adequate and timely
financing.
D. Transport Sector Management, Policy and Issues
1.39      Transport sector management in Burundi needs improvement, espe-
cially coordination of road, port and lake transrort development.   The
Ministry of Planning (NP) provides an overview of the development of the
country's economy including the transport sector; however, MP lacks ade-
quate staff to make a meaningful contribution to sectoral planning. Res-
ponsibility for the management of the transport sector is divided between
MPW for roads and MTT for other transport modes. Neitcher of the two mini-
stries has adequate staff to carry out planning and coordination of trans-
port investments and management of the sector.   Under the Third Highway
Project, a transport economist has been provided to assist both NTT and MPW
in: (a) planning future investment needs, (b) advising on policy matters,
and (c) reviewing the feasibility of specific projects in the sector.
1.40       Since the capacity for transport planning and coordination has
not yet been established, the project would continue assistance to MTT and
MPW for another two years starting in 1985/86 (para. 2.17).  In addition to
institution building in MTT and MPW which will be required for some time,
in the mid-term period IDA would concentrate in Improving road maintenance
operations in the country through reorganized DW of NPW.  In addition, IDA
strategy in the sector would include further assistance in training, both
locally and abroad, of MPM and NTT staff and in construction of secondary
roads needed for the coumtry's economic development.

1.41       The Government policy for the sector is not clearly established.
Based on the projects listed in the 1983-87 development plan, however,
Government's strategy in the transport sector could be summarized as fol-
lows:  (i) upgrading the existing road network to support the productive
sectors of the economy;  (ii) improving road access to the international
routes leading to ocean ports; and (iii) improving and expanding transport
facilities on Lake Tanganyika for international trassport.
1.42      Although these general objectives for the transport sector appear
reasonable, more attention should be given to selection of priorities and
the rationale of specific projects.   In the five-year period, about FBu
17.5 billion (US$150 million equivalent) in constant 1981 prices has been
earmarked for the transport sector (Table 1.5). The share of the sector in
the total capital investments to the economy is reasonable (16.3%). Most
of the capital investment (79%) was planued for construction/upgrading of
ten roads with a total length of about 480 km. During the plan implemeuta-
tion construction of five roads totalling about 175 km is being completed
(construction of some roads actually started before 1983), while some roads
were deleted. In a revised investment program for roads covering the peri-
od 1985-88, the pace of new road construction is slowed down markedly.
Now, there are only two new road construction projects for which the con-
sultants' calculated economic rates of return exceed the estimated opportu-
nity cost of capital ia Burundi.  Most of the roads included in the program
are those whose construction is being completed or those which are to be
rehabilitated and strengthened. Specifically, following the Association's
advice,  the Government postponed the construction of one of the roads
(Gitega-Ngozi, 81 km) to paved road standard; a stage improvement was found
more appropriate and the road will be improved to gravel standard under the
project.  The future use of limited resources for the sector needs to be
carefully scrutinized. In addition to roads (para. 1.43), that is also re-
levant to the projects envisaged il the port and lake transport (para.
1.13).

1.43      At a time of financial austerity in Burundi, any new iavestments
in roads should be carefully evaluated.  During project implementation an
updated three-year investment program will be submitted annually to IDA for
its ,review ald approval. Furthermore, to monitor Government investments in
new road coustruction, the Association will review the economic viability
of all proposals for new road projects exceeding US$3 mill-ion equivalent
prior to any decision on the construction being made (para. 4.01(e)).



- 17 -
1.44        With regard to the iLssues related to Burundi's access to the
ocean, the Association is preparing a review of the lnternatiocal transport
of Burundi and Rwanda to help identify action and investments required to
improve their performance on international routes. The focus of the report
will be to define the future priority policies and investment needs; the
report will be completed in FY 1985.
E. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Highway Subsector
1.45       The Association's three previous road projects in Burundi have
assisted Government in training Roads Department staff, institution build-
ing particularly for maintenance activities, and improving the road net-
work.   The Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 467-BU, US$5.0 million,
1974) had its origin in a 1970 engineering credit (Sll-BU) which financed
consultants to carry out a study of Burundi's highway maintenance needs.
The project helped fiuance the preparation and implementation of a four-
year maintenance program, including the establishment of a labor intensive
road maintenance organization C'cantonnage') and one mechanized maintenance
brlgade, and the provision of technical assistance for these activities and
for the training of local staff. The project also included studies for fu-
ture highway development which was carried out under the Second Highway
project.  The Maintenance Project, completed in September 1980 (PCR dated
September 25, 1981) significantly improved the "cantonnage" road mainte-
nance organization and also provided an impetus to the Government to allo-
cate adequate more funds for road maintenance.
1.46       The Second Highway Project (Cr. 773-BU, US$14 million, 1978)
provided for the paving of a major national road, (Bujumbura-Rugombo, 65
kim), the start-up phase of an improvement program for selected secondary
roads and bridges, the construction of a new central laboratory, strength-
ening of the mechanized maintenance brigade and the provision of technical
assistance and road equipment. The project was completed in July 1983 and
the road maintenance components of the project have generally met their
institution-building objectives in training and organization of road main-
tenance operation. The road construction components had cost overruns of
over 50% compared to the original estimate; this was caused by serious dis-
ruption in international transport in the region during hostilities in
Uganda in 1979.
1.47       The Third Highway Project (Cr. 1132-BU, US$25 million, 1981)
includes improvement of selected secondary and tertiary roads (360 km),
procurement of additional equipment for the existing mechanized brigade and
for a second mechanized brigade, the construction to two-lane paved stan-
dard of the Ngozi-Kobero road (39 km), and consultants' services to assist
in road maintenance operations  transport planning and on-the-job training
of local staff. This project is about 802 completed and is meeting its ob-
jectives in road construction and maintenance and in training of MPW per-
sonnel.



- 18 -
1.48      The Association also assisted the Interuational Transport Company
(INTRACO), engaged in road transport to and from Mombasa (Kenya), to help
reduce Burundi's dependence on the transport route through Tanzania.  Under
Development Bauk Project (Cr. 731-BU, US$3.4 million, 1978) IDA assisted
INTRACO with purchase of necessary trucks. After INTRACO became insolvent
in 1980, the Government liquidated the company and the funds provided under
the Credit were used by TOB (Transport Office of Burundi), the only para-
statal company in road transport.
1.49       The lessons learned in the above projects showed that: (i) road
maintenance in Burundi needs further external assistance and a higher level
of domestic financiug; (ii) labor-intensive techniques could be very effec-
tive in carrying out the road maintenance operations while the teaching of
these techniques was institutionalized through the creation of a training
center for 'cantonniers' in Gitega; and (iii) in view of the growing need
for trained personnel in both the public and private sectors, training pro-
grams would have to go beyond the highway sub-sector to cover the transport
sector as a whole.   The proposed project will thus continue efforts made
to: (i) Improve key road links to support the country's economic develop-
ment; (ii) expand and improve road maintenance operations; and (iII) train
local personnel.
1.50        The proposed project is also geared to improving Institution
building in MPW and MTT, transport planning and policy and investment
decision-making in the sector.  IDA will monitor not only road maintenance
expenditures (para. 1.33) but will also review capital Investments in roads
(para. 1.43) and in the port and lake transport (para. 1.13). Cousequent-
ly, in addition to ugently needed improvement of the road network, the pro-
ject seeks to ensure that available resources for the sector are used for
investments with the necessary economic justification and prlority.

II. THE PROJECT
ObJectives
2.01       The road network of Burundi is approaching a size where It can
meet the country's general economic and social needs.  The Government is
now expected to concentrate Its major efforts on malitaining this important
national asset. A three-year Government program Was prepared to: (1) con-
tinue efforts begun under previous IDA financed projects to Increase MPW's
capacity to saintain its road network; (11) expand.road maintenance opera--
tions to cover both -srth and paved road networks; (iII) izprove transport
planning and coordiL._ion; and (iv) train local staff. The Government pro-
gram is presented under (1.), while Its part to be financed under IDA Cre-
dit is presented under (2.).
1. Road Program
A. Program Descriptlon
2.02      The proposed program comprises:
a) a three-year road maintenance and strengthening program (1985/6 -
1987/88) consisting of:
(i) strengthening and resurfacing of 99 km of paved roads, and
improvement and regravelling of 135 km of earth/gravel roads;
Cii) patching of the entire paved road network (744 km); mainte-
nance of about 1,100 km of selected earth roads; improvement
and maintenance of bridges; and labor-intensive routine main-
tenance of the entire network (about 2,900 km); this will re-
quire provision of equipment, spare parts, materials and sup-
plies;
b)   training of GDR and GDT Staff;
c)   consulting services for: (1)  supervision of works under a) (i);
(2) technical assistance for management of force account and
labor-iatenalve works, training of personnel and for economic
analysis, planning and coordination in the trasport sector; and
(3) pre-Invtstment studies, and
d)   project preparation (PPP repayment).
(a) Road Maintenance and Strengthening Program
2.03          The three-year road maintenance and strengthening program
(1985/6-:987/8) will concentrate on strengthening and maintenance of prio-
rity roads for economic development.  To reach a double objective of in-
creasing GDRt's capacity to carry out road maintenance operations effectlve-
ly without undue burden on its organiuzation and to promote the construction
Industry, the works will be carried out both by contract and force account.



- 20 -
(i)  Works by Contract
2.04        Under the Third Highway Project, feasibility and engineering
studies were carried out on the 135 km of earth roads and 99 km of paved
roads, permitting adequate assessment of the level of Improvements which
are economically justifiable.  The construction details and bidding docu-
ments are being prepared under the Project Preparation FaciiUty (PPF) ex-
cept for 88 km of roads to be financed by ED (para. 2.18); they are sche-
duled to be completed by September 1985 and would allow the start of the
execution of works at the beginning of 1986.
2.05      Strengthening and resurfacing of 99 km of paved roads include N!Ul
Bujumbura-Bugarama (34 km), lR2 MIuramvya-Gitega (54 km), lilR4 Bujubura-
Katumba (5 km) (PDO to PK5), NR5 Buj umbura-Rigombo including the crossing
over River Kaj eke (6 km) (PK16 to PK2Z); the roads were built 24, 11, 27,
and 3 years ago respectively. The traffic counts in 1984 show high traffic
volumes of about 820 vpd, 435 vpd, 1,505 vpd and 240 vpd respectively. Ihe
roads have been maintained sporadically and their present condition is poor
and deteriorating. The works would consist of (i) improvement of drainage
structures; (ii) rebuilding of some subgrades; (iii) regravelling of shoul-
ders; (iv) construction of base courses of 15 an to 20 om of selected mate-
rials; and (v) construction of a double surface asphalt treatment. The de-
sign is based on a realistic maximum aingle axle load of 13 tons for an
economic life of 15 years. It is expected that resurfacing would be re-
quired after seven to eight years.
2.06       Improvement and regravelling of 135 km of earth roads include
RGI I Gitega-Ngosi road (81 km) and RGI 8 Kigangara-lubanga Road (54 km)
located in the north-central and central regions, the most populated and
agriculturally productive regions in the country. These roads carry about
85 vpd and 50 vpd respectively and during the rainy season the traffic is
seriously impeded due to lack of drainage, steep grades and sharp curves.
Works to be carried out include (i) limited alignment and grade Improve-
ment, (ii) regrading and regravelling; and (iii) improvement of drainage
structures.
(ii) Works by Force Account
2.07       DW will carry out (i) patching operations on the entire paved
road network (Annex II); (ii) spot improvement, regravelling, regrading and
improvement of drainage structuree of 1,100 km of selected earth roads
(Annex III) which are located mainly in areas of agricultural and industri-
al development and carry mostly between 40 vpd to 100 vpd; and (iii)
cantonnage- or labor intensive operations on the entire network (2,900 km)
consisting of clearing shoulders, filling potholes, cleaning ditches and
drainage structures and maintaining bridges.
2.08      At present, DW runs four mobile brigades from Bujumbura; two bri-
gades carry out improvement and regravelling works while the other two car-
ry out maintenance of earth roads. DW also runs two ill-equipped patching
brigades for the maintenance of paved roads. The dispatching of these bri-
gades from Bujumbura to other regions is excessively costly and disrupts
supplies and rotation of personnel. Maintenance of equipment is poor for
lack of adequate and timely financing of operating costs. To carry out the



- 21 -
works efficiently under the proposed program: (i) the brigades would be re-
organized and based in four regional road maintenanee centers: Bujumbura,
Gitega, Bururi and Ngozi each with a regravelling/regrading brigade for I=-
provement and maintenance of earth roads; (ii) two patching brigades would
be created for routine maintenance of paved roads and located in Bujumbura
and Gitega; and (iii) 52 -cantonnage- teams (corresponding to the subdivi-
sion of the road maintenance organization) would be organized with 1,500
laborers for labor-intensive operations and maintenance of bridges. On the
basis of projected output and Improved conditions envisaged under tbis pro-
gram, it is estimated that each regravelling/regrading brigade would main-
tain about 100 km to 150 km of earth roads a year, each patching and re-
sealing brigade 400 km of paved roads a year; and each laborer would main-
tain about 2 km of roads year round.  To stimulate and encourage the deve-
lopment of the domestic construction industry, DU would subcontract to
domestic contractors some minor works such as materials haulage, simple and
limited regravelling, and construction of culverts, ditches and appur-
tances.
2.09      Improvement and maintenance of bridges have been carried out by
two small DW specialized brigades. KfW (FRG) has provided structural ele-
ments of bridge decks and technical assistance for the execution of these
works in the past and would continue to do so under this program. These
works will be accompanied by an overall maintenance program of bridges. In
addition to the bridge element provided by KfW, the program will provide
for equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies.
2.10        The proposed program will include rehabilitation of and spare
parts for equipment for the regravellinglregrading brigades financed under
previous IDA projects, and new equipment, materials and supplies for the
maintenance of the road network. The list of equipment (Annex IV) was dis-
cussed and agreed upon during negotiations. The equipment will be main-
tained in the workshops of Bujumbura, Gitega, Bururi and Ngozi, built and
equipped by FRG financing.
b) Training of GDR Staff
2.11       IDA's assistance to the Government for training in the highway
subsector would continue under the proposed program. GDR's overall train-
ing program (Annex VI) was reviewed and agreed upon at negotiations (para.
4.01(f)). The proposed project would provide training for three years of
about 100 equipment operators and mechanics, 26 personnel in general admi-
nistration and accounting and 14 management level staff in the areas of
planning and execution of road maintenance operations, organization and
management of work sites, and training organization. The training of the
operators and mechanics would be carried out by the specialized Section A3
of the Public Works School (PWS) in Gitega.  PWS was built and is being
operated under the Second Education Project (Cr. 1979-BU). As the Ministry
of Education lacks equipment and operating funds to run Section A3, and to
Improve -ne relevance of the training activities, agreement was reached
with the 'k -erinent at negotiations for the transfer of Section A3 to the
responsibilAty of the Ministry of Public Wbrks by August 31, 1985 (para.
4.01(f)). Section A3 will be provided with a training production brigade
including equipment, materials and supplies by the road maintenance



- 22 -
center at Gitega with w-aich it will liaise for both field training exer-
cises and road maintenance operations in the region. The training in gene-
ral administration and accounting will be carried out by the Center for
Basic and Advance Training (CBAT) established in Bujumbura with the assist-
ance of UNDP, and the training of managers will be carried out in overseas
institutions; about 60 man-months of scholarships will be provided for the
CBAT and overseas institutions.
c) Consulting Services
(1) Supervision of Works
2.12      In view of the staff constraints at DDC, consultants will super-
vise strengthening, resurfacing and improvement and regravelling works to
be carried out by contractors on the 99 km of paved roads and 135 km of
earth roads (Para. 2.02 a(i)).
(2) Pre-Investment Studies
2.13       The proposed studies are for the improvement of the earth road
Muzinda-N'Dora (60 km).   This road would improve accessibility to the
northwestern province of Bubanza, spur a hydro-agricultural project in the
region of East-Mpanda and the agricultural development tn the reglon of
Imbo (rice, corn and coffee) and Kifurwe (milk), and facilitate access to
the construction site of the hydro-electric plant in Rwegura.  The road
is a continuation of Bujumbura-Muzinda road (13 km) which is now being con-
structed under financing from the European Development Fund (EDF).  The
proposed program would include the feasibility study of Muzinda-N'Dora
road, and if economically justified the preparation of detailed engineering
and bidding documents for the road improvement to an all-weather gravel
standard including necessary road widening and drainage works.  The terms
of reference (Annex VIII) were discussed and agreed upon at negotiations
(para. 4.01(g)). It 1984 the CDR prepared a preliminary economic analysis
of the proposed section which indicated that the economic rate of return
for the road improvement is about 15%.
(3) Technical Assistance
2.14      As MPW has limited qualified personnel, the program will provide
for services of technical assistance experts in staff training and in
operations. Terms of reference for the experts (Annex V) were agreed upon
at negotiations (para. 4.01(g)).
2.15      GDR needs technical assistance services to carry out the training
program. As the Second Education Project lacks funds, the services of the
expert running section A3 of PWS in Gitega are financed for one year (June
1984 - July 1985) undsr the PPF (para. 2.18) with a further 36 man-mouths
included under the proposed program; in addition, the services (36 man-
months) of a training expert would be provided to GDR for planning and co-
ordination of training activities as well as the selection, recruitment,
promotion and upgrading of the GDR staff.



- 23 -
2.16       To assist DE in the execution of force account works the program
would provide technical assistance services including: (i) three road con-
struction experts (84 man-months) to manage the road maintenance centers
and the brigades; the experts would be engaged under a management contract
between the Government and qualified contractors; (ii) two labor-intensive
experts (72 man-months) for the planning, organization and execution of
labor-intensive construction of feeder roads to complement the financing
under USAID, and (iii) one mechanical expert (36 man-months) to run the
workshop and warehouse in Bujumbura, while FRG will provide experts to run
similar facilities in the other three regional centers: Bururi, Gitega and
Ngozi.
2.17      The program also includes technical assistance to GDR in MPW and
to the General Directorate of Transport (GDT) in MTT. One economist/finan-
cial analyst (20 man-months) would assist MPW in evaluation of road invest-
ments, traffic counts analysis and in financial/accounting operations of
the GDR. In setting up proper accounts related to the program's implemen-
tation, short-term consultants (4 man-months total) will also be engaged.
The economist/transport planner (24 man-mLnths) is to assist GDT in plan-
ning and coordin&:ing transport investments including advising the Govern-
ment on all policy matters regarding external transport routes. Terms of
reference for the technical assistance (Annex VII) were agreed with the
Government at negotiations; the Government also agreed that the implementa-
tion of the technical assistance will be conditioned by appointment of ade-
quate local counterparts in both GDT and GDR (para. 4.01(g)).
d) Project Preparation
2.18       An advance of US$900,000 from the Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) is being used in order to provide continuity in road maintenance and
rehabilitation undertaken under the Third Highway Project and in training
begun under the Second Education Project and to prepare the necessary con-
struction details for the roads included in the proposed project. The fol-
lowing items are approved to be financed net of taxes and duties: (i) pre-
paration of engineering and bidding documents for road strengthening/im-
provement; (Ui) acquisition of necessary spare parts for the road mainte-
nance equipment procured under the Third Highway Project Cr. 1132-BU to
prevent disruption of maintenance operations until the proposed project be-
comes operational; (iii) continuation for one year of technical assistance
provided under Cr. 1132-BU for the execution of labor-intensive construc-
tion of earth roads; and (iv) continuation for one year of technical as-
sistance to Section A3 of the Gitega School. The proposed project includes
refinancing the advance from the PPF.
B. Cost Estimates
2.19        The total cost of the program (Table 2.1), net of taxes and
duties but including contingencies, is estimated at US$42.0 million equiva-
lent with a local cost component of about US$7.0 million equivalent (17X)
and foreign costs of about US$35.0 million (83Z). The total cost including



- 24 -
taxes aud duties is estimated a.t about US$43.9 million. Base costs are In
March 1985 prices. Physical contingencies of about 10% have been added to
all components except labor. Price contingencies are based on recent esti-
mates of international iaflation rates as follows: 5% in 1985 and 7.5% in
1986 and 8% in 1987-88.  The same price coutingencies for local cost were
calculated on the basis of the FBu exchange rate being adjusted to coupen-
sate for the difference between domestic and international inflation. The
detailed program costs (the cost of the proposed project is showN in Table
2.2) are shown below:

2.20      Program cost estimates are based on the following:
(a) Paved Road Strengthening/Resurfacing: based on engineering stu-
dies, unit costs and quantities developed by consultants, taking
into consideration current prices of materials, labor and equip-
meut, as well as a survey of unit prices on other similar works
in the project area; the average cost per km is estimated at
US$94,000; the cost of supervision of the works amounts to 5% of
civil works costs.
(b) Earth Road Improvement/Regravelling: on the basis of engineering
studies, the average cost estimate is US$30,000/km; supervision
cost amounts to 5% of civil works costs. -The costs are in line
with those of similar recent works in the country.
(c) Road Maintenauce Equipment, Spare Parts. Materials and Su Plies,
Training Equipment:  based on consultants' estimates wici  re-
flect recent bid prices and quotations in Burundi.
(d)  Consultant Services:  includes a total of 312 man-months, at an
average of about US$9,600 per man-month which includes about
US$7,000 for salaries, firms' overheads (home office expenses,
expatriate allowances, social costs, etc.) and profit, and about
US$2,600 for reimbursable expenses (international travel, commu-
nications, subsistence and other miscellaneous items).   These
costs are in liue with those for similar and ongoing services in
Burundi.
Ce)  Fellowships:   Costs of fellowships for overseas training are
estimated at about US$2,500 per trainee per month, including tra-
vel, lodging, subsistence, tuition and fees.
C. Economic Justification of the Program
2.21      The three-year road maintenance and strengthening program is well
justified and yields an overall ERR of about 38L  Economic analysis of in-
dividual components of the program, including items to be financed under
the proposed IDA Credit is presented in Chapter III.
D. Progra Financing
2.22       The three-year program would be financed separately by EDF, Kfw,
ADB, Japanese bilateral aid, Belgian bilateral aid, IDA and the Govern-
ment.    The  Government has  requested  EDF  to  finance  strengthening/
resurfacing of two paved roads (NRl, NR2), KfW to finance construction of
bridges and Japanese aid to finance one of the four brigades (under IV) in-
cluding equipment and ADB to finance improvement of the earth road (RGI8).
The financing package for the program has been substantially agreed upon;
some of the financing arrangements were already made (KfW and Belgian aid)



27 -
while for the remaining the Government is now in the process of finalizing
the financing of tbe program with the multilateral and bilateral aid agen-
cies. The proposed InA Credit will finance a self-contalued project -
part of the program which is presented in para. 2.23.
2. The ProJect
A. Project Composition and Financing
2.23         IDA will monitor the implementation of the whole program and
under the proposed project will finance part of the program. The project
cost including contingencies with base cost calculated in March 1985 prices
is estimated at US$22.9 million equivalent net of taxes with a local cost
component of about US$4.1 million equivalent (18%) and a foreign cost com-
ponents of about US$18.8 million equivalent (82Z). The total cost includ-
ing taxes is estimated st about US$24.0 million equivalent. The project
would consist of:  (i) strengthening/resurfacing of 11 km of paved roads;
(ii) improvement/regraveliing of 81 km of earth roads; (iii) mantenance of
paved roads; (iv) maintenance of earth roads (three out of four brigades);
(v) maintenance of bridges; (vi) labor-intensive road maintenance; (vii)
technical assistance and training; (viii) pre-investment studies; and (ix)
PPF (Table 2.2).  Project financing net of taxes will be as follows:  IDA
participation will be US$18.1 million equivalent which will cover 96% of
the the foreign exchange cost; Belgian aid of US$0.7 million equivalent for
road maintenance equipment will cover the remaining 4Z of the foreign cost,
while the Government will finance the local cost of the project estimated
at US$4.1 million including US$2.0 million equivalent for local labor.

B. Implementation and Procurement
2.24      The project would be implemented by the Ministry of Public Works
through its GDR except for the assistance to transport planning and coordi-
nation, which would be implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Tele-
communications.
2.25        The proposed implementation schedule for major activities for
the project components is shown in Chart III.  This schedule was agreed
upon at negotiations (para. 4.01(h)). The project will cover a three-year
period, starting June 1985.   The works by contractors on earth and paved
roads should start in January and March 1986 and should take approximately
24 months and 12 months, respectively, to be completed. Equipment for road
maintenance should be delivered by June 1986, about six months after noti-
fication of contracts to the suppliers. Technical assistance for manage-
ment of operations and planning should be provided up to three years start-
ing in June 1985. The studies of the Muzinda-N'Dora road are expected to
start it January 1986 and take about a year to complete with a review by
Government and the Bank in the third quarter of 1986. The project is ex-
pected to be completed by June 30, 1988.
2.26       The table below indicates the planned procurement procedures and
respective amounts. This distribution may be subject to some revision as
the project components and their respective Implementation arrangements are
worked out.

2.27      Major civil works for the improvement/regravelling of earth roads
and strengthening/resurfacing of paved roads would be carried out by con-
tractors on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines for procurement after suitable pre-qualifica-
tion. For force account works DW would subcontract to domestic contractors
for some minor works such as haulage of materials, construction of cul-
verts, ditches and appurtances.
2.28       Equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies would be grouped
into suitable lots and procured through ICB satisfactory to IDA.  Minor
items of equipment, spare parts, materials and supplies in lots of less
than US$50,000 and totaling no more than US$500,000 may be procured from
established suppliers on the basis of quotations obtained locally in accor-
dance with the Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement.
2.29        Consultants for supervision, technical assistance and studies
would be selected following the 1981 Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (para.
4.01(i)).   The fellowships will be awarded on the basis of the training
program (Annex VI) agreed upon at negotiations. The fellowships proposal
will include the qualifications and positions of the candidates, type and
cost of training as well as the training institutions and an indication of
assignments to be given to the trainees on their return to Burundi.
2.30      In order to expedite and facilitate disbursements, the Goverament
would agree at negotiations to set up a Special Account in a commercial
bank in Burundi with an initial deposit of US$0.5 million to service as a
revolving fund for expenditures for road maintenance including purchase of
necessary fuel, spare parts aid workshop tools.  The account would be main-
tained in US dollars.
C. Disbursement
2.31       The proposed IDA Credit of US$18.1 million will be disbursed on
the following basis:
a)   75% of total expenditures for civil works;
b)   100% of foreign expenditures for procurement of equipment, spare
parts, materials and supplies; 70% of local expenditures if pro-
cured locally;
c)   100% of total expenditures for fellowships;
d)   100% of foreign expenditure for consultant services and technical
assistance.
All disbursements will be made against full documentation of expenditures.
Expenditures for materials and suppies woul-. be made against certified
statements by GDR and consultants.



- 31 -
2.32        The estimated schedule of disbursement is shown below (Table
2.4). It is based on the project implementation schedule and the disburse-
ment profile of past highway projects in the country. A 6-month delay from
the end of the physical execution of the project until the last payment is
given to allow for delays in determining price variations in contracts.

D. Acccunting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
2.33       Accounting practices in GDR have not been satisfactory since GDR
does not have the proper capacity to set up and maintain project accounts.
In order to enable GDR to maintain separate accounts for each project com-
ponent, technical assistance would be provided (para. 2.17). Project ac-
counts including special account will be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association.   During negotiations, Government



- 32 -
and IDA agreed that aLl project accounts includiag the special account to-
gether with the auditor's report will be submitted annually to IDA, not
later than six months after the end of the fiscal year. Government and IDA
also agreed on progress reporting requirements (Annex IX) and the subuis-
sion of a project completion report, in a form satisfactory to the Associa-
tion, not later than six months after the closing date (paras. 4.01(j),
(k)).
E. Environmental Aspects
2.34       None of the project's elements wold adversely affect the envi-
ronment.  The planned works would not only improve and shorten the existing
tortuous alignment, but would also help decrease traffic noise, pollution
and accidents in the areas.  No land use problem should arise since the
road works are to take place in the existing alignments with no encroach-
ment to housing and agricultural areas.

III. ECONOKIC EVALUATION
A. General
3.01      The priority for Burundi's road subsector Is to preserve past In-
vestments, particularly when resources available for the sector are limited
and the country has financial constraints.  The proposed three-year road
strengthening/improvement and maintenance program which includes components
to be financed under the proposed IDA Credit is designed to meet the above
objective. Taking into account traffic volumes and the needs of the coun-
try's economy on the one hand, and road conditions on the otber, about 99
km of paved roads are identified as needing urgent strengthening. In addi-
tion, 135 km of earth/gravel roads would be improved and appropriate road
maintenance would be carried out on the whole network (2,900 km). The pro-
gram, including both road works and road maintenance, is expected to yield
an overall ERR of about 381. The components to be finauiced under the IDA
project (para. 3.13) have, however, an overall ERR of about S1X.
3.02      For the following minor program  components: training In PWS and
CBAT, fellowships and assistance In transport planning and coordination,
maklng up about 3 percent of the total program cost, It is not possible to
provide a quantified economic justification. They are, however, necessary
for successful Institution building in GDR and NTT and for the achievements
of the program objectives. Furthermore, these program components would, in
the long run, lead to more effective planning of road works and more effi-
cient road maintenance operations.
B. Areas of Influence of the Program, Benefits and Beneficiaries
3.03      The roads selected for strengthening (99 km) and for improvement
(135 km) directly serve densely populated areas near the capital and In the
north/central part of the country. Three of the four identified paved road
sectlons make up part of the international road links to Zaire (tN4) and to
Rianda (NRI and NR5). Furthermore, most of the selected roads also serve
important coffee growing areas.
3.04       The main benefits to be derived from the program would be: (a)
savlngs in vehicle operatlig costs (para.3.09) and (b) avoiding costly re-
constructlon In the future (for the paved roads) wh_-h would otherwise be
necessary to keep the roads usable. Additional benefits would result from
improved road safety, reduced freight damage and accidents, and savings in
travel time.
3.05      The major dlreet beneficiaries of the reduced transport costs and
Improved road safety would be the owners and operators of cars, trucks ard
buses.  Since the road transport Industry is competitlve, it is expected
that producers and consumers alike would also benefit from the resulting
reduced road transport costs. Furthermore, improved road conditions would
prolong vehicle life and reduce their maintenance/repair needs.  Antici-
pated reduced fuel consumption should also result in savings in foreign ex-
change.  The Government would also benefit from savings from deferred,
costly road reconstruction and through its vehicle fleet ownership.



- 34 -
C. Economic Aualysis of the Program
3.06      -The economic analysis was carried out by comparing 'with- and
without' the project cases.  Iv the 'without' the -project case, it is as-
sumed -that the paved roads would, with inadequate maintenance and repairs,
gradually deteriorate, significantly increasing vehicle operating costs
(VOC).  It bas also been assumed that the condition of the umpaved roads,
which are already of low standards, would continue to deteriorate over
time, al8o increasing VOC. In the 'with' the project case it is assumed
that proposed strengthening/improvements (pavement strengthening, recon-
struction of shoulders, widening, Improvement of roadside drains, regrading
and regravellIng) would be made not only to protect capital iuvestments in
roads, -but also to reduce VOCs over the estimated. economic life of the
works. Only savings in vehicle oFeratiug costs are quantified in the ana-
lysis. Benefits such as savings in deferred future reconstruction as a re-
sult of the proposed maintenance .program (for the paved roads), time
savings and reductions in potential freight damage represent substantial
benefits which, if quantified, vould enhance the rates of return. There-
fore; the rates of return were calculated conservatively.
3.07      Traffic counts on the program roads have been carried out since
1982, after being initiated under the Third Highway Project. In 1984 on
the paved road network the traffic volumes were mostly in tbe range between
200-1,000 vvd. On the unpaved road network (for roads included in the re-
grading program) the traffic volumes were mainly between 40-100 vpd.

3.08      Since no generated/induced traffic is anticipated to develop on
the program roads (the roads have been in- place for many years) the ex-
pected traffic growth is linited to the existing normal traffic.  The traf-
fic is expected to grow at 6 percent p.a. during the economic life of the
road works; in the sensitivity analysis, however, a growth rate of 4 per-
cent was applied (para. 3.14).  The traffic growth was estimated on the
basis of several factors, such as past traffic development (when avail-
able), vehicle fleet growth (para. 1.18), fuel consumption (para. 1.20) and
population growth. The moderate growth rate used in the economic analysis
is also influenced by an expected slower pace of future growth of the
economy.
3.09       VOCs have been estimated for three different types of terrain
(Annex X, Table 1), taking into account the condition of road surface as
well as expected deterioration due to dlimate, traffic, and actual road
maintenance carried out on the roads. The consultants calculated VOCs for
five different vehicle groups (passenger cars, pickups, trucks, heavy
trucks and buses).  Savings in W)Cs were based on -with- and "without  the
project scenarios and they range on average between 20-30 percent; for the
routine maintenance program the anticipated savings in VOCs were substan-
tially lower (Annex X, Table 2). The economic analysis also assumes that
during the estimated economic life of works, in the -without- the project
case, VOCs are expected to increase further.
Road Strengthening/Improvement
3.10      The economic analysis was carried out in mid-1984 prices, net of
taxes and duties.  The major assumption and inputs in the 15-year (10-year
life for the unpaved roads) cost/benefit analysis are presented in Annex
IX, Table 2.  The cost included in the economic evaluation comprise:  (i)
civil works (strengthening or improvement) In 1985-1987, (ii) 10 percent
physical contingencies, (iii) supervision, and (iv) road maintenance. The
benefits considered in the economic analysis include savings in VOCs for
the normal traffic growing at 6 percent p.a. during the anticipated econo-
mic life.
3.11      The cost/bPnef: analysis based upon the assumptions presented in
paras. 3.06-3.10 show that the proposed civil works are economically justi-
fied.   The combined ERR for the strengthening/resurfacing of the paved
roads is estimated at 18 percent; ERR for individual roads range from 16-24
percent (Table 3.2). Combined ERR for improvement of two earth roads is
estimated at 21 percent. The returns thus exceed the opportunity -ios: of
capital in Burundi, estimated at about 8-10 percent.

Road Naintenance Progras
3.12      The economic analysis for the three-year road maintenance program
1985/86-1987/88 has been done separately for paved and unpaved roads.  The
analysis is based on capital (cost of equipmeut, bridge repair - and rele-
vant technical assistance) and recurrent costs on the one hand and modest
savings in VOCs on the other, as identified by the consultants.  The rou-
tine maintenance program on the whole paved road network (744 km) yields an
ERR of about 27 percent. ERR for the mainteunace program (para. 2.07) on
selected 1,100 km of earth roads (out of -2,100 km) with the traffic mostly
in the range of 40 to 100 vpd in 1984 is estimated at about 71 percent.
Proposed low-cost labor-intensive routine maintenace works on the wbole
network (2,900 km), to be done in the three-year period, is also expected
to yield a high ERR - exceeding 30 percent (Annex X, Table 2).
D. The Project Components
3.13     The components of the three-year program to be financed under-the
proposed project are well justified and yield an overall ERR of about 51%,
which is higher than that of the overall ERR of the identified program.
The individual ERRs of the project components are as follows:   (i)
strengthening/resurfacing of NR4, 22% and NR5 section, 17%; (ii) improve-
ment/regravelling of the Gitega-Ngozi Road, 29; (iii) routine aintenance
of paved roads, 271; (iv) maintenance of earth roads, 71x; and (v) labor-
intensive maintenance of the entire network, 33Z (Annex X). The project
components were explained earlier in Chapter III.

IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During project negotiations the following agreements were reached
with the Government:
(a) the Government will give the Association an opportunity to comr-
ment upon the study of the port master plan and will ensure that
any investments in the port and lake transport are economically
justified (para. 1.13);
(b) the Goverment will furnish to IDA by June 30, 1986 a proposal
for new vehicle legislation on axle-load limits and will agree to
take measures satisfactory to the Association to enforce axle
load limits approved by the Association (para. 1.25);
(c) the Government will give priority to maintenance over new con-
struction in allocating funds to its highways sector (para.
1.32); in the last quarter of each PY the Governeunt will consult
with the Association on increasing the funding of road malnte-
nance and will also give IDA an opportunity to review GDR annual
budgets; the Government will also consult IDA on the level of in-
crease of the Road Fund tax in order to insure that expenditures
for road maintenance will reach adequate levels and will set
minimum road maintenance expenditures in 1986 at US$4.0 million
equivalent in 1985 prices; the amount will be increased appropri-
ately in subsequent years (para. 1.33);
(d)  all the funds to be made available for road maintenance will be
channelled to the special account already existing in the Central
Bank and that the proceeds of the account will be used to finance
counterpart funding of the project (para. 1.34);
(e) the three-year investment program for roads will be submitted an-
nually to IDA for its review and approval; also, for all new road
projects exceeding US$3 million equivalent, the Association will
review their economic viability prior to the decision on con-
struction being made (para. 1.43);
(f) the training program (Annex VI) for GDR staff was agreed upon and

GDIR Staff
1.         GDR staff numbered 2,696 by March 1984:  936 were permanent or
under contract and 13670 were hired ad boc and paid on a daily basis.  Of
the permanent and under-contract staff, 83. 9Z (784). were unskilled, 121
(113) semi-skilled and skilled, 2.21 (21) middle uanagement and 1.91 (18)
umaagement.
2.        Of the unskilled staff, about 412 have received training from 11
to 17 weeks; 54Z of the semi-skilled and skilled staff have had no formal
training while that figure reaches about 701 in procurement; only two of
the five "zone" supervisors have been trained up to grade A2.
Training of GDR Staff
3.         The training program for the period 1985-87 was prepared by the
GMD with the assistance of the consultants ORT (financed under the Third
Highway Project). The program is to be reviewed -during negotiations. The
originally proposed training program was designed to respond to the GDR's
short-term needs, particularly emphasizing training laborers, operators and
mechanics. The revised program has a new approach. While intending to
satisfy the GDR's needs in laborers, operators, and mechanics, this program
has three main features:  (1) lmproving personnel management in order to
get more information on personnel; (ii) improving management by introducing
training for high level management staff; and (iii) improving personnel
performances in finance, administration, warehouse keeping, and secretari-
at.
4.         The revised training program for the period 1985-87 is to cover
563 persons in GDR, broken down by grade and by specialty as shown below:

The revised training progran sounds feasible in regard to the number of
staff to be trained. However, appropriate measures should still be taken
during project implementation to improve the effectiveness of training
through a comprehensive analysis of skill gaps for each category of staff.
Implementation of Training Program
5.         In carrying out its training program, the GDR wiU have the use
of the following centers:
(i)   Gitega Training Center:  the unskilled workers (manual road
maintenance, foremen, team chiefs, masons) who are the largest number in-
volved, will be trained at the Gitega Training Center; 357 people were
trained there between March 1979 and June 1982. Since 1981, the annual
output has been some 90 persons per year. It should therefore be possible
to reach the target set for the next program, 290 people. The Gitega
Training Center will also handle both the training-upgrading and the train-
ing of worksite foremen and zone supervisors;
(ii) Public Works School (PWS): the section A3 of the Public
Works School at Gitega will handle the upgrading of engine operators, dump
truck drivers, and worksite chiefs;
(iii) Central Workshop in Bujumbura: the Central Workshop will
handle the training-upgrading of equipment mechanics, diesel engineer
mechanics, machinists, electricians, workshop section chiefs, and workshop
chiefs;
(iv) Bujumbura Basic and Advanced Training Center: established
with the technical assistance of UNDP, the Basic and Advanced Training Cer-
ter in Bujumbura will help in training office secretaries, accountants and
administrative staff of GDR.
6.          If these centers are to perform their task adequately, certain
requirements must be met: (i) an adequate flow of supplies to the Gitega
Training Center; (ii) the administrative links with the Ministry of Educa-
tion for the Section A3 must be reviewed; the Ministry of Education will
provide the buildings necessary for the training, together with instructors
in general matters, technology, and industrial drawing; on the other hand,
the CDR will provide the operating expenses and will make available not
only spare parts but also the engines needed for training in the road main-
tenance work incorporated in the proposed Project, together with qualified
instructors in engine operation and maintenance; and (iii) the training of
mechanics, electricians, and workshop chiefs at the Central Workshop in
Bujumbura will have to be provided by bilateral aid from the Federal Repub-
lic of Germany as in the past.
7.         During the period 1985-87, the Project would finance:  (i) the
in-country training of about 125 staff (engine operators, administrative
staff, accountants, worksite mechanics) and (ii) the overseas training of
14 managerial staff (five in organization of worksites, in workshop and
highway equipment, two in road construction and maintenance, one in testing
and quality control, four in road supervision, one in administration and
organization of training, one in personnel management).

Personnel management and training
8.        Upgrading staff in an agency as large as the GDR is undoubtedly a
costly operation, quite apart from the inconvenience caused by the tempora-
ry absence of the staff members from their regular productive jobs. To be
cost effective, training should  be designed to meet the GDRts specific
needs and tailored to cover requirements clearly defined in advance. At
present, it can hardly be said that GDR has a staffing plan which will take
into account foreseeable changes in staff due to retirement, transfers,
dismissals or changes in the nature of the agency's operations. Similarly,
no work has been carried out on job descriptions and classifications, ex-
cept for the engine operators and dump truck drivers (undertaken with the
assistance of the consultants ORT).
9.         The training component is intended to improve personnel manage-
ment within the GDR and to bring about a better balance between training
and employment. The training should therefore form part of an overall per-
sonnel management policy that would encompass all the essential functions
of the agency such as the planning of manpowar needs at all levels, as well
as the selection, recruitment, promotion and upgrading of the staff. GDR's
Personnel Department would be strengthened with two local staff, one of
whom would be responsible for forecasting manpower, while the other would
be the chief of a training unit. Along with the reinforcement of local
staff, the proposed technical assistance would support the GDR's efforts
by making available a training specialist with thorough experience in job
analysis and classification of a Government organization in roads. This
specialist will assist the Personnel Department in: (i) formulating a poli-
cy in continuing training; (ii) drawing up job descriptions; (iii) analyz-
ing staff skill gaps; (iv) designing a detailed training plan for 1985-87;
and (v) preparing, programing, coordinating training programs and evaluat-
ing their execution.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Terms of Reference for
The Muzinda-N'Dora Road
Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering
I. OBJECTIVES
1.         The Ministry of Public Works, Energy and Mines intends to under-
take the improvement of the Mhzinda-N'Dora road (60 km) a section of
Bujumbura-Muzinda-N'Dora road (73 km).  This earth road now carries about
60 vpd and during the rainy season traffic is seriously Impeded due to lack
of drainage, steep grades and sharp curves. The Bujumbura-Muzinda section
(13 km) is being constructed under financing from EDF.  The economic and
technical studies necessary to define the works for the Muzinda-N'Dora sec-
tion are described in these terms of reference.
II. STUDY
2.         The study will be executed in two phases by a team composed of
consultant experts:
(a) Phase I: Feasibility Study and Preliminary Engineerizg
Phase  I includes all  the economic  and  technical studies
necessary to define the nature, importance, and characteris-
tics for the improvement and/or reconstruction works to be
undertaken.
On the basis of the Phase I studies, the Government will de-
cide the type of construction to be udertaken.
(b) Phase II: Detailed Engineering
Phase II will proceed only if the proposed technical solution
is supported by sound economic justification; it will include
the detailed engineering and bidding documents for the execu-
tion of the works to be undertaken.

Phase I
3.        Feasibility Study.  The objective of the feasibility study is to
define the optimum technical solutions based on economic analysis for the
improvement of the Muzinda-Bubanza road.   The choice will be based on a
comparison of alternatives including:
(1) the scope of the construction to be undertaken;
(ii)  the technical characteristics to be given to the road sec-
tions;
(iii) the cost for the execution of the works; and
(iv)  the economic rate of return of each alternative.
4.        The feasibility study will include:
(1) Traffic Studies
Forecasts of traffic will be made for the Muzinda-Bubanza road.
The following vehicle types should be used:
-  heavy trucks (greater than 7t load);
-  light trucks (up to 5t load)
-  vans and land rovers;
-  passenger cars; and
-  buses.
The forecasts should be established with the help of traffic
counts and origin-destination surveys of typical users.
The following points should receive special attention:
(i) existing traffic;
(ii)  seasonal variations in traffic;
(iii) traffic generated by agricultural development in the road
zone;
(iv)  forecast of a major traffic iucrease Immediately after the
road is constructed; and
(v) determing future traffic growth rate per year.
(2) Study of Road Transport Costs
For each technical solution considered, the operating costs for
each type of vehicle during the economic life of the investment
will be studied. The costs of routine and periodic maintenance
will be included, as well as the costs of road construction.  The
interrelationship between traffic, the VOC, maintenance costs and
the cost of construction will be considered.



-60-
ANNEX VIII
Page 3 of 4
5.          Economic comparison of the solutions examined.  To define the
economically most advantages solution, a comparison will be made of the
total transport costs (all net of taxes) on the road (including all VOC),
for the economic life of the proposed investment (15-20 years), as well as
the costs of investments and maintenance associated with the different
solutions considered. The comparison is to determine the optimum technical
characteristics as well as the timing of the investment. Normal and gene-
rated traffic will be separately identified. Other benefits in the zone of
influence of the road (without double-counting of generated traffic) will
also be explored and quantified. The effects of the alignment on the en-
vironment will be examined, and the consultants willrecoumend appropriate
measures to minimize any adverse effects.
6.         The various solutions will be compared to a reference solution,
which is defined as the continued use of the existing road, on its present
alignment, without major investments and with maintenance as required. The
ERR and the net present value using a 1OZ discount rate will be determined
for each solution, as well as the first year return (comparison of costs to
benefits the first year after completion). An appropriate sensitivity ana-
lysis will be performed to account for uncertainty in any of the cost and
benefit parameters entering in the calculation. Any possible interdepen-
dence among the variables should be considered.
7.        The costs to be taken into account are economic costs, i.e., net
of taxes and subsidies and adjusted to reflect the scarcity or surplus of
the resource. In addition, to convert all local costs into border prices,
an analysis with conversion factors for local material and labor (shadow
wage rate) will also be undertaken to calculate the ERR.
8.            Technical Investigations.   Consultants should undertake all
pertinent topographic, soils, and bydrological surveys to determine a new
alignment or partial realignment for the improvement of the Muzinda-. N'Dora
(-60 km) road; they should undertake topographic surveys for necessary road
widening.
9.        All bridges and drainage structures to be repaired or constructed
will also be examined and the necessary works defined.   The documents
necessary for the execution of these works will be prepared, including in-
vestigations for foundation studies and hydrological surveys for drainage
works.
10.          The consultants should also study with special attention the
materials best adapted for the construction of the subgrade, sub-base, the
base and wearing courses. They should identify and carefully evaluate the
quality and quantity of available materials within an economical hauling
distance to the road.
11.       The Phase I studies will be defined with the accuracy of prelimi-
nary engineering.

Phase II
12.       Detailed engineering and bidding docuents.  The second phase will
include the preparation of detailed engineering cost estimates and bidding
documents for the works found economically justifipd and selected by the
Government with IDA concurrence, on the basis of she Phase I recommenda-
tions.
13.       The bidding documents will be prepared for international competi-
tive bidding with prequalification of contractors, In accordance wiht the
Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Toans and IDA Credits.
14.       As soon as the necessary elements for the detailed definition of
the works are known, the consultants will prepare a prequalification dossi-
er. It will include an invitation to apply for prequalification as well as
a brief descriptive notice on the nature of the works. The consultants wil
also prepare the newspaper publicity and the circulars for informing the
embassies of IDA member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan.
15.       The bidding documents will include:
(a) all plans necessary for staking the road centerline, cross-
sections and grades and for construction of sub-grades, base
course,  ditches,  shoulders,  as well as for all drainage
structures and bridges where needed;
(b) the general conditions of contract;
(c) the special conditions of contract, including the technical
specifications fo the construction methods and materials and
the control and measurement procedures;
(d) schedule of unit prices; and
(e)  the quantity estimate.
16.        The confidential report shall comprise the detailed cost esti-
mate, broken down into foreign costs, local costs and taxes.  The foreign
costs will include, in particular, the following: depreciation of imported
equipment, imported materials and supplies, salaries and benefits for ex-
patriate personnel (but excluding any payments or expenses in local curren-
cy), overheads and profits of the contractor, as well as the main foreign
exchange cost of goods produced in Burundi which are used in the project.
17.       The Government will supply the formats and other details necessa-
ry for the preparation of written documents.

mitted quarterly in triplicate, no later than one calendar mouth after the
end of the quarter. The first report should cover the quarter ending
September 30, 1985.
2.        The Progress Reports should contain the informatiou described
below:
(a)  Geceral Information:  This section should refer to Project Moni-
toring in reporting the following:
(i)  the physical progress accomplished to the date of report and
duriag the reporting period;
(ii) actual or expected deviations from the project implementa-
tion schedule;
(iii)  actual or expected difficulties or delays and their effects
on the implementation schedule, and the steps planned or
taken to overcome the difficulties and avoid further delay;
(iv) expected changes in the completion date of the project;
(v)  key personnel changes in DGR's staff, consultants or con-
tractor;
(vi) matters which may affect the cost of the project; and
(vii) any development activity likely to affect the economic via-
bility of project components.
(b) A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementation
schedule, should show the progress ic each project compoment.
(c) A financial statement should be set out in tabular form and indi-
cate for each project compont:

(iii) actual expenditure;
(iv)  projected expenditure; and
(v)  actual and projected withdrawals from the
Credit Accouont.
(d)  Finally,  Progress Reports  should state the status of action.
on each covenant of the Credit Agreement.
3.        Progress Reports vill be an Important input in the preparation of
the-Project Completion Report.
Project Completion Report
4.         The Borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to
be submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the
Closing Date.
5.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce the self-evalua-
tion capacity by the Borrower and the Association's operating departments
and to facilitate dissemination of lessons learned through the project.
The PCR will examine and assess:
(a) the performance by the Borrower and the Association of their re-
spective obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether the
Association could have been more helpful;
(b) the results that can be expected from the project, as compared
with expectations at appraisal, and whether the originAl expecta-
tions were realistic; and
(c) whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or could have
been done better.
6.         For those components of the project for which a rate of return
was estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of
the return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for
physical or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calcula-
tion should be as simple as possible under the circumstances and should ab-
sorb only a minor portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the
PCR.   An annex with the relevant information supporting this analysis
should be included.
