MIEMORANDUNM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATiON
TO TIHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR A SECOND IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECTF
1     I suhnvt for your approval the following memlioralndumii and recouimmendationi oii a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Madagascar for SDR 15 million (US$212 .2 millioni), on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and a ten year grace period to finanlce a second Irrigation
Rehabilitationi project.
2.    Country Background. With a populationl of about 12.4 million (1993), growinig at 2.8
percent per year. and a per capita income of $230, Madagascar is among the least developed
countries in the world. The agriculturally dominated economy, whichl had growni modestly in the late
1980s following a decade of decline, was disrupted by political developments since 1991. The annual
rate of economic growth has been outpaced by the rate of population growth so that real per capita
incomes declined by 40 percent between 1971 and 1991. Madagascar successfully completed a two-
year political transition to democratic rule in 1993. A new president was elected in February 1993,
parliamentary elections were held in June and a new govermnent was formed in August. The
political environment in Madagascar is complex, however, and the country is going through a period
of political apprenticeship.
3.    Sector Background. Agriculture is the most important contributor to the national economy.
The sector employs over 80 percent of the active population and accounts for over 60 percent of
foreign exchange earnings. The sector supplies the primary inputs to the food and textile industries
which together account for 75 percent of the value added of the industrial sector. The economic
stagnation which has affected other sectors of the economy more severely than agriculture, has led
to an increase in agriculture's share of GDP, from 31 percent in 1965 to 33 percent in 1993.
4.    Although most tropical and temperate climate crops can be found in Madagascar, only about
2.3 million ha, or about 6 percent of the country's arable land, is cultivated. Rice production is the
most important agricultural activity, accounting for 41 percent of agricultural output. Fishing is the
second most important activity (20 percent of agricultural production). The traditional export crops
(coffee, vanilla, cloves and pepper) together account for 7 percent of agricultural output. Root crops
and maize contribute 11 percent.  Vegetables and fruits contribute 10 percent. industrial crops 3
percent and livestock 5 percent. While agriculture and agro- industries are still contributing about 80
perce 'to total exports, there has been a shift in the relative importance of various products. The
share of traditional exports has declined to about 40 percent in 1991, while the share of non-
traditional products (such as shrimps and lobsters), currently accounting for about 15 percent of total
exports, has been rapidly growing by over 20 percent per year since 1986.
5.    Madagascar possesses a considerable potential 'or agricultural growth. It has a comparative
advantage in agricultural production based on low labor costs and availability of land in different
ecological zones. It can produce a variety of temperate and tropical crops for the domestic and
export markets. It possesses an extensive irrigation infrastructure that is laigely underutilized,
representing an important asset to enable intensification and diversification. Moreover. crop yields
are uniformly low and the potential to increase yields on the basis of known technologies is
substantial.



2
6.     Sector adjustment reforms undertaken by Madagascar in the recenit past, such as the
liberalization of domestic trade, have improved prices and market demand for agricultural produce
but have produced only a limited supply response so far. Sustained and spontaneous growtlh of the
sector is constrained by the continuing lack of reliable transport anid communication infrastructure
linking farmers wvith a market, poor conitrol and lack of maniagement of water resources, inadequate
protection of watershed areas and poor agricultural support services.  Public investment in the
agricultural sector has concenitrated too heavily over recent years on undertaking activities which
could be carried out by farmers themselves, and too little on providing basic services and creating
ar. environment to enable farmers to better fend for themselves.
7.     Rural development policy is based on the intensification of the small farml sector to accelerate
the development of the rurai non-farm economy in the high potenitial areas of Madagascar. increase
the size of the domestic market and provide sizeable farmn and off-farn employment opportunities and
environmental benefits. Agricultural development strategy calls for: (a) the removal of the remaining
macro-economic  distortions; (b) provision  of adequate  rural infrastructure  (transport and
communications, irrigation, rural market infrastructure), and regulator) framework (business
legislation, agricultural institutions, rural financial policies) in the rural areas to promote
intensification of small-farm production and to facilitate inter-regional trade, (c) strengthening the
public sector capacity for coordination, policy and strategy formulation, administration and
monitoring of implementation: (d) provision by the public sector of cost-effective market support
services; (e) decentralization of decision-r,-aking and financial responsibility to local communities and
private operators; (f) more effective cost recovery on publicly funded investments; and (g)
development of viable private sector organizations (producers' associations, water users' associations,
professional and inter-professional organizations, etc.) that can progressively take over support
services (inputs and products marketing, certain areas of applied research, extension, credit,
management of irrigation schemes, etc.). Ongoing discussions of the 1994-96 public expenditure
program have concentrated on ways to reduce the number of investment projects and concentrate
public expenditure on activities directly linked to the stated strategy.
8.     Irrigation sub-sector. The agricultural sector is characterized by the relative importance of
irrigation and by the long tradition of its farmers in irrigation. After Sudan, Madagascar has the
second largest irrigated agriculture sector in sub-saharan Africa. More than one million hectares or
about 50 percent of the total cultivated area of the country is under irrigation or potentially irrigable.
It is estimated that the irrigation sub-sector contributes almost 15 percent of Madagascar's GDP, 70
percent of agricultural production and 88 percent of total rice productioa and employs directly or
indirectly 85 percent of the active population. The potential for new irrigation schemes is limited,
given that about 80 percent of land potentially irrigable is already under irrigation. The government's
irrigation sub-sector development strategy endorses the need for a reduction in direct involvement in
the maintenance and operation of publicly-managed schemes (Grand Perimetres Irrigu6s and Petits
P6rimetres Irrigues), thus releasing scarce funds to support other services, such as research, extension
and rural roads. By encouraging the establishment of Water Users' Associations (WUAs) on these
schemes the government aims to !ransfer operating and management functions to the farmers
themselves. Local enterprises will be encouraged to develop capacity to undertake rehabilitation and
maintenance work on behalf of local WUAs. To achieve this, the Government intends to (a) increase
consultation between the public authorities and water users; (b) improve resource mobilization at both
the central and the decentralized levels; (c) improve the prograniming and planning process at the
local level, with active WUA participation; (d) decentralize and strengthen the Ministry of
Agriculture, so as to enhance coordination and improve the quality of the technical support services
to farmers; (e) strengthen training activities targeting both the public authorities and the beneficiaries



3
of the irrigation schemc rehabilitation programs; and (I) enact legislation governing the procedures
fot transfer to the users of the responsibility for the rehabilitated irrigation schemes.
9.     Project Objectives. The piroject would support the coLIntry development strategy, whichi is
being presented simultaneously to the Board, on four fronts: (a) promnoting growlth - it would
contribute to increased agricultural output through better wvater managemenit and intensified
agricultural extension on rehabilitated irrigation schemes: (b) poverty reductioni - it wouold contribute
to improved rural incomes and food security by improving production and productivity on irrigation
schemes in all of Madagascar's six rural provinces; (c) imaproving environmental mnanagement - it
would develop techniques for enviroiinental assessment of irrigation re'habilitation and reinforce iocal
capacity for environmental assessment; (d) enhancing prqject implementation caparity - it would
establish operational procedures for the transfer of management and financial responsibilitv for the
operations and maintenance of public irrigation schemes to water usels, thus serving to reduce the
burden of public expenditure on the maintenance of such irrigation infrastructure. It would use the
rehabilitation of public irrigation schemes as an incentive to involve water users in long tenm
maintenance and -perations of these schemes. It would strengthen the effectiveness of decentralized
public services and the control and supervision of public works at regional and local levels. It wouid
thus contribute to improving the coordination of local project and program activities, which currently
operate independently. It would contribute to improved productivity of the rural population by using
accessible and proven technology, and would serve to promote private sector initiatives, and recourse
to local consultants and engineering services. It would also establish criteria for the selection of
schemes to be rehabilitated taking account of environmental implicat.ons. The lessons drawn from
the project experience will provide guidelines for future efforts on other irrigation schemes which
have benefitted from recent rehabilitation works, and whose sustainable upkeep and maintenance
represent a major liability for public funding.
10.    Project Description. The project would be implemented over a five-year period and would
comprise the following components: (a) Cyclone damage repair and corrective rehabilitation
works (IJS$4.1 million): Urgent repairs of damage caused by cyclones Daisy and Geralda (US$2.8
million) will be tackled in the early months of the project. During the execution of these works and
of other corrective works during the first two years of the project, a genuine commitment,
demonstrated by contributions in cash and in kind, will be sought from members of the WUAs, on
schemes which have been rehabilitated under the first project Services from field staff will be
intensified, and the details of the new responsibilities of the state and the water users will be
disseminated. The potential role of associations for women producers on the rehabilitated irrigated
schemes will be given special attention. (b) Environmental protection (US$1.5 million): An
environmental assessment will be conducted prior to all future rehabilitation. Procedures and criteria
will be based on the experience of the 30 irrigated schemes rehabilitated under the first project. The
project will fund a study of the impact of environmental degradation on the operation of these
schemes and will fund limited environment protection works. An environmental assessment guide for
irrigation schemes will be prepared to help with the rehabilitation of future schemes. Local
consultants would be trained in environment assessment mitigation by organizing seminars based on
the experience gained under the project. The project will fund a disaster compensat i)n study. (c)
Rehabilitation of new irrigation schemes (US$8.2 million): Rehabilitation work on additional
schemes (indicatively 4,000 ha) will proceed only when firm progress has been made on the above
two components. Preliminary identification of the schemes has been made in the inventory study
prepared under the first project but final selection will depend upon (i) the level of firm commitment
identified among the water users; (ii) the economic viability of the schemes; (iii) the environmental
assessment; and (iv) their proximity to a road outlet. (d) Support to the MEADR (US$5.2 million):
The project would provide support to the Directorates of Rural Works, Agriculture, Programming



4
and Finance, Lands (Domaines) and Water and Forests to enable the MEADR to provide more
professional and effective technical support services for irrigation scheme operation and maintenance
and transfer of agricultural technology. The project will support these services in nine regions andi
in five out of six of Madagascar's existiing faritany (provinces), as part of support for a more
generalized decentralization of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's services
envisaged under the new constitution. (e) Training (US$0.7 million) - Training of field staff,
regional technical and administrative staff and national level technical and coordination staff will
continue to be a major component of the second phase project. (f) Mlonitoring and Evaluation/Audit
(US$0.2 million) - The project would provide for continuous monitoring and evaluation of project
impact including increases in production and yields. adoption rates of extension messages and
performance by water users' associations both in collection of dues for O&M and in implementation
of c*peration and maintenance of the rehabilitated schemes. (g) O&JI by Water Users Associations
(US$1.3 million) - Once rehabilitated schemes have been formally transferred to WUAs, maintenance
and operations will be carried out by the Associations. Funding under this component will come
solely from the WUAs, Collection of contributions from members of Water Users' Associations will
be a critical parameter to be monitored in project execution.
ii.   Estimated project costs, disbursement and procurement arrangements to be followed under
the project are detailed in the attachments to this memorandum.
12.   Project Sustainability. Longer term sustainability of the investment and institutional reforms
initiated by the project depends upon the establishment of a commitment by local water users'
associations to take over responsibility for the O&M costs of the rehabilitated irrigation schemes.
The project will introduce participative techniques to encourage farmers' involvement in local
decision-making. Through more professional and regular farm extension services, the project will
also contribute to a reestablishment of confidence between .he public and private sectors, whicl
should consequently ensure the longer term terhnical sustainability.
13.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. Lending to the irrigation sector in
Madagascar began in 1970 with a project to improve the irrigation and drainage of some 12,000 ha
in the Lac Alaotra area. Subsequent credits in support of large scale irrigation schemes in the
Morondava, Samangoky and Lac Alaotra followed during the 1970s and 1980s. They all shared
similar problems of poor post-project maintenance, ineffectiveness of the extensio .ervices and poor
management by parastatal companies. Over-sophistication in the technical and ma..agerial design of
the projects also explained poor performance. Ex-post impact evaluations recommended, among
other things, the need for private sector involvement and close collaboration with water users and
water user associations. Government now recognizes it has neither the financial nor managerial
capacity to operate these large scale schemes, as originally envisaged.
14.   With the implementation of the first Irrigation Rehabilitation project (Cr. 1589-MAG) in
1985, a more successful formula for irrigation development and rehabilitation was developed. The
project demonstrated the importance of a detailed assessment of beneficiary commitment throughout
the design and implementation process. The importance of an assessment of the conditions of the
catchment areas above individual schemes became clear. Draft legislation was prepared (and has
since been adopted), defining the roles and responsibilities of the State and of water users, once
operations and maintenance have been transferred. Improved agricultural production was achieved
on the rehabilitated schemes more from improved water management than from adoption of improved
technology.  Flexibility was a key principle in project implementation, leading to successful
implementation after a slow start-up.



5
15.   The design of this second phase project has taken account of these lessons and builds on past
experience. Considerable involvement of water users is envisaged at an early stage and throughout
the rehabilitation process. There are no parastatal agencies involved and thie water users themselves
will be made responsible at an early stage for ensuring fcr reliable water supp'y {o their schemes.
Improved cost-effectiveness will be achieved by applying preselection criteria to comzpaniies bidding
to carry out civil works. Agricultural extension efforts will be intensified and hetter maniaged.
16.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's main objectives in Madagascar are to help the
government promote private sector- and export-led growth, attack poverty, improve natural resource
management, build local capacity and improve project implementation. A key underlying theme is
redefinition of the role of the state, improving the quality of public services, and expanding the role
of the private sector in investment and the provision of services. The proposed project is consistent
with the country assistance strategy, which is being presented to the Board simriultaneously with this
investment proposal, and contributes to meeting all of the above objectives. The project will
stimulate growth through the rehabilitation of key irrigation infrastructure, which is needed to
increase agricultural production and productivity. It will attack poverty by increasing rural iicomes
and food security in Madagascar's six rural provinces. It will develop techniques for environmental
assessment of irrigation rehabilitation and reinforce local capacity for environmental assessment. The
project will enhance project implementation capacity by transferring the management and financial
responsibility for the operation and maintenance of public irrigation schemes to water users, thus
reducing the role of the state and the burden on public expenditure. Finally, it will encourage
participatory approaches in project execution and provide resources for training.
17.    Actions Agreed. Assurances obtained during negotiations include: (i) agreement to submit
a project execution program, budget and financial plan annually before October 31, for the following
year's activities; (ii) project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA; (iii) audits of financial accounts will be submitted to IDA not more than six months after the
close of each financial year; (iv) reports on project implementation progress would be submitted to
IDA and other donors semi-annually at the end of March and at the end of September each year; (v)
the MEADR would fix a common policy on field allowances for all projects before the end of 1994
and (vi) the MEADR would maintain the irrigation sector coordination committee, whose secretariat
would be assured by the national irrigation program coordinator; (vii) Government would carry out
in consultation with donors, a mid-term evaluation of the project; (viii) Government would carry out,
in consultation with donors, an annual review of the public expenditure program for the agricultural
sector. Effectiveness of the credit would be subject to the deposit of an initial amount of US$100,000
as Government's contribution to the project account.
18.    Environmental Aspects. Irrigation has a major positive impact in increasing yields and
national productivity, as well as improving local living standards and diets. In Madagascar, irrigation
also has a positive impact by alleviating agricultural pressure on the marginal hillside lands. Adverse
direct environmental impacts of rehab.litation could result from problems due to technical design
flaws and the damage caused by construction during physical rehabilitation. With proper supervision,
such impacts can be reduced to negligible proportions. The direct impacts most often associated with
intensive irrigation (soil degradation, surface water contamination by fertilizers and pesticides and the
increased risk of water borne diseases) are not significant at this time on the rehabilitated irrigation
schemes in Madagascar and should pose no major threat with sound farming and maintenance
practices.
19.    Adverse indirect .npacts of rehabilitation usually include the degradation of watersheds
upstream of the rehabilitated schemes, with a moderate to high adverse impact on certain schemes



6
during and after rehabilitation. Cyclones have also had on occasioni a moderate to very hlighi impact
on the environment, both during the rehabilitation phase and during subsequenlt scheme operations.
Byf conducting an environmental analysis prior to any new rehabilitation, the project will make a
major effort to avoid adverse rehabilitation effects experienced io date. For the rehabilitated schemiies
under the first project, scheme-specific evaluiaiions will he carried out as part of a moie global
retrospective evaluation.  Thlis evaluation will provide recommendatiolns wllich will serve as a
reference in the development of futurc imitigation plans.
20.    Program Objective Categories (POCs). The proJect supports thlree POCs: food security,
poverty alleviation aad capacity building (government sLrvices and farmer groups). 34 percent of the
popuLtion in Madagascar are estimiiated to be afficted by lood insecurity. The project will contribute
to reducing food insecurit) ii- rural areas an(d will increase rural incomiies among smallholder rice
producers, whlo wvith average, holding. of half a hectare, are among the poor.st of the rural
population. The project monitoring indicators developed and agreed with government cover these
categories and will be reviewed regularly in the framework of annual supervision.
21.    Project Benefits. The project will make a major contribution to the reinforcement of the
technical services of the Ministry of Agriculture, both at the central level and more especially a!
provincial and local levels. This institutional strengthening will benefit agricultural development in
Madagascar in general, and the irrigatior. sub-sector in particular. Through the improvement of water
management on existing irrigation schemes, the project will have a direct impact on increasing the
income of approximately 40,000 small scale farm families. B) introducing the possibility of cropping
in the off-season, the area cultivated may be increased by up to 50 percent. The introduction of
better organized agricultural extension services and the application of improved techniques for rice
and other crops will lead to increased yields and hence output. With the transfer of the responsibility
for operations and maintenance of the medium-sized irrigation schemes, the recurrent costs of
maintenance of these schemes from public funding sources will be reduced. Once rehabilitation has
been completed and the schemes have been taken over by the water users, it is estimated that there
will be a saving of the equivalent of US$500,000 per year to the public exchequer.
22.    Risks. The success of the project depends, among other things, on the successful transfer
of the management and the maintenance of the rehabilitated schemes to local WUAs. The project
has incorporated the principle of progressive rehabilitation, with an assessment of physical and
monetary contributions at each stage of the rehabilitation. In addition, z, more intensive process of
local feed-back and participation in project execution by beneficiaries will permit project staff to
assess the levels of local commitment of the WUAs at different stages. Given the progress registered
under the first project, there is a high probability that management and maintenance responsibility
will be successfully transferred.
23.    The lack of intensified agricultural extension support provided by the Directorate for
Agriculture following rehabilitation was one reason for the only modest improvements in agricultural
productivity and production during the first project. The risk of a lack of collaboration by the
Department of Agriculture is reduced in the light of the (a) the renewed political commitment by the
Ministry of Agriculture on improving the effectiveness and professional quality of its national
agricultural extension service; and (b) the resources which will be mobilized specifically for the
Department of Agriculture to improve the quality of extension support on and around the rehabilitated
schemes, unlike the previous project, when such resources were not specifically identified.
24.    In order to ensure longer term sustainability of the rehabilitation program, virtually no
recourse is anticipated to long term technical assistance. In its place, short term assignments by



7
consultants, both national and expatriate, are envisaged. There is a risk that this might result in a
higher incidence of technical errors in rehabilitation design.
25.   Insufficient funding of the Government's contribution to the project could have a negative
impact on execution. However, the project budget approval and financing arrangements are such as
to minimize the impact of delinquency by any cofinancier. IDA funds will be made available on a
lender of last resort basis, and annual work programs and budgets will be designed accordingly. An
intensified dialogue between the Bank and the Government on macroeconomic questions will focus
attention on the public expenditure program, through which priority counterpart funding obligations
would be flagged. The risks of poor Government funding performance seriously affecting successful
project implementation are low.
26.   The risk of environmental damage to water catchment areas feeding newly rehabilitated
schemes, as encountered under the first project, would be minimized by the environmental
assessments proposed in the selection of additional schemes for rehabilitation. On the basis of
historical evidence, there is nonetheless an five to ten percent possibilitv that rehabilitated schemes
will suffer from cyclone damage or other natural disaster within ten years of rehabilitation.
27.   Recommnendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreemenit of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

SECOND IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Note on projects with significant disbursement lag
I.    Most projects with IDA linancing in Madagascar have suffered froma slow disbursements
due partiN to generic problems. including: (a) lack of counterpart funds, (b) difficulties for project
managers to access IDA funds deposited in special accounts opened by the Central Bank and
operated by signatories in the Treasury; and (c) cumbersome public procurement procedures due
to repeated reviews by central agencies. lhe situation worsened in July 1991 witlh the onset of
political turmoil. Large scale demonstrations and strikes paralvzed public adminiistration and
severely disrupted economic activity. The country has now completed a process of political
tranc ion (new government in place since late August 1993).  Project implementation has
continued to be slow during the two-year transition. The generic problems noted above have
affected all projects, in addition to othIer project-specific factors causing delays. The fol!owing
projects have the most significant disbursement lags:
Accounting and Mianagement Training Project (Cr. 1661-MAG). Even though the project has
attained most of its goals, disbursements are low, with larger than anticipated co-financing
through grants from Canada and France. Agreement has been reached on possible uses for some
of the remaining funds, and a little more than USSI million has been cancelled.
Forest Management (Cr. 1878-MAG). Implementation of this project has been delayed by a
wide variety of problems (organizational, personnel, counterpart funds, and marketing). A mid-
term review in March 1992 made recommendations to redirect and streamline the project and
agreed on an action plan, which the Forestry Department (DEF) has so far implemented with
minor delays. Consideration is being given to transferring the activities under this component to
the Environment project (Cr 2125-MAG), which has similar objectives The Fanamalanga pine
forest plantation has almost completed reorganizing and equipping itself to meet its tasks, and is
continuing its efforts to find foreigni operators who are interested in its products and by-products.
Seventh Highway Project (Cr. 1905-MAG). This project was mostly affected by the generic
problems of cumbersome procurement procedures and lack of counterpart funds. Many contracts
have now been signed and disbursements have increased significantly (USS8 million in FY93 and
US$13.8 million already in FY94 by the end of April 1994).
Economic Management and Social Action Project (Cr. 1967-MAG). Implementation of IDA-
financed components was slow, partly due to complexity of project design. Components financed
by grants from Switzerland and UNDP were disbursing more rapidly. Following the
establishment of a new coordination unit (private sector), the disbursement rate picked up and the
project was re-designed in October 1992 to streamline its activities.
National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 2042-MAG). The project experienced an eight-
month start-up delay in meeting credit effectiveness conditions. Project execution was disrupted
in 1991 due to the political turmoil in the country and continued to be affected by institutional
disputes. Several missions in 1993 and 1994 have focussed on restructuring the project, and a
proposal to downsize the project and cancel part of the credit has been implemented.

Education Sector Reinforcement Project (Cr. 2094-AIAG). Only about 30)'X of this credit has
been disbursed, even though the project has been effective for three years. Project objectives and
design are being simplified in order to speed up project implementation
Financial Sector and Private Enterprise Development (APEX) Project (Cr. 2104-NMAG). The
APEX credit, despite a good commitment record, is not disbursing rapidly. A mid-term review
in October 1993 gave particular attention to identifying and addressing the problems which have
being holding up disbursements. Actions to remedy a number of problems (e.g. authorization
for Central Bank to request disbursement directly, simplified methodology for ERR calculation,
clarification of eligibility criteria, procurement guidelines, more regular monitoring) were agreed
upon with the Borrower and for the most part have been implemented.
Antananarivo Plain Development Project (Cr. 2117-AIAG). This project experienced start-up
delays, due both to cumbersome procurement procedures as well as complicated resettlement
issues, but most of these problems have been resolved and disbursements are expected to pick
up considerably.
Environment Project (Cr. 2125-MAG). Madagascar's period of political and social instability
coincided with, and affected, the start-up of this project. The institutional set-up of the project
has, however, been put in place and has helped develop a satisfactory implementation capacity.
The project now needs to concentrate on priority areas and establish realistic objectives and
performance criteria. A mid-term review mission and meeting with the cofinanciers in December
1993 addressed these issues.
National Health Project (Cr. 2251-MAG). Start-up of this project was delayed due to slow
establishment of a project management structure. Progress is still slow and a mid-term review
is planned for Fall 1994 to define steps to improve project performance and its contribution to
sector objectives.
2.    Some recent breakthroughs have been made which should go some way towards
addressing the generic problems of the portfolio. A CPPR was carried out in April 1994 during
which a calendar was agreed upon to address remaining issues and to complete the restructuring
of the portfolio, particularly in the case where projects are incompatible with execution or
financial capacity, or do not respond any longer to today's development priorities; clearer
responsibilities will be given to project managers; innovative mean of project implementation and
management will be introduced following the positive experience of the Antananarivo Urban
Works Project; systematic monitoring of performance will be implemented. These breakthroughs
followed the Country Implementation Review (CIR) in Antananarivo in December 1990 and a
follow-up CIR in March 1992, which resulted in: (a) new regulations for procurement and use
standard bidding documents which comply with Bank guidelines; and (b) a decree allowing
project managers to have direct access to special accounts to be opened in commercial banks.
In FY93, disbursements for investment operations reached US$41 million, i.e. almost 80% more
than the total amount disbursed in FY92. In FY94, US$38 million had been disbursed as of
April 1994. A Bank implementation specialist will be assigned to the Resident Mission in early
FY 95. The specialist will train local staff and help project managers to develop and use
appropriate tools for accelerating project implementation.
