          TRENDS AND THE JOBS
          CHALLENGE IN TURKEY

                    Putting more human capital to use
                    and making it more productive is
                    crucial for growth

                    1. The performance of the labor market
                    after the crisis has been remarkable,
                    but employment rates have remained
                    stubbornly low. Employment has been
                    growing at an outstanding 5.5 percent
                    per annum since the last quarter of
                    2009. Despite this remarkable upturn, the
                    share of the population 15 years of age or
                    older working was only 45.2 percent by
                    the second quarter of 2012 (seasonally-
                    adjusted), down from 52 percent in
                    1990, making it the lowest employment
                    rate in the OECD (19 percentage points
                    below the OECD average) 3 (Figure 1
                    and Figure 2). This downward trend is in
                    sharp contrast with the long-term upward
                    trend in real GDP and largely unaffected
                    by crisis and recovery episodes, except
                    for the recent post-crisis period when
                    the employment-to-growth elasticity
                    increased to 0.72 (from 0.34 between
                    the first quarter of 2005 and the third
                    quarter of 2008). Unemployment rates
                    have increased somewhat from around
                    8 percent in 1988 to 9 percent by the

     2. LABOR MARKETS THROUGH
THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND RECOVERY
                       Data and methodology

                       1. The analysis of the impact of the
                       crisis on labor market outcomes is
                       based on the comparison of growth
                       rates during the crisis with growth
                       rates before the crisis. 9 Comparing
                       growth rates rather than levels makes
                       it possible to isolate the impact of the
                       crisis from prior trends in labor market
                       outcomes. In particular, the impact
                       of the crisis on a given labor market
                       indicator is calculated as the difference
                       between the average growth rate of that
                       indicator during the crisis (i.e. year-on-
                       year changes) and its average growth rate
                       before the crisis. The pre-crisis period
                       goes from the first quarter of 2006 until
                       the third quarter of 2008. Extending the
                       pre-crisis period to 2006 mitigates the
                       influence of the rapid increases in food
                       and fuel prices in 2007 and 2008— the
                       Turkish economy started to slow down in
                       2007  . GDP growth rates turned negative
                       from the last quarter of 2008 until the
                       third quarter of 2009, defining the crisis
                       period. Thus the post-crisis period starts
                       in the last quarter of 2009. The study also
                       looks at the degree of recovery from the
                       crisis by looking at how much of the pre-
                       crisis levels of labor market outcomes
                       has been recovered post-crisis (i.e. the

One explanation for the surge in agricultural employment is higher agricultural prices, which

has made the sector more profitable and thus attractive for investments that have in turn                          in construction and agriculture. By the               (monthly earnings per hour), as working
generated employment. The figure below shows that until 2007 changes in agricultural                               fourth quarter of 2010, manufacturing                 hours, on a downward trend before the
prices in Turkey were closely aligned with world food prices and general producer prices. In
2007 , world food prices shot up while Turkey’s agricultural prices increased more modestly                        e m p l oy m e n t h a d r e c ove r e d t o i t s    crisis, declined even faster during the

Turkey’s agricultural prices decreased more marginally. By the end of 2009 world food prices
started shooting up and Turkey’ agricultural prices followed the same course this time (and                        construction and agriculture was 19
well above the trend in general producer prices). Thus the trend in agricultural prices could                      and 9 percent, respectively, above pre-               11. The reduction in household labor
explain some of the increase in agricultural employment in 2007 and could have had a lot                           crisis levels. The relative stability of              income was driven by household
to do with the increases after the crisis. Gürsel and İmamoglu (2011) make use of regional
variation in agricultural employment between 2004 and 2010 to show that indeed changes in                          agricultural employment since 2007                    members not finding or losing jobs
agricultural prices are a significant predictor of changes in agricultural employment.                             is explained by a combination of the                  and lower self-employment income.
