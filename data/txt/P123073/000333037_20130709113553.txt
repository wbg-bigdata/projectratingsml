                           2. LABOR MARKETS THROUGH

                                             Data and methodology

                                             1. The analysis of the impact of the
                                             crisis on labor market outcomes is
                                             based on the comparison of growth
                                             rates during the crisis with growth
                                             rates before the crisis. 9 Comparing
                                             growth rates rather than levels makes
                                             it possible to isolate the impact of the
                                             crisis from prior trends in labor market
                                             outcomes. In particular, the impact
                                             of the crisis on a given labor market
                                             indicator is calculated as the difference
                                             between the average growth rate of that
                                             indicator during the crisis (i.e. year-on-
                                             year changes) and its average growth rate
                                             before the crisis. The pre-crisis period
                                             goes from the first quarter of 2006 until
                                             the third quarter of 2008. Extending the
                                             pre-crisis period to 2006 mitigates the
                                             influence of the rapid increases in food
                                             and fuel prices in 2007 and 2008— the
                                             Turkish economy started to slow down in
                                             2007  . GDP growth rates turned negative
                                             from the last quarter of 2008 until the
                                             third quarter of 2009, defining the crisis
                                             period. Thus the post-crisis period starts
                                             in the last quarter of 2009. The study also
                                             looks at the degree of recovery from the
                                             crisis by looking at how much of the pre-
                                             crisis levels of labor market outcomes
                                             has been recovered post-crisis (i.e. the

                                             9- The methodology used in this study follows

                              Latest post-crisis monthly data is July 2012 (labor force participation rate (LFPR), the employment rate (ER) and the
                              unemployment rate (UR)). Impacts are in percentage points; degree of recovery is ratio of latest quarter to pre-crisis
                              average level. HI: per capita household disposable income (real) (SILC), HLI: per capita household disposable labor
                              income (real). Labor transitions are relative to the previous year. EE is the transition from employed to employed;
                              EU: from employed to unemployed; EOLF: from employed to out of the labor force. The analysis of labor transitions
                              is based on the 2006-2009 panel of households, where the pre-crisis trend is the difference between transition rates
                              from 2007 to 2008 and transition rates from 2006 and 2007, while the crisis trend is the difference between transitions
                              from 2008-2009 and transitions from 2007-2008 (see Tables A1 and A2 in the annex for all transition rates). The
                              analysis of household income is based on the full sample of households for 2006-2010. Income refers to total annual
                              income in the year prior to the survey. In this case we can use 2008 as part of the crisis period (2008-2009), while 2005
                              is added to the pre-crisis period (2005-2007) to make results more robust (see Table A3 for growth rates of household
                              income and impacts). In both cases, results must be interpreted with caution as they are based on annual data.

                      informal to formal wage employment                  increasing after the crisis. Before the
                      that instead went to informal self-                 crisis, agriculture was mostly shedding
                      employment and inactivity. And most                 workers, although that trend started
                      ‘added’ workers went to informal self-              changing right before the crisis (Figure

                      average pre-crisis level by the fourth              employment was mostly due to new

                      Box: The crisis and high food prices are behind the stalling of
                      agricultural shedding since 2007.
                      One of the salient structural transformations of the Turkish economy since the 1990s is the
                      decrease in the share of agriculture in total employment and output, as the non-agricultural
                      sector becomes more attractive and productivity increases in agriculture push labor out
                      of agriculture. While agricultural subsidies have slowed down this process, the downward
                      trend in agricultural employment continued until 2007: the share of agricultural employment
                      halved from 46 percent in 1990 to 23.5 percent in 2007      , while the number of agricultural
                      workers declined from 9 million to 6 million during the same period. In parallel, the share of
                      agriculture in GDP decreased from 17   .5 percent to 7.6 percent.

                      Since 2007  , however, this trend has been reversed: agricultural employment increased by
                      26 percent between 2007 and 2011 and its share in total employment reached 25.5 percent
                      in 2011. The increase has been larger for unpaid family labor and women. During the same
                      period agricultural output increased by 17 percent in real terms and the share of agriculture
                      in GDP increased to 7  .9 percent in 2011. Why has agricultural employment been growing
                      since 2007?

                      First, the process of agricultural shedding is far more complete, so the recent surge in
                      agricultural employment is unlikely to indicate a structural shift.Turkish farms are still mostly
                      family-owned, small and fragmented. Wage earners are only 10 percent of total employment
                      and unpaid family workers are the main employment category (47 percent in 2011). Labor
                      productivity is very low and there is still abundance of (mostly) low-skilled labor, which
                      makes the employment-to-output elasticity very low—and agricultural output has indeed
                      increased since 2007 .

            One explanation for the surge in agricultural employment is higher agricultural prices, which
            has made the sector more profitable and thus attractive for investments that have in turn
            generated employment. The figure below shows that until 2007 changes in agricultural
            prices in Turkey were closely aligned with world food prices and general producer prices. In
            2007 , world food prices shot up while Turkey’s agricultural prices increased more modestly
            but faster than general producer prices. Around mid-2008 world food prices plunged while
            Turkey’s agricultural prices decreased more marginally. By the end of 2009 world food prices
            started shooting up and Turkey’ agricultural prices followed the same course this time (and
            well above the trend in general producer prices). Thus the trend in agricultural prices could
            explain some of the increase in agricultural employment in 2007 and could have had a lot
            to do with the increases after the crisis. Gürsel and İmamoglu (2011) make use of regional
            variation in agricultural employment between 2004 and 2010 to show that indeed changes in
            agricultural prices are a significant predictor of changes in agricultural employment.

           agricultural enterprises (survey of salary structure).


            The other explanation is increased attractiveness of agricultural jobs relative to non-
            agricultural jobs, particularly during the crisis. Agricultural employment served as a cushion
            against the crisis. The increase in agricultural employment mostly came in the form of
            unpaid family labor that came from inactivity (added-worker effect). Agriculture could have
            also become a more attractive sector for low-skilled salaried workers as a result of the
            increase in the relative labor demand for low-skilled workers in agriculture. One way to see
            that is by looking at the levels and trends of agricultural wages versus minimum wages.
            Indeed, the figure above shows that agricultural wages were below minimum wages and
            started growing faster than minimum wages from 2004, reaching the same level in 2006,
            increasing thereafter to peak at a level 24 percent higher than minimum wages in 2008 and
            staying around that level, but still growing, since then. So the increase in relative wages in
            agriculture could have contributed to the increase in agricultural employment since 2007      .
            Gürsel and İmamoglu (2011) find that changes in non-agricultural wages for low-skilled
            workers do explain changes in agricultural employment in 2004-10.

                                                   overall and distributional impacts of the
                                                   crisis and recovery on the labor market
                                                   due to policies? Surely policies have
                                                   some explanatory power but exactly how
                                                   much is hard to tell because of the lack of
                                                   a credible counterfactual, i.e. what would
                                                   have happened in the absence of these
                                                   policies. This section looks at this question,
                                                   but rather than attempting to evaluate
                                                   the impact of policies, the focus is rather
                                                   on making a constructive assessment
                                                   of policy measures taken during the
                                                   business cycle and existing labor market

                                                   The (reasonable) assumption is that while
                                                   policies may have had an effect, this effect
                                                   was not strong enough to change the
                                                   sign of the observed impacts. The focus
                                                   of the analysis is on employment and

                                                 1. Crises are rarely fully predictable,
                                                 but there are measures Turkey can

                                                 responsive to them. This section
                                                 makes use of the analysis of the impact
                                                 of the crisis and policy responses
                                                 in Turkey as well as lessons from

                                                 response to a crisis needs to be timely
                                                 (when needed), address the nature
                                                 of the adjustment (e.g. jobs versus
                                                 earnings), well-targeted to those
                                                 who need support and temporary

                                          1. Clearly, many of the policies to
                                          manage labor markets through the

                                          policies to improve the functioning
                                          of the labor market, also address the
                                          long-term labor market challenges
                                          outlined in Section 1. The Government
                                          is well aware of these challenges and
                                          has made employment a top policy
                                          priority with important initiatives such
                                          as those outlined in Section 3. And a
                                          new National Employment Strategy is
                                          in the making. The aim of this section is
                                          to build on these initiatives and provide
                                          additional options to enhance productive
                                          employment in Turkey—putting more
                                          human capital to use and making it more
                                          productive, while recognizing that more
                                          work is needed to refine these options.

                                          2. More research is needed on the

                                          come up with others. The report notes
                                          the stalling of agricultural labor shedding
                                          since 2006, which is explained by a
                                          combination of higher food prices and
                                          the added-worker effect during the crisis.
                                          And subsidies to agriculture have slowed

                                          however, is the extent to which there

                      individual actions to find employment
                      and participation in specific activation
                      programs, based on an employability                           39- The plan is also to provide counseling
