                               The objective of the program supported by the REGE-DPL2 is to
                               support equitable growth and job creation over the medium term, by
                               advancing critical business climate and broader competitiveness
                               reforms, while carrying forward Turkey’s public expenditure reform
                               agenda with a focus on the delivery of inclusive social programs at
                               sustainable cost. The PPDPL/REGE-DPL series supports key reforms
                               in the provision of inclusive social services (health and social security),
                               while making these sustainable by reining in costs. Reforms in the area
                               of equitable growth and employment focus on the business climate and
                               selected improvements to vocational and basic education.

                               The proposed REGE-DPL2 was included in the Country Partnership
    Program Development        Strategy (CPS) as updated by the Country Partnership Strategy Progress
    Objective(s) and           Report, which was presented to the Executive Board on January 7,
    Contribution to            2010. The program supports all three pillars of the CPS:
    Country Partnership        • Business climate reforms (enactment of the new Commercial Code,
    Strategy (CPS)                 enactment of the new Civil Procedures Law, and enactment of the
                                   new Code of Obligations) support the first pillar aimed at
                                   improving competitiveness and employment;
                               • The expansion of universal health insurance and the
                                   implementation of the pre-school expansion program contribute to
                                   the second pillar, equitable human and social development;
                               • The enactments of the new Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) law
                                   and the new Law on Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids,
                                   regulating monitoring and supervision mechanisms for the design
                                   and implementation of state aids, as well as the continued
                                   implementation of global budgets for Ministry of Health hospitals
                                   and spending caps for university and private hospitals, support the
                                   third pillar, the efficient provision of high-quality public services.
                               There are three main risks to the program’s outcomes: (i) economic and
                               external risks, (ii) implementation risks, and (iii) political risks.

                               Economic and external risks. The main macroeconomic risk is that a
                               reversal of capital flows could cause a significant growth slowdown,
                               given the high level of the current account deficit. The authorities and
                               the financial markets are watching the direction of the current account
                               deficit carefully, although indicators so far suggest that it is financeable.
    Risks and Risk
                               Turkey’s substantial foreign exchange reserves and flexible exchange
    Mitigation
                               rate regime mitigate risks associated with capital reversals.

                               Continued uncertainty about the state of the global economy creates
                               downside risks to the global demand for Turkish exports (especially
                               from the EU), to output growth and fiscal performance. There is also a
                               risk of increased inflation and overheating, fuelled by capital inflows,
                               continued lending growth as well as external developments, which if
                               not addressed could lead to a growth slowdown. Lower growth could in


only independent, comparative and regular measure of budget transparency and accountability around the world. Of
the 94 countries evaluated in 2010, Turkey ranked in the top 30 percent. In 2006, Turkey was in the 58 percentile
rank.

challenge for the authorities is to determine the right policy mix in the
face of these vulnerabilities, while favorable near-term growth
prospects and healthy balance sheets will likely continue to attract
capital inflows. Measures to mitigate risks would include in the short
term a combination of fiscal and macro-prudential tightening, more
restrictive liquidity conditions and further competitiveness-enhancing
structural reforms. In the longer term, higher productivity, higher
exports to more diverse markets, higher domestic saving, and greater
energy efficiency and diversification of energy sources are the keys to
reducing Turkey’s reliance on external finance.

There is some risk associated with recent political developments in the
Middle East and North Africa, and a major downside risk arises from a
sustained increase in oil prices. It is estimated that a USD10 increase in
the price of a barrel of oil is estimated to increase Turkey’s current
account deficit by 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP. If oil prices remain at or
above the recently elevated levels, Turkey’s strong macroeconomic
performance may be hindered, and risks associated with the
sustainability of a high current account deficit would increase. The
proposed REGE-DPL2 operation helps Turkey mitigate these risks
mainly by supporting reforms to improve the business climate, which
will help increase the competitiveness of the private sector, thus
promoting exports as well as higher inflows of foreign direct
investment. Longer term mitigation measures include increasing energy
efficiency and diversifying into non-oil energy sources, such as wind
and solar energy—an agenda that the Turkish authorities are pursuing
as a priority and with Bank support, including under a complementary
DPL series focusing on environmentally sustainable development and
the energy sector.

Implementation risks. Effective implementation of major public
reforms needs strong coordination and monitoring. Public sector
reforms tend to be cross-cutting and take time to implement. Moreover,
social consensus on the reform program and sufficient institutional
capacity are needed for successful implementation. The complexity and
social impact of many elements of the reform program, including the
labor market reform, requires consensus building among social partners
that takes time and inevitably results in compromises. On the private
sector agenda, the effective implementation of the newly enacted
Commercial Code will require a major upgrade in the capacity of the
auditing profession to deal with the enhanced transparency and
accountability requirements introduced by the Code. Similarly, the
introduction of civil and criminal liability for violations of corporate
governance standards is likely to raise additional challenges for
Turkey’s judicial system. As in many other countries, the introduction
of tighter reporting requirements could bring about requests for delays
in the application of these new requirements.

Political risks. Turkey has had a majority government since 2002
under the Justice and Development Party (AKP), facilitating the

                      iii
               implementation of major reforms. Key risks relate to continuing
               domestic political differences and the possibility that the outcome of the
               upcoming general elections scheduled to be held in June 2011 could
               slow the pace or reduce the effectiveness of economic and social
               reforms. The EU accession agenda remains an anchor and the process
               of harmonization with European legislation and regulation continues to
               be part of the Turkish reform agenda.

    PROPOSED SECOND RESTORING EQUITABLE GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT
         PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN (REGE-DPL2)
                     TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY

                                         I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      Turkey has recovered strongly from the effects of the 2008-09 global crises. The
Turkish economy contracted by 4.7 percent in 2009 but bounced back to grow by more than 8
percent (est.) in 2010 3. This recovery was underpinned by economic reforms undertaken since
2001: fiscal adjustment, modernized debt management, an independent central bank, inflation
targeting, a freely floating currency, and improved banking supervision. Turkey also continues
implementing a major long-term structural reform agenda—ranging from public financial
management, health systems, and education to large-scale privatization and regulatory, energy,
and environmental reforms. The Government’s program proposed to be supported by the Second
Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy Loan (REGE-DPL2) focuses,
in particular, on critical business climate and competitiveness reforms, while carrying forward
Turkey’s ongoing fiscal and public financial management reforms. With these reforms, Turkey
aims to encourage private-sector led growth, employment, and improved social outcomes. They
will also help manage external vulnerabilities to safeguard and extend recent economic gains.

2.      The objective of the program supported by the REGE-DPL2 is to support equitable
growth and job creation over the medium term. The first of the program’s two main
prongs is a set of critical business climate and broader competitiveness reforms. Turkey’s
medium-term growth strategy includes a continued focus on trade and financial integration with
the EU and an increasingly diversified set of other partners, with export growth expected to play
an important role as competitiveness improves and global economic growth resumes. Sustaining
high growth rates in the medium term requires using more of the available labor and using it
more productively than before. Success rests on reforms to enhance competitiveness and
productive employment by improving the business climate and strengthening education and
skills. The proposed REGE-DPL2 supports critical reforms with those objectives, and the
Government has resumed pre-crisis business climate reform and competitiveness agenda with
vigor. Key among the REGE-DPL 2 supported reforms is the new Commercial Code, which is
central to the creation of more, higher-paying jobs through an improved private-sector regulatory
framework. Expanded and improved vocational training and pre-school education are key steps
on the path to making Turkey’s labor market more competitive and growth more equitable.

3.      The second prong of Government’s program supported by the proposed operation
is the advancement of Turkey’s ongoing public expenditure agenda, with a core objective
on the delivery of inclusive social programs at sustainable cost. The REGE-DPL2 program
includes continuing reforms in the provision of social services (health and social security), while
making these sustainable by reining in costs, including through global budgets and expenditure
caps in the health sector. Also key to delivering quality public services at value for money is the
public financial management agenda. Government’s recent focus on improving the oversight of

public spending, including through laws strengthening the reporting of state aids and the Turkish
Court of Accounts, is supported by the proposed operation.

4.       The proposed REGE-DPL2 is the final loan in a series of four DPLs to Turkey,
which has been central to the Bank’s engagement in Turkey during the 2008-11 CPS
period. It builds on the reform program defined in the First Restoring Equitable Growth and
Employment Development Policy Loan (REGE-DPL), which took forward the ongoing public
sector reform agenda supported under the Programmatic Public Sector (PPDPL) series (REGE-
DPL and REGE-DPL2 are follow-up operations to this series). REGE-DPL also carried forward
critical pending reforms from the Competitiveness and Employment (CEDPL) series, which was
closed and evaluated in an Implementation and Completion Results Report in 2010. 4 Figure 1
explains schematically how the REGE-DPL series relates to these earlier operations.

5.     The results to date of the reform program supported by the programmatic
PPDPL/REGE-DPL series towards meeting its objectives have been positive, both in the
area of supporting equitable growth and job creation as well as in advancing the public
expenditure agenda (see Annex 3). Overall the key measures supported by the PPDPL/REGE-
DPL program have included the enactment and implementation of revised social security and
universal health insurance legislation, the enactment and implementation of a new Public
Financial Management and Control Law, and a broad series of measures aimed at managing the
impact of the global crisis.

6.     Measures supported by the PPDPL/REGE-DPL series (see Annex 2) have provided
support toward the following critical outcomes:
    •   An improved climate for private sector-led job creation. Financial and employment
        measures have protected employment during the 2008-09 global crisis, and the

  Technically, the REGE-DPL2 is defined as the fourth operation of the PPDPL series. See Programmatic Public
Sector Development Policy Loan (PPDPL), Report No. 36274-TR, June 5, 2006; Second Programmatic Public
Sector Development Policy Loan (PPDPL 2), Report No. 43473-TR, May 17, 2008; and Restoring Equitable
Growth and Employment Programmatic Development Policy Loan (REGE-DPL), Report No. 51062-TR, Feb. 24,
2010. See also Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL), Report No. 39826-TR, June
1, 2007; Second Programmatic Competitiveness and Employment DPL (CEDPL 2), Report No. 46436-TR, Nov. 13,
2008. The CEDPL series was closed and evaluated by two Implementation Completion and Results Reports: Report
No. ICR1008, April 1, 2009 and Report No. ICR1443, April 29, 2010.

        unemployment rate has fallen from 14 percent in 2009 to less than 12 percent in 2010,
        while female labor force participation has increased from 24.5 percent in 2008 to 27.6
        percent in 2010. The enactment of a new Commercial Code in 2011 is the cornerstone of
        Turkey’s recent business climate and competitiveness reform agenda, and will help
        facilitate higher private investment and employment going forward.

    •   Fiscal sustainability and government efficiency. Gross public debt levels as a share of
        GDP have fallen from 54.1 percent in 2005 to an estimated 44.5 percent at the end of
        2010, in spite of a sharp increase in 2009 linked to the impact on Turkey of the global
        financial crisis. A series of laws overhauled public financial management and control,
        external audit, and state aids; systemic operational reforms introduced modern
        management methods, such as performance budgeting. Turkey’s Open Budget Index
        improved from 41 in 2006 to 57 by 2010. 5

    •   Social security and universal health insurance reform. The law no. 5510 provides a
        legal and institutional basis for providing access to health insurance for all citizens
        (health insurance coverage increased from 86 percent in 2005 to 94.3 percent in 2010)
        and introduced adjustments to pension parameters that significantly improved the long
        term sustainability of the public pension system. The implementation of the 2008 reform
        has been facilitated by efforts to unify the existing three social security schemes under the
        Social Security Institution (SSI).

    •   Investment in skills. Vocational training ramped up significantly since 2008 (from
        30,000 beneficiaries in 2008 to around 210,000 in 2010), and significant investments
        were made to improve the quality and employment impact of vocational training (e.g.
        vocational standards, quality and performance assessment of training providers) and
        strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system. The job placement rate of the
        unemployed registered with ISKUR also increased from 9.3 percent in 2009 to 9.8
        percent in 2010. The Government formally targeted universal pre-school education and
        by in the 32 provinces targeted by the first phase of the program, enrollment of 5-year
        olds in kindergarten increased from 70 percent in 2009/10 to around 93 percent in
        2010/11.

  The Open Budget Index, produced by the Open Budget Initiative, assigns a score to each country based on the
information it makes available to the public throughout the budget process. The score ranges from zero (no
information) to 100 (extensive information). The Open Budget Initiative is an expert civil society network and the
only independent, comparative and regular measure of budget transparency and accountability around the world. Of
the 94 countries evaluated in 2010, Turkey ranked in the top 30 percent. In 2006, Turkey was in the 58 percentile
rank.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

7.      Turkey’s political situation is stable. Turkey has been governed by the Justice and
Development Party (AKP), which has an overall majority in Parliament, since 2002. The most
recent general election was in 2007. New general elections are scheduled for June 12, 2011.

8.     Turkey is a candidate country for EU membership. The process of harmonization
with European legislation and regulation continues to be an anchor for Turkey’s reform agenda.
Among 35 Chapters of the EU Acquis Communautaire, 13 Chapters have been opened, and one
Chapter on Science and Research has been provisionally closed, since negotiation talks began in
2005.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

9.      Turkey’s recent economic management is a story of notable turnaround. After its
banking crisis in 2001, when GDP contracted by 5.7 percent, and an expensive recapitalization
of its banks, the country embarked on a concerted path of structural reforms. These included
improving fiscal and public financial management, strengthening banking supervision,
introducing a comprehensive social security reform, and revamping the framework for
macroeconomic management, within which an independent central bank is responsible for
inflation-targeting and the lira floats freely against other currencies.

10.    These reforms yielded results in the years after 2001, and helped the economy to
deal with the challenges of the recent global crisis. GDP growth during 2003-07 averaged
nearly 7 percent, and poverty fell from 27 percent to 17 percent (using the national poverty line).
The financial sector remained profitable and highly capitalized. Primary fiscal surpluses
averaged about 4 percent of GDP over 2004-08, and gross public debt plummeted from 73.3
percent of GDP in 2002 to 42.9 percent in 2008. However, the current account deficit grew,
peaking at 6.1 percent of GDP in 2006. Healthy export growth (23 percent per year over 2004-
08) contributed to limiting external vulnerability.

11.     Despite these strengths, Turkey was hit by the 2008 crisis: GDP fell by 4.7 percent in
2009 (Table 2). Several factors help explain this. First, Turkey’s exports are concentrated in
highly cyclical sectors, such as automotive vehicles, white goods, and other consumer durables.
In addition, before the crisis, more than half of Turkey’s exports went to EU markets, where the
declines were among the steepest. Second, low domestic saving 6 and high energy imports make
Turkey’s private sector a high net importer of foreign capital; the current account deficit
averaged 5.2 percent of GDP during 2004-08. Much of this was financed through lending, with
the effect that at the onset of the crisis Turkish companies faced high external debt rollover
requirements (of the order of USD 100 billion in 2009).

  The upcoming World Bank Country Economic Memorandum, in partnership with the State Planning Organization,
is on the role of domestic savings in Turkey’s growth.

                                                    4
12.     However, Turkey bounced back from the downturn much faster than many other
countries in the region. By the fourth quarter of 2009 the economy was growing again. Growth
in 2010 is estimated to be in excess of 8 percent 7, the output is back to pre-crisis levels, and
unemployment is falling. Capacity utilization has been above the 70 percent level since April
2010, compared to an average rate of 65 percent in 2009. Recent data for February 2011 put
capacity utilization at 73 percent. Industrial production growth in the first month of 2011 was
18.9 percent with respect to same month of 2010. This represents a 0.5 percent increase with
respect to the already strong December 2010 industrial production.

      Gross public debt as defined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury varies from the EU defined general government debt
    stock definition. The difference arises from the following adjustment items for EU defined debt: (i) recording of zero
    coupon securities at face value; (ii) inclusion of inflation variation for CPI indexed bonds; (iii) inclusion of coins in
    circulation issued by Treasury; and, exclusion of the government securities held by different public sector institutions.

13.     Turkey’s recovery has been led by domestic consumption and investment demand
from the private sector, driven by historically low interest rates. In the first three quarters of
2010 y/y economic growth was nearly 9 percent (Figure 2a). Of this, private consumption and
private investment accounted for a sizeable share (about 5 percent each, with net exports making
a large negative contribution; see Table 2). A further factor explaining both the severity of the
slowdown and the rapid recovery in Turkey was a marked inventory cycle, as producers adopted
a wait-and-see approach in 2008 and 2009, running down inventories, before quickly re-
accumulating them from late 2009 onwards.

14.     Unemployment has fallen back close to pre-crisis levels, but remains high. After
peaking at above 16 percent in February 2009, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell steadily
from the second quarter of 2009, and stood at 11 percent in December 2010, about one percent
above pre-crisis levels (see Figure 2b). This compares favorably with the past tendency of
unemployment in Turkey to “ratchet up? during recessions, subsequently failing to decline again.
Some of this favorable performance can be attributed to measures taken by the Government to
protect employment during the crisis, some to the short duration of the recession in Turkey
compared to past recessions. Nonetheless, open unemployment in Turkey remains high in
absolute terms, and represents a challenge both to social welfare and to productivity.

15.     Poverty rose moderately in 2009. Using Turkey’s national (food and non-food
expenditure) poverty line, the poverty headcount ratio reported by the Turkish Statistical Agency
rose to 18.1 percent in 2009 from 17.1 percent in 2008. Extreme poverty (defined in Turkey by a
USD 2.15 poverty line) remains negligible.

16.     Banks remain well capitalized and profitable, while asset quality has improved. The
banking sector proved resilient when faced with the effects of the global crisis. Turkey is the
only OECD country where no public sector support was provided to the banking sector in the
wake of the crisis. The capital adequacy ratio for the system is high at about 19 percent, and all
banks are above the recommended 12 percent regulatory minimum. After high profitability in
2009, which was driven by a rapid widening of net interest margins, profitability returned to
more normal levels in 2010, with profits still rising by 9.6 percent during the year. The stability
of the system’s funding base is supported by a modest reliance on wholesale funding, including
syndications and securitizations, as reflected in loan to deposit ratios below 100 percent for the
system. There is no consumer lending in foreign exchange. Loan quality has improved with the
resurgence in economy activity, with the Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratio for the banking
system as a whole coming down to 3.7 percent at end-2010 (compared with rates around 3.5
percent before the crisis and 5.3 percent as of end-2009).

17.     Lending growth has resumed rapidly after contracting during the crisis, but the
Turkish financial sector’s role in funding the real sector remains well below its potential.
After remaining essentially flat in real terms in 2009, bank credit increased significantly in 2010,
growing by 33.94 percent during the year, which in turn contributed to the significant widening
of the current account deficit in 2010 (see paragraph 18). As of end-January 2011, year-on-year
loan growth registered 36.2 percent. Consumer loans, accounting for just under a third of total
loans, and including mortgages, and car and credit card loans, grew at 32.9 percent year-on-year,



                                                 7
just below the average for total loan growth. 8 The Authorities are watching credit growth rates
carefully, and there is a risk that continued high growth could contribute to inflationary pressures
and possible overheating of the economy. The financial system nevertheless remains relatively
shallow for the size of the economy, with total banking sector credit (about one half of total
assets) accounting only for about 43 percent of GDP. 9 Also, lending remains mostly short term
although maturities are being extended, reflecting a dearth of longer-term funding. More than 90
percent of domestic deposits, which account for more than two thirds of non-equity liabilities,
bear a maturity of less than three months.

18.      After falling during the recession, the current account deficit (CAD) returned to the
fore by 2010. In 2006-08 Turkey financed CADs of the order of 6 percent of GDP (Table 2).
This ratio fell to 2.3 percent in 2009, driven by the recession and lower oil prices. However, as
these factors reversed in 2010, a significant current account deficit returned: the CAD for 2010 is
estimated at 6.5 percent of GDP. This increase was mainly the consequence of rising imports.
Imports (f.o.b.) rose by 31.6 percent to USD 173.9 billion in 2010 from USD 132.1 billion in
2009, led by an increase in imports of investment goods. Exports (f.o.b.) remained sluggish,
increasing by 13 percent to USD 117.9 billion in 2010 from USD 104.3 billion in 2009. The
trade deficit therefore more than doubled to USD 55.9 billion in 2010 from USD 27.8 billion in
2009, and was equivalent to 7.6 percent of GDP. Real exchange rate strengthening throughout
2010 (which has since been partially reversed with a 9.9 percent real weakening of the TL since
November 2010) was one factor in the relative performance of exports and imports. The non-
energy trade deficit stood at 3 percent in 2010, with rising oil prices contributing considerably to
the rising trade deficit.

19.     As growth picked up, the general government fiscal deficit declined to 3.6 percent of
GDP in 2010. The fiscal deficit had increased sharply from 1.6 percent in 2008 to 5.3 percent of
GDP in 2009. Most of this increase was explained by the contraction in GDP and the operation
of automatic stabilizers (such as the increase of approximately 1.8 percentage points of GDP in
budgetary transfer to the Social Security Institution (SSI); only 1.2 percentage points are
estimated to have come from discretionary spending measures. 10 The general government deficit
was reduced to 3.7 percent in 2010, mostly through improved revenue performance owing to the
pick-up in GDP (Table 2) 11. Central government spending actually grew by 9.5 percent in 2010,
with total central government spending expected to reach above 26 percent of GDP in 2010.
Public sector primary fiscal balance is expected to post a small deficit of 0.2 percent in 2010
before returning to surplus in 2011.

   Recent measures have been introduced by the Authorities to limit mortgages to 75 percent of house value, 50
percent for commercial real estate and to link credit card limits to documented monthly salaries.

  The banking sector comprises 49 banks, with the top 6 banks accounting for about two thirds of total assets. The
three largest state-owned banks account for one third of the banking system’s assets. The remainder of the financial
system accounts for about 11 percent of GDP (mainly mutual funds, insurance companies, leasing companies, and
factoring and consumer finance companies).

20.    With better fiscal performance, public debt ratios improved. Gross public debt12
increased significantly during the crisis, from 42.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to 48.9 percent of
GDP in 2009. Public debt was estimated to be at around 44.5 percent of GDP at end-2010.

21.     Inflation targeting performed well, although the task has been complicated by the
high volume of portfolio flows to the Turkish economy. End-2010 inflation was 6.4 percent,
close to the target of 6.5 percent 13, helped by an end-year drop in food prices. While Consumer
Price Index (CPI) inflation fell to a four decades low in February 2011, reaching 4.2 percent
(year-on-year food inflation was 4.5 percent), year-on-year Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation
is running higher, at 10.9 percent in February 2011 (driven by a 29 percent increase in oil
product and energy prices and a 36 percent rise in the price of basic metals). Under this
framework, the Central bank explicitly stated that given the rapid pace of domestic demand and
rising commodity prices, general price setting behavior will be closely monitored and additional
measures will be taken to contain inflation expectations, if needed.

22.     Against the backdrop of low interest rates and quantitative easing in some advanced
economies, Turkey (like other emerging markets) has been the destination for a high
volume of short-term capital inflows. This has raised private external indebtedness and
increased exposure to capital flow reversal risks. In 2010, USD 15.9 billion came into Turkey in
the form of short-term credits from foreign banks, and a further USD 16.3 billion entered in the
form of portfolio investments in securities (relative to USD 200 million in 2009). As a result, of
the 2010 capital inflows (excluding reserve changes of Central Bank and other sectors) of USD
46.6 billion, more than half consisted of short-term inflows, many intermediated through banks
supporting credit, demand, and imports. From January 2009 to November 2010, the (CPI-based)
real effective exchange rate (REER) strengthened by 16 percent. 14 Such conditions make it
harder for the central bank to raise interest rates to curb aggregate demand in the event
inflationary expectations exceed the target and create a risk of overheating.

23.     The Central Bank introduced a “policy mix?, which consists of a combination of
short term interest rates, reserve requirement ratios and an interest corridor 15, to reconcile
inflation targeting with a more aggressive approach to managing inflows, but more
measures may be needed moving forward. Turkey increased its holdings of net international
reserves by USD 11.1 billion in 2010. In December 2010, the Central Bank cut the policy
interest rate by 50 basis points, while at the same time increasing the wedge between its
overnight borrowing and lending rates and increasing reserve requirement ratios significantly,
with varying degrees across maturities and broadening the coverage of liabilities subject to
reserve requirement. The Central Bank followed this up with a further cut of 25 basis points to
the policy rate at its January meeting and further increases to reserve ratios. Cutting the overnight

interest rates is designed to discourage portfolio investors from taking short-term “carry trade?
positions in lira assets; at the same time increasing reserve requirements is designed to curtail
domestic credit creation.

24.     Partly in response to these measures, the lira weakened by 11 percent nominally
against the dollar between November 2010 and February 2011, while the real effective
exchange rate weakened by around 10 percent during the same period. At the same time,
Turkey’s (EMBI+) sovereign spread has remained close to record lows of around 200 basis
points. Nevertheless, in recent months high credit growth has continued and high oil prices are
adding further to inflationary pressures. There is a risk of overheating, which if not addressed
could lead to a growth slowdown. Measures to mitigate risks would include a combination of
fiscal and macro-prudential tightening, more restrictive liquidity conditions and, in the longer run
and supported by the PPDPL/REGE-DPL series, further competitiveness-enhancing structural
reforms.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

25.    In line with the Government’s Medium-Term Program (MTP), growth is forecast at
about 4.5 percent in 2011 and around 5 percent over the medium term, and will rely
increasingly on exports. Projected growth relies on a combination of slowly recovering exports
and private-sector led domestic demand, and is predicated on capital inflows financing a CAD of
around 5-6 percent of GDP over the medium term. The CAD is projected to narrow in the outer
years owing to stronger export growth (on the back of structural reforms and enhanced
competitiveness – see next paragraph - as well as a recovery in global growth) and supported by
higher domestic savings. The CAD will likely stay high in the near term however, while
financing prospects appear favorable. Despite downside risks (see paragraph 35), and assuming
continued political stability, further progress on economic reforms, and net positive capital
inflows, these growth rates appear achievable.

26.     The growth path projected in the MTP requires continued structural adjustment,
consistent with the Government’s reform program, to make the economy more resilient to
shocks and to realize its growth potential. New vulnerabilities have emerged as a byproduct of
strong growth and large capital inflows. These vulnerabilities are unlikely to abate in the near
term, and will need to be managed carefully to avoid boom-bust cycles of the past. The growth
projects are also underpinned by the implementation of ongoing reforms (including moving
forward decisively with implementation of the new commercial code and the code of
obligations), and the initiation of further reforms in the post-election period, especially as they
relate to measures that bolster productivity and employment and secure long-term fiscal savings.
The regulatory reform is a critical agenda item in this regard, particularly as it relates to the
reform of labor market regulations, including severance pay reform and greater employment
flexibility. Improvements in the business environment and further privatization, which will
gradually improve corporate productivity, as well as profitability, and prudent fiscal
management, are expected to help bring about the increase in the domestic savings rate.

27.    The MTP envisages further improvements in fiscal balances to bring down the
public deficit - and to help manage external imbalances. On the public sector side, Table 3
shows a shift from a 0.2 percent public sector primary deficit in 2010 to a 1.0 percent surplus by

                                                10
2013. In parallel, the general government balance shifts, from a 3.7 percent deficit in 2010 to a
1.2 percent deficit in 2013. General government expenditures as a share of GDP are projected to
decline faster than revenues, from the 2010 levels of 39.1 percent, leading to a declining
borrowing requirement over the period.

28.     The MTP envisages that the fiscal adjustment over 2011-13 will come mainly from
expenditure measures. Over the MTP period, central government spending is targetted to fall
by 2.8 percent of GDP, while primary spending will decrease by 1.7 percent of GDP. The main
sources of this adjustment are cuts in goods and services, and public investments and a decrease
in current transfers to the SSI because of the improvements in its balance. However, the budget
includes no income from a recently announced comprehensive amnesty on government
receivables and only limited income from an ambitious privatization agenda, thereby creating
room for additional spending while still meeting the budget target. More generally, it will be
important to leave room in the budget for growth-enhancing public investments by controlling
current spending.

29.   The MTP foresees a slight decline in general government revenues as a share of
GDP over the 2011-13 period, with the composition of taxes moving in favor of direct taxes.
Tax revenues rely heavily on value added and special consumption taxes, with scope for
improved collection of income tax. The program also assumes further privatization revenues.

30.     Public debt sustainability is subject to moderate risk. Debt sustainability analysis
suggests that the risks to the sustainability of Turkey’s public debt burden are moderate. These
risks have declined significantly since the

shock (half standard deviation shocks to growth and interest rates, a 15 percent weakening, and

46.2 percent of GDP in 2012 before subsiding to 37.0 percent of GDP by 2015. Turkey has a
strong track record in public debt management, mitigating some of the macroeconomic risks to
debt sustainability.

external debt-to-GDP stood at 43.6 percent

increase significantly, although external debt ratios remain sustainable. Figure 4 illustrates
two alternative scenarios with higher external debt outcomes.

             a. An “overheating? scenario assumes a one percent increase in growth over the base
                case, with higher CADs partly covered by FDI. Under this scenario, external debt
                reaches about 51 percent of GDP by 2015.

             b. A “slow-reform? scenario is more adverse, with lower GDP growth (one standard
                deviation lower over 2011-15), smaller CADs, USD 4 billion lower FDI, and a
                weakened currency in 2011-15. Under this scenario, external debt climbs to about
                ten percentage points above the baseline in 2014-15.

33.     In the baseline macroeconomic scenario, external financing is likely to be available
to meet the needs of the Turkish economy in 2011-15 (Table 4). Projections assume a
moderate rise in capital inflows consistent with a slow global recovery. Turkey should be in a
position to attract further FDI given privatization efforts and the potential for mergers and
acquisitions: baseline net FDI inflows rise from USD 7.2 billion in 2010 to USD 21.9 billion in
2015. Similarly, net portfolio flows are assumed to be positive, consistent with continued
Eurobond issuance and the potential of the domestic capital market to raise financing. Assuming
a gradual improvement in rollover ratios of corporations’ medium- and long-term (MLT) debt
from 76 percent in 2010 to 130 percent in 2015, which is well below the annual average of 179
percent in the period of 2003-2008, results in a projected further accumulation of international
reserves over the period 2011-15. 16 Lower rollover ratios of the order of 90 percent to 100

16
   Starting in June 2009, corporate sector agents without revenues in foreign exchange were allowed to start
borrowing in foreign exchange directly from domestic banks. This has increased the proportion of foreign exchange
loans extended by domestic banks, but is not accurately captured in the data in Table 4 above, implying that actual
rollover ratios of private non-bank sector in 2009 and 2010 are higher than the rollover ratios in Table 4. In the

                                                        13
percent in 2011 and 2012 would not place serious pressures on reserves. Higher oil prices than
assumed here (USD 100), for a sustained period, would create additional external financing
requirements-a risk that needs to be closely monitored going forward. A USD 10 increase in oil
prices would increase the CAD by an estimated 0.4-0.5 percentage points of GDP, and would
shave around 0.2-0.3 percentage points of growth.

34.     To conclude, Turkey’s overall medium-term economic framework is adequate.
Market reactions reflect the credibility of the Government’s measures in response to the global
crisis and its forward-looking plans. Growth has returned and social indicators are improving.
Improved prospects have also been signaled by upgrades and outlook revisions by all the main
credit rating agencies. On November 24, 2010, Fitch lifted Turkey’s rating outlook to positive
from stable, citing the country’s economic recovery and improving public finances. Fitch rates
Turkey one notch below investment grade, and the revision signals that strong growth recovery
plus plans to cut the budget deficit could finally put Turkey within sight of an investment grade
rating. Moody’s upgraded Turkey to Ba2 from Ba3 on January 8, 2010 and changed the outlook
on Turkey’s Ba2 local and foreign currency government bond ratings from stable to positive on
October 5, 2010. JCR also upgraded Turkey to BB from BB- on February 1, 2010. Moreover, on
February 19, 2010, Standard and Poor’s upgraded Turkey’s long-term credit rating from BB- to
BB, maintaining a positive outlook.

35.     However, there are significant macroeconomic risks. The main risk is that a reversal
of capital flows could cause a significant growth slowdown, given the high level of the current
account deficit. There is some risk associated with recent political developments in the Middle
East and North Africa, and a major risk arises from a sustained increase in oil prices. Turkey is a
major energy importer, and a USD 10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil is estimated to
increase Turkey’s current account deficit by 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP. If oil prices remain at the
recently elevated levels or further increase, Turkey’s strong macroeconomic performance may be
hindered, as risks associated with the sustainability of a high current account deficit would
increase. Although Turkey’s external financing needs are likely to be met in the near future,
there is a danger of a rapid accumulation of short-term foreign liabilities, by definition
potentially subject to possible reversal. The possibility of such a reversal creates a downside risk
to growth with corresponding risk to public finances. The measures taken by the central bank
within the constraints of inflation targeting may be insufficient to prevent such a continued
accumulation of liabilities in the private sector.

36.    There is also a risk of overheating, which if not addressed, could lead to a growth
slowdown (although unemployment data suggest that the risk of overheating is not immediate).
A challenge for the authorities is to determine the right policy mix in the face of these
vulnerabilities, while favorable near-term growth prospects and healthy balance sheets will likely
continue to attract capital inflows. Measures to mitigate risks would include a combination of
fiscal and macro-prudential tightening, more restrictive liquidity conditions and further
competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms. The proposed REGE-DPL2 operation helps
Turkey mitigate these risks mainly by supporting reforms to improve the business climate. These
reforms are aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the private sector, which would promote

forward projections, an adjustment has been made to incorporate these loans. Projected roll-over ratios are consistent
with those forecast by other observers, including the IMF.

exports as well as higher inflows of foreign direct investment – a preferred means of financing
the current account deficit.

                         III.    THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

37.     Turkey’s economic policy framework and reform program are described in a
number of separate but consistent documents. Turkey’s medium-term economic policy and
reform program is articulated in the Ninth Development Plan (2007-13), which was published in
the Official Gazette on July 1, 2006. The Turkish government implements the development plans
through its annual programs, and the 2011 Annual Program was issued in October 2010 and
outlines the Government’s structural reform program for 2011. The government moved to
medium-term budgeting in 2006 and the sixth Medium-Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP) and Medium
Term Program (MTP) covering the period 2011-13 were issued on October 10, 2010. Turkey
also produces annual EU Pre-Accession Economic Programs that detail short- and medium-term
policy actions and structural reform priorities related to EU accession.

38.     Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan is the foundation of the World Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy and of this loan series. The Ninth Development Plan vision is “a Turkey
which grows in stability, shares her income more equitably, is competitive at a global scale,
transforms into an information society and has completed the stage of legal harmonization for
EU membership?. The Ninth Development Plan comprises of five strategic areas of action,
namely: (i) enhancing competitiveness; (ii) fostering employment; (iii) strengthening human
development and social solidarity; (iv) ensuring regional development; and (v) increasing quality
and efficiency in public services.

39.     The policy program supported by the PPDPL/REGE-DPL series has been closely
aligned with the strategic objectives of the Government and supports selectively key elements
of the competitiveness, employment, human development, and public services axes of the Ninth
Development Plan. These program areas were chosen in view of their importance, informed by
economic and sector work conducted jointly with the Government and their strong relationship
to the CPS objectives. The measures identified in the 2011 Annual Program do not only overlap
with the REGE-DPL2 reform agenda, but they strengthen the agenda through additional follow
up actions during the remainder of 2011. The 2011 Annual Program states, inter alia, that by the
end of 2011, secondary legislation for the implementation of the Commercial Code will be
issued; the employment strategy and a subsequent action plan will be prepared. The secondary
legislation of the new TCA Law will be in line with the EU practices and international standards
will be completed.

Improved climate for business growth, productivity and job creation

40.     The Government, after focusing policy efforts on dealing with the effects of the
global crisis, has taken up structural reforms with renewed impetus. Recent efforts aim
specifically to set the conditions for higher private (including foreign) investment, employment,
and enhanced competitiveness. These include promoting the transparency of commercial
accounts, increasing the accountability of companies’ management, and setting the ground for
enhancing the efficiency and depth of the financial sector.


                                               15
41.    The cornerstone of Turkey’s recent business climate and competitiveness reforms is
the adoption of a new Commercial Code, which in essence provides a completely new,
modern “constitution? for private sector commercial activity and entrepreneurship,
grounded in financial transparency and strengthened corporate governance. This is
discussed in further detail in Box 1.

                      Box 1: The Commercial Code, Corporate Governance, and Growth

In law, a commercial code refers to the body of legislation that pertains to commercial transactions. Its wide-
ranging scope includes many different areas that affect businesses and individuals who enter into these transactions.
Partnerships, corporations, secured transactions, insurance, bankruptcy, and even merchant shipping inter alia, are
governed by the commercial code. In replacing an outdated commercial code (from 1956), the authorities recognized
the need to align this body of law with the modern reality of commercial transactions. The main approach of the new
Code is to introduce more transparent corporate governance principles, with the aim of fostering trust in the
financial position of Turkish companies and thus increasing their global competitive strength. The Code’s corporate
governance approach is based on four pillars:

•   Transparency. The Code: (1) expands Turkish Accounting Standards, which are aligned with International
    Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), reporting requirements to all joint-stock companies, not only listed ones;
    and (2) introduces consolidated reporting requirements for financial and non-financial group companies.
•   Accountability. The Code: (1) requires compliance with International Auditing Standards (IAS) and elevates
    professional standards for auditors; (2) introduces the concept of ‘transaction’ and ‘operational’ audits; (3)
    regulates legal and criminal liability; and (4) introduces the concept of independent board member and sets
    minimum standards for professional board members.
•   Regulatory Innovation. The Code: (1) introduces simpler incorporation procedures (based on founders’
    declarations); (2) introduces the concept and regulates preferred shares; (3) regulates the conversion of
    companies through mergers, spinoffs and restructuring; (4) regulates share buybacks; (5) allows for a single
    board member and shareholder, including legal entities; (6) introduces separate provisions for ‘closely held’
    corporation and ‘listed’ corporations; (7) separates the role of the Board and management; and (8) regulates
    electronic commerce.
•   Fairness (equity). The Code: (1) requires all companies to set up websites where all material decisions affecting
    all stakeholders (not only shareholders, but also employees and creditors) will need to be reflected; and (2)
    introduces procedures for minority shareholders’ to bring lawsuits against management, board members and
    auditors for misrepresentation of a company’s financial position.

While all these innovations are expected to materially improve the investment climate, there are a few changes that
are expected to have a significant impact on investment decisions, even in the short run: a) the new enhanced
reporting and disclosure requirements will deal squarely with a major identified constraint to better access to finance
by smaller companies (see below); (b) the provision allowing for single shareholder/board member (including legal
entities) will promote foreign direct investment by effectively eliminating the need to find “straw man?
shareholders, while also allowing smaller single proprietors to grow their company into larger concerns without
having to seek additional shareholders; and (c) the provisions governing e-commerce will allow for expansion of
commercial activity into a sphere of commercial transactions that remains woefully underserved.

42.    The new Code of Obligations enacted in February 2011 is a critical complement to
the Commercial Code and essential for its effective implementation. The Code of
Obligations governs a key aspect of commercial activity, namely the implementation and
enforcement of contractual obligations, while also injecting a heavy dose of fairness and equity
into commercial relationships. Some key innovations under the new Code deal with the
enhancement of consumer and creditor rights—an essential element in promoting retail
commerce and supporting consumer credit, but also reflects an effort to account for modern
technology and business practices in contract law. Specifically, the Code regulates the use of
general conditions, requiring their full disclosure to, and acknowledgment by, adverse parties,

                                                          16
and extending their use to agreements with banks, insurance companies, travel, and transport
businesses. The law also introduces of the concept of “risk liability? and regulates negligent civil
wrongs not arising from contractual obligations. Finally, the Code introduces "electronic
signature" as a valid and binding commitment, which should facilitate internet commerce and
further expansion of innovative companies.

43.     The new Civil Procedures Law, while an important judicial and social reform in
itself, is the third and final critical component of the recently enacted troika of
fundamental business legislation, complementing the Commercial Code and the Code of
Obligations. The Civil Procedures Law aims to reduce court workloads and the corresponding
burden on businesses. The law replaces legislation dated 1927. Enterprise surveys consistently
point to administrative justice procedures and judicial review as one of the most challenging
areas in improving the business climate in Turkey. The new Civil Procedures Law introduces a
modern administrative legal framework including: (i) procedures to streamline court cases, (ii)
new out-of-court conciliation mechanisms, (iii) a national arbitration system on par with
international good practices; and, (iv) new regional civil courts as an intermediate appeals
mechanism. Overall, the law aims to facilitate out-of-court settlements and reduce court
workloads, something that will be essential in the effective implementation of the enhanced
corporate governance principles introduced by the new Commercial Code and the strengthened
consumers’ rights brought about the new Code of Obligations.

44.     The Government’s agenda to support the corporate governance precepts outlined in
the new Commercial Code--and thus promote financial sector deepening, capital
investment and growth prospects--includes the adoption of a new Capital Market Law
(CML). As a piece of legislation that is subsidiary to the Commercial Code, the Capital Market
Board (CMB) is in the process of insuring consistency of the draft CML with the provisions of
the new Commercial Code, including the supervisory and regulatory powers granted in it to the
CMB, a process that will take until later in the year. Moreover, while the Law is expected to
reflect the results of a twinning project with the German financial regulator, on harmonizing
regulations with the EU Acquis on capital markets, the CMB foresees that the Law will also need
to reflect the results of the ongoing deliberations by standard-setters on possible adjustments to
the regulatory and supervisory capital market framework to reflect the shortcomings that
emerged during the global crisis.

45.     The implementation of the Commercial Code, together with further steps to reduce
red tape, will benefit small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the backbone
of the economy, playing a vital role for the welfare of the population as the main source of job
creation and economic growth. 17 Many SMEs face access to finance constraints, are
disproportionately burdened by business regulations, and seem to lack the ability to adopt and
use the knowledge needed to make them more competitive internationally. These findings
emerge from the study Turkey: Investment Climate Assessment (ICA)—From Crisis to Private
Sector Led Growth that Turkey and the Bank completed in early 2010. The study examined



17
   In Turkey, SMEs account for around 80 percent of employment, almost half of total investments, two-thirds of
total retail sales, around 60 percent of total exports, and about one-quarter of bank credit.

                                                      17
firm-level constraints to growth, based on a survey of 1,200 firms conducted between April 2008
and January 2009. 18 Specifically:

•    A majority of surveyed firms (especially SMEs) see themselves as held back by problems
     with access to finance (26 percent of firms cited this as their single most important
     constraint). In complementary survey work and interviews with financial institutions and
     business associations, a consensus emerged that the problem of access of to finance was
     closely linked to a lack of proper financial accounts. 19 The enhanced reporting
     requirements introduced by the new Commercial Code should therefore help bridge the
     information gap that limits companies’ access to credit, equity, and venture capital flows,
     particularly into existing and new innovative companies, particularly SMEs.

•    Red tape still seems to impose significant costs on businesses, especially SMEs. 20 The
     survey found that the top management in enterprises spends a strikingly high amount of time
     (27 percent) dealing with red tape. Some of this “time tax? relates to frequent changes in
     rules and a discretionary, unpredictable implementation of rules, be it for taxes, for licenses,
     for procurement, or other transactions. 21 In order to address the regulatory burden issue, the
     Government is currently preparing a regulatory reform strategy with the goal of
     simplifying business regulations, including improved horizontal and vertical coordination
     among levels of government, and enhanced consultation with the private sector (Box 2).

46.    The Government’s reform agenda includes a number of planned additional
investment climate reforms for the future: (i) intellectual property rights (IPR) reform,
including the Turkish Patent Authority Law, and the Patent Law Treaties, to align the IPR
regulatory framework with the EU Acquis; (ii) execution and bankruptcy legislations, including
regulatory changes to restore the balance between preserving company value and protecting
lenders’ rights.

19
   Other factors included lack of collateral (in itself a subsidiary problem to lack of proper accounts) and a lack of
capacity to prepare appropriate bankable business plans. KOSGEB’s new support and credit interest rate programs
may help to fulfill the needs of SMEs to present sound investment and business plans.
20
   For instance, the progress that has been made in the granting of operating licenses to manufacturing firms - from
66 days in 2005 to 62 days in 2008 – is still not sufficient to match comparator countries, including Bulgaria (21
days) and Romania (24 days). When including the service sector, the total number of days to obtain licenses drops to
36.
21
   This is much more than in comparator countries such as Brazil (19 percent), Hungary (13 percent), Poland (13
percent), Bulgaria (11 percent), Czech Republic (10 percent), Romania and Chile (both 9 percent).

                         Box 2: The “Time Tax? and a New Regulatory Reform Strategy

The 2010 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) showed that the Turkish Government has taken significant steps in
establishing institutions and mechanisms for regulatory reform; enacting legal reforms conducive to simplification
of the legal framework; and introducing, through pilot projects, a number of regulatory tools to improve the quality
of regulations. In this process, achieving EU harmonization has been a key driver of reform and Turkey has broadly
embraced the EU Better Regulation Agenda in a number of areas. Nevertheless, as evidenced by the still significant
amount of time spent by company management in dealing with regulations (‘time tax’), challenges remain.

The ICA analysis notes that efforts to reduce the regulatory burden experienced by the business sector in Turkey
would in principle need to focus on:
• Implementing a clear, coherent and comprehensive strategy for regulatory reform; this would be country-wide
    and include all the facets of the regulatory system, and supported at the highest political level.
• Increasing coordination among different institutions and of different initiatives with similar regulatory
    objectives.
• Linking regulatory reform to clear and measurable economic targets and objectives in the medium and long
    term.
• Building capacity across the administration. Efforts in different directions to train officials in the use of modern
    regulatory tools testify to the need to dedicate resources to this goal.
• Enhancing consultation efforts with private sector stakeholders.

The lead agency in regulatory reform, the Prime Ministry, and the Bank have engaged on a new technical assistance
program on regulatory reform to address the points above. The program focuses on three main areas:
• Preparation of a national strategy for regulatory reform. This document is intended to concentrate all
    efforts already underway in a single, coherent, targeted-oriented strategy that will cover four main areas of
    action: 1) improvement of legal process and introduction of forward planning at central level; 2) improvement
    of Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and capacity building in ministries to use this tool; 3) guiding and
    facilitating of administrative simplification attempts of public institutions; 4) better management of the stock of
    regulation in Turkey.
• Improvement of the existing legal database of all laws and secondary regulations. The comprehensive
    database already in place can be further improved, in particular by adding technical capacities, ensuring legal
    security for all information and connecting it to the work to streamline regulation, identify burdens and
    expanding it to other regulatory instruments, like licenses, permits and authorizations.
• Implementation of a pilot project on administrative simplification. The main goal of this project is to
    develop capacities in the Prime Ministry to introduce administrative simplification measures, based on a
    measurement of administrative costs through the use of the Standard Cost Model (SCM), consultation with
    affected businesses and coordination with ministries and municipalities responsible for licenses.

Creating more and better jobs

47.      The Turkish labor market is characterized by low activity rates as well as high
unemployment and job informality. Despite six years of sustained growth after the 2001 crisis,
the employment rate never rose above 46 percent, about 20 percentage points below the EU
average. The employment rate of working age (15-64) women (26 percent in 2010) is the lowest
among OECD and Europe and Central Asia countries. Unemployment has decreased
significantly since its peak in Q1 2009 and reached pre-crisis levels by November 2010 (11
percent), but has not consistently come down below 10 percent. The youth unemployment rate
remains about twice the overall unemployment rate. Finally, about 44 percent of those employed
were working in the informal sector in 2009. 22 Overall job informality has decreased somewhat
between 2001 and 2009.

48.     Labor market outcomes in Turkey are the result of structural factors and policies,
including (but not limited to) labor market policies. Indeed, the effectiveness of any policy
effort to reduce unemployment will be constrained by labor supply pressures from urbanization,
flows from agriculture and new entrants (see Box 3). As the structural shifts fade away and
women become more educated, more women will join the labor force, generating additional
pressures. There are two important sets of policies that can help enhance productive employment
in the long run: (1) improving the skills for work (through the education and life-long learning
systems, including second chance programs) and (2) improving the climate for firms to grow,
innovate and create jobs. The Government program in these two areas is described in separate
sections. Progress has been most notable in the business climate area, with the approval of the
Commercial Code and other relevant legislation, as well as efforts to identify and reduce the
burden of regulations on businesses. In skills, the improvement in PISA scores between 2006 and
2009 (see next section) may already reflect the positive impact of the new curriculum for
primary education, and the ongoing expansion of early childhood education will significantly
improve skills in the future.

             Box 3: Structural Features of the Turkish Labor Market and Their Implications for
                                          Employment and Growth

A number of structural factors underlie high unemployment and informality. First, the structural transformation of
the economy from agriculture into non-agriculture sectors and the migration from rural to urban areas are still
ongoing. These transformations are supplying the non-agricultural sector (particularly the informal sector) with large
numbers of (mostly) low skill male workers, while forcing many (mostly) low skill women (who used to work in
agriculture as unpaid family labor) out of the labor force. Second, sheer numbers of young people are entering
working age population each year (about 800,000), a population that is expected to growth until 2020 (demographic
window). Third, the non-agriculture sector has not been sufficient to absorb the growing labor force: non-
agricultural GDP grew by an average 7.7 percent annually between 2003 and 2007, while non agricultural
employment only grew by 2.7 percent (an annual average of around 500,000 new jobs were created). Fourth, the
labor demanded in the non agriculture sector is, however, increasingly more skilled. Limited job opportunities
(particularly for low skill workers) combined with a rapidly increasing non-agriculture labor force (particularly
youth and low skill workers coming from agriculture) generate high unemployment and fuel job informality in the
non-agricultural sector. The low levels of education and skills characterizing large segments of working age
population lead to low participation rates, particularly among women.

Sustaining high growth rates and converging faster to more advanced economies would require using more labor,
use it longer, and make it more productive. Growth potential is currently is impinged by large numbers of unused
labor and low productivity of labor. As the demographic window closes, and more women are employed, labor will
become a less important determinant of growth and productivity growth will become the sole driver of economic
growth. Increasing productivity requires improving the skills of the workforce (and getting these skills productively
employed) and boosting firm growth and innovation.

49.    Reforms to make labor markets more flexible can, however, make a significant
contribution to job creation in the short and medium term. Turkey has traditionally had high
non-wage labor costs by international standards. The employment protection legislation in
Turkey is one of the most restrictive in the OECD and is focused on protecting jobs rather than
workers. Restrictions on or disincentives to flexible contracting (e.g. fixed-term contracts, part-
time work and temporary employment agencies) as well as very generous (but often not paid)




                                                         20
severance obligations are the main factors behind this institutional rigidity. 23 Additionally,
support to workers through unemployment insurance (UI) and Active Labor Market Program
(ALMPs) has been very limited. 24 Generating more and better jobs requires reforms to make
labor markets more dynamic while protecting workers, by reducing non-wage labor costs,
restrictions on flexible contracting, and severance obligations (but ensuring workers are actually
paid) and enhancing protection through UI and ALMPs.

50.      Employment and labor market reforms have been a top priority for the
Government since 2008. The Government’s labor reform agenda is framed in the 9th
Development Plan and covers three main policy areas: reducing non-wage labor costs, raising
skills, and making the labor market more flexible while improving worker protection. The 2008
labor package focused on the first two pillars by reducing employers’ social security
contributions (across-the-board 5 percentage points reduction) and expanding the coverage of
Active Labor Market Programs (ALMP) (by increasing funding from the Unemployment
Insurance Fund and extending the beneficiary base to all registered unemployed). Government
efforts in 2009 focused on responding to the negative effects of the global crisis on the labor
market, leaving temporarily aside further labor market reforms. The two largest programs were
short term wage subsidies and vocational training, which also provided stipends to trainees.

51.     A comprehensive employment strategy has been drafted, presented to the Council of
Ministers and will be discussed with social partners in the coming months. The employment
strategy shifts the protection from jobs to workers and includes measures to improve labor
market flexibility and worker protection. The strategy has specific targets related to the quantity
and quality of employment up to 2023 and is built around four pillars: (1) linking education and
employment (including ALMPs); (2) labor market flexibility (including flexible contracting and
severance pay reform); (3) support to women, youth and disadvantaged groups; and (4)
strengthening the relationship between employment and social protection (including
unemployment insurance). The 2011 Annual Program includes the preparation of the action plan
by December 2011.

52.    In the meantime, significant efforts to expand and improve ALMP are already
underway. The Government continues increasing the coverage of ALMPs (the number of
beneficiaries is expected to be around 400,000 in 2011, from just over 17,000 in 2006) and
improve their quality and effectiveness. The national vocational qualification system, which
links curricula and qualifications in vocational fields with occupational needs, continues to be
developed: cooperation protocols have been signed for 571 occupational standards and 340
occupational standards have been prepared so far; 171 national occupational standards were
published in the Official Gazette; testing and certification of competencies have started. Training
providers will now be selected on the basis specific quality and performance criteria, not just

23
   Workers qualify after one year of service, with payment of one month wages per year of service for qualifying
separations (including separations for economic reasons, just cause discharge cases, and retirements), with no ceiling
on number of years (but a ceiling on amount paid per year).
24
   Despite the expansion of ALMPs in 2009, they only covered about 14 percent of registered unemployed in 2009.
Coverage of unemployment insurance increased from 5.3 percent in October 2008 to 8.2 percent in March 2009 (the
period in which unemployment increased the most), but it is still low for international standards. The combination of
large numbers of unregistered workers, strict qualification rules and low benefits limit the effectiveness of
unemployment insurance as an instrument to protect workers during economic downturns and beyond.

                                                         21
cost. Through a partnership between ISKUR, MONE and the Unions of Chambers and
Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) a new project, “Specialized Vocational Course
Centers Project? (UMEM), has been launched, which will provide quality vocational training to
about 200,000 people per year in vocational and technical high schools and internships at TOBB
businesses. A rigorous impact evaluation of ISKUR vocational training programs is underway:
the baseline survey has been completed and evaluation results are expected in early 2012. Efforts
are being initiated to activate social assistance recipients by linking benefit receipt to
participation in ALMPs.

53.     Some changes related to flexible contracting and the extension of the targeted
subsidies to new hires are included in the new Omnibus Law (no. 6111) which was issued in
the Official Gazette on February 25, 2011. The Omnibus Law extends the scope of the
incentives regulated in 2008. For example, the Law extends the incentives to new hiring of
women and youth (introduced with the 2008 package) until 2015 and reduces social security
contributions for self-employed women. It also enables part-time workers to pay their unpaid
social security contributions retroactively, and to be eligible for unemployment insurance. The
law also reduces the disincentives for green card holders to look for jobs in the formal sector.
While these changes are noteworthy, the important broader reforms included in the new
Employment Strategy, which will be key to significantly improving labor market flexibility and
worker protection, remain pending.

54.      As the Government moves further along in its dialogue with social partners, it may
consider a number of options to improve labor market flexibility and worker protection.
Shifting the focus from protecting jobs to protecting workers requires reforming severance pay
(to reduce payments, but also to make it more efficient and ensure workers are actually paid) and
unemployment insurance (to make it the main instrument for protecting workers when they lose
their jobs). Provisional Article 6 of the 2003 Labor Code (Law No. 4857) already provides for
the creation of a severance payment fund, which can help achieve the goals stated above. At the
same time, the details of the design and implementation of this planned reform will be crucial for
its success. An increase in the coverage (by relaxing eligibility criteria) and benefits (with a
gradual reduction in the rate over time so provide an incentive to find employment) of the current
PAYGO unemployment insurance system would also achieve the second goal. The Government
may also consider giving more emphasis to employment services (job placement, counseling, job
search assistance), as international evidence shows they are more cost-effective than other
ALMP and most effective screening device for identify individuals who require additional
ALMPs. The cost of inaction far outweighs the difficulties of reaching an agreement on
severance pay and flexible contracting reforms: keeping the existing rigidities would continue to
contribute to limited job creation and high informality.

Improving education and skills

55.    Increasing the quality of education while reducing inequalities are the main
challenges of Turkey’s education system. Turkey has almost universal primary school
enrollment (net enrollment of 98.4 percent in 2010/11) and has significantly improved secondary
school enrollment (69.3 percent net enrollment rate in 2010/11), although enrollment varies by
region and by gender within certain regions. However, enrollment rates in preschool and tertiary
education (around 27 percent) remain low by international standards and vary by region and by

                                               22
gender within certain regions. Turkey has made significant progress in learning achievement, as
measured by PISA scores, between 2006 and 2009 (Figure 5). Despite these gains, however, a
high proportion of 15-year-olds in Turkey continue to perform below the most basic proficiency
level in reading, math and science (24 percent, 42 percent and 30 percent, respectively), with
significant differences by region, socioeconomic status and school type.

56.     Improving skills for work requires a Figure 5: PISA Math Proficiency Levels of 15 Year
comprehensive       reform     package.     The                 Olds (percentage of students)

financing, teacher training and human resource
policies. An expansion of life-long learning opportunities will also be important, including
second chance programs for working age individuals without the basic skills to be productively
employed.

57.     Investing in early childhood education is crucial for improving skills and reducing
inequalities. Preschool enrollment is low in Turkey given the country’s income level and highly
inequitable, with fewer opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Development of the child during the early years (cognitive and non-cognitive skills as well as
physical growth and well being) lays the foundation for future learning, work and life.
Expanding and improving early childhood education would ensure all children, particularly those
from disadvantaged backgrounds, enter school ready to learn, increasing subsequent education
and labor market outcomes and providing equal footing to succeed in life. According to Bank
simulations, one year of pre-school education would increase family incomes by 8 percent and
reduce the percentage of poor families by 10 percent. 25 In addition, expanded access to preschool
would alleviate one of the main constraints to female labor force participation, which in turn
would spur growth and reduce poverty. 26

58.    The Ministry of National Education (MONE) is working to increase preschool
enrollment and achieve universal preschool education for 5 year-olds by 2014. In September
2009 MONE started an ambitious program to achieve two targets by the start of the school year
2014/15: (a) universal enrollment for kindergarten (students aged 60-72 months old); and (b) 50
percent participation for the pre-school years (students aged 36-60 months old). For the school

year 2009/10, the program focused on 32 provinces with the highest gross enrollment rates—
those with above 50 percent participation for kindergarten, because universal coverage could be
attained more quickly than in other provinces as they did not need any new facilities. In these
provinces enrollment of 5-year olds in kindergarten increased from 70 percent in 2009/10 to 93
percent in 2010/11. The program was successfully expanded to 25 new provinces at the
beginning of the year 2010/11.

Ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability of the health and social security systems

59.      The 2008 social security and universal health insurance reform has improved the
social protection system and its long term fiscal sustainability. It provided a legal and
institutional basis for providing access to health insurance for all citizens, and introduced
significant adjustments to pension parameters (such as a gradual increase of the retirement age
and contribution period and reduction of the accrual rate) 27 to increase long term sustainability of
the public pension system. The reform law was enacted in 2006 (supported by PPDPL1), but the
Constitutional Court then cancelled many provisions of this law shortly before it took effect.
Necessary modifications were made in May 2008, and most provisions of the law took effect by
October 1, 2008 (supported by PPDPL2). A significant part of the secondary legislation required
for the enforcement of this law (No. 5510) has since been issued.

60.      The important administrative reform to unify the existing three social security
schemes under the Social Security Institution (SSI) is at an advanced stage. One of the key
goals of the social protection reform initiated in 2006 was to tackle the previous fragmentation of
the social security system. Unifying social security regimes by merging the previously existing
institutions had to go hand-in-hand with a wide-reaching and complicated administrative
reform. 28 SSK (Social Security Institution for Workers in the Old System), Bag-Kur (Social
Security Institution for Self Employed in the old system, BK) and Emekli Sandigi (Social
security Institution for the Civil Servants in the old system, ES) were legally merged within SSI
in 2006. Progress has been made since then to effectively unify SSK, BK and ES under SSI both
in terms of personnel and IT systems. All staff now works under the same institutional structure,
with unified human resource management. Significant efforts have been made since 2008 to
integrate separate databases and the conversion of remaining manual records into electronic
form. The 2008 Social Security Decision Support System Project created an interface between
the databases of three social security institutions, allowing reports to be produced across these
databases based on unique citizen identification numbers. The recently initiated Social Security
Integration Project is designing a new system to fully integrate data systems and applications,
including the creation of a single database. SSI has also implemented a number of operational


27
   The 2008 pension legislation will, inter alia, increase the retirement age in Turkey to 65, for both men and
women, although the transition will be slow and the retirement age of 65 will not be fully reached until 2070. The
reform also reduced the benefit accrual rate, which has been traditionally high in Turkey, closer to internationally
fiscally sustainable norms of 1.5 percent of benefit per year of contribution. The reform also gradually revises the
averaging period for wages used in pension calculation to lifetime career average wages; and the revaluation of past
earnings has been reduced. Post-retirement, the law moves the indexation of pensions from wage-growth linked to
inflation linked.

61.     Despite these reforms, health and pension expenditures, may still pose a challenge to
public finances (Table 5). The combined health and social security deficit increased steadily
between 2006 and 2009, although until the global economic crisis SSI expenditures and revenues
had grown roughly in line with the number of beneficiaries and active contributors. In 2009,
there was a sharp deterioration with nominal expenditures tracking inflation and thus rising as a
share of GDP while nominal revenues remained flat (with the nominal increase from inflation
approximately offset by the real effects of the GDP contraction). Although the 2008 reform
improved the long term fiscal sustainability of pensions, significant deficits are still expected to
persist in the near future. Total public health expenditures (SSI expenditures plus central
government health expenditures) as a percentage of GDP have increased by 21 percent since the
introduction of the Health Transformation Program (HTP) in 2003. These trends are explained
by a number of factors: increased health expenditures (partly related to the increased coverage); a
limited impact of the 2008 pension reform in the short to medium term (due in part to the slow
phasing in of parametric changes); a significant increase in pension beneficiaries prior to the
2008 reform; a TL 60 increase in the minimum pension in 2010; and the lasting impact of the
crisis on the social security deficit (through reduced contributions).

62.     Progress towards universal health insurance is one of the many achievements of
HTP since 2003. Turkey has achieved near universal health insurance coverage, improving
equity in access to health care nationwide, an agenda that has been supported by both the PPDPL
and REGE-DPL operations. Increased access to and utilization of health services have been
possible thanks to the expansion of the Green Card Program and the introduction of family
medicine in 2004. Patient satisfaction has also increased substantially (from 69 percent in 2004
to 86 percent in 2008 among family medicine provinces). These gains in access and quality of
services have translated into significant improvements in health outcomes: maternal mortality
fell from 29 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 19.4 deaths in 2008 (already meeting the
MDG goal on maternal mortality), and infant mortality decreased from 25 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 2005 to 17.0 in 2008. Life expectancy at birth in 2008 at 73.6 years stood at 92.8
percent of the OECD average, compared with 71 percent in 1960.

                                                      25
63.     Continued increases in coverage along with Turkey’s demographic, epidemiological
and nutrition transitions will put considerable pressure on health costs. Public health
expenditures have grown from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2003 to an estimated 4.6 percent of GDP in
2010. The further expansion of the system and the planned equalization of benefit packages will
drive up costs, while the potential efficiency gains of family medicine will take some time to be
realized. There are also several external factors that will affect future demand for health services
and thus health expenditures in the medium to long term. While still relatively young, the
Turkish population will age faster than many of its OECD counterparts. Disease patterns are
changing and non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming the predominant causes of
death and disease. Demographic and epidemiological changes as well as increased demand for
new technologies will exert significant pressures on health costs. These external and internal cost
pressures need to be counterbalanced by efficiency-enhancing reforms now to ensure the long
term fiscal sustainability of the public health system.

64.      Measures to date to contain health expenditures have had mixed results. The 2006
introduction of “bundled? pricing for outpatient visits by SSI to control excessive itemized
billing in an open fee-for-service environment did not adequately control volume, thus having
little impact on health expenditures. In 2007, a fixed global budget for all Ministry of Health
(MOH) hospitals was implemented and to date this has been successful in containing further
spending growth in these hospitals. The claims management system too was unified and now all
hospitals report through SSI’s Medical Messenger (MEDULA) system which can verify claims
and reduces fraud, thus increasing efficiency. Reduction in pharmaceutical prices has resulted in
a decline in pharmaceutical spending as a percentage of SSI health expenditures, although at 42
percent in 2010 these still remains high compared with other Middle Income Countries (MIC),
mainly due to the high volume of prescriptions, with the consumption of antibiotics being a
particular problem. In July 2008, extra-billing by private hospitals was capped at a maximum of
70 percent above the price charged by SSI. A co-payment of TL 15 was also introduced for
outpatient visits to private health facilities, while the commensurate amounts for university and
MOH facilities was set much lower (at TL 8), and the prices of certain high volume procedures
such as cataracts and cesarean sections were reduced.

65.     New measures to control health costs have been important in controlling health
spending. Since October 2009, increased co-payments for outpatient visits apply and this has
resulted in TL 1.2 billion in savings in 2010. Rates are TL 8 for university and MOH hospitals
and TL 15 for private hospitals. A TL 2 co-payment for all primary health care was also
introduced in 2009 but the co-payment for family medicine was cancelled by the State Council
(Danistay) in May 2010. To reduce over prescription, a TL 3 discount applies at university,
MOH and private hospitals if no medicine is prescribed. Supplementary billing caps too remain
in place. In 2010, the Government successfully imposed spending limits for university and
private hospitals – and these have been extended in the 2011 budget. While pharmaceutical
spending declined between 2009 and 2010, maintaining the spending limit for pharmaceuticals
has not been particularly successful: drug expenditures in 2010 (TL 15.2 billion) were above the
global budget (TL 14.6 billion), but SSI introduced an additional 9.5 percent discount on drug
prices to meet the global budget for 2010.

66.   Going forward, key measures to improve health care finances include strengthening
of health expenditure management and measures to enhance the efficiency of health

                                                26
spending. Expansion of family medicine without further refinement of the capitation system to
emphasize cost-effectiveness would create fiscal concerns. Efficiency gains in the health system
can be achieved through appropriate provider payment systems and the application of controls to
the benefits package. By June 2011, all MOH hospitals are expected to be paid using Diagnosis
Related Groups (DRGs) within the global budget for MOH hospitals. Introducing DRGs has
several benefits: (i) it increases transparency by enabling comparison of costs, efficiency and
quality across hospitals; (ii) it pays providers fairly for their services; and (iii) it discourages
unnecessary care thus ensuring provision of efficient and appropriate care. The next step is for
SSI to extend DRGs to university and private hospitals while maintaining spending caps. More
can also be done to improve efficiency in the pharmaceutical sector, in addition to introducing
spending caps. Options include limiting reimbursement to the most commonly used generics,
creating conditions for more price competition in the generic market, and developing a more
structured mechanism for introduction of new drugs.

Enhanced Public Financial Management (PFM)

67.    The Government has established a successful track record of Public Financial
Management (PFM) reform in Turkey. Reforms are ongoing in line with the Government’s
timetable. Medium- term macro and fiscal frameworks have been prepared and implemented
since 2006, and they provide budget ceilings for the central government institutions. Significant
progress has also been made in integrating strategic management into public sector management.
Central government institutions and local administrations with populations above 50,000 have
completed strategic plans. Likewise, an increasing number of public institutions are completing
performance programs.

68.     Downstream budget areas such as internal control and audit remain critical areas
for further reform and reform implementation. The Government completed a Public
Financial Management Performance (PFMP) benchmarking study (jointly with the Bank) in
March 2010, using the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework.29
Reforms such as upgrading the legal and institutional framework, the introduction of medium-
term planning and budgeting, new budget definitions and classification, the elimination of off-
budget activities, are reflected in strong ratings. Areas of improvement in downstream budget
issues, such as internal control and audit systems, a complementary external audit function, and
commitment monitoring, are now challenges.

69.     Implementation of the new Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law enacted in
December 2010 will be central to effective PFM and control. The new law redefines the
audit scope, the types of audit mandated, and the organizational structure of the TCA. The
law has expanded the audit mandate of TCA to cover the entire public sector and introduces
financial and performance audits in line with international standards (beyond the compliance
audit currently undertaken). The annual audit program will be selective and based on risk, size,
and other criteria. Finally, the law foresees major changes in the Court’s organizational structure,

29
   PEFA is a partnership between the World Bank, the EC, the UK Department for International Development, the
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Royal Norwegian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, and the IMF. PEFA aims to support integrated and harmonized approaches to assessment and
reform in the field of public expenditure, procurement and financial accountability. Additional information on the
PEFA methodology is available in www.pefa.org.

                                                       27
to help implement the new PFM framework, including the merger of the State Audit Board
(responsible for the audit of state owned enterprises) and the establishment of two new vice-
presidencies, one specifically responsible for audit function.

70.     The Law on Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids enacted in October 2010
introduced a new legal and institutional framework for state support to both public and the
private sector. The new Law aims to ensure the compatibility of state aids with the related
provisions of the agreements and decisions between Turkey and the European Union by laying
the framework, guidelines and principles. Enactment of the law is a key step to the opening of
the Competition Chapter of the EU Acquis. Apart from ensuring the compatibility of state aids
to EU rules, since the Law provides for the collection of implementation results from the aid
granting institutions for the purpose of making necessary notifications to EU and other relevant
authorities, it will also bring about the measurability of total cost to public by requiring the
quantization of all aids granted in varying forms including tax measures. Consequently, its
implementation is expected to improve fiscal transparency and the effectiveness of public
expenditures, while clarifying and leveling the playing field for the private sector by regulating
the framework rules and conditions on state supports to eliminate the distortion of competition..
The new Law also provides for monitoring and transparent disclosure of state aids programs and
their impact and effectiveness.

                IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

LINK TO CPS

71.     The proposed REGE-DPL2 forms part of the World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY2008-11, which was endorsed by the Executive Board on February 28,
2008. Through the CPS, the Bank Group is a partner with Turkey in realizing the country’s
development vision—fast and sustained growth with equity—through full integration with
Turkey’s development strategy. Accordingly, the CPS is shaped directly by Turkey’s Ninth
Development Plan and by the Government’s program: it aims to contribute to three of the Plan’s
development pillars: (i) improved competitiveness and employment, (ii) equitable human and
social development, and (iii) efficient provision of high-quality public services.

72.     A CPS Progress Report, endorsed by the Executive Board on January 7, 2010,
summarizes adjustments to the CPS agreed between Turkey and the World Bank Group to
reflect global developments and evolving country priorities. The Progress Report envisaged
that the resulting program for the remainder of the CPS period would focus on areas crucial for
renewed growth: stimulating private sector, especially small and medium enterprise (SME),
business and job creation; sustainable energy and infrastructure; and human capital and social
protection of the most vulnerable groups. 30 The agreed adaptation of the CPS program includes
the REGE-DPL and proposed REGE-DPL2, in support of a program that combines the
continuation of Turkey’s fiscal and public-sector reform agenda (supported by the earlier PPDPL

30
   IBRD and IFC will accelerate financing to the private sector, especially SMEs. The updated CPS program also
envisages enhanced Bank AAA and financing for human and social development, including social and poverty
monitoring, jobs, and vocational training. Finally, as Turkey has set out to strengthen its contribution to local and
global environmental sustainability, the Government and the Bank plan to broaden the electricity DPL program to
include energy efficiency, climate change, and environmental sustainability.

                                                         28
1 and PPDPL 2 operations) with the private sector development agenda (supported by the earlier
CEDPL and CEDPL 2 operations).

73.    The proposed REGE-DPL2 amount of USD 700 million equivalent is consistent with
the CPS and the increase in IBRD financing agreed in the CPS Progress Report. In light of
the impact of the financial crisis, the Turkish authorities and the Bank agreed to raise the total
amount of new IBRD commitments during the FY08-11 CPS period to up to USD 8.1 billion,
including USD 4.4 billion in DPL financing.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

74.     The Bank and the IMF are coordinating and working together closely on Turkey.
The IMF’s most recent Stand-By Arrangement for Turkey was completed successfully in May
2008. IMF Staff completed its most recent post-program monitoring mission in December 2010.
Topics on which the Bank and Fund staffs have collaborated include the assessment of
developments in the health and social security systems, energy pricing, and local administration
finance. Bank staff regularly provides the Fund team with analyses of the business and
investment climate, labor market and employment developments, social security, health, and
education systems and policies, poverty simulations, and energy sector developments and
policies. IMF staff regularly share macroeconomic projections and the detailed fiscal
assessments of Fund staff have informed the Bank’s own views of the MTP. 31

75.     The European Commission and the World Bank recently launched a new initiative
seeking to increase opportunities for synergies in working with the Turkish authorities. The
scope of the collaboration includes the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) and European Investment Bank (EIB). Possible areas for collaboration include food
safety, energy sector reforms, and public administrative reform. Bank staff also holds regular
consultations with staff from EIB, which has an active portfolio in Turkey including areas of
common interest such as energy and agriculture, and EBRD, which has recently opened an office
in Istanbul.

76.     The World Bank also maintains close dialogue and collaboration with UNICEF and
UNDP in Turkey. Recent surveys into the impact of the economic slowdown in Turkey at the
household level were conducted jointly with UNICEF (as well as with TEPAV). The Bank is
also working together with the German Development Bank, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
Bankengruppe (KfW) and UNDP in providing technical assistance to industry and financial
intermediaries for energy efficiency investments. The Undersecretariat of Treasury plays an
active role in donor coordination.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

77.    The proposed operation is a follow-on operation to the REGE-DPL, and in common
with that operation, (1) continues the reform program supported by the programmatic
Public Sector DPL series; and (2) incorporates and builds on key reforms from the
completed programmatic Competitiveness and Employment DPL series. The Program

31
     Bank-Fund collaboration is outlined in a joint letter to files dated August 24, 2010.

                                                             29
Document for REGE-DPL describes in detail how the REGE-DPL series relate to the past
PPDPL and CEDPL series.

78.     REGE-DPL2 complements related investment lending. In health and social protection,
the Health and Social Security Adaptable Program Loans support investments in the family
health system and technical and administrative improvements in SSI, important components of
Turkey’s model for financially sustainable, universal access to healthcare and social security. In
private-sector development, the policy measures supported by the proposed program
complement the Bank’s lending to SMEs and exporters through its credit line facilities. 32

79.     The proposed program is complemented by a programmatic series of DPLs focusing
on environmentally sustainable development and the energy sector. The first loan in this
series was approved by the Board on June 11, 2009; the second (ESES-DPL2) was approved by
the Board on June 15, 2010. 33 A third loan in this series is under preparation.

LESSONS LEARNED

80.     The proposed design draws on several World Bank evaluations. The proposed
program supported by the DPL series reflects lessons from the recent 1993-2004 Country
Assistance Evaluation for Turkey, 34 the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY04-FY07
Completion Report, 35 as well as the recent review of World Bank conditionality. 36 Conclusions
of these reports include the importance of full ownership by government as well as full
integration into a government reform program.

81.     The CAS Completion Report recommended that the Bank Group’s future assistance
program should envisage greater support for private sector development. The current and
planned future operation are at the heart of the Bank’s strategy for Turkey in that respect,
including a comprehensive package of reforms targeting an improved competitiveness
environment for firms. It also supports labor market reforms intended to increase labor force
participation rates for women and youth which, according to the Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment carried out for CEDPL 2, would particularly benefit poorer households. The
Completion Report also singles out the importance of combining high quality analytical work
with policy-based lending. The proposed operation rests on a large volume of high-quality
analysis, carried out by bank staff in partnership with government organizations, as well as by
other institutions (see Analytical Underpinnings below).

82.    The design of the proposed program reflects the experience in Turkey that medium-
term structural and institutional reforms are best supported through a programmatic
series of two or more operations. Indicative triggers for the future operation reflect the
government’s own reform priorities as discussed in the Development Plan, the MTP, and in

many cases legislation either before parliament or under preparation by the relevant ministries.
The authorities have consistently expressed their preference for programmatic lending
encompassing the broad array of reform areas they are pursuing. Finally, an important feature of
such lending is the appropriate flexibility in defining indicative triggers for the next operation.
While the authorities have a well-defined set of planned actions and planned timing, the actual
feasibility of each reform step in a given period depends on many factors outside their control.
Past experience, in particular with the CEDPL series, points to a trade-off between ambition and
realism in follow-up triggers; the ambition of the PPDPL/REGE-DPL series thus reflects strong
government ownership and agreement with the authorities about the importance of the reforms.
Furthermore, the experience with the PPDPL series (which built on the earlier three-loan
Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan series spanning 2001-04) suggests
that prolonged engagement, maintaining commitment to key reform areas over time, delivers
results.

83.      A further lesson from programmatic lending to Turkey is the importance of
continuity in program design, mirroring the government’s rolling MTP. The Bank supports
the government’s own rolling program and thus mirrors the continuity of this plan in DPL
programs. Most Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) and financing follow this
programmatic approach. Consistently pursuing pending reforms over many years has proven
critical in several key areas, such as social security reform, disaster management, and energy.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

84.     In its 2008 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), 37 the World Bank, in
partnership with the Undersecretariat of Treasury completed a wide-ranging assessment of
the challenges to sustaining Turkey’s high rates of growth since 2002. Key areas emphasized
in that study were structural fiscal reforms, PFM, investment climate reforms, and employment
regulations. The study reaches conclusions that are consonant with other international studies of
the Turkish economy, notably the annual progress report of the EC and the 2008 country survey
carried out by the OECD. In an upcoming 2011 Country Economic Memorandum the World
Bank is analyzing factors that could help improve Turkey’s low savings rate.

85.    The PFM agenda supported by the proposed operation is rooted in ongoing
programmatic ESW (Programmatic Public Expenditure Review and Financial
Management Study). In collaboration with the steering committee of the PPER, a World Bank
team recently completed (March 2010) the PFMP benchmarking exercise, based on the PEFA
methodology. The benchmarking found a high level of performance in central, “upstream? PFM
functions with room to enhance impact in decentralized and “downstream? functions, for
example including line agency audit and control functions. Under the PPER, a transport sector
expenditure review is being undertaken jointly with the government.

86.   Ongoing work with the authorities and several studies of the business environment
inform the policies supported by the proposed operation. Recommendations for
improvements in the investment climate are grounded in the recent ICA (2010), 38 “Doing

87.    A broad range of major analytic work has informed the policy dialogue on
employment and skills—including a comprehensive labor market study in 2006, 41 a study
of labor taxes in 2008-09, 42 programmatic studies of informal employment, 43 female labor
force participation, 44 and youth unemployment. 45 A study is underway, to be completed by
June 2011, looking at labor market through the crisis and recovery. Two recent studies look at
the quality and inequalities of basic education and early childhood education. 46 A study will be
completed by June 2011 looking at options to expand and improve early childhood education.
Health sector policy recommendations are based on a comprehensive sector study with the
OECD 47 and subsequent work.

       V.     THE PROPOSED SECOND RESTORING EQUITABLE GROWTH AND
                EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN (REGE-DPL2)

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

88.    The objective of the program supported by the REGE-DPL2 is to support equitable
growth and job creation by advancing critical business climate and broader
competitiveness reforms, while carrying forward Turkey’s public expenditure reform
agenda with a focus on the delivery of inclusive social programs at sustainable cost. The
operation is based on Turkey’s program embodied in the Ninth Development Plan and the MTP,
the CPS, the 2009 CPS Progress Report, and extensive analytical work.

89.    REGE-DPL2 is the last of four development policy lending operations executed
sequentially. It builds on the reform program defined in the First Restoring Equitable Growth
and Employment DPL (REGE-DPL), which took forward the ongoing public sector reform
agenda supported under the Programmatic Public Sector (PPDPL) series (REGE-DPL and
REGE-DPL2 are follow-up operations to this series). REGE-DPL also carried forward critical
pending reforms from the Competitiveness and Employment (CEDPL) series, which was closed
and evaluated in an Implementation and Completion Report in 2010. 48

   Technically, the REGE-DPL2 is defined as the fourth operation of the PPDPL series. See Programmatic Public
Sector Development Policy Loan (PPDPL), Report No. 36274-TR, June 5, 2006; Second Programmatic Public

                                                     32
90.     Like REGE-DPL, which focused primarily on crisis response, the proposed REGE-
DPL2 contains two pillars: “Equitable Growth and Employment? and “Fiscal
Management?. With the transition from crisis management to renewed growth, the
implementation of the pre-crisis business climate reform agenda has resumed, which will
enhance competitiveness and facilitate job generation. The equitable growth and employment
pillar supports reforms in the business climate and selected improvements to education and
training. The fiscal management pillar supports key reforms in the provision of inclusive social
services with a specific focus in REGE-DPL2 on reining in health costs. REGE-DPL2 takes
forward reforms in PFM by supporting the enactment of the Turkish Court of Accounts and the
state aids legislation, both aimed at improving transparency and accountability.

91.     The main objective of the PPDPL/REGE-DPL supported Program remains
unchanged. The Authorities are committed to the full implementation of the overall reform
program as set out to the Board of Directors on February 24, 2010. The program matrix has been
adapted to reflect country circumstances and recent developments as well as evolving priorities
as follows—with three prior actions added, three dropped, and two modified (see also Table 6):

      a. The enactment of the Law on Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids is being
         added as a prior action. Its enactment further advances the public expenditure and
         financial management reform agenda by regulating monitoring and supervision
         mechanisms for the design and implementation of state aids, while also clarifying and
         leveling the playing field for both public and private sector firms. The enactment of this
         law was discussed at the time of PPDPL2 as a trigger for PPDPL3, but was not included
         in REGE-DPL because it focused on addressing the impact of the global economic
         crisis. The new Law aims to ensure the compatibility of state aids with the related
         provisions of the agreements and decisions between Turkey and EU by laying the
         framework, guidelines and principles. Enactment of the Law is a key step to the
         opening of the Competition Chapter of the EU Acquis. Apart from ensuring the
         compatibility of state aids to EU rules, since the Law provides for collection of
         implementation results from the aid granting institutions for the purpose of making
         necessary notifications to EU and other relevant authorities, it will also bring about the
         measurability of total cost to public by requiring the quantization of all aids granted in
         varying forms including tax measures. Consequently, its implementation is expected to
         improve fiscal transparency and the effectiveness of public expenditures, while
         clarifying and leveling the playing field for the private sector by regulating the
         framework rules and conditions on state supports to eliminate the distortion of
         competition. The new Law also provides for monitoring and transparent disclosure of
         state aids programs and their impact and effectiveness.

      b. The enactment of the new Code of Obligations is added as a new prior action. The
         new Code of Obligations is an essential complementary step in the effective

Sector Development Policy Loan (PPDPL 2), Report No. 43473-TR, May 17, 2008; and Restoring Equitable
Growth and Employment Programmatic Development Policy Loan (REGE-DPL), Report No. 51062-TR, Feb. 24,
2010. See also Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL), Report No. 39826-TR, June
1, 2007; Second Programmatic Competitiveness and Employment DPL (CEDPL 2), Report No. 46436-TR, Nov. 13,
2008. The CEDPL series was closed and evaluated by an Implementation Completion and Results Report in 2010,
Report No. ICR1443, April 29, 2010.

                                                    33
  implementation of the Commercial Code, and covers a key aspect of commercial
  activity, namely the implementation and enforcement of private contractual obligations.

c. The enactment of the Civil Procedures Law is also added as a new prior action.
   The new law provides another leg supporting the proper implementation of the
   Commercial Code. The 2010 ICA report states that administrative justice and judicial
   review remain one of the most challenging areas of the business climate. This law,
   replacing legislation dated from 1927, aims to reduce court workloads and the
   corresponding burden on business. The enactment of this law been was envisaged in
   PPDPL2 to be a trigger for PPDPL3, but was eventually not included in REGE-DPL
   because it focused on addressing the impact of the global economic crisis.

d. REGE-DPL included a REGE-DPL2 trigger on the implementation of a fiscal rule,
   which has been dropped. A fiscal rule had been viewed as a possible way to shore up
   investor confidence in longer-term economic management. A draft rule prepared in
   2010, and submitted to Parliament, targeted a long-term overall budget deficit ratio of 1
   percent of GDP and intended to bring down gradually the gross public debt-to-GDP
   ratio to below 30 percent. Subsequently, however, the Government declared that the
   Fiscal Rule Law will not be pursued and that the medium-term program will remain the
   key anchor of fiscal policy. The fiscal targets in the MTP for 2011-13 converge towards
   a medium-term 1 percent target, in line with what the fiscal deficit adjustment formula
   in the draft rule would have implied. To date, even without adoption the fiscal rule by
   law, investors and financial markets have reacted positively to the Government’s
   Medium-Term Program and 2011 Budget, as is also reflected in the earlier mentioned
   rating and outlook upgrades by rating agencies (see paragraph 33).

e. In the area of labor market reform, although policy reform is advancing, the initial
   REGE-DPL2 trigger “Reform measures taken to increase labor market flexibility
   and worker protection? has been dropped. A comprehensive employment strategy
   has been drafted, presented to the Council of Ministers and will be discussed with social
   partners in the coming months. However, because of the sensitivity of the reforms under
   consideration, these discussions will still take time (with the election in June 2011 and
   the set up of the new Government, the employment strategy is not expected to be
   approved before the end of 2011). As envisaged, the strategy shifts the protection from
   jobs to workers, and includes measures to improve labor market flexibility and worker
   protection. The Government’s 2011 Annual Program includes the preparation of the
   Action Plan for the Strategy, which gives an indication on the strong commitment of the
   Government in pursuing the labor market reform. While the labor market flexibility
   parts of the employment strategy are being discussed among key stakeholders, other
   parts related to ALMPs have been partially moved forward in the context of the recently
   enacted Omnibus Law. While the measures in the Omnibus Law are noteworthy, the
   important broader reforms included in the new Employment Strategy, which will be key
   to significantly improving labor market flexibility and worker protection as was
   envisaged in REGE-DPL, remain pending. The cost of inaction far outweighs the
   difficulties of reaching an agreement on severance pay and flexible contracting reforms:
   keeping the existing rigidities would continue to contribute to limited job creation and
   high informality.

         Market Law, which has been dropped. The Government’s agenda to support the
         corporate governance precepts outlined in the new Commercial Code—and thus
         promote capital investment and growth prospects—includes the adoption of a new
         Capital Market Law. The Capital Markets Board (CMB) is planning to send a new
         Capital Market Law, that is expected to help promote the transparent and orderly growth
         of capital markets, to the Prime Ministry later this year, based on the principles of
         corporate governance outlined in the new Commercial Code, which was only recently
         enacted 49, The drafting of the Law is also taking on board key recommendations
         emerging from the current post-crisis discussion on enhanced global supervisory and
         regulatory standards. The law will reflect the results of a twinning project with the
         German financial regulator, on harmonizing regulations with the EU Acquis on capital
         markets.

      g. The REGE-DPL2 trigger in the area of improving the quality and employment
         impact of vocational training has been partially amended. The launch of a rigorous
         evaluation of the effectiveness of ISKUR programs in the context of the expansion of
         training services has been implemented as envisaged: the baseline survey has been
         completed and evaluation results are expected in early 2012. Moreover, training
         providers will now be selected on the basis of specific quality and performance criteria,
         not just cost, a measure which will also be supported under REGE-DPL2. The overall
         performance-based management information (PMIS) is under development.

      h. The prior action relating to pre-school education has been strengthened as the
         expansion of pre-school education to new provinces has been faster than
         anticipated. Pilot implementation of preschool education expanded to 25 (rather than
         13) additional provinces and progress reports have been completed by all 32 pilot
         provinces.




49
  The Commercial Code will enter into force on July 1, 2012 whereas some provisions of the Code will take effect
as of January 1, 2013.

  92.     The program supported by the proposed REGE-DPL2 is expected to have positive
  fiscal impact. The cost of measures supported by the REGE-DPL2 is small and outweighed by
  the (less easily quantifiable) fiscal benefits of restraining spending in the health and social
  security systems alone. Two prior actions have potential fiscal costs. The World Bank estimates
  that the expansion of the coverage of ISKUR vocational training programs are estimated to have
  cost about TL 300 million in 2010 (covered by the unemployment insurance fund). The
  expansion of pre-school education is estimated to have cost TL 240 million in 2010. The total
  cost of these two measures is therefore about 0.05 percent of GDP. By comparison, the fiscal
  adjustment associated with central government health spending is significantly larger. The
  introduction of co-payments alone has generated about 0.10 percent of GDP in savings in 2010.
  The health sector spending caps, which are generally set at previous year’s spending levels and
  being met, also seem to have some impact.

  POLICY AREAS

  PILLAR 1: Equitable Growth and Employment

  93.   REGE-DPL took forward the agenda supported by the CEDPL series with a focus
  on measures in response to the global crisis, while REGE-DPL2 is focusing on the longer
  term business climate and education reforms. This component of the program supports
  implementation of the business climate and employment generation, including selected
  improvements to vocational and basic education. With the transition from crisis management to
  renewed growth, progress under this part of the program has resumed, and includes the

                                                          37
enactment in early 2011 of the new Commercial Code, the Code of Obligations, and the Civil
Procedures Law. Since many of the key reforms under this pillar of the program are being
supported by REGE-DPL2, it is too early to measure results linked to some of these key
measures.

1.A Private Sector Led Growth and Job Creation

94.     The ultimate objective of this component of the program is to enhance
competitiveness and job creation. The unemployment rate has already fallen to around 11
percent, after peaking at around 16 percent in February 2009, and down from a 2005 base level
of 10.6 percent. Credit to SMEs as a share in total credit rose from 21 percent in 2009 to 23.8
percent in 2010. The impact of the preschool expansion will be measurable through preschool
enrollment rates in the pilot provinces, which have already jumped from 71 percent to around 93
percent in the first 32 provinces targeted. Vocational training has reached around 210,000
trainees by end 2010. In addition, the expansion of ISKUR services and improvements to its
monitoring and performance management system has already translated into increased rates and
numbers of trainees placed in lasting employment.

95.       The specific measures are:

Improving climate for business growth and job creation

      •   A law for the establishment of Regional Courts of Appeal has been enacted (PPDPL2)
      •   On-line connections among courts have been established (PPDPL2)
      •   Amendment to customs law to streamline customs procedures (REGE-DPL)
      •   Enactment of the new Civil Procedure Code aimed to reduce court workloads and the
          corresponding burden on business (REGE-DPL2)
      •   Enactment of the new Commercial Code, broadly aligned with the provisions of the
          Acquis on commercial matters (REGE-DPL2)
      •   Enactment of the new Code of Obligation governing the implementation and enforcement
          of private sector contractual obligations. (REGE-DPL2)

Improve the quality and employment impact of vocational training

      •   Accelerated expansion of the coverage of ISKUR vocational training (and trainee
          stipends), reaching 150,000 people in 2009. (REGE-DPL)
      •   Introduction of a system for evaluating providers of training on the basis of quality and
          has launched an evaluation of the effectiveness of ISKUR (Turkish Employment Agency)
          programs in the context of the expansion of training services. (REGE-DPL2)

Improving education and skills

      •   Hiring of 15,000 new preschool teachers for the 2009-10 school year and issuance of
          MONE Circular launching universal preschool education for children 5 years of age in 32
          provinces (REGE-DPL)
      •   Expansion of preschool education to an additional 25 provinces and completion of
          progress reports on preschool education in the 32 pilot provinces. (REGE-DPL2)

                                                 38
1.B Employment and Social Protection during the Crisis

96.     Prior actions for the REGE-DPL in this area focused on banking stability,
employment, and SME access to finance. Result indicators for this pillar are related to the
take-up of each of these measures during the crisis, as well as the phasing out of the measures
post-crisis. The blind broker facility “insured? more than USD one billion of inter-bank FX
transactions at the height of demand in November 2008 and was last used in June 2010. The
CGF increased credit intermediation to SMEs and TL 216 million was guaranteed under the
scheme including January-October 2010, albeit less than initially envisaged.

97.       Specific prior actions under REGE-DPL were:

      •   Implementation of the CBRT blind broker function 50
      •   Increase in short-time employment compensation (by 50 percent) and its extension (from
          3 to 6 months, and then to 12 months) effective until end 2010 to reduce layoffs (part of
          the employment support packages)
      •   Amendment of the Public Finance and Debt Management Law to provide authority to
          expand the CGF by TL 1 billion

PILLAR 2: Fiscal Management

2-A: Maintaining Inclusive Social Programs at Sustainable Cost

98.     Key objectives of this part of the program are to establish universal health
insurance coverage and to protect the long-run fiscal sustainability of the health and social
security system. (i) The establishment of universal health insurance coverage was supported by
PPDPL1. (ii) The pension reform was implemented through secondary legislation and regulation.
(iii) Administrative reforms to unify the existing three social security schemes under the Social
Security Institution (SSI) are moving forward. (iv) Cost containment in the health sector through
global budgets for MOH hospitals, spending limits for private hospitals and pharmaceutical cost
controls were supported under REGE-DPL. The continued implementation of these measures
throughout the system is supported by REGE-DPL2.

99.     The impact of these reforms so far has been significant and measurable.
Implementation of the social security and universal health insurance reform law started in 2008.
It provided a legal and institutional basis for providing access to health insurance for all citizens.
Universal health coverage has increased significantly, reaching more than 94 percent of the
population at the end of 2010 (up from 86 percent in the baseline year). It also introduced
adjustments to pension parameters that significantly improved the long term sustainability of the
public pension system. The combined health and social security deficit, which peaked in 2009
due to the crisis, was held in check and declined thereafter (to about 4 percent of GDP in 2010).
The efforts to unify the three social security schemes under the Social Security Institution (SSI),

50
   Blind brokerage implies the Central Bank making a market anonymously between banks who wish to demand and
supply foreign exchange on the interbank market, i.e., guaranteeing to purchase from sellers and to sell to purchasers
at the market rate, in effect insuring foreign exchange default risk.

                                                         39
including the integration of staff and IT systems, have facilitated the implementation of the 2008
reform and resulted in significant efficiency gains and improved social security management.
The introduction of the global budgets and spending caps in the health sector seems to be having
some effect, with caps generally being met (and being set at levels equivalent to the previous
year’s spending). Continued implementation of the social security and UHI law, and further cost-
saving measures in health will help to contain the combined health and social security deficit and
total health expenditures as a share of GDP.

100.   The specific measures are:

Universal Health Insurance Coverage
   • Establishment of a UHI system which will provide access to health insurance for all
       citizens. (PPDPL1)

Ensuring long-term sustainability of the health and social security system
   • Revised social security and universal health insurance legislation including a parametric
       reform of the pension system (PPDPL1) and on-track implementation of the law (REGE-
       DPL)
   • Enactment of a law aimed at reforming the administrative dimensions of social security
       (PPDPL1) and on-track implementation of the law (PPDPL2, REGE-DPL2)
   • An expenditure tracking system for pharmaceuticals has been established and is
       operational (PPDPL2)
   • Implementation of global budgets for MOH hospitals, the introduction of spending limits
       for university and private hospitals, and publication of an SSI budget circular stating
       pharmaceutical expenditure controls (REGE-DPL)
   • Continued implementation of global budgets for the Ministry of Health hospitals, and
       spending limits in university and private hospitals through the 2011 budget. (REGE-
       DPL2)

2-B: Enhanced Public Financial Management (PFM)

101. Following the financial and economic crisis of 2001, Turkey has been pursuing a
broad program of public expenditure and financial management reforms to strengthen
overall fiscal discipline and to improve fiscal transparency. These reforms are expected to
promote improved public service delivery, value for money, and ultimately public welfare across
government institutions.

102. Turkey has established a solid track record of PFM reform. Gross public debt levels
have fallen from 54.1 percent of GDP in 2005 to an estimated 44.5 percent at the end of 2010.
The PPDPL/REGE-DPL series has supported the institutionalization of medium-term fiscal
planning and budgeting, starting with the introduction of the rolling medium-term plans in 2006.
Since then, there has been further improvement in linking medium-term plans and policies with
annual programs and budgets, and all ministries now have strategic plans and performance
programs. There have also been significant improvements in the Open Budget Index, which
increased from 41 in 2006 to 57 in 2010, suggesting that budget analysis is increasingly being
used as a tool to improve governance. For the purposes of measuring impact of reform in the
public financial management area, measurement of the quality of PFM outcomes will also be
                                               40
pursued through the Bank’s ongoing partnership with the authorities through the PFMP
benchmarking.

103.   The specific measures are:

   •   The Public Financial Management and Control Law has been satisfactorily implemented
       (PPDPL1) and all secondary legislation required for the Law has become effective
       (PPDPL2)
   •   A central government budget law consistent with the MTFP has been enacted and is
       being implemented (PPDPL1)
   •   Local administration laws have been enacted and a satisfactory draft law on Special
       Provincial Administrations and Municipal Revenues has been prepared (PPDPL1)
   •   Strategy development units responsible for strategic planning, budgeting, accounting and
       internal control functions have become operational in all general government institutions
       (PPDPL2)
   •   2006 financial statements of central government institutions and local administrations
       have been prepared on an accrual basis (PPDPL2)
   •   Revision of the Guidelines for performance based budgeting and preparation by at least
       50 institutions of their performance budget (REGE-DPL)
   •   Enactment of the TCA law, which supports the accountability framework defined by
       Turkey’s 2006 Public Financial Management and Control Law and redefines the audit
       scope, the types of audits mandated and the organizational structure of the TCA. (REGE-
       DPL2)
   •   Enactment of the Law on Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids, which regulates
       monitoring and supervision mechanisms for the design and implementation of state aids
       and promotes fair competition (REGE-DPL2)


                        VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

104. Households were affected by the crisis through the labor markets, but
unemployment decreased quickly with recovery, reaching pre-crisis (high) levels by the end
of 2010. Unemployment peaked at 16.1 percent in February 2009. The increase in
unemployment mainly came from new entrants into the labor force rather than job losses. In
urban Turkey, most of the decrease in labor incomes came from reduced earnings. The impact
through the labor market translated into a modest increase in the poverty rate of about one
percentage point (from 17.1 percent to 18.1 percent). Unemployment started to come down in
May 2010, as employment picked up in all sectors (including manufacturing, which had been hit
hard by the crisis) and demographic groups, declining to close to pre-crisis levels by December
2010 (11.4 percent).

105. The program of reforms supported under REGE-DPL2 is expected to reduce
poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run. The program supports private-sector led
growth and productive employment generation through reforms to (i) improve the climate for
businesses, particularly SMEs (more than 90 percent of firms), to grow through improved access

                                              41
to finance and reduced burden of regulations (also facilitated by a prudent management of public
finances), (iii) increase access of the unemployed to productive employment through ALMP; and
(iv) improve skills for work and reduce inequalities by providing a solid foundation in the early
years. Also, the universalization of health insurance provides equal access to health services and
financial protection for the poor, improving the health status of poor. The introduction of caps on
hospital expenditures may decrease the quality of health services unless these caps are based on
adequate pricing of health inputs. Finally, public financial management reforms increase
transparency and accountability of public institutions (including local administrations), thus
improving the provision of public services, which the poor tend to consume disproportionally.
The rest of the section highlights some of these impacts.

106. Spending caps help contain health costs but can affect services negatively if set too
low and not accompanied by appropriate provider payment incentives and demand-side
controls. Negative effects include reduced quantity and quality of services, reduced access,
substitution of services not subject to caps and patients opting for private providers where they
do not pay the full charge out-of pocket as uncovered services. Expenditure caps are positive and
necessary steps to ensure the fiscal sustainability of Turkey’s universal health insurance system.
However, caps need to be based on objective factors, including efficient pricing of health inputs,
a realistically affordable package of covered benefits, and monitoring of access, quality, and total
(not just public) cost impacts in order to avoid their potential negative effects. While more
analysis is needed on how these caps are set and enforced, anecdotal evidence suggests that they
are not always objectively and transparently determined. However, by June 2011 all MOH
hospitals will be paid using Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs), a tool for grouping health
services in a way that allows paying providers efficiently for their services, within the global
budget for MOH hospitals. Next steps to be considered include: extension of DRGs to university
and private hospitals, reinstatement of a functioning referral system with penalties, establishment
of clear criteria for setting and enforcing the caps; and continuing the implementation of
efficiency- and quality-enhancing policies, such as family medicine, inpatient and outpatient
DRGs, and the Performance Bonus System—all accompanied by continuous monitoring of costs,
quality, and access.

107. The incentives (in the form of reduced employer social security contributions) for
hiring young and women introduced in 2008 and recently extended will have its full impact
now. The incentives were introduced in 2008 and continued in 2009, but due to low labor
demand during the crisis few people benefited from it (53,000 in 2009) 51. With the economy
now growing rapidly, the net number of jobs expected to be created by these incentives is
estimated by the Bank to be between 163,000 and 235,000. This new employment will help
reducing poverty as the poverty risk for women and young people is higher than for the rest of
population. A modest increase in female labor force participation of 5 percentage points could
decrease the poverty rate by 15 percent. It is, however, important to keep this measure time-
bound and to continue assessing its benefits against costs.

108. The continued expansion and improvement of vocational training under ISKUR will
facilitate access of disadvantaged groups to productive employment. ALMP, including
vocational training programs, are not panacea for resolving large-scale unemployment, but well

51
     World Bank estimate.

                                                42
designed programs can help facilitate access to productive employment, particularly among
disadvantaged groups. Vocational training programs expanded significantly in 2009 but the focus
was more on providing protection (the program carries a stipend) rather than employability. In
2010 and 2011 the program has expanded even further but the emphasis is now shifted towards
increasing the quality and employment impact of vocational training through, for example, the
quality and performance assessment of training providers. ISKUR and the World Bank are
conducting a large-scale rigorous impact evaluation of vocational training programs that will
inform future improvements in this program to increase employment and poverty impact.

109. The expansion of preschool education is expected to have a large impact in helping
reduce poverty. The Government program aims to achieve universal preschool education for 5
year-olds by 2014, starting with 32 provinces in 2009 (where enrollment increased from 71
percent in 2008/09 to around 93 percent in 2010/11) and 25 more provinces in 2010. Expanding
early childhood education would ensure all children, particularly those from disadvantaged
backgrounds, enter school ready to learn, increasing subsequent education and labor market
outcomes and providing equal footing to succeed in life. According to Bank simulations, one
year of pre-school education would increase family incomes by 8 percent and reduce the
percentage of poor families by 10 percent. 52 Expanded access to preschool would also alleviate
one of the main constraints to female labor force participation, which in turn would spur growth
and reduce poverty. 53

110. The Green Card Program provided protection to the poor through the recent crisis.
The Green Card program, which provides health insurance for the poor, expanded its coverage
from 2.5 million people in 2003 to 9.3 million in 2008. The program has one of the best coverage
and targeting performances among poverty programs in Europe and Central Asia: 48 percent of
households in the poorest quintile of the population are covered, and 71 percent of all Green
Card beneficiaries are in the poorest quintile of the population.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

111. The reforms supported by the proposed operation are not likely to cause significant
effects on the country’s environment or natural resources. The PFM reforms supported by
this operation are expected to enhance budget transparency, accountability, financial
management, and ultimately service delivery. This overall emphasis on improving governance
should improve environmental spending along with other categories.

112. Turkey has a fairly well developed body of environmental legislation and
institutions. In addition Turkey is advancing the harmonization of the national legislation with
the EU Environmental Acquis and aims to harmonize its legislation fully within the next few
years. Turkey’s environmental legislation makes no distinction in the standards applied between
public and private sector activities and compliance requirements.

113. Turkey’s environmental priorities and commitments are specified in official
documents. These include Turkey’s National Report on Sustainable Development (2002)

52
   World Bank, 2009, Turkey: Expanding Opportunities for the Next Generation; and World Bank, 2011, Improving
the Quality and Equity of Basic Education in Turkey: Challenges and Options.

   World Bank, 2009, Female Labor Force Participation in Turkey: Trends, Determinants, and Policy Framework.

                                                     43
prepared for the Johannesburg Summit, the environmental chapter of Turkey’s National Program
for the Adoption of the Acquis (2001), and the National Environmental Action Plan (1998).
Turkey became a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol in February 2009. A number of sector
strategies complement these national reports, such as the Nutrient Reduction Action Plan (2002)
which focuses on efforts to reduce agricultural waste runoff to the Black Sea; the National Forest
Program (2004); and the National Strategy and Plan of Action on Biodiversity (2001) which
outlines Turkey’s commitments as a signatory to the Convention on Biodiversity. Protected Area
Management Plans have been prepared in a participatory manner for four sites with strong local
consultation on land use and zoning of the protected areas. 54

114. The Bank and other institutions are partnering with Turkey in its efforts to improve
environmental management. A programmatic operation is under discussion with the
authorities, supporting the integration of sustainable development principles in sector
policies/programs and the enhancement of energy security, following on the First Programmatic
Energy DPL approved in June 2009. Reforms under this proposed operation’s environment
component aim to improve the policy and regulatory framework for protecting and improving
urban environment services and to strengthen environmental management. The EU is also
helping build capacity for environmental regulation and management and for revising legal
instruments for nature conservation. The Turkey-EU Environment Screening process was
completed in June 2007.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION (M&E)

115. The Undersecretariat of Treasury will be responsible for coordinating actions
among other concerned ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies are involved in
the implementation of the public sector reform program being supported by the REGE-DPL2
program including MONE, SPO, MOF, Ministry of Justice, MOH, MOLSS, ISKUR, TCA and
SSI, BRSA, CBRT, CMB, and KOSGEB.

116. As part of the REGE-DPL2 preparation process, the Bank has delivered technical
assistance on M&E to representatives of nine Turkish government agencies and
parliament. The SPO and Undersecretariat of Treasury have emphasized the importance of the
results agenda, and more specifically are focusing on increasing M&E capacity in key line
agencies. A significant part of the Bank’s dialogue with the authorities has been geared towards
strengthening M&E capacity through three separate vehicles: a PPER, the Joint Portfolio
Performance Review (JPPR), and an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant. Under the
Public Expenditure Review (PER) program, a two weeks hands-on training, Designing and
Implementing Sustainable Results-based M&E Systems in the Public Sector in Turkey, was
organized jointly with SPO in June, 2009. In addition, an IDF grant completed in 2010 provided
support to SPO and pilot agencies to develop an M&E framework designed to assess the results
of the National Development Plan.

117. MOLSS and SSI continue development of an M&E process of the social security
reforms to ensure adequate feedback from beneficiaries to policy-makers. This qualitative
feedback mechanism will complement the ongoing quantitative poverty monitoring which is

54
     Sultansazligi, Igneada, Camili and Koprulu Canyon.

                                                          44
undertaken annually (and continuously) since 2002 by TURKSTAT. The monitoring systems for
SSI are supported under the HTSSRP.

118. Bank staff will monitor the results of the program and possible adjustments, if any,
during its implementation, while considering the latest country developments, stakeholder
support, and feasible options for realizing the intended development goals. The review will
be largely based on the monitoring indicators (benchmarks) and the goals of the program (see
Annex 3). At the same time, the overall status of the Government’s program will be monitored to
determine whether country conditions and the specific conditions of the proposed operation have
been met.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

119. PFM in Turkey has strengthened considerably and was recently benchmarked
under the PFMP exercise. After 2001, modernization of Turkey’s system of public financial
accountability in line with international standards was an urgent PFM priority. Enactment of the
PFMC Law in 2003 marked a defining moment in this process. The Law defines new principals,
rules and structures for Turkish PFM systems including budget formulation and execution,
financial and internal control systems, and internal and external audit structures. Each year,
budgets and indicative proposals for the following two years are prepared according to the
functional, economic and institutional classifications defined under the PFMC Law. The
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) analytical budget classification and the accrual based
accounting systems have been expanded to all general government institutions, including local
administrations. The MOF is thus able to consolidate the budget realization for all general
government institutions. Periodic financial statements are prepared regularly and on time. GDPA
prepares aggregated financial reports for the central government, which are published as a
monthly bulletin. The PFMC Law has transferred the authority to incur expenditures and provide
other approvals for expenditures above predetermined thresholds (internal control over budget
expenditures) to the SDUs established within each public administration. The most important
positive feature of the PFMC Law is that it combines duties and responsibilities in a single
spending authority that incurs expenditures and is kept accountable. The PFMC Law has also
introduced a modern internal audit framework, an important step given increased devolution of
spending authority to line agencies.

120. Accounting. An automated online accounting system has been implemented. The MOF
developed in-house an automated online public accounting system (KMYS) has been up and
running since 2002. The system captures receipts and payments from more than 1,500 sites of
the MOF’s GDPA across Turkey as they are made and can produce financial statements and
covers all general budgetary institutions except the Office of the President and the accounting
office for State Debt within the Undersecretariat of Treasury. Turkey has consciously switched
from cash-based to an accrual basis of accounting. A uniform chart of accounts that is
harmonized with budget classification has been implemented. The GDPA has issued a new
framework for the accrual-based chart of accounts, harmonized with the economic classification
of the newly adopted GFS budget classification system. Article 49 of the PFMC Law mandates
that accounting be harmonized with international standards, and that those standards be issued by
a Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which has been operating since June 2006.


                                               45
The GASB is under the MOF, comprised of representatives from the TCA, SPO, MOF,
Undersecretariat of Treasury, and other agencies.

121. Procurement. Turkey has moved decisively to upgrade its public procurement
legislation and practices in line with international standards. The current Public Procurement
Law was enacted in 2002. The Law is based on the United Nations Commission on International
Standards (UNCITRAL) Model and moves Turkey in the direction of compliance with EU
standards. The independent Public Procurement Agency (PPA) established by law to oversee
public procurement and ensure enforcement of the new procurement standards is fully
operational. The Government is working on new procurement legislation for SOEs in the public
utilities sectors consistent with the relevant EU directive in order to improve operational
efficiency of the SOEs. Benchmarking of Turkey’s public procurement system against an
internationally recognized baseline of best practice in procurement was carried out jointly by the
World Bank and the Turkish PPA in February 2006 and updated in October 2007. The
benchmarking included analysis of four main pillars: legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar
I); institutional framework and institutional capacity (Pillar II); procurement operations and
market practices (Pillar III); and the integrity of procurement systems (Pillar IV). It showed that
the country achieved greatest progress in the legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar I), and
in the integrity of the national public procurement system (Pillar IV). Further improvements in
public procurement are important in: (a) lowering of the threshold for publication of contract
award decisions; (b) eliminating restrictions in the form of thresholds for participation by
international bidders; and (c) simplifying dispute resolution system. Finally, selection of
consulting services procedures would benefit from use of quality-and-cost based selection
system, particularly for the assignments that require high competence and relevant experience.

122. Auditing. Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernization of
Turkey’s public audit system. The objectives are twofold: (a) clarify institutional responsibilities,
promote improvements in audit quality in line with international standards and support the shift
from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring in harmony with the efforts to improve operational
performance; and (b) expand the scope of TCA audits to cover the entire general government
including local administrations, autonomous agencies, social security institutions, remaining
extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds, with the overall objective of transforming the TCA
into an effective state audit institution. These objectives were facilitated by the enactment of the
PFMC Law and will be further pursued through the TCA Law that was enacted in December
2010. The new law requires regularity and performance audits and significantly broadens the
audit space of the TCA to include all institutions using public funds irrespective of the public
share in their capital. The TCA is committed to undertake internal reforms to align its
institutional structure with international standards for state audit institutions, to upgrade its audit
capabilities, and to reach consensus with other government audit bodies on the implementation
of the new law.

123. FX Control Environment. The IMF had conducted a safeguards assessment of the
CBRT in April 2002 and determined that, while number of measures was taken to strengthen the
CBRT, such as the conduct of a quality external audit and the preparation of financial statements
according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there remained a number of
vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed. The assessment recommended reorganization of the
internal audit function, expansion of the role of the audit committee, publication of IFRS

                                                  46
financial statements, and reconciliation of program monetary data with the audited financial
statements, including an audit of the treasury component. Since then CBRT has taken a number
measures including reconciliation of monetary data with audited financial statements and its
audit by the independent auditor, publication of annual audited financial statements and the
independent auditors report, reorganization of internal audit function, including the adoption of a
new charter and the appointment of the head of the internal audit department. The audit reports
by independent auditors on the financial statements of the CBRT for the last three years (2009,
2008, and 2007) provided a clean audit opinion. Past audits and generally positive assessment by
the IMF indicate that there are no strong reasons for asking additional safeguards such as audit of
deposit account.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

124. Disbursement and Implementation Arrangements. The proposed loan will follow the
Bank’s disbursement procedures for DPLs. The untied finances will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the program and not tied to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the
Bank of Loan effectiveness, the government will submit a withdrawal application. At the request
of the Undersecretary of Treasury, the IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan with the
CBRT into a designated deposit account which will form part of the official Foreign Exchange
reserves of the country. The government will utilize the proceeds of the loan in foreign currency
for either foreign debt servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent into the treasury
single account for financing budgeted expenses. Prior to that, the borrower will pay a front-end
fee amounting to 0.25 percent of the loan amount from its own resources. If, after deposit in this
CBRT account, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes (for example, for
financing items imported from non-member countries or goods or services on the IBRD standard
negative list), the IBRD will require the borrower to refund the amount directly to the IBRD, and
the IBRD will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan.

125. Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The administration of this loan will be the
responsibility of the Undersecretariat of Treasury. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision of the Loan Agreement. Given the IMF`s positive assessment of the
CBRT, an audit of the deposit account for the proceeds of the loan is not considered necessary.
The Undersecretariat of Treasury will provide the Bank within 30 days a confirmation letter
stating that the DPL funds have been received and deposited in the designated account assigned
by the Borrower that forms part of the Borrower`s budget management system. The closing date
of the loan will be December 31, 2011.

CONSULTATIONS

126. The Government’s reform program underpinning the REGE-DPL2 has benefitted
from consultations with relevant stakeholders (in line with OP.8.60) Turkey has its own
participatory processes underpinning policy formulation. Government policy in employment,
fiscal adjustment, social security, investment climate reforms, and other areas is informed by
regular consultation with stakeholders in varied forums. Groups involved in this process include
unions, employer organizations, chambers of commerce and industry, civil society organizations,

                                                47
academics, and private sector representatives. The legislative process in Turkey requires
ensuring participation of all public stakeholders during the preparation of any draft legislation. In
the case of comprehensive reforms, such as the employment strategy, the government undertakes
a series of consultations with all relevant stakeholders. Involvement of academia and relevant
public institutions are sometimes secured (like in the case of the employment strategy) through
establishing a steering committee for preparation of draft legislative changes. In the case of the
employment strategy, after reaching consensus at the steering committee, the Government shared
the draft with the Council of Ministers. Additionally, a formal consultations process is ongoing
with the trade unions.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

127. There are three main risks to the program’s outcomes: (i) economic and external
risks, (ii) implementation risks, and (iii) political risks.

128. Economic and external risks. The main macroeconomic risk is that a reversal of capital
flows could cause a significant growth slowdown, given the high level of the current account
deficit. The authorities and the financial markets are watching the direction of the current
account deficit carefully, although indicators so far suggest that it is financeable. Turkey’s
substantial foreign exchange reserves and flexible exchange rate regime mitigate risks associated
with capital reversals.

129. Continued uncertainty about the state of the global economy creates downside risks to the
global demand for Turkish exports (especially from the EU), to output growth and fiscal
performance. There is also a risk of increased inflation and overheating, fuelled by capital
inflows, continued lending growth as well as external developments, which if not addressed
could lead to a growth slowdown. Lower growth could in turn create challenges for social policy
and fiscal management. A challenge for the authorities is to determine the right policy mix in the
face of these vulnerabilities, while favorable near-term growth prospects and healthy balance
sheets will likely continue to attract capital inflows. Measures to mitigate risks would include in
the short term a combination of fiscal and macro-prudential tightening, more restrictive liquidity
conditions and further competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms. In the longer term, higher
productivity, higher exports to more diverse markets, higher domestic saving, and greater energy
efficiency and diversification are the keys to reducing Turkey’s reliance on external finance.

130. There is some risk associated with recent political developments in the Middle East and
North Africa, and a major downside risk arises from a sustained increase in oil prices. It is
estimated that a USD10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil is estimated to increase Turkey’s
current account deficit by 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP. If oil prices remain at or above the recently
elevated levels, Turkey’s strong macroeconomic performance may be hindered, and risks
associated with the sustainability of a high current account deficit would increase. The proposed
REGE-DPL2 operation helps Turkey mitigate these risks mainly by supporting reforms to
improve the business climate, which will help increase the competitiveness of the private sector,
thus promoting exports as well as higher inflows of foreign direct investment. Longer term
mitigation measures include increasing energy efficiency and diversifying into non-oil energy
sources, such as wind and solar energy—an agenda that the Turkish authorities are pursuing as a


                                                 48
priority and with Bank support, including under a complementary DPL series focusing on
environmentally sustainable development and the energy sector.

131. Implementation risks. Effective implementation of major public reforms needs strong
coordination and monitoring. Public sector reforms, by the nature of the issues they address, tend
to be cross-cutting and take time to implement. Moreover, social consensus on the reform
program and sufficient institutional capacity are needed for successful implementation. The
complexity and social impact of many elements of the reform program, including the reform of
the social security system, requires consensus building among social partners that takes time and
inevitably results in compromises. Containment of health spending is a particularly sensitive
issue also because there is often a fine line between providing health services to society and to
the poor, and containing unnecessary spending or reducing inefficiencies in spending. Although
the authorities are well aware of such risks, there is a need to remain vigilant in monitoring such
expenditures and in introducing tougher administrative measures if the need arises.

132. On the private sector agenda, the effective implementation of the Commercial Code will
require a major upgrade in the capacity of the auditing profession to deal with the enhanced
transparency and accountability requirements introduced by the Code. Similarly, the introduction
of civil and criminal liability for violations of corporate governance standards is likely to put
additional pressure on the judicial system. Like in many other countries, the introduction of
tighter reporting requirements could bring about requests for delays in the application of these
new requirements. At all times, efforts will need to be made that the requirements apply
universally to all enterprises rather than selectively, to avoid creating multiple standards of
reporting.

133. Political risks. Turkey has had a majority government since 2002 under the Justice and
Development Party (AKP), facilitating the implementation of major reforms. Key risks relate to
continuing domestic political differences and the possibility that the outcome of the upcoming
general elections scheduled to be held in June 2011 could slow the pace or reduce the
effectiveness of economic and social reforms. The EU accession agenda remains an anchor and
the process of harmonization with European legislation and regulation continues to be part of the
Turkish reform agenda.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Second Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with
Turkey
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/24
February 16, 2011
    Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
    the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of
    the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of
    Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the
    regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries
    with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
    discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
    particular case. The Staff Report may be made available at a later stage if the authorities
    consent.
On February 11, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Second Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with Turkey. 1

Background
The Turkish economy’s strong post-crisis recovery continued throughout 2010, supported by
high levels of capital inflows. Growth is projected to have exceeded 8 percent in 2010, placing
output above its pre-crisis level, with credit-financed domestic demand the main driver. Helped
by a drop in volatile food prices, headline inflation came in just below the 2010 target, while
temporary factors compressed core inflation.
Push and pull factors are behind Turkey’s intensified capital inflows. Wide interest rate
differentials, Turkey’s relatively healthy public- and private-sector balance sheets, strong near-
term growth prospects, increased political certainty, and the prospect of a possible upgrade to
investment status have all supported inflows.
Yet availability of abundant low-cost foreign savings has also highlighted Turkey’s
vulnerabilities. The rapid bounce-back in the current account deficit (to 6¼ percent of GDP
in 2010) reveals the high import content of domestic and external demand and growth’s
dependence on capital inflows, which are symptomatic of weak external competitiveness.
Predominantly short-term capital inflows—mostly intermediated by the banking sector—have
increased exposure to capital flow reversal and associated repricing risks.
To varying degrees, policies implemented in recent months have sought to mitigate these
macroeconomic and macroprudential risks. The Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) slowed the pace
of liquidity growth, mostly by reducing its foreign exchange purchases and raising reserve
requirements. More unconventionally, it also sharply widened its interest rate corridor and
lowered its policy lending rate. Some financial sector prudential standards were tightened,

  Post-Program Monitoring provides for more frequent consultations between the Fund and members whose
arrangement has expired but that continue to have Fund credit outstanding, with a particular focus on policies that
have a bearing on external viability. There is a presumption that members whose credit outstanding exceeds 200
percent of quota would engage in Post-Program Monitoring.

including setting ceilings on real estate loan-to-value ratios. The primary balance of the
nonfinancial public sector exceeded the budget target in 2010 on buoyant—but partially
transient—tax revenue derived from the import boom. Excluding such revenue, the underlying
fiscal balance declined, adding to demand pressures. Further demand pressures are expected in
2011.
On the expectation of continuing capital inflows, domestic demand is projected to remain strong
and the current account deficit elevated. GDP is forecast to expand by a robust 4½ percent
in 2011. Strong import growth amid subdued exports and higher energy prices are projected to
widen the current account deficit to 7 percent of GDP. Following a lull early in the year from
dissipating base effects, inflation is expected to rise to 6½ percent by end-year on increasing
demand and cost pressures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong recovery of the Turkish economy during 2010, with
output exceeding its pre-crisis level and unemployment moderating significantly. They noted,
however, the sharply widening current account deficit, which is linked to weak competitiveness
in the context of abundant low-cost external financing.
Directors concurred that Turkey’s main challenge is determining the right policy mix in the face
of vulnerabilities arising from excessive domestic demand and volatile short-term capital flows.
They recognized that Turkey’s favorable near-term growth prospects and healthy balance sheets
would likely continue to attract capital inflows, but also cautioned against the risk of a sudden
capital flow reversal. They noted that these vulnerabilities could be effectively addressed
through a combination of fiscal and macroprudential tightening, more restrictive liquidity
conditions, and competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors considered the authorities’ planned fiscal policy in 2011. While some Directors
viewed the policy stance as broadly appropriate, many called for fiscal tightening to restrain
domestic demand and rein-in the current account deficit.
Directors agreed that monetary policy should continue to focus on price stability, essential for
durably strengthening competitiveness. They encouraged the authorities to continue with direct
measures to contain liquidity expansion, including limiting exchange rate interventions and
increasing reserve requirements. Directors welcomed the early signs of success of the Central
Bank’s strategy to allow increased volatility of short-term market interest rates. They noted that
recent decreases in policy rates entail some risks and urged the authorities to stand ready to raise
the policy rate in the event current measures are insufficient to contain inflationary pressures.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ increased focus on systemic financial-sector risk and a
moderate tightening of macroprudential measures. A number of Directors, however, called for
further actions in these areas. Directors also welcomed the upcoming Financial Sector
Assessment Program update.
Directors encouraged progress on structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and resilience
to capital inflows. They welcomed the improvement in accounting standards and strengthening
of shareholder rights under the recently approved Commercial Code.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued commitment to their Post-Program Monitoring
with the Fund.
