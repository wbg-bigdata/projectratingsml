REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESI]DENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR THE BAY OF AGADIR TOURISM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kingdom of Morocco for the equivalent of US$211.0 million, to help fi-
nance the Bay of Agadir Tourism Project. The loan would have a term of 20
years, including 5 years of grace, with int-erest at 8.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An updating economic mission visited Morocco last April and December;
its report is due to be issued by the end of January; the following paragraphs
are based on the mission's principal findings. Country data are attached as
Annex I.
3.        During the 1968-72 Plan, Morocco succeeded :Ln accelerating the
growth of its economy and in improving the situation of its external payments.
Aided substantially by good crops following favorable weather in three years
out of five, real GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent per annum during the five-
year period. Reflecting the sustained rise in exports during the Plan period
and a slower growth of imports in 1971 and 1972, the balance of payments
showed a surplus from 1969 onward. These results represented a definite im-
provement over those of the preceding decade, during which the rate of real
GDP growth had barely exceeded that of population growth, and the balance of
payments had been a source of constant concern. These achievements were
accompanied by an increase in private consumption averaging about 2 percent
per capita in real terms during the five-year period.
4.        From 1967 to 1970, the main growth determinants had been exports,
tourism and investment, all of which rose substantially; in addition, sizeable
stocks were accumulated following the exceptionally good harvest in 1968. By
contrast, in 1971-72 exports and tourism together with current government
spending were the major factors to sustain economic growth. During these last
two years of the Plan, the investment of public and semi-public enterprises de-
clined, largely because the state-owned phosphate company (OCP) had completed
its expansion program.   Government investment stagnated after 1968.   Private
investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the face of political developments
in 1971 and 1972 and in the expectation of new measures to encourage investment
and exports. At the end of the 1968-72 Plan period, there was therefore an
urgent need to revive public and private investment. Particularly, in the
public sector, absorptive capacity needed to be increased by appropriate changes
in staffing and organization.

of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without Work Bank authorization.



5.        Following a long period of very slow growth in private consumption,
social problems had to be tackled. Over the 1960-71 period, there had been a
slow but perceptible decline in real per capita consumption for about one-
third of the rural population. Wealth and income differences between cities
and villages, among regions, and between rich and poor tended to widen. Un-
employment remained high, in 1971 averaging 9 percent of the country's labor
force, and ranging between 12 and 16 percent in large urban centers.
6.        Recognizing these difficulties and problems, the Government began
in 1971 to revise its development policies, paying increasing attention to
social objectives. The changed orientations were reflected in the 1973-77
Plan which aims at (1) GDP growth of 7.5 percent per annum in real terms from
1973 to 1977, mainly through a sharp increase in public and private investment
and a strategy geared strongly toward increasing exports; and (2) an improve-
ment in the distribution of growth benefits among the different social groups
and the various regions, in order to achieve greater equity and at the same
time increase domestic demand. This improvement was to be brought about
through further land distribution to poor farmers, more emphasis on the deve-
lopment of rainfed agriculture, "Moroccanization" of some industrial and
commercial enterprises, reforms designed to make the tax system more equitable
and progressive, a price and wage policy designed to enable the poorest seg-
ments of the population to satisfy their essential needs, an ambitious pro-
gram of low-cost housing, various measures to improve the lot of the rural
poor, and increased emphasis on the development of poorest regions.
7.        During   the first two years of the 1973-77 Plan, the main development
policies proposed in the Plan were introduced. Further, in 1974, Morocco ben-
efitted from a steep rise in the price of phosphate, its main export product,
which provided substantial additional resources compared to the Plan's expec-
tation. The Government decided to step up investment spending for the years
1975-77, partly to reflect cost increases for the development program already
adopted and partly to embark on additional investment projects.
Recent Economic Performance
8.        In 1973, exports were the onlv dynamic element in the economy, and
real GDP grew less than 3 percent. Agricultural output declined by 11 percent
due to drought. Investment rose 3 percent in real terms, because of an insuf-
ficient number of fully prepared projects, the late publication of the 1973-
77 Plan and new investment incentives.
9.        In 1974, by contrast, the economy registered a strong recovery
(GDP grew by 10 percent) supported by all growth determinants; agricultural
output rose by 14 percent, thanks to good weather conditions and expansion
of irrigation; fixed investment increased by 34 percent in real terms due to
public sector investment and the implementation of new incentives for semi-
public and private investors, and stocks were replenished: exports (including
non-factor services) grew by 14 percent; and Government consumption rose by
more than 20 percent at constant prices.



-3-
10.       The revival of economic activity in 1974 was accompanied by further
improvements in the balance of payments. There was a sharp increase in phos-
phate export earnings from $192 million in 1973 to $932 million in 1974, due
to a 345 percent rise in average export price and a 16 percent growth in
quantities exported. This and a further large (52 percent) increase in
workers' remittances from Europe were the main factors behind a doubling of
the current surplus to $237 million in 1974, in spite of increased import
payments for foodstuffs and petroleum. The current surplus enabled Morocco
to increase short-term financing of its exports to facilitate sales, and to
raise the level of its external reserves. These reached $454 million at the
end of 1974.
11.       Some weak spots should be noted, however.   These are:  the increased
burden (5.4 percent of GDP in 1974) of price subsidies for imported foodstuffs
and petroleum; the volume decline of agricultural exports and the high level
of import requirements for wheat, sugar, edible oils and dairy products; the
increasingly felt shortage of skilled manpower, particularly at mid-level of
technical and managerial qualifications; and the rather low level of reserves
in relation to imports (2.4 months at the end of 1974).
12.       Available indicators show that the economic and financial situation
was less favorable in 1975 than it was in 1974. Two factors in particular
have held back economic growth. These are: (a) a decline in phosphate
exports and downward pressure on phosphate prices, and (b) less favorable
weather conditions in 1974/75 than in 1973/74 which caused a decline
estimated at 10% in agricultural output. However, the growth of fixed
investment and the Government's current expenditures continued at the rapid
pace that began in 1974. On balance, real GDP growth was only an estimated
2 percent in 1975. At the same time, the internal and external financial
situation has tightened compared to 1974. The Government's budget showed
a substantially increased overall deficit, due to sharply risinp current
and capital spending. Despite smaller import price rises and a substantial
increase in external borrowing, the balance of payments should register for
the full year a very small surplus only. Reserves wDuld be about 2 months
of 1975 imports by the end of 1975. The difficulties experienced in 1975
should be temporary. A recovery of output and exports is expected in 1976
for the agriculture and phosphate sectors, which should provide the real
resources for a further increase in investment. This and greater fiscal
discipline likely to be introduced with the 1976 budget law would enable
the country to ease the financial situation by comparison with 1975.
Revisions to the 1973-77 Plan
13.       The Government revised upward the 1973-77 Plan allocations for
the years 1975-77. Government investment appropriations for the five-year
period have been raised to DH 25.6 billion (about $6.4 billion) compared to
the original DH 11.8 billion. Of the DH 13.8 billion increase, changes to
original projects and cost increases represent DH 4.15 billion and new
projects for 1975-77, DH 9.2 billion. Excluding defense, new projects fall
in the following main categories:



DH 2,500 million for regional development;
DH 1,600 million for transport and communications;
DH 1,300 million for agriculture and water development;
DH 400 million for industry;
-    DH 150 million (to be raised to more than DH 300 million depend-
ing on implementation capacity) for low-cost housing; and
-    DH 200 million for social services.
Since planning is indicative only for the semi-public and private sector, the
above allocations do not include investments by this sector. Nevertheless,
the Plan revisions contain provisions to prepare for the implementation of
two large industrial complexes (chemicals and steel) in the semi-public
sector, and expect a vigorous investment growth in the private sector. The
State Secretariat for Planning estimates that total investment at current
prices could jump from DH 4.2 billion in 1974 to DH 12.0 billion in 1977.
This would enable the country to meet the original GDP growth target of 7.5
percent a year for the 1973-77 period.
14.       The Plan revisions seem justified overall.    Indeed, the achievement
of initial (especially social) Plan objectives is eminently desirable. Simi-
larly, Morocco's economy has developed to a stage where heavy industry should
begin to find a place. The country possesses an obvious comparative advantage
in the processing of phosphates, which would tend to stabilize export earnings.
However, the Plan revisions raise several issues of importance for Morocco's
long-term development strategy and prospects.
15.       The steep investment growth foreseen by the plan revisions could
exceed the countrv's absorptive capacity. Following the revival noted in 1974
and 1975, investment in real terms would rise by 39 percent in 1976 and 19
percent in 1977, and continue at very high rates in following years according
to the tentative plans for heavy industry. Availability of skilled manpower
may restrain the pace of project preparation and implementation. The manpower
constraint can only be relieved gradually by training. For large industrial
and infrastructure projects, Morocco may be able to use foreign services more
extensivelv than in the past, but at considerable cost. In addition, the
Government will have to ensure that the increase in capital intensity implied
by the moves into heavy industry would be compatible with the objectives for
increasing opportunities for unskilled employment.
16.       Financial resources may also restrain investment growth.    The
analysis of Morocco's financial prospects shows that such resources would
grow relatively slowly in the next five years. Export earnings are likely
to be restrained by a decline in phosphate prices, and as a result, the
phosphate company's savings which are a large share (36 percent in 1974) of
national savings would be restrained. Taking into account the objective and



- 5 -
policies to improve consumption levels of low-income proups, the growth rate
of national savings may be expected to be relatively Low. In spite of planned
efforts to increase budgetary savings and food import substitution, foreign
exchange and national savings are likely to become a constraint on investment
towards the end of the decade.
17.       Despite the uncertainty over the future evolution of phosphate export
receipts, it is likely that investment growth will still reach close to 13.5%
p.a. on average during the 1973-77 Plan period. It would exceed the original
plan targets for 1973-77, but remain below the revised targets. Provided the
volume of phosphate exports recovers in 1976,real GDP gains would average
about 6.5 percent yearly during the five years. Private per capita consumption
would rise by about 3.5 percent a year, which should correspond to a net im-
provement in the situation of low-income groups. Despite heavy external
borrowing, the balance of payments would remain strong until 1977. These
results would be satisfactory by comparison with the initial objectives of
the 1973-77 Plan for output and consumption growth, and for the balance of
payments.
18.       For the 1978-80 period, however, projected trends call for caution.
Taking into account the absorptive capacity and resource availability con-
straints, investment growth could slow down to around 10 percent a year in
real terms. Such growth and assumed export increases would lead to growth of
real GDP of about 7 percent a year, and of private per capita consumption of
about 2.5 percent. Import requirements for consumption and especially invest-
ment would grow rapidly, and with the likely deterioration in terms of trade,
the economy's resource gap would widen substantially during the last three
years of the decade. To cover it and service accumulated debt, external
borrowing requirements on a commitment basis would need to average more than
$700 million annually in 1978-80, compared to an actual $553 million in 1974
and an estimated annual average of $540 million in 1975-77. Morocco's borrow-
ing capacity seems sufficient to mobilize these amounts from available sources,
provided the necessary effort in project preparation for external financing is
made. The bulk of borrowings up to 1980 would be from official, bilateral and
international sources.
19.       External debt and debt service would increase as a result of pro-
jected borrowings. Debt outstanding and disbursed wcould rise from $1.0 bil-
lion at the end of 1974 to $2.6 billion at the end of 1980. Debt service
would go from 8121 million in 1974 to some $464 million in 1980. Debt service
would remain manageable, rising to 11 percent of exports (including non-factors
services) in 1980, from 6 percent in 1974. The prolongation beyond 1980 of
macro-economic trends foreseen during 1976-80 indicates that external borrow-
ing requirements would remain large, due in particular to the rise in import
needs r)r investment. These would lead to substantial debt service obligations,
since an increasing share of external borrowing wouldl come from commercial
sources. However, with an additional and feasible export effort and provided
recourse to commercial sources is kept within reasonable limits, debt service
would remain a manageable burden on the balance of payments.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
20.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 23 projects with
financing totalling $520 million (net of cancellations), of which $304.5 mil-
lion has been lent since the beginning of FY73, IDA credits, totalling $50.8
million, have been made available for five projects. IFC investments have
amounted to $2.9 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of November 30, 1975, and notes on the
execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases, delays have been
caused by management or procurement difficulties, and recently the risk of
cost overruns has increased due to the upsurge in investment activity in
Morocco and the recent acceleration of inflation. However, performance in
project execution has considerably improved during the last two years.
21.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the industrial and
agricultural sectors, which together have accounted for 70 percent of total
net commitments: the balance is accounted for by utilities (14 percent), roads
(8 percent), tourism (5 percent) and education (3 percent). Apart from the
transfer of resources to Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted to
5.5 percent of total fixed investment in 1970-7b), the main objectives of
lending were to foster and strengthen development institutions, provide tech-
nical assistance, particularly for project preparation, and increase produc-
tive capacity, particularly in order to improve the balance of payments.
22.       While these objectives remain, emphasis is now also being given to
supporting the new orientation of the Government's development effort in the
field of income distribution. Future Bank lending will reflect this orienta-
tion. An increasing share of Bank Group lending will be devoted to projects
developing directly or indirectly the productive capacity of the lowest urban
and rural income groups.
23.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development
and credit. The Doukkala Irrigation Project is being presented to the Execu-
tive Directors. While continued lending for irrigation is envisaged, greater
emphasis will be given to supporting the improvement of rainfed farming, and
lending will in general be focussed on support to small farmers. A first
project for the development of rainfed agriculture in the Meknes region has
been approved recently. Projects for livestock/rural development in a rain-
fed zone in northern Morocco, for agricultural credit and for developing
production of fruits and vegetables are being prenared.
24.       Continued lending for industry and tourism through two DFC's
(Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique and Credit Immobilier et
Hotelier) will be proposed. A third line of credit for CIH is now being ap-
praised. A project for the construction of a large cement plant in the less
developed northeast part of the country is to be negotiated, and joint finan-
cing of this project with the Arab Fund is also envisaged. The tourism in-
frastructure project for which a loan is proposed here will alleviate the



-7-
scarcity of improved land for hotel development in t:he Agadir Region.  Proj-
ects in industry and tourism help to raise foreign exchange earnings and to
improve sectoral policies.
25.       A sites and services project in Casablanca is being prepared.   It
should contribute to solvina the problem of rapid growth of slum areas. A
substantial social serv:!ces component is envisaged. The Bank is executing
agency for project preparation being financed by UNDP; UNDP is also providing
technical assistance for overall planning of the sector. A second Water
Supply projnct i.s being appraised to meet the needs of several urban and
rural centers.  A multiDurpose development project, mainly for power but
also with substantial irrigation and industrial and potable water supply
benefits, located on the Oumr-er-R'bia river, is being appraised.
26.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.   Two
IDA credits have been made to develop secondary education and teacher training
and to improve technical and vocational training.   A proposed Third project
concentrates on general education in rural areas and specific skcill training.
These objectives would be pursued through a planned fourth project.
27.       A consultative group for Morocco was formed in April 1967 under the
chairmanship of the Bank.   It includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Kuwait, Spain. the U.K., the U.S., UNDP, OEC])/DAC, the African Develop-
ment Bank and the European Investment Bank. The last meeting of the Group,
on March 28 and 29, 1974, expressed satisfaction with the improvement in
Morocco's economic performance in recent years, and the emphasis in the Third
Five-Year Plan (1973-77) on improving the distribution of growth benefits.
The next meeting of the Group may take place in 1976 but has not yet been
scheduled. The gross inflow of official loans and grants to Morocco rose from
$129 million in 1966 to $159 million (of which $18 Tmillion in grants) in 1971,
but temporarily fell to $128 million in 1972 and $121 million in 1973; in 1974
the gross inflow rose again to $19O million. The major sources of aid were
France, the U.S., Germany and the Bank Group.
28.       At the end of 1974. the Bank Group's share in Morocco's external
public debt was estimated at 17 percent on a disbursement basis. The share
of the Bank Group in debt service was 14.5 percent in 1973 and 12 percent in
1974. By 1980 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding and in debt service
are expected to rise to about 24 percent and 15 percent respectively.
PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
29.       Located within easy reach by car, boat and airplane from European
tourist generating countries, Morocco offers attracl:ive beaches along its
extensive Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, architectural monuments of its
four imperial cities of Marrakesh, Fez, Meknes and Rabat and the unique
ambiance of its pre-Saharan oases. The diversity of its tourism resources
and climatic conditions attracts a heterogeneous tourist clientele, including
culturally motivated tourists as well as year-round beach vacationers; as a
result, tourist traffic to Morocco is more evenly distributed over the year
than in most other Mediterranean countries.



- 8 -
30.       The number of foreign visitors increased from 469,000 to 1,226,000
between 1968 and 1973, at an annual rate of 21 percent. A 14 percent decline
in 1974 reflected the impact of the energy crisis and economic recession in
Europe. Growth has resumed in 1975; in the first quarter of that year foreign
visitor arrivals were 25 percent greater than in the coresponding quarter of
1974. In 1974, about 60 percent of tourists came from Western Europe and 20
percent, from North America. About two-thirds of total visitors arrived in
Morocco by car. According to a Bank-sponsored study of Mediterranean tourism
markets, recently completed for ten Bank-associated DFC's in Mediterranean
countries, foreign tourist arrivals are projected to grow over the next decade
at 1n.5 percent per vear for Morocco, as compared with 5 percent for the
Mediterranean region as a whole.
31.       The country's hotel capacitv has not increased as fast as the number
of tourists; it only doubled between 1q69 and 1974 to reach 41,000 beds. About
two-thirds of the hotels built during that period were financed by private in-
vestors, most of them Moroccan. The remainder was financed by the Government
or by oublic agencies such as the Moroccan Railways, Royal Air Maroc and
Government-controlled banks.   During the Second Five-Year Developmanz Plan
(1968-72) hotel investment amounted to about USS115 million and represented
less than 4 percent of the total gross fixed capital formation. Morocco's
accommodations are concentrated in the four imperial cities and Casablanca
(43 percent), the Mediterranean coast (35 percent) and Agadir (12 percent).
Thev are generally of a high standard, with luxury establishments accounting
for over 40 percent of the total. About 30 percent of existing accommodation
is managed and operated bv foreigners. The 1973-77 Development Plan called
for the construction of 55,000 beds over five years. Implementation during
the first two years of the Plan lagged far behind Plan objectives and achieve-
ments during the previous Plan period. This sluggish growth can be explained
by the general slowdown in investment following the political events in 1971
and 1972, more promising investment opportunities in other sectors following
the Moroccanization laws and the shortage of developed land in Agadir and
Marrakesh, Morocco's top ranking tourist areas.
32.       Gross foreign exchange receipts from tourists represented 21 percent:
of the country's total foreign exchange earnings from the export of goods anc
non-factor services in 1974. Until phosphate prices were raised in 1973,
tourism was Morocco's major foreign exchange earner. About 16,000 Moroccans
are directly employed in the hotel industry. Indirectly, some 60,000 jobs in
handicraft and some 20,000 in agriculture, construction industry, transport
and other services depend on the tourism sector.
33.       The tourism directorate of the Ministry of UJrban Development,
Housing, Tourism and Environment (MUHTE) is responsible for promoting tour-
ism, administering the investment incentives system, training hotel personnel
and developing tourism infrastructure. Hotel construction is primarily fi-
nanced through Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH), a government controlled
development finance company specialized in housing and hotel lending. The
1973 Investment Code provides the following main incentives for hotel inves-
tors: (i) a ten-year income tax exemption; (ii) an interest free advance
covering 15 percent of the investment, excluding land acquisition, for a



- 9 -
period of ten years including a five-year grace period; and (iii) an interest
rebate on loans provided by CIH, resulting in an effective rate of 4.5 percent
p.a. (as compared to a nominal rate of 8.75 percent).
34.       The Bank has expressed concern on several occasions that generous
incentives may lead to overinvestment in hotels. Incentives are granted to
investors in hotel projects which have been approved technically by MUTHE
and financially by CIH.   CIH also calculates an economic rate of return on
all hotel investments: however, because of methodology and limited data,
these calculations are not fully reliable. A recent 3ank mission which
appraised a proposed third loan to CIT conducted a survey aimed at establish-
ing the methodological and information bases for improved economic appraisal
techniques. CIH would be expected to adopt these techniques as soon as
possible while the Government would endeavor to improve the collection and
analysis of tourism statistics. These measures shoulcd eventually lead to a
rationalization of Morocco's hotel incentives system and reduce the risk of
benefits being granted to marginally economic hotel prolects.
35.       The Bank started financing tourism projects in Morocco in 1966, when
it agreed that part of a loan to Banque Nationale de D)eveloppement Economique
(Loan no. 447 MOR) could be relent to CIB for hotel financing.    The Bank has
since extended two lines of credit to CIH to finance hotel construction, the
first in 1970 for US$10 million and the second in 1972 for US$15 million. A
third line of credit is being appraised. In addition, the proposed third
education project includes construction of a hotel training school which would
supplement the five existing schools and graduate each year about 55 middle
level hotel technicians and of four hotel training centers which would train
about 520 lower level hotel personnel each year. Under the proposed project
for tourism infrastructure the Government would be required to organize a
training program for additional lower level hotel personnel in the existing
Agadir hotel school.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
36.       The proposed project to provide infrastructure for new tourism devel-
opment is located in Agadir, the fast growing administrative center of southern
Morocco and one of the year round beach resorts closest to Europe. In 1960,
Agadir was entirely destroyed by an earthquake in which 15,000 out of its popu-
lation of 35,000 died. The Moroccan Government created a special agency to
design and reconstruct a new city for 50,000 inhabitants. The new city was
built away from the geological fault and according to anti-seismic standards.
Its population grew rapidly and reached the target population of 50,000 in
1969-70. Economic activity of the Agadir Metropolitan Area is based on fish-
ing, agro-industries (based largely on irrigation development in the adjoining



- 10 -
Souss Valley which the Bank is supporting under Loan. No. 1123), ore processing
and tourism. Tourism, virtually non-existent in 1960, has boomed since, with
almost all tourism facilities concentrating in the Secteur Touristique et
Balneaire, on the beach front of the city. In 1974, 4,000 hotel beds were in
operation and 120,000 visitors received. The imbalance between growing demand
and increase in accommodation capacity has resulted in exceptionally high
occupancy levels - during the first eight months of 1975 bed occupancy rates
reached 75 percent - and a high volume of demand that could not be satisfied.
Considerable further growth is expected and Moroccan and foreign investors'
interest in the Agadir area is strong; applications for hotel construction
sites have largely remained unsatisfied for want of developed land.
37.       In 1971, the Moroccan Government requested Bank assistance to finance
infrastructure for the development of tourism in various areas of Morocco.
In 1073 the Agadir area was selected and TNDP agreed to finance, with the Bank
as executing agency, the identification of suitable zones for tourism devel-
opment and the preparation of feasibility studies. As counterpart to the
UNDP contribution, the Government, together with the major Moroccan financial
institutions, created the Societe Nationale d'Amenagement de la Baie d'Agadir
(SONABA), a public sector enterprise (owned by the Government and Government
controlled financial and tourism institutions), and intended to prepare and
implement tourism infrastructure projects in the Agadir area. The project
was appraised in June 1975. Negotiations were held in Washington in December.
The Moroccan delegation was led by Mr. R. Belkoura of the Prime Minister's
Office. A report entitled "Appraisal of the Bay of Agadir Tourism Project"
(918a-MOR) is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Annex
III contains a loan and project summary.
Project Description
38.       The proposed project is intended to assist the Government in dev-
eloping Agadir into a major tourisnm area and to use it as a stimulus to foster
further planned growth of the Greater Agadir Area. The project would consist
of (i) infrastructure works and public facilities for the development of a
new tourism section on 260 hectares, adjacent to Agadir's existing section, and
known as Unite d'Ameragement Touristique (UAT), on which 7,000 hotel beds
and 2,600 housing urits are expected to be constructed; (ii) regional infra-
structure and facilities for the development of Greater Agadir and its tourism
assets; and (iii) related studies.
39.       The planning concept proposed for the new tourism section represents
a departure from traditional patterns, where hotels for tourists are self
contained and isolated from other activities. This is particularly the case
for the existing tourism section in Agadir, whose development has proceeded
in a ribbon-fashion along the beach and has been characterizedd by segregation
of hotels from each other and from other types of activities. Hotels in the
new tourism section would be smaller, intermingled with apartments for tour-
ists and housing nnits for the local population, and clustered around shop-
ping and entertainment facilities.



- 11 -
40.       The proposed combination of infrastructure for tourism and housing
facilities is justified by the project's location within the urban area and
by the intention of making better use of public utilities investment neces-
sary for the hotel component. Although the housing program would be designed
mainly for the upper and middle income groups, it would also alleviate the
general shortage of housing in the Agadir area. The number of housing units
in the project zone would represent 6 percent of the incremental housing de-
mand in the Greater Agadir Area during the period of project implementation
(1975-84). Improved lots would be sold under the project at prices in line
with those expected to prevail on the market. These prices would fully cover
all investment costs and a reasonable return to SONABA.
41.       Under proposed legislation, SONABA would acquire the land whose
development would be based on a land-use plan and zoning regulations which
are almost completed. Zoning regulations are also being completed for the
existing tourism section and are intended to curb the construction of high
rise hotels in order to preserve the visual balance ol- the beach front. These
regulations will also include provisions for the sale of land in the existing
section at nonsubsidized prices comparable to those to be applied to the new
section. Enactment of these zoning regulations for both tourism sections
would be conditions of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
42.       As an extension of Agadir's existing infrastructure and public
utilities system, the project would include roads, waLking paths, parking
facilities, street lighting, sewerage, water and power supply, telephone
lines and green spaces. In addition, it would provide financing for a core
of public facilities such as shopping, entertainment and sports activities
which would make the project zone attractive to investors and visitors alike.
43.       Regional infrastructure and facilities to boe financed under the
project would include (i) completing Agadir's ring road to allow heavy traf-
fic from the Sotuth and East to reach the harbor of Agadir without passing
through the urban agglomeration and the two tourism sections of the city;
(ii) upgrading a 56 km stretch of a tourism road connecting several villages
in the picturesque Imouzzer valley, one of the most attractive sites in the
region; and (iii) eliminating harbor pollution and risks of beach contamination
by replacing primwitive water pumps used to unload fish in the port of Agadir.
44.       In addition, the proposed project includes a program of technical
assistance and studies intended to help the Government in planning the future
growth of the Greater Agadir Area and developing methods to protect the
environment increasingly threatened by the effects of urbanization. It would
also include the updating and completion of master plan for the Area; and the
preparation of regulations and guidelines for preservation of traditional
architecture in the Imouzzer valley and other rural areas surrounding Agadir
which would allow rural families to improve their dwellings. At present,
only the city of Agadir is serviced bv a sewerage network. Sewage disposal
is inadequate. The proposed project would finance a feasibility study for a
sewerage treatment and disposal serving Greater Agadir. The project would
also finance the preparation of another tourism infrastructure project.

Project Implementation
45.       Development of the new tourism section in Agadir would primarily
be the responsibility of SONABA which would implement all infrastructure and
building works through contractors. SONABA would conduct the detailed planning
studies, supervise final engineering work, advertise requests for tenders,
evaluate bids, enter into contracts and supervise all work. Consultant ser-
vices would be utilized to assist SONABA in preparing the final engineering
design and supervising the works in the Project Zone. For the design and
construction of the water supply, electric power and telecommunications compo-
nents, SONABA would contract with Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP),
Office National de l'Electricite (ONE) and the Ministere des Postes, Tele-
graphe et Telephone (PTT) respectively. Once implemented, these facilities
would be operated by these specialized agencies, which are adequately orga-
nized and managed to carry out these tasks. In implementing the sewerage
component, SONABA would work closely with the Municipality of Agadir, which
runs the existing system, and with the Province of Agadir, which is in charge
of the Greater Agadir Sewerage study.
46.       Coordination between SONABA and other Government agencies is ensured
through an ad hoc interministerial commission at the national level chaired
by the Minister of Tourism, and a local committee chaired by the Governor of
Agadir. A condition of loan effectiveness would be the signing of agreements
between SONABA on the one hand and ONEP, ONE, and PTT on the other hand,
defining the agencies' respective technical and financial responsibilities in
the construction, management and maintenance of the various infrastructure
works (Section 6.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
47.       Once developed, the land and public facilities would be sold or
leased by SONABA to private investors at market prices. It is expected that
land revenues will cover all investment costs and provide a satisfactory rate
of return to SONABA. Transactions would be subject to regulations (i) giving
SONABA a preemptive re-purchase right in case the buyer of the land wishes to
sell it before construction; and (ii) imposing construction deadlines and
standards in order to avoid having improved land remain unbuilt and to make
sure that building projects fit with the overall plan. Adoption by SONABA's
board of a policy incorporating these regulations would be a condition of
loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
48.        SONABA's responsibilities would evolve over the life of project
implementation. During the first years, its function would be mostly that of
a builder. Then, its commercial function would become more important. SONABA's
staff would reflect this changing character. SONABA's project implementation
unit would be responsible for the physical and architectural implementation
of the projects. It has already prepared a critical path network which will
be reviewed with the Bank every six months; as will be its progress reports
(Section 3.03 of the draft Project Agreement). It is headed by a qualified
Technical Director, an engineer with experience in similar projects. Within
this unit, physical planning and architecture would be coordinated by the chief



- 13 -
urban planner who supervised these aspects of the UNDP financed studies.
SONABA's commercial and financial division would, after the start-up years,
promote the sale or lease of hotel and housing sites as well as the proposed
public facilities (Section 3.04 of the draft Project Agreement). A legal
and administrative division would prepare and supervise sale and lease con-
tracts according to the regulations mentioned in paragraph 47, and manage
personnel and equipment.
49.       To guarantee completion of the project after the infrastructure in-
vestment has been made, the Moroccan Government has undertaken to ensure that
sufficient hotel beds will be built to attain an acceptable rate of return on
infrastructure outlays; a minimum of 4,200 beds (or 60 percent of the sche-
duled total) would be in operation by 1988 (Section 4.04 of the draft Loan
Agreement). Such an expansion will yield an estimated economic rate of
return of 13 percent.
50.       The Regional Components (Agadir's ring road, Imouzzer valley road
and harbor equipment) would be implemented under the responsibility of the
Ministry of Public Works through its regional or specialized agencies.
51.       The project would be completed over a periodl of about five years.
Preparation of a detailed land use plan would be compLeted by December 1976.
Final designs for infrastructure works would be completed at the latest by
June 1977 and for public facilities, by February 1978.. Construction would
start by August 1977 and would be completed by June 1981.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan

Grand Total                                         47.9
The Bank loan would be made to the Government and would finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project amounting to US$21.0 million.. The por-
tion of the loan proceeds needed for the Project site would be on-lent to
SONABA on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, while local costs,
including interest during construction, would be covered by the increase of
SONABA's authorized capital, the subordinated long-term Treasury advance
bearing 6 percent interest and the additional Government loan having the same
terms as the Bank loan. Any cost overruns incurred in the implementation of
the project would be financed by the Government. Conclusion of a subsidiary
loan agreement, acceptable to the Bank, between the Government and SONABA
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of the draft Loan
Agreement). SONABA has agreed to refrain from incurring any debt other than
for the financing of the project prior to 1986 without the Bank's approval
and would at all times maintain a minimum debt service coverage of 1.1
(Sections 4.03 and 4.04 of the draft Project Agreement). Depending on the
actual pace of land sales, SONABA might accumulate sizable cash balances. In
this case SONABA would prepay that part of the Bank loan relent to it by the
Government to the extent that in any one year, the ratio of land sold in the
project area to the total land intended for sale or rent exceeds the ratio of
total prior repayments by SONABA of the Bank loan relent to it to the total
amount of such loan. Such prepayment would be made to the extent necessary
to equalize these ratios the debt service coverage covenant permitting (Sec-
tion 2.09 of the draft Loan Agreement). The Government would make correspon-
ding prepayment to the Bank and could equally claim prepayment of its own
senior loan. SONABA's accounts would be subject to annual audits by indepen-
dent auditors acceptable to the Bank (Section 4.02 of draft Project Agree-
ment).
Procurement
54.       Civil works contracts would be tendered under international compet-
itive bidding according to the Bank's guidelines. In order to permit smaller
local contractors to tender for work of a size within their capabilities and



- 1 5 -
also to attract foreign bidders, contracts for civil works would be tendered
individually and would also be combined into bidding groups at the bidders'
option. Equipment would be procured after international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank's guidelines except for purchases not exceeding
US$70,000 equivalent, when procurement will be in accordance with normal
government procurement procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank, provided
that such purchases do not exceed an aggregate of USn500,000. A 15 percent
preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower, would
be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids for equipment.
Telecommunication equipment procured under the project would have to be com-
patible with that presently used in Agadir. It is therefore proposed that
PTT negotiate the purchase -with manufacturers of this equipment, subject to
Bank approval. The amount involved would be about US.6On,000.
55.       The consultants would be appointed by SONABA, the Ministry of Urban
Development and Tourism and the local authorities following Bank guidelines.
Retroactive financing amounting to about USèS120,000 is proposed to cover the
foreign exchange cost of detailed planning and engineering studies undertaken
since August 1, 1975.
Disbursement
56.       The proposed Bank loan of USS21.0 million, to be disbursed by 1982,
would finance
(a) 47 percent of total expenditures for civil works;
(b)  100 percent of the CIF price of imported equipment or of the
ex-factory price of locally produced goods pirocured through
international competitive bidding and 60 percent of the ex-
factory price of other locally procured goods; and
(c) 34 percent of the total cost expenditures for consultant
services, project administration and studies.
JustiFication
57.       The project would develop Agadir's tourism potential within the
overall development of Greater Agadir and its surroundfings. Hotels to be
built on the project site would be small to medium sized, and by and large
sponsored and managed by Moroccans. Keen tourist demand observed in the past
is expected to continue. The number of bednights has been estimated to grow
annually at 9.5 percent wwhich appears reasonable in comparison to past aver-
age growth of 37 percent between 1970 and 1974, and also in light of past
high unsatisfied demand (estimated at 20 percent of tot:al bednights in 1975).
On these assumptions, and with a drop of occupancy rates from their present
congested level to a more normal one, the overall financial rate of return
for hotels would average 11.4 percent. When selling about 50 percent of deve-
loped hotel sites at market prices and leasing the balaLnce, SONABA would earn
a 9.2 percent financial rate of return on its operation,s.



- 16 -
58.       The economic rate of return of the project investment, excluding the
Agadir ring road, would he 17.4 percent. It would decline to 14.6 percent if
investment costs increased by 20 percent and to 13.4 percent if opening of
hotels was delaved by two years. The economic rate of return of the Agadir
ring road, which represents about 11% of the project cost, would be 27.7 per--
cent. It would decline to 23 percent if investment costs increased by 15 per-
cent and to 22.4 percent if benefits accruing to road users decreased by 25
percent. The weighted average economic rate of return of the entire project
would be 18.5%.
59.       The net foreign exchange earnings generated by the project would
amount to about USS37 million per year in 1989 when all planned accommodations
have become fully operational. This compares with USS245 million net foreign
exchange receipts earned by Morocco from tourism in 1974. Direct employment
from project hotel and tourism facilities would amount to 4,400. Indirect
employment generated in construction, handicrafts, agriculture and other
services is likely to account for 7,200 additional jobs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
60.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and SONABA the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
61.       Features of the Agreement of special interest are described in
paragraphs 41, 46, 47, 48, 49, 53, 54 and 56. Sepcial conditions of effective-
ness are as follows:
-    enactment of zoning regulations for the existing and new
tourism sections;
-    signature of agrements between SONABA and public agencies
concerned with project implementation;
-    approbation by SONABA's board of the project agreement
between the Bank and SONABA;
-    conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to
the Bank between the Government and SONABA and effective
increase in SONABA's share capital;
-    adoption by SONABA's board of a policy for sales and leases
of land; and
-    authorizations from present landowners allowing SONABA to
start implementing the project.



- 17 -
62.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
63.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1,
Ln. No. 642 and Cr. No. 167 First Highway Project: US$14.6 million of
November 13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: May 22,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The project suffered from initial delays; however, construction was
completed in late 1973 and within the estimated cost. The original closing
date has been extended three times, from the orginal date of February 28,
1974. By December 1975, $0.2 million was still undisbursed out of the com-
bined credit/loan, mainly because of cumbersome Government disbursement pro-
cedures. This amount is to be cancelled.
Ln. No. 643 Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project: US$46 million Loan of November
Date of       13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness:  June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
November 30, 1978.
Progress in implementing the project is now satisfactory although
considerable problems were first experienced with management and procurement,
and some procurement difficulties continue. The major project structure,
Idriss le Dam, is completed and equipment of 13,200 ha out of a total of
35,000 ha is completed. Additional infrastructure for the project area, in-
cluding a sugar cane processing factory and flood protection works, are being
provided by Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Ln. No. 704 First Hotel Development Project; US$10.0 million of August 12,
1970: Date of Effectiveness:   January 28  1971; Closing Date:
December 31. 1975.
Disbursements and commitments were initially lower than originally
expected, as construction of some hotels ran into difficulties in 1971-73.
As a result, the original closing date of December 31, 1973 was extended, and
$1.2 million was cancelled from the loan.   With returniing confidence and re-
newed investment activity, project execution substantially improved in 1974
and 1975. The loan is now fully committed, but a further postponement in the
closing date is being arranged to complete disbursements,
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balance evaluation 6f strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX 11

Cr. No. 266 Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August 18,
1971; Date of Effectiveness: December 10, 1971; Closing Date:
April 30, 1976.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific sec-
tions of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems of the
Borrower, and technical assistance for project administration and school main-
tenance. Subsequently the Association agreed not to finance two Vocational
Training Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an
amount of about US$0.9 million has been transferred to the unallocated cate-
gory for future reallocation and/or cancellation. Initial delays occurred
in the appointment of consultant architects, in the recruitment of local
personnel and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit, and in pro-
curement. However, execution is now proceeding satisfactorily, and all civil
works contracts under the project have been awarded. Physical execution of
the project is forecast for completion by the end of 1976, about one year and
a half later than originally planned, and an extension of the closing date
will be necessary.
Ln. No. 848 Second Hotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30. 1972;
Date of Effectiveness:   November 1, 1972; Closing Date:   December
31, 1976.
Commitments initially lagged behind expectations, as in the case of
Loan No. 704, due to sluggish investment activity, but the loan should be fully
committed by March 1976, as against the appraisal estimate of year-end 1973.
A third loan is now being appraised.
Ln. No. 850  Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19,172;
Date of Effectiveness: May 2, 1973; Closing Date: December 31_
1977.
The dam which was the major component of the project was inaugurated
in August 1974. All project elements are being completed on schedule except
for the treatment plant and the training school, which are both about six months
behind schedule. The financial position of the Borrower, Office National de
l'Eau Potable (ONEP), is satisfactory. In early 1976 consultants are due to
complete a tariff study which will assist in improving ONEP's long-term finan-
cial performance. Consultants should be engaged shortly to undertake a manage-
ment study for ONEP.
Ln. No. 861, Cr. No. 338 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$34.0 million
of October 10, 1972; Date of Effectiveness: February
2, 1973; Closing Date: August 31, 1976.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily and disbursements
had reached US$25.5 million by the end of November 1975. The Caisse Nationale
de Credit Agricole (CNCA) increased its lending rates in September 1975; as a
result, the total of sub-loans which qualify for reimbursement under the Bank
loan has increased, and disbursements are likely to be completed by March
1976, in line with the appraisal forecast.

Ln. No. 890 Sixth BNDE Project; US$24 million of May 14, 1973, Date of
Effectiveness: September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The loan was fully committed by May 1974, about six months earlier
than expected, due to rapid improvement of the investment climate since mid-
1973. Disbursements are also running slightly ahead of the appraisal estimate
