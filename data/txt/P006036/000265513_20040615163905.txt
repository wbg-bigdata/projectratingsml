InspectionPanel Report
on
Reviewof Present Project Problems andAssessment of Action Plans


INTRODUCTION

      1.        This Report responds to the World Bank ("Bank) Executive Directors' ( "Board") decision to
      ask the Inspection Panel ("Panel"), on February 28, 1997, "to undertake a review of the existing
      problems of the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project in the areas of environment and resettlement and
      provide an assessment of the adequacy of the Action Plans as agreed between the Bank and the two
      countrieswithinthe nextfour months."

      2.        At the same time, the Executive Directors decided that "independent of the above decision,
     the Inspection Panel [was] expected to look at the extent to which the Bank staff had followed Bank
      procedureswith respectto this project." As explained in Part 4 of this Report, the precise extent and
      scopeof this latter decisionwas notdetermined by the Executive Directors.

      3.        This decisionarose as a resultof the Board's considerationof the Panel'srecommendationto
     them to authorizean investigationintothe Requestfor Inspectionrelated to the Project("Request").

     The Request
     4.         On September 30, 1996the Panel received a Request for Inspectionfrom SOBREVIVENCIA
     - Friends of the Earth Paraguay, representing people who live in Encarnación, Paraguay, who claim
     that their rightslinterest had been affected by acts and omissions in the implementationof the Bank-
     financed Yacyretá Project. The Requesters claimed that they had been, and may potentially be,
     directly and adversely affected in their standards of living, health and economic-wellbeing as a result
     of the filling of the Yacyretá Reservoir and the Bank`s omissions and failures in the preparation and
      implementationof the project. The Chairmanof the Panel registeredthe Requeston October 1, 1996.

      ManagementResponse
      5.        The Management Response ("Response") to the Request was submitted to the Panel on
      November 1, 1996. In its Response the Management included a description of "Pending Actions" as
     AttachmentA.

      Panel Recommendation
      6.        The Panel, on December 24, 1996, recommendedto the IBRD's ExecutiveDirectorsthat they
      authorizean investigation.

Executive Directors' Decision
7.        On February 28, 1997 the Executive Directors considered the Panel's recommendation.
During the meeting, Management presented Action Plans A and B. Action Plan A dealt with actions
that should have been completed, but were not before the reservoir was filled in 1995 to 76 masl.
Action Plan B proposed activities aimed at permittingthe "continued operation of the reservoir at 76
mas1 in an environmentalsound manner". These Plans had been agreed with authorities responsible
for the project but at the time a number of elements had to be further defined and certain actions taken

review- the scope of which is intheir decisionquoted in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.
by March 15, 1997. In light of this the Executive Directors' decided to ask the Panel to conduct this


Panel Review & Assessment
8.        The then Chairman of the Panel had designated Mr. Alvaro Umaña Quesada-lead inspector
in charge of the initial review of the Request-as leader of this review and assessment authorized by
the Board. Mr. Umaña who had visited the Project area in December 1996 for the initial review,
returnedthere twice (May & July 1997) conducting consultationswith Argentine and EBY officials and
with localauthorities,and affectedpeople on the Argentine and Paraguayansides of the Project.

Additional Requests for Inspection from Affected People in Argentina
9.        During his second visit, Mr. Umaña was approached in the city of Posadas, Argentina, by
several groups of people who allegedly were adversely affected by the Project and also by local
political and communityleaders, as well as local government officials. They submittedoral and written
Requests asking the Panel to review several aspects of project executionwhich, according to them,
are detrimentalto the people, communities and the environment on the Argentine side of the project.

10.       After a careful review of these Requests, the Panel concluded that-while some of the
Requestscould be regarded as new Requests for Inspection-in substance the issues they raised are
substantially the same as in the original Request related to the same project. In the Panel's view, the
matters raised in the additional Requests could be regarded as falling within the scope of the Board's
February28,1997 mandated review.

11.       As a result the Panel informedthat Board that it proposed to proceed as follows: a) provide
copies of the written Requests received to Management and ask for comments within the usual 21
business day period; b) include references to such Requests and Management's comments-as well
as the Panel's specific findings thereon-in this Report; c) advise these new Requesters accordingly.
The Board's approval was given on a no objection basis on June 23, 1997. Management Comments
were received August 4, 1997. Attachment 1 contains Management Comments on the Additional
Requests. The Additional Requests themselves are not attached, since they were submitted in
Spanish and the Panel is satisfied that these Requests are adequately summarized in Management
Comments.

12.       The Panel met with Argentine authorities in Buenos Aires and Posadas during July and in
Encarnación with Paraguayan authorities, the bi-national executing agency EBY and the NGO
community. The Panel would like to acknowledge the full cooperation and thank both the GOA and
GOP and provincial and local authorities, EBY staff as well as SOBREVIVENCIA for facilitating the
Panel's task. The Panel benefited from a number of frank dialogues with Government and EBY
officials and with people living in the projectarea and would like to express its thanks to them for their
assistance. Finally, the Panel acknowledges the cooperativelogistical help from Bank Management,
and in particular the assistance provided by a consultantto the Panel for this review, Mr. Francis V.
Fragano.

13.     This Reportis infour parts. Part 1 reviews the Project'spresentproblems. Part2 providesan
assessment of the adequacy of Action Plans A & B. Part 3 covers the Additional Requests for
Inspection and Management Comments on them.           Part 4 addresses Bank compliance with its
procedures.

14.     The Request, Management Response and Panel Report and Recommendation to the Board
can be found in a separate volume which has been available to the public since February 28, 1997.

EXECUTIVESUMMARY


Findings
     0 After morethan fourteen years underconstructionwith investments(including interest) surpassing
       $8.5 billion, the Yacyreta Hydroelectric Project remains riddled with problems, delays and
       uncertaintiesthat cast serious doubts about the Project'sfuture and its continued adverse effects
       on adjacentpopulations.

     0 Imbalancein execution between civilíelectro-mechanical works on the one hand and resettlement
       and environmental measures on the other has been one of the fundamental problems of the
       Yacyretá Project. This imbalance has been exacerbated by the usual Bank practiceof financing
       the former while leaving the latter for counterpart funding. The Panel believes that this practice
       should be reconsidered.

            0    This imbalance is dramatically illustrated by the fact that the reservoir was filled prior to
                 completion of the agreed environmental and resettlement measures which resulted in
                 negative environmental impacts and placed populationsliving in low-lying areas on both
                 sides of the reservoirat higher risk for a prolonged period of time. This action-to which
                 Bank Management gave its non-objection triggering the Request for Inspection and the
                 Panel's intervention-has caused risks of serious health hazards through exposure to
                 unsanitary conditions and poor water quality. Other risks include potential loss of
                 sustainable livelihoodthrough loss of highquality clay and fish resources.

            0    Such imbalance, leading as it has to rising social and environmental liabilities,now has a
                 financial cost at leastequivalentto the costs of PlansA and B ($132 million) if the Project
                 operates at 76 masl. To address the imbalancewill take until at least the year 2000.

       Substantial issues raised by additional Requests for Inspection need to be addressed by
       Managementincluding cost of replacement housing on the Argentine side; quality of housing and
       community infrastructure on both sides of the reservoir; economic situation of oleros and workers
       in the brickmaking industry and of fishermen.

       Despite extensive but inconsistentsupervision efforts, the Bank has failed to bring the project into
       compliancewith relevant Bank policies and proceduresdue to an poorly conceived Projectdesign
       in the first place, compounded by changing standards and regulations over time, EBY bureaucratic
       proceduresand lack of financial resources.

     0 Bank environmental and resettlement procedures call for continued participation of potentially
       affected people from the outset. The Panel has found that the process has been neglected and
       now is all but discontinued. Bank supervision will be essential to ensure resumption of the
       participatoryprocess.

     0 Institutionalstrengthening of executing agencies in the areas of resettlement and environmental
       protectioncontinues to be an issuethat needs to be addressed by the Bank

     Although the macro and financial environment is highly uncertain, solution to the problems
     depends on implementationof Plans A and B strictly in accordance with the timetables proposed.
      Howeverthere are components of these Plans that are already lagging behind (e.g. creation and
      maintenance of biodiversity reserves) and the Project history of delays and non-compliance
      previously tolerated by the Bank does not allow the Panel to assess potential performancewith
     any degreeof confidence. Forexample:

               Some fundamental studies critical to Plans A and B are either incomplete or have not
               been conducted, such as hydrogeological studies and the Ana Cua environmental
              assessment. These studies must be completed immediately. But, the conduct of the
              studies (and the resulting designs) must follow Bank procedures on environmental
              assessment and participation. This is likelyto result in delays in completionof aspectsof
               PlansA and B.

     Due to the significant long term involvement that both the Bank and IDB have in the Project, the
     two institutions should continue providingfinancial and technical assistanceto correct the harms
     that have been identifiedand must remain committed to implementationof the REMP independent
     of formal ownership of Project.

     Presentlyoperatingat 76 mad, the lowest possibleelevation, the Project'sannual net cash flow is
     about $50 million, which is insufficient to cover the sociaVenvironmental liabilities and meet the
     investmentsrequired to raise the reservoirabove its present elevation. If the Projectwere to stay
     at the presentoperating level,the debt would never be repaid.

     Given the Government of Argentina decision to suspend allocation of additional investment
     resources to the Project during the last three years, privatization was supposed to provide the
     capital requiredto reach elevation 83 masl. However, both the Government of Argentina and the
     Governmentof Paraguay have failed to obtain approval from their respective Congressesfor the
     legislationthat would authorize privatization. Present plans are unclear.

The investmentrequired to reach elevation83 mas1has been estimatedby Management to be at least
$700 million beyond [that required for execution of]Plans A and B. This however does not take into
account the actual costs of remaining expropriations (including thousands of hectares of land),
resettlement of urban populations on both sides of the reservoir, and replacement of infrastructure
(railroads, ports, airport)which would render the Management's estimatewholly inaccurate.

Review

       15.      The Yacyreta Hydroelectric Project ("Project") is a unique and complex undertaking, with
      many singular features that have an important bearing on the problems that the project has
      experienced. Among the project's most salient features are its massive proportions and impacts, its
      complex institutional basis, the long lead-time and persistent implementation problems that it has
      suffered, and considerable uncertaintieswith respect to the availabilityof financial resources required
      for its completion. All these interrelated factors, which contribute to a highly problematic present
      situation, are analyzedindividuallybelow.


Massive Nature of the Project
      16.       The Projectconsists of a 65 Km. earth dam in the main channelof the Parana River about 80
      Km. from the cities of Posadas, Argentina and Encarnacion, Paraguay. The project is a low-head
      hydroelectric facility with 20 Kaplan turbines of 155 MW each for a total generating capacity of 3100
      MW. Inaddition,the projectalso includesa navigationlock, fish-passage and other supportfacilities as
      well as a large program of infrastructure relocation, population resettlement, and mitigation of
      environmental impacts. The earth dam, with a uniform height of 86 masl, creates a reservoir of 1065
      square kilometersand, if filled to its design level of 83m, would flood over 107,000 hectaresand affect
      over 13,000 families, includinga major impact on the urban areas of Encarnación and Posadas. Most
      of the impactsof the project can not be avoided and stem from the locationof the large reservoir,huge
      areas to be inundated and the large numbers of people affected, including the second largest city in
      Paraguay and, to a lesserdegree the city of Posadas.



Institutional Basis
      17.       The Projectwas started by a 1973 bi-nationaltreaty between the Republics of Argentina and
      Paraguay.The Treaty of Yacyreta proposed to develop the hydroelectric potentialof the Parana River,
      improve navigation in the area, mitigate the effect of severe river floods and promote irrigation. The
      Treaty also created the "Entidad Binacional Yacyreta" (EBY), an autonomous bi-nationalentity formed
      between an Argentine and Paraguayan utility, having equal rights and duties, as well as full legal,
      financial, administrativeand technicalcapacity. Despite its equally shared ownership, Argentina agreed
      in the Treaty to securetotal financingfor the project.

      18.       As stated in the 1992 SAR for the Yacyreta II Hydroelectric Project, "Yacyreta has suffered
      from instability in the management of the project entity, lapses in technical direction, constant
      uncertainties of assurances and levels of future funding, excessive EBY Board interference, strains
      between the owners and in their dealings with international contractors, and a not fully satisfactory
      design of the resettlement and environmental protection plan, as well as its slow implementation."
      Unfortunately,five years later the same problems still persist, and some may have deteriorated. For
      example,throughoutits existenceEBY has had eighteendirectors, the last three within the period after
      filing the Request.

Long Delaysand ImplementationProblems
      19.       The Project has been under design or construction for over 20 years, and the Bank's
      involvementgoes back to the mid-seventies. Since the projecthas taken such a long time to complete,
      many standards have changed in the both environment and resettlement areas. For example, the
      OperationalDirectiveson Environmental Assessment and InvoluntaryResettlementwere adopted after
      the two initial Bank loans had been approved, but before the lasttwo loanswere in place. At the time of
      the original design, some impacts, like drying-up a major river, were considered acceptable. Today,
      this is no longer the case. At the same time, there is considerably more appreciation today of the
      problemsof resettlinglargenumbersof people or the effectson urbancenters.

      20.       The Project has suffered major implementation problems from its inceptionwhich have led to
      significant delays in completion and large financial problems. The Bank President's Memorandum to
      the Board for the Yacyreta II Project (August, 1992) refers to the "unforeseen political (initially the
      Southern Atlantic war) and macroeconomic instability since the Project works began, discontinuity in
      the Ministry of Economy oversight of the project and sector finances, recurrent difficulties with
      contractors over payment arrears, inadequate management of the projectand differences between the
      Argentine and Paraguayan owners have led to extended delays, and form an enormous financial
      burden." Again, this assessment characterizesmany of the project's present problems. Unfortunately,
      some of them havedeterioratedconsiderably during the past five years

      21.       One of the areas of rapiddeteriorationdeals with the impactson the populationto be affected
      due to the uncertaintiming of the impacts and the low level of credibility that the Bank and EBY has
      among the population.The specific problems that triggered the Panel's interventionare derived from
      the filling of the reservoir to 76 masl. The Request claims that this action, carried out without having
      adequately implemented the requiredresettlement, environmentaland social mitigation measures has
      harmed specific groups, such as the clay workers and urban populations living between 76 and 78
      masl. The Bank`s "no objection'' to filling the reservoir was conditioned upon the agreement that all
      pendingenvironmentaland resettlement actions, which were not complete at the time of the reservoir
      filling, would be completed in the course of 1995. The premise that these pending actions would be
      completed shortly turned out to be tragically wrong, and by the end of August 1997, a significant
      numberof them remain to be carriedout.


InsufficientFinancialResourcesfor Completion
      22.       The original cost of the Project was estimated by the Staff Appraisal Report ("SAR) in 1979,
      including physical and price contingencies, at $3.7 billion. By 1992,the SAR for the Yacyreta II Project
      estimatedthe investmentat $5.5 billion.At the present time, estimated costs to date, including interest
      on the debt, surpass$8.5 billion.

      23.       Although the civil and electromechanical works are almost complete, most of the
      "complementary works", particularly those related to resettlement and environmental management
      plans, remain to be done. In additionto the $4.7 million undisbursed from Plan A, $116.7 million are
      requiredfor prolongedstay at 76 mas1(Plan B), and at least an additional $700 million for completion
      to 83 masl. However, this latter figure cames a high level of uncertainty because it includes
      expropriation of lands to be flooded-where costs could be considerably higher once expropriation is
      actuallycarriedout-and other problems such as:

      0     the waste treatmentplantfor Encamarción, and



                                                                                                            7

0    the environmental protectionworks for the Brazo de Ano Cua for which alternative solutions are
     still understudy, and
0    the resultsof hydrogeological studieswhich have stillto be carried in spite of the fact that they are
     fundamentalto the futuredevelopment of complementary works .

24.        In late 1994, just months after the reservoir had been filled, the Government of Argentina,
("GOA") facing difficult macroeconomic conditions in the aftermath of the Mexican crisis, decided that
it could no longer allocate additional resources to the Project, and that it would seek private capital to
complete and operate the facility. Management's Response to the Request claimed on October 29,
1996 that the "...implementationof the REMP has been delayed for more than two years and is
currently nearly halted, mainly because of the Government's decision to hold implementationuntil the
privatization scheme for Yacyreta is approved by the Argentine and Paraguayan Congresses." The
legislation requiredfor privatizationof the facility failed to obtain approval in either Congress, and the
most recent plans includethe privatizationof the managementof the facility while retaining bi-national
ownership. This alternative would not require Congressional approval. Bank Management informed
the Panelthat as of lateAugust 1997therewere "no plansfor the privatizationof Yacyreta."

25.        The Panel requested Management to provide it with an analysis of scenarios of investment
repayment periods for the different reservoir elevations.         Management's response illustrates the
Panel'sconcerns:

           "Assuming that the total investmentat elevation76m would amount to about US$5.5 billion, of
           which US$0.3 billion are being financed by EBYfrom electricitysales, the net total investment
           amounts to US$5.2 billion. It is estimated that the annual net cash flow, starting after
           completing Plan B, would be about US$50 million. Under this scenario, it would take about
           100 years to repay the investment. The US$50 million were calculated as the difference
           between EBY's revenues and the sum of operating and maintenance expenses and the
           following deductions: (a) reduction from the tariff stated in the Treaty (US$32/MWh) to the
           spot price of electricity (currentlyaround US$20/MWh; (b) compensation to Paraguay; and (c)
           paymentsof transmissioncost and provincialallowances.

           In the case of elevation 83m, it would take about 23 years to repay the investment, with an
           annual netcashflow of US$240 million.

           However, it should be taken into considerationthat most of EBY's investment requirements
           have been financed by government loans and supplier's credits and commercial bank loans,
           the repayment period is much longer, because the repayment of the debt service should be
           added. 6% of the total investment at elevation 76m, and 11% at elevation 83m would be
           financed by EBY'sown resources.

           Inthis case, it would take 42 years to repay the total debt at elevation 83m, assuming that the
           works required to reach elevation 83m are completed by the year 2003. At elevation 76m,
           EBY's debt would never be repaid. It should be noted the government debt has an interest
           rate of 6% perannum.

           Finally, it is necessary to take into account, that the privatization scheme proposed by
           Government assumes that the debt service payment obligation would remain with the
           Government, and would not be transferred to the Concessionaire."

     26.       Managementassumes an investmentof US$5.5 billionwould be required to reach 83 masl. It
     is evident that this is not the case. At 83masl the reservoirwould flood a much larger amount of land
     (as indicatedin the attached map), basic infrastructure suck as railways and the airport, and the heart
     of improved urban areas of Encarnaciónand Posadas(includinghomes, businesses, commerce) all of
     which would have to be replacedor compensated at substantialcost. The range of incrementalcosts
     of going to 83 mas1 is reported to be from US$800 million to around $2 billion. The Memorandum
     suggests that at elevation 76masl EBY's debt could never be repaid. Given the facts just noted one
     has to question seriouslywhetherthe debt would ever be repaid at 83masl once the full costs are taken
     into account.


Action Plans


     27.      The panel was asked by the Executive Directors to assess the Action Plans presented to
     them by Managementat the February28th, 1997, meetingof the Board.

     28.       Plan A, with a projected cost of $16 million and a completion date of December 1997, is
     intended to remedy actions that should have camed out prior to filling the reservoir in 1994. At this
     time, while some elements are completed, it is also clear that important commitments, such as the
     hydrogeologicalstudies, cannot be completed by the end of the year.

     29.       Plan B, with a projectedcost of $117 million and a completion date in the year 2,000; includes
     complementary works needed to permit prolonged operation of the project at 76 masl, now a likely
     scenario. Given the eariy stage of this Plan, it is difficultto assess progress. The Panel does note,
     however, that major decisions have yet been finalized with regard to wastewater treatment plants in
     Posadas and Encamacion, mitigating the effects of the dam on fisheries, and long-term supplies of
     clay to that major regionalindustry.


AdditionaI Requests

     30.      In May 1997, the Panel received additionalRequestsfrom Argentine citizens allegingdamage
     from the Project. The principal issues raised were the cost of replacement housing, quality of the
     housingand community infrastructure,and the economic plightof the Brickmakers and fishermen.

     31.      Management provideda responseto these new Requests -- included as Attachment A - and
     the Panel, recognizing the organic linkages between the original Request and these new Requests,
     recommended to the Executive Directors that they be treated in the same Report. As a result, the
     presentReportcovers all pending issues on the Argentineand Paraguayansides of the reservoir.



Compliance with Procedures

     32.       Bank environmentaland resettlement procedurescall for continued participationof potentially
     affected peoplefrom the outset. The Panel has found that the process has been neglectedand now is




                                                                                                           9

all but discontinued. Bank supervision will be essential to ensure resumption of the participatory
process.

33.      Despiteextensive but inconsistentsupervisionefforts, the Bank has failed to bring the project
into compliance with relevant Bank policies and procedures due to an ill-conceived Project design in
the first place, compounded by changing standards and regulations over time, EBY bureaucratic
proceduresand lack of financial resources.

34.      Institutional strengthening of executing agencies in the areas of resettlement and
environmentalprotectioncontinuesto be an issuethat needsto be addressed by the Bank

PART 1: PRESENT PROJECT PROBLEMS


1. RESETTLEMENT

Overview
     1.       Resettlementconstitutesthe largestand most complex of the actions requiredto addressthe
    impacts caused by the Yacyretá project. To date, only a fraction of (25%) of the total populationto be
    affected has been resettled. The Request and Management`s Response regarding resettlementhave
    considerably different views on the issues of: lack of institutional capacity of EBY and Government
    agencies to undertakea resettlement program; ineffectivecompensation systems; failure to maintain
    the productivity and standards-of-livingof those relocated; and inadequate resettlement of the Mbya
    indigenouspeople.
    2.        This sectionof the Report is based on interviews with people in the projectarea conducted by
    the Inspectorand a consultantemployed by the Panel.
    3.        People in areas to be resettled were questioned on their status prior to EBY involvement
    and what informationthey had been given about their rights or benefits. A chronology of their cases
    was compiledto determinethe average length of time they had been waiting to be relocatedand what
    negativeeffects the uncertaintiesabout relocationhas had on them. They were also asked to provide
    information on their relationshipwith EBY and with whom they interacted. Other questions included
    their level of satisfactionwith proposed compensation.
    4.        The experience of the resettled population was further assessed through extensive
    interviews..    Resettled individuals are divided into broad categories of urban residential, rural
    inhabitants and brick-makers which reflects the groupings used for the EBY programs of assistance.
    Peoplefrom all categorieson bothsides of the reservoirwere interviewed.. The resettledcommunities
    in Posadas called Villa Lanus(A-32) and Villa Yacyreta (A-I) and the Buena Vista and San Pedro
    neighborhoodson the Encarnación side were visited. The rural settlement of Caraguata, indigenous
    resettlement Pindo, and brick-maker resettlements of Nemesio Parma and El Porvenir (AR.) and San
    Pedro(PY.) were observed and relocated individualsinterviewed.


    5.        There exists a large population not within the EBY 1990 census- called "adicionales" or
    "extra-censales"- which has been or is being relocated in the community of Ita Paso on the
    Paraguayanside. This settlementwas also visited, as was a settlementof EBY compensated but self-
    relocatedbrick-layersin the area of El Porvenir inthe vicinity of Posadas.
    6.        The resettled communities were observed to determine the quality of the infrastructure and
    services, access to cities and relative locationwith respect to previous locations. Questions followed
    similar lines as those for non-relocated individuals: on the quality and level of satisfaction with
    compensation; from where had they been relocated; what kind of on-going assistance if any, had
    they received; and what relationship they had at present with EBY. EBY officials responsible for
    relocationwere also contactedfor detailson the process and their relationshipwith the communities.
    7.        The 1992 Resettlement and Environmental Mitigation Program ("REMP) was reviewed to
    compare activities includedin the present[Bank?] Action Plan with the policyand planningestablished
    in the REMP. The most recent Panel of Experts ("OP) summary (Vil Panel) which provideda status
    reportof the implementationof the REMP programswas also reviewed.

I.2ResettledPopulation
      8.       The resettled population affected by the Yacyreta Dam project encompasses several
     categories of people which are provided assistance by EBY programs based on their presence in the
      plannedflood areaswhen a censuswas taken in 1990, land tenure, and occupation. Those individuals
     that were part of the 1990comprehensive census, those with title to land, and those people who were
     counted and work as brick-makers, are considered for, or entitledto, some level of compensationfrom
      EBY. These are people who are the targets of the Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation(PARR).
     This plan was prepared in 1992 with the assistance of the Bank and is one of the guiding documents
     for the Planof Action (Programa Base) presentlyin placeto consolidatethe 76-78 masl.

     9.        In addition to the resettled population recognized by EBY as their responsibility, there are
     additional families that have moved into the areas. These families have been attended to by the
     governmentagenciesof the two countriesinvolvedin the project. The problem of additionalfamilies is
     serious because the numbers continue to increase and it is now estimated that the additional
     population is of the same order of magnitude as the original populationto be resettledaccordingto the
      1990census.

Paraguayan Side
      I O .    The main resettlement communities on the Paraguayan side of the Parana River are the
     neighborhoodsof Buena Vista and San Pedro. These are urban neighborhoods where families were
     relocatedin houses built by EBY. These houses were provided at no costto the presentoccupants.

Buena Vista
     11.       Complaints center around the quality of some aspects of the houses (electrical, plumbing,
     etc.), and the amount of time EBYtook to respond to their needs. Mosttook possessionapproximately
     4 years ago after waiting many years. Some did not receive prompt compensation for their productive
     infrastructure (store, workshop, etc.) and lost money due to the time lag while replacements were
     constructed (Request paragraphs 32, 33). The owners interviewed did have title to their property and
     were to a large degree satisfied with their houses. Houses have one architectural style but come in
     several differentsizes that are distributedaccording to beneficiaryfamily size.

     12.       The relationship with EBY was regarded as very inadequate. Most of the information they
     receive is by television or radio or visits to EBY offices given the proximity. Several were unsure of
     why they had been compensated first while others stayed behind, includingfamily members who were
     not title holders.

      13.      EBY confirmed that there are 170 unoccupied houses in the Buena Vista neighborhood. It
     was explained that to avoid creating social conflicts the houses are being reserved for similarly
     higher income propertyowners who will be affectedwhen the reservoiris filled to higher mas1levels.
     A large piece of property exists adjacent to the Buena Vista neighborhood also owned by EBY. The
     school appears largeand relativelywell cared for. Most urban servicesseemed to be provided.

San Pedro
      14.      The poor quality of the houses was singled out as one of the primary concerns of lower
      income occupants. Field visits to the neighborhood confirmed the poor quality of the infrastructure.

     After 3 years of occupancy houses showed serious signs of deteriorationand most of the inhabitants
     compared their houses with the ones in Buena Vista neighborhood. Some houses were abandoned
     and had been vandalized. Several people complained about the high costs of services after movingto
     the new neighborhood. The schoolseemed largebut showed some of the sameconstruction problems
     as some of the houses (roofingtiles falling off). Community infrastructuresuch as plazas and soccer
     fields appearunfinished.

      15.      With regard to the relationshipof the community with EBY, people expressed concerns with
     the length of time they have been waiting to receive all of the promised infrastructure and support.
     They regard the EBY with suspicion based on having received little response to their requests and
     unmet promises. Neighbors have now organized themselves into a community group to present
     petitions and improve the quality of their life. Among their requests is a bridge that would link them
     directly to the city (asthey were priorto resettlement) since they presentlyhave only one accessto the
     main highway and those who walk across the Mboi-cae bridge are in serious danger of being hit by
     heavytraffic.

     16.       Many of the interviewed said that their immediate material situation had improved
     substantially. But they found difficulty in re-entering productive economic activities (Request
     paragraphs 29, 32, 33). Several small shop-owners and other service-providers indicated that they
     had lost many clients who were left behind and had a hard time making ends meet. They stated that
     they do not receive support for recomposing their productiveworkspace from EBY. Most felt that the
     brick-makers were privileged and received significant support from EBY for their economic activities
     and they expectedthe same treatment.

San Pedro Brick-makers
     17.       In the area for relocatedbrick-makersthere appeared to be satisfactionwith compensation.
     Mainconcerns were relatedto long-term availabilityof raw material. The present location of the brick-
     makers is on landwithout clay depositsand EBYtransports clay from deposits. Based on suggestions
     by the Bank there seems to be a move towards organizingthe brick-makersand providing them with
     equipmentto transport raw materialto their factories. They are unsure of how this will work out.

     18.       Each beneficiary will receive an allotted amount of clay based on their previous production
     levels. The general view was that those who had received cash compensation for their production
     were in worse shape since many did nothavethe capacityto manageor investtheir money prudently.


Caraguata Rural Resettlement
     19.       The roadsto the Caraguata rural resettlementcommunity are rocky but adequate. The roads
     within the community however seem poorly finished and narrow. The agricultural land is of mixed
     quality, with some families settled on sandy areas more suitable for pasture than agriculture.
     Inhabitants acknowledge having received food assistance and technical assistance for about 20
     months but feel that conditions are very different and that it is difficult to make a living out of
     agriculture underthe new conditions. The new lots are large (7 ha without house or 4 ha with house)
     and ownersexpectto get title.

     20.       Concerns are that on the islandswhere these people previouslylived many animals could be
     maintained on large open expanses which settlers now no longer have, land was exceedingly fertile
     and the humidclimate was idealfor fruit growing, and incomes were typically supplementedby hunting,
     fishing, and honey collection. This diversity of possibilities does not exist in the new resettlements.


                                                                                                         13

       Several also mentioned that the inhabitantsof the community of San Miguel Potrero (also relocated
       islanders) were much worse off since they were about 30 km. inlandfrom the river althoughthey have
       a good outlet for their agriculturalproductionin the town of Coronel Bogado.

       21.      The extent of EBY support at present seems limitedto technical assistancefor productionof
      traditional crops for family consumption and some small sales of excess productionif possible. EBY
      social workers indicated that they are working on aspects of health, education, community
      organization, and relations between neighbors (a problem has arisen from the transition of living on a
      sparsely populatedislandsto living now in close proximity.).

San Cosme
      22.       Houses seemed well built and most lots had small vegetable gardens in a small village of
       relocated fishermen in the town of San Cosme. Those interviewed said that their titles were being
      processed. They generallyhad problems finding work. Onthe islandthey couldcollect honeyand wild
      animals and that input into their incomes was lost now. They denounced illegal fishing by outsiders.
      They feel that islanders should have special access to fisheries but they are harassed by the
      authorities.

Ita Paso
      23.       Ita Paso is a resettlement neighborhood located approximately 8 kilometers outside of the
      city of Encarnación. This area was purchased by the Government of Paraguay (GOP) through the
      Ministry of Public Works and Communication to fulfill the commitment to settle additionalfamilies who
      are not listed in the 1990censusperformed by EBY.

      24.       The settlement is somewhat distant and surrounded by rurallsemi-ruralproperty. No housing
      is provided by EBY or the GOP. Services available include water tanks at several comers of the
      neighborhood which are filled approximately three times per week. Housing consists generally of
      small, wood plank houses constructedby the settlers and outdoor latrines. Most of the lots are about
       12x 30 meters in size and there appear to be many vegetable gardens. Bus services are available. A
      school was establishedin a smalltwo-room house outside the neighborhood. Tent awnings have been
      added to the school to add space. Recently, Paraguayan news publicationshave highlightedthe poor
      conditionsof this schoolfor educatingthe large numberof childrenin the Ita Paso community.

      25.       The people interviewedappeared satisfied to be owning a piece of property no matter what
      the conditions. They are able to make improvements to their housing and have security of tenure
      which they did not have in the Barril Paso neighborhood. Most indicated that they had been small
      farmers who had come from Itapua to the city seeking to improve their economic conditions. Lack of
      work nearby was a problem. The need for improved school and health services was highlighted as
      was the need for running water because the water tanks typically runout of water on the weekends.


Pindo
      26.       The Mbya indigenoussettlement of Pindo is home to approximately 20 families settled there
      after leaving Yacyreta Island in the 1970's. The property was obtained from the National Electric
      Administration(ANDE) by EBY which explains the presence of hightensionwires crossingthe property
      and questionedin the Request (paragraph 35).

      27.       A consultant anthropologisthas recently been hired by EBY to provide a full assessment of
      this settlementand propose solutionsto be funded under the Action Plan. Inthe past EBY support has
      rangedfrom food donations to agriculturalextension services under different Bank loans. A few of the
      members of the group have been supported in their highschooland universitystudies by EBY.

      28.       The present plan will analyze the capacityof the agriculturalsoils this communityis settled on.
      The anthropologist intends to seek alternatives for long-term sustenance through diversification of
      crops and possiblyarts, crafts, and herbal medicines.

      29.       The issue of ancestralterritories and ethnohistoryof this Mbya group is to be included in the
      EBY review. The traditional uses of the forest resources of the region will also be analyzed and the
      results may indicate the adequacy or not of the present solution to support certain aspects of their
      culture, referredto inthe Request.


Argentina Side

Area A-I
      30.       The main problem with this community known as Villa Yacyreta lies in the cost of the houses.
      The owners allege that the costs have been readjustedand the monthly payment is quite high given
      their incomelevels. EBY professionalstaff confirmed that the costs seemed to be high and the owners
      are being offered a deferred payment schedule that allows them to lower the monthly cost to a more
      acceptablelevel.

      31,       Owners are now being asked to title their land at the offices of the EBY notaties. The people
      do not want to sign however for fear of entering into a mortgage that they cannot pay and have their
      houses foreclosed on in the future. This option also requires people to begin paying municipal taxes
      and paymentfor several servicesthat EBY now covers. Little or no informationhas been providedto
      them and EBY officialsdo not seem to have an official planto amelioratethis situation.

      32.       This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the future houses to be provided by EBY will be
      at no cost to those relocatedand one basic model. It is expected that this will cause friction with the
      paying population of homeowners and at the same time the newly relocated may have higher
      expectations for their housing after seeing the quality of the previous resettlements. It is not clear at
      presenthow this situationwill be addressed. However EBYseems to be analyzingalternatives.


Area A3-2
      33.       This neighborhood is a newer settlement which has not been fully finished for a variety of
      reasons. Infrastructuresuch as the school and recreationalcenter have not been completed due to
      what seemto be contractualproblems with the constructionfirm.

      34.       Water services are said to be insufficientfor the number of people living there and a police
      station is not available yet. The neighborhood does have sewage collection and treatment in large
      settling ponds east of the city of Posadas. Houses have different layouts and the occupants pay for
      their housesat ratesset by EBY butwith options based on their payment capacity.

      35.       Several people here mentioned that they relied on day jobs to survive and the distance from
      the city and cost of transportationwere burdens that they did not have to bear previously. Many jobs
      were said to be lost in the brick-making industry. Payment for the houses was becoming difficult
      because the houses were re-appraised recently and people were being pressuredto sign titles with
      mortgageclauses,causingsome fear.

      36.       EBY has announced publicly that it is in process of solving the problem of unfinished
      infrastructure. The Action Plan includes the construction of new housing (approximately 500) to
      resettlethe remainingpopulationlocated between 76 and 78 masl.


El Porvenir Brick-makers
      37.       The settlementof El Porvenir is comprised of brick-makers from the Zaiman Stream area who
      receivedcompensationin cash from EBY and relocatedthemselves on an area with clay to the south-
      east of Posadas. EBY is supposed to provide some infrastructuresuch as access roadsand water that
      they have not receivedyet.

      38.       These brick-makersindicatedthat the Nemesio-Parma brick-makersettlementhas a problem
      with accessto clay. Only some of those relocated at that settlement have clay on their property. They
      prefer El Porvenirsince all propertieshave clay-even though the clay is not as good in quality-and it is
      closer to the city.

      39.       This settlement seems to have adapted best to resettlement, possibly because they picked
      the area themselves and also received cash to begin their activities at the same time. Some
      complained that the time before they received their compensation was extended and caused delays
      and hardshipsduringtheir resettlement. It has taken two years to regainprior levelsof production.

      40.       Biologistsat UNAM highlighted this site as containing many importantplant species, including
      some endemic ones, and were worried about the impacts of the settlement.

Nemesio Parma Brick-makers
      41.       The Nemesio-Parma settlement is located several kilometersoutside of Posadas, to the West
      of the city. The settlement was established for a large group of brick-makers (94) relocated from
      different areas. The brick-makersare in the processof creating and consolidatingan Associationwith
      the support of EBY social workers and programs. The Association was formed partially as a result of
      Bank oversight. The Association is neededto help solve the issue of unequal accessto clay deposits
      in the settlement. Only 45% of those resettledhavedirect access to clay deposits.

      42.       The oleros (brick-makers) indicated that they were originally unhappy with the choice of
      property for the settlement. EBY followed the recommendations of the Mines and Geology Ministry
      which indicatedthat the claywas adequate for brick-making. The oleros havespecific requirementsfor
      their clay because of the rudimentary techniques they use. They indicated that the clay on this
      settlement was known by the oleros to be inadequate and they protested but eventually moved
      because no other options were available to them. Areas west of the zone of Nemesio are more
      adequatefor their needs and they hope that in the future, when the Associationis financially stronger,
      they may buy other clay deposits.

      43.       The oleros would like to modernize their production. However many factors conspire against
      this such as the high cost of production relative to Paraguayan brick, and a factory which would be

      quite costly. EBY intendsto provide machinery to the Association to distributeclay to the oleros. It is
      not clear what will happen if certain oleros are not a part of the Associationor if internal political issues
      break down an equitableclay distributionsystem. The Bank anticipatesthat at least 70% of the oleros
      willjoin the association. There may be no other choicefor those without clay deposits.

      44.       The Action Plan has programs to continue assisting the Nemesio-Parma oleros with a
      $250,000 budget for 1997. It is unclear if the assistance will continue over a longer period of time if
      necessary to ensure the economic sustainability of this settlement. Several activities were under
      implementation such as installation of a water system and construction of houses for extra-census
      oleros. The assistance by the social workers seems to emphasize strengtheningof the Association
      and appeared quite participatory. Approximately 5 to 6 general assemblies of the Association were
      scheduledfor the year. Participationof oleros in the assembly taking place at the time of the visit was
      high.


I .3 Future Resettlements
                The number of people included in the 1990 census is far below the total numberof people in
      the areas. EBY personnel estimate that the number on the Argentina side outside of the census is
      larger than those that have been counted. Problems have also arisen now that many of the EBY
      beneficiary families now have grown children that have families of their own living on their parents'
      property. These people are not counted as beneficiaries and can be expected to become a growing
      problem as resettlement activities advance with the Action Plan and peoples' expectations rise.
      Several complaintswere heard about the inaccuraciesof the census in 1990, particularlyfrom people
      who had moved out of the areas canvassed because of floods that year and did not move back in time
      to be counted. EBY social workers agreed that the census has errors and areas had even been left
      out.

      45.       In general, the people interviewed about future relocation said that relocation delays have
      been most damaging, particularlyfor those in the 76-78 mas1interval. These people do not move out
      because they understand that if they do they lose their rights to be compensated and therefore
      continue to live in very unsanitary conditions. On both sides of the river the lack of support and
      investmentby city and provincialservices was evident in areas to be flooded.

      46.       Most of those interviewed did not have much knowledge about the resettlement process,
      thoughthey generallyknew what rightsthey had. They could not mentionany particularmechanismof
      communicationthat the EBY had set upfor consultationon the places to which they would be relocated
      or the conditions they were to expect in the new areas. Several described situations in which their
      (now) grown children who were included in the earlier EBY census will not be able to move with them
      since they have subsequently married. This is a specialcategory of people who are part of the census
      but get no compensationfor their lossof housing.

      47.       It is evident that confidence in EBY by people to be relocatedhas deterioratedto the point of
      complete disbelief. EBY social workers acknowledge this. The type of work these social workers can
      do is largely limited to informing people of whether they have a right to compensation. Presentlyon
      the Posadasside there has been some work by EBY in trying to ensure communityorganizationwhich
      would allow peopleto petitionservicesfrom the government offices in the face of uncertaintime frames
      for relocation. On the Paraguayan side the socialworkers' work in urbanareas seems to be limited to
      providinginformationaboutthe status of beneficiaries.

    48.      Data is collected monthly on the Argentina side and reviewed to provide modificationsin the
    programscarried out by the social work team. People on the Posadas side also seemed to be more
    aware of the location of neighborhood offices and could identify the social workers.             On the
    Paraguayanside this was notthe case. No similarquantitativedata was providedfor that side and the
    general feeling of EBY personnel was that the work was somewhat less flexible and adaptable,
    relying strictly on the PARR. Most affected people could identify only the head of the resettlement
    program or the Directorof EBY in Encarnación.

    49.      EBY social workers did feel that they would need to increase personnel and resourcesonce
    shifting people began. Presentlythey have approximately 28 people on each side, one vehicle and
    three computersat their disposalwhich they feel is insufficientfor the number of people they serve.

7.4Review of BY Consultant Report
    50.      The independent consultant report that evaluates the PARR-mentioned in the Management
    Response to the Request-was prepared in 1995 by two consultants who now are members of the
    Expert Panel on Resettlement. They provided a five volume evaluationwhich covers the rural, brick-
    maker, and urbanresettlementson bothsides of the Parana River.

    51.      The objective of the study is to evaluatethe "pertinence, efficiency, efficacy, and impacts'' of
    the PARR. With respectto the objectivesof the PARR and the programs adopted to deal with them
    the study indicates a relatively good correlation in the urban programs. However the rural and peri-
    urban methods and programs do not adequately respondto the stated objectivesof the PARR.


    52.      The report states that the group of pen-urban (mostly islanders and oleros) and rural
    inhabitantswas not well analyzed beforethe rise in water level to 76 mas1possibly because , among
    other reasons, EBY was restructuringits SocialWelfare Department. The populationwas not studied
    well and alternatives based on the aspirationsand profile of the affected families before the flooding
    were not analyzed in depth. These groups are also characterized by weak or non-existentcommunity
    organizations, unlike the urban inhabitants. This meant that their needs were relegated to second
    place while the approach of the reservoirflooding prompted protests and waves of negotiationsin the
    urbanareas.


    53.      Conclusions regarding the urban resettlements indicatethat the "product" is adequate based
    on the objectives of the REMP. However, the study criticizesthe processthrough which the solutions
    were reached. The results in terms of physical infrastructure are satisfactory and recuperation of
    economic activities is progressing favorably. It points out though that those groups that were most
    affected are the ones least able to cope with loss of income. Problems include restructuring and
    relocation of the brick-making industry, inflation, and declines in small commercial activity in the port
    area of the city.


    54.      The San Pedro resettlementwas particularlyimpacted in this respect accordingto the study.
    The costs of transportationand improved infrastructurehave caused a significantincreasein expenses
    for householdmaintenanceand food.
    55.      Another impact criticized was the mode of compensation implemented in Posadas. The fact
    that payments have been made by those relocated has changed the compensatory nature of the
    relocations. For newly resettledfamiliesa standard size house will be providedat no cost. The study

       predicted conflicts based on these inequalities in solutions and recommended that EBY forgive the
       debts of the already relocatedfamilies. The experts recognized that this does not solve the conflicts
       but levelsthe playingfield by making all those relocatednon-paying.


       56.      The study's major conclusion on brick-makers indicatesthat the relocationand resumptionof
       productiveactivities were seriously delayed, especially in Argentina. At the time of the study in 1995
       the pre-conditionsfor productionhad not yet been achieved. The major positive aspect observed by
       the study was in the high level of housing infrastructurethat has been provided for those relocated
       (including"extra-censales").



I . 5 Other Resettlement Issues

Participation
       57.      The levels of participationidentifiedand confirmed by affected parties varies significantly on
       each side of the Parana and withinthe relocationprogramsthemselves.

       58.      The REMP calls for a continual process of participation throughout the design and
       implementationof the relocation activities. This process was observed being implemented by EBY
       only with the Nemesio-Parma brick-layers-although other instancesmay exist. Solutionsappearto be
       negotiatedto a degree but primarilyin the rush of completion or fulfillmentof deadlinesratherthan in a
       well thought out participatoryapproach. The Action Plan calls for mainly "informational"type activities
       in regardto future resettlement.


Income Generating Activities
       59.      Although the independent consultants study indicates successful recovery of income
       generation in resettled urban communities, to maintainthe material improvements for most of those
       relocated requiresan increase in income for others as well. This aspect does not seem to have been
       contemplatedby any particular EBY program (exceptfor brick-makers and restrictedto owners) and
       is an important limitingfactor affecting many already relocatedas well as those to be relocated in the
       future. This is particularly evident in the San Pedro neighborhood in Paraguay and in A3-2 in
       Argentina. Future relocationsshould take this issue intoconsideration.


Outreach
       60.      There appears to be an intensivepublic relationscampaign on TV and radio. This campaign
       emphasizes the benefits that the Yacyretá Dam Project is having on communities, the environment,
       fishermen, and brick-layersin the zone of influence.

       61.      Most peopleinterviewedreacted negatively to these campaigns, particularlythe ones affected
       by the dam and who had been waiting for some time to receivecompensation. The REMP indicated in
       1992, in its "lessons learned" section, the need to avoid creating false expectations in the population
       through propaganda and institutional messages.          It specifically recommended avoiding these
       messages in the future. Outreach and public relations are not discussed in the recent reviews of the
       REMP.

7.6Findings
     62.       Information gathered shows that there has been monitoring and oversight of the programs
     implemented, primarily through POE visits and the presence of a Resettlement Coordinator working
     closely with the social workers on both sides of the Parana. Review of the original 1992 REMP
     (previously know as the PARWPMMA) revealed that it addressed most of the issues included in the
     Request, including the need for ongoing participation, the dynamic nature of the population to be
     resettledand the need to reevaluatethe beneficiarypopulation, and the negativeimpactsof prolonging
     resettlement.

     63.       The main issues of concern revolvearound the length of time taken for the implementationof
     the REMP programswhich has led to a significant breakdown in community relations. Compounding
     this is a weak program of social communication caused to a great extent by the lack of information
     available to ground teams of EBY to provide to the populace. Fragmentation of the community
     framework by transferring people by successive flood levels rather than seeking to maintain social
     structure has also caused significant stress and hardship on the resettledcommunities. This fact was
     emphasized particularlyby EBY resettlement workers and officials as a majorobstacleto successfully
     carrying out their tasks. This fact has also been highlightedby the most recent POE meeting in May of
     1997. Definitionis needed on the entirecommunities that are to be affected(78 and above), if they are
     to ultimately be moved.

     64.       The fragility of the models selected for rehabilitationof certaingroups is also of concern. The
     fishermen and island inhabitants seem to have a particular vulnerability given the radical change in
     lifestyle and the assumption that they can be productive in other environments. Previously they
     benefited from a diversity of wildlife, crops, and good soils that are not available to them in their
     present situation. Now the reality seems to be that they were placed into an urban commerce
     environment around Encarnación, San Cosme, Carmen del Parana, and Ayolas, on the Paraguayan
     side.

     65.       The impact of the relocation on certain segments of the San Pedro neighborhood
     (Encarnación), as highlighted in the Request, seems to be confirmed by this review and the
     independent consultant studies. Adverse affects on their incomes from the increased cost of
     transportationand changes in the brick-making industry have not been analyzed and programs based
     on such analysesdevelopedto consolidate this relocationeffort. [Analyze the issue of incomeand job
     lossinSan Pedroand design support programswhere pertinent.}

     66.       In Posadas, there are no plans for the solution of conflicts that may arise due to the
     differentiated housing between future and former resettledcommunities (¡.e. new housescome in one
     size while older houses come in various sizes). Bid documents have already been distributedfor the
     unique style housing solution to be constructedwhich negates the possibility of substantially altering
     this type of solution as alluded to in the Independent study. However, as outlined in Part 3 of this
     review, considerable progress has been made with the decision to reduce the cost of housing to all
     Argentinebeneficiaries,and reduce it by 90% for those who cannot pay.

     67.       On both sides of the river, the solution of organizing the brick-makers into associations and
     cooperativeswill need a long period of support by EBY or other groups. These types of organizations
     have significant internalpolitical issuesto overcome in many instancesand lack strong administrations
     without support programs such as the ones EBY is providing. Longer term support for the brick-maker

  settlements of Nemesio-Parma and San Pedro is needed to consolidate their organizations and
  promoteself-sufficiency.


2. WATER QUALITY

2.1         Overview
  Specific issues raised in the Request include the presence of submerged vegetation that was not
  removed which could negativelyaffect water quality (paragraphs 38,43,44,45) and movementof water
  in the lake(44); effects on the water table and hydrogeology(46); and water quality as a factor in the
  increaseof water-borne diseases(34).

  68.       A survey of the sanitary conditionsof lateral bays of the cities of Encarnaciónand Posadas
  was carriedout to assess the present and potentialeffectson the populationsof these cities. Meetings
  were also held with personnel of the EBY Environmental Department to clariw issues raised by the
  Requesters and to inquire about the water quality monitoring system presently in-place, or if such a
  programexisted.

  69.       The areas visited included the major streams affected near the cities of Encarnación and
  Posadas, the Quiteria and Mboi-cae on the Paraguayan side and the Zaiman and Martires in
  Argentina. Other smaller streams crossing the city, particularlyin Posadas were also observed. Field
  visits to the west of Encarnación in the cities of Carmen del Parana and San Cosme provided
  informationon the Tacuary Stream and Aguapey Stream.

  70.       After a visual inspection, water samples were taken at the largerstreams in Encarnaciónand
  Posadas. Six samples were taken includingone blank sample as a lab control. These samples were
  taken only to provide confirmationof complaints by neighbors and EBYs own water quality analyses
  and providea "snapshot"of the overall conditionsof the streams. Finally, a review of documents and
  sampledata providedby EBYwere analyzed and reviewed for adequacy and comprehensiveness.


2.2         Vegetation
  71.       The Request makes specific references to the impact of emergent and submerged vegetation
  that was not removed prior to filling at 76 masl. Specific concerns are that the vegetation would
  provide conditions for growth of aquatic weeds, decrease water circulation and inhibit oxygen
  distributionamong others (paragraphs 38,43,44,45).

  72.       The 1992 Environmental Assessment ("EA) states, regarding vegetation removal, the need
  for studies to determine the priority areas for deforestationor clearing for the purpose of preventing
  anaerobic conditions caused by decomposition of rotting organic matter. "Given the cost of the
  deforestation, it is necessary to perform in-depthstudies that permit the definition of specific areas for
  biomass removal". Problem areas were identified in the EA includingthe areas around the floodplain
  of Ombu Stream, Yacarey Stream, and Rincon Santa Maria, Isla Talavera and the center of Yacyreta
  Island.

  73.       Review of documentation provided by EBY indicates that there were unforeseen problems
  with organic matter from wetlands on the flooded island of Yacyretá that loosened from the sandy
  substrateof the islandand floated towards the dam causing problems for the generationof electricity in

       December 1994. These large floating mats of vegetation are being diverted by a private contractor to
       the Ana Cua branchspillway.There is some concern that this method of disposalcould pose problems
       with the quality of potable water in the Paraguayan city of Ayolas. Interviewswith members of the
       contractor team indicated that they were towing the islands in the direction of the right side of the
       Parana, in small inlets, and allowing the wind and waves to break them up. This is a recurringproblem
       of considerable magnitude that should be included specifically in operating costs as well as with
       respectto environmentalimpactsand the Ana Cua branch solution.


Paraguayside
       74.       General conditions on the coast near the city of Encarnación indicated that vegetation had
       been removed prior to the filling to a large extent. Some small patches of emergent or rotting
       vegetation along the Parana River coast were observed from the area between the Mboi-cae and

       been cleared up to the Tacuary Stream approximately. No large stagnant water areas or masses of
       Quiteria streams and the area up to Isla del Medio. Localfisherman indicatedthat the vegetation had

       floating vegetation were observed growing on the Parana River. Many recreationaland professional
       fishermanwere noted along the coast and in canoes.

Arroyo Mboi-cae
       75.       An important area where submerged vegetation was observed was at the entrance of the
       Mboi-cae. Rotting vegetation, some slightly higher areas with live vegetation, and areas of attached
       macrophytes have created some miniature bays or enclosures of water around the mouth of this
       stream. In these bays along the side of the stream are large quantities of floating aquatic weeds.
       Movement of the water was observed superficially to be inland from the river with little removal of
       weeds and floating matter on the bay. Heavy rains produced some flushing of floating vegetationand
       solids and some accumulation in sides of enclosed areas of baylets.


Arroyo Quiteria
       76.       This stream presented no major areas of submerged vegetation. This stream has a wider
       low-lyinggrassy floodplain used as animal pasture and some evidence of rice growing. Some smaller
       areas of floating aquatic vegetation are dominated primarily by "camalotes" (water hyacinth). There
       appeared to be no dying or dead fish to indicateanoxic conditions in the bay. The areas immediately
      surroundingthis stream are somewhat more uninhabited than other urban streams observed.

Carmen del Paranáand San Cocme ¿?Damian
       77.       The margins of the town of Carmen del Parana showed signs of having vegetationremoved.
      Ybycui island inthe Parana River had largeareas of emergent rottingvegetation. The port area of this
       town had some vegetation impeding easy access to Parana River. From the town of San Cosme
       vegetation around the Yacyretá Islandwas clearlyvisible.

       78.       Representativesof the local government and a rural inhabitantof Carmen del Parana alleged
       that EBY showed Bank teams a site specifically prepared for the occasion which did not reflect the
       true extent of vegetation removal which was far less than scheduled.. These representatives also
       indicatedthat the town of Coronel Bogado had already spent substantialresources of their own budget
       on removing vegetationwhich had been adversely affecting their tourist sport-fishing industry. They
       feel that there is an increaseinthe mosquito and bat populationsince the reservoirwas filled.

       79.     The Mayor and City Council of San Cosme allege that the vegetation removal process is
       incomplete and that large tires had been burned by EBY on the Island of Yacyretá and the banks to
       make it look to the Bank representatives over-flying the area as though vegetation removal activities
       were beingcarried-out.


Argentina Side
       80.     The coast along the Argentina side of the Paraná River has a steeper drop than along the
       Paraguay side and less vegetation was noted there. This bank also presents more human alteration
       and ongoing development of the waterfront from Posadas moving west to the mouth of the Martires
       stream, as evidencedby the many recreationalclubs and housing developments.


Arroyo Martires
       81.     This stream has a long parallel line of submerged and semi-submerged vegetationalong the
      entire mouth of the bay. Significantquantitiesof attached and floating aquatic vegetation are growing
      in the more stagnantareas. The area was also visitedfor sampling after a heavy rainstormand did not
      present the flushing phenomenon observed in some of the other streams and bays. Significant
      amounts of floating vegetationremained even afterthe rainstorms. Littlewater movement was noted.

Rincon Santa Maria
      82.      From the coast of the Santa Maria Reserve, general observations were made of the water
      quality and presenceof aquatic vegetation. No extensive areas of submerged vegetation were noted,
      nor extensive floating masses of vegetation. No dead fish, foul odors, or other indicatorsof anaerobic
      conditionswere detected.


    2.3        EBY Monitoring Program
      83.      A summary of EBY's water quality monitoring results indicate that there are three major
      impacts on water quality as a result of Yacyreta Dam. The first is the gas super-saturation
      phenomenon which caused large fish kills in August and October of 1994. The second is the
      appearance of largefloating masses of vegetation coming from the wetlands on the submerged island
      of Yacyreta posinga threat to the dam turbines and quality of water for the city of Ayolas downstream.
      The third impact is the decline in water quality in the urban stagnantareas created in the floodplains of
      streamssuch as the MartiresStream.

      84.      The program carried out by EBY is a joint program between the Paraguayan and Argentina
      side. Activities of the Environment Department are coordinated primarilyout of the offices in the towns
      of Ayolas and Ituzaingo.

      85.      The watershed above Yacyretá Dam is over 1 million km2 and over 50 dams exist within the
       Parana basin. Yacyretá is not the only factor affecting hydrology downstream and in the reservoir.
       Data on historical levels of the river indicatethat floods of up to the 80 mas1level have occurred with
      some frequency. The new EBY budgets and programming (Plan Base) provide mathematicalmodels
      capableof indicatingproblem areas in the reservoirand assisting in the management of water quality.

       86.     EBY indicatesthat removal of vegetation in the area was carried out based on mathematical
       modeling done by EBY to indicate areas of water movement, thermal stratification and oxygen

  response to the filling of the reservoir. The Department has prepared a table of average flow and
  retention times in the reservoir which indicate that average flow is more similar to a lotic (flowing)
  system ratherthan a lentic (lake) system. It was not clear if the flow continued to be monitoredin the
  field as part of their normal data collection. It was indicated however, that the present water quality
  monitoringstations had been locatedin important areas they thought could be problematicdue to lower
  water flows.

  87.      Water quality has been monitored since 1993 through agreements with the University of
  Misiones, CERIDE of Cordoba, and the National University of Asuncion (FACEN). These higher
  education institutions were asked to perform the studies because they are considered capable of
  providing an independent assessment of water quality and permit training of qualified local human
  resources.

  88.      A baseline study was performed in 1993 which indicated high levels of contamination of
  bacterial origin around the cities of Posadas and Encarnación which exceeded PAHO health
  standards. Measurements have been made continuouslysince that time. Water quality is monitored
  along the river above Posadas from the city of Puerto Yguazu. A map was presentedto indicate the
  number of monitoring stations and data provided as evidence from a number of these stations on
  oxygen concentrations and other            parameters.       Sampling is     performed   monthly for
  physicallchemicallbacteriologicalparameters and every three months for pesticidesand heavy metals.
  A more refined monitoring program is included within the Master Plan for Encarnación to be
  implemented under the Action Plan. This is necessary because present monitoring systems were
  designed to address overall quality in the reservoirand not with the purpose of assessing risks to the
  urban population.

  89.      EBY believesthat water quality has not declinedsignificantlythanks primarilyto the significant
  flow of water through the reservoir. Problems however exist in regard to the people in contact with the
  rising waters and water tables which will be improved through the relocation efforts and the
  implementationof the complementary works to be constructed in the cities adjacent to the reservoirs.
  They do expect problems such as eutrophicationin the bays in the future due to heavy phosphorus
  loads and higher retentiontimes. Water table changes have also been anticipated in the preparation
  of Terms of References for these studies (See 2.5 below).

  90.      EBY professionalshighlighted the fact that they have the capacity to respond to impacts not
  contemplated in the EA and other studies. They feel they have been able to effectively alter the
  operations of the dam spillways to solve the fish-kill problem and have contractedfor the removal of
  floating vegetation. Ongoing experiments and studies are being carried out with the Universidad
  Nacionaldel Nordeste of Corrientes, on the effectsof gas super-saturation. These studies will provide
  monitoringmethods to detect problems and guide dam operations in the future.


2.4        Sample Analyses
  91.      Samples were taken in the main streams of Encarnacion and Posadas to confirm data
  presented by EBY. Five samples were taken in total. Sampling was performed in areas with easy
  access and which would demonstrate to the greatestextent, the impact of urbanlsuburbandischarges
  to the system. Samples were taken on May 20, 1997, as indicated below :
  Number Location
  Q-1                Arroyo Quiteria
  MC-1               Arroyo MboiCae

 QC-1                Blank sample
 z-1                 Arroyo Zaiman
 M-1                 Arroyo Martires(sidestream)
 M-2                 Arroyo Martires

 Samples were sent to Asuncion for analysis at a local private laboratory. Parameters analyzedfor are
 BOD, COD, pH, and phosphorus. Labs were not able to provide fecal coliform analysis however, they
 indicate that Ammonia analysis is a good surrogate measure. The analyses performed confirm
 findings of previous analyses in these urban streams and follow patterns expected given the
 contaminantloadingthey receivefrom each watershed.

 92.       The Paraguayan bank streams indicate higher levels overall for Biochemical Oxygen
 Demand, Ammonia, Phosphorus, and Suspended Solids. These streams receive high loads of
 contaminants from urban settlements, a garbage dump, and a slaughterhouse. Ammonia levels are
 particularly high in the Mboi-Cae Stream adjacent to the slaughterhouse. The continued operation of
 the Encarnarción slaughterhouse with raw discharge into the reservoir in one of the most flagrant
 violations to environmental and health standards yet there is still no plan for its relocation or other
 permanentsolution.

 93.       The Argentina side streams show the highest values in the Zaiman Stream which also
 receives slaughterhouse effluents and has the Posadas municipal garbage dump located in its
 watershed (as indicatedby EBY technical staff). The MartiresStream, located on the Western side of
 Posadas, indicates higher values at the Rowing Club (near its confluence with the Parana) after it
 receivessubstantialcontaminantloadingfrom largehousing settlements.
2.5        Water Table
 94.       The Request highlights the impacts of the dam on the hydrogeology within its zone of
 influence (paragraphs30 and 46). These sections call for studies on the effects on the water table in
 the urbanareas and along the tight bank (potentiallyproduced by the bentonitewall underthe dam).

 95.       The EA of the Yacyretá II Hydroelectric Project (1992) mentions ground waters only briefly
 (three paragraphs) in generalterms. The study highlightsthat the increasein the reservoircan impact
 undergroundwaters by connectingaquifers and cause the water table to rise. Problemsmay occur in
 urban and rural areas causingthe formation of swamps, salinizationof soils and provideconditionsfor
 disease vectors to spread. However, no comprehensive studies have been carried out to measure
 long-termimpactsand changes in soil characteristics.

 96.       The issue of groundwater quality and the rising water table was brought up on both sides of
 the river by inhabitants,representativesof local groups and EBY social workers. Inhabitants pointed
 out that their latrines have been flooded in large part with the rise of waters to the 76 masl. Absorptive
 capacityof the land has also decreased and post-flooddryingof the areas takes much longer.

 97.       In the town of Carmen del Parana the rising water table is of particularconcern to the Mayor
 and individualsinterviewed, since there the water table is very shalloweven at the highest levels (avg.
 1 to 3 meters below surface) They feel that even raising the level to 78 mas1could create a great
 problem.

     98.       The situation of underground water flow and water table levels in the area of influence of the
     Yacyreta dam has to date not been the subject of an objective scientific study according to EBY
     officials.

     99.       EBY officials indicated that they have distributed the bid documents for the initial
     hydrogeologicalstudies. At the time of this Report the final bids should have been received. However,
     these studies seemto be limitedto the urbanareas and have a budgetof $534,840 in accordancewith
     the Action Planfunded under Bank Loan 2854. This is clearly insufficientand Management is urgedto
     develop a GIS-based monitoringsystem to correlateall data on a reservoirwide scale.


   2.6         Wafer Qualify and Disease
     100.      The issue of water quality as a factor in increasingthe incidenceof water-borne diseases is
     included in the Request. (paragraph 34).       From an epidemiological point of view it is analyzed in
     section 3 below.

     101.      The analyses performed, in addition to the reports reviewed at EBY, indicate that a
     contamination problem existed in the urban areas of Posadas and Encarnación before the reservoir.
     Water quality monitoring has been performed by different consulting firms contracted by EBY since
     1980. The information shows high levels (above acceptable limits for potable water use) of fecal
     coliforms around the Posadas coastline and somewhat lower levels in the Encarnación area (with the
     exception of the Mboi-caeStream areas). The human settlements in proximity or direct contact with
     the banks of the Parana river and adjacent urban streams are presently (and have been for some
     time) at high risk for water-borne disease.

     102.      The EBY summary of water quality effects of the reservoirindicatesthat one of its impacts is
     the formation of stagnant bays in the floodplainsof urban streams and a subsequent decline in water
     quality, especially the dissolved oxygen and pH levels, resulting in more unfavorable conditions for
     humansin these areas than had already existeddue to urban contamination.

     103.      The Action Plan presentlybeing implemented by EBY includesseveralactions to addressthe
     existing and potential problems that may arise due to these conditions. Among the actions being
     carried out underthis plan are:

     0    Closureof the MunicipalSlaughterhouse of Encarnación.
     0    Wastewatercollectionand treatment systems for Encarnación and Posadas.
     0    Cleaningand de-populatingthe coastlineand closureof latrinesup to the 78 masl.
     0    Continuethe Ministryof Health cooperative agreements to support public health.
     0    Preparationof an EmergencyAction Plan for Floods.
     0    Preparationof industrialwaste guidelines.
     0    Diseasevector monitoring.

Eachof these actions should be monitoredclosely.

   2.7         Ana Cua Branch
     104.      The effects of the Yacyreta dam on the Ana Cua Branch of the Parana Rivercomprise issues
     related to biodiversity,water quality, and fisheries. The Request makes specific allegations regarding
     this part of the river in paragraphs 38,40-42. Specificallyit refers to effectsof the drying of the branch
     for long periods during lower flows in the Parana and to statements the Requesters have received

  from the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank ("IDB")and EBY that the mitigationprograms would not be
  implemented.

  105.        Management Responseto these claims states that programs exist to:
        constructmini-damsdownstream from the spillway;
  0     monitorwater qualityand effectson flora and fauna;
        design "ecological"operating guidelines;
  0     relocatewater and sanitationinfrastructurefor Ayolas;
  0     control illegalfishing; and
  0     providefor community fisheriesprograms.

  106.       The POE in its most recent review analyzes the possible alternatives for the branch and
  agrees with the implementation of the mini-dams. It indicates that this solution presents some
  problems regardingcommercial and sport fishing, fish migration, and possible increase in vegetation
  growth and presenceof disease vectors. This appears to be correct based on interviews, analysis of
  the Action Plan, and discussion with Bank staff. Presently SI4 million is budgeted for the construction
  of the mini-dams and complementary works. It is not clear how the mitigation measures are to be
  carried out, or whether they are being planned with participationof the affected parties, especially the
  fishermenof the Ayolas area.

  107.       The proposed mini-dam solution to the Ana Cua branch requires proper environmental
  assessment and close coordination with operation of the reservoir. It is bound to have significant
  ecological impactssince it would change a free-flowing riverwith 3 mini-reservoirs. Impactson fishing
  are also likely to be significant.


2.8          Encarnacion TreatmentPlant
  108.       A reviewof the proposed wastewater treatment plant was requested by the Panel becauseof
  allegations in the Request (paragraph 34) of detrimental environmental health conditions presently
  prevailing in several riverside communities of Encarnación as well as specific claims made by these
  neighborhoodsdirectlyto the Panel.

  109.       The Master Plan for Encarnación, prepared by EBY as part of the mitigation measures for
  filling of the reservoircreation includesthe expansion of the sewage collection system of the city and
  the treatmentof wastes in a plant planned for constructioninthe vicinity of the QuiteriaStream.

  110.       The planned treatment for the wastewater involves a series of anaerobic and facultative
  lagoonsto degradethe organic wastes. The system was originally proposed in 1993 and the final plan
  impact statement was presented in 1996 for approval by the MAG authorities. Final approval of the
  EIA was granted in October 1996. In the approval decree, the MAG requires EBY to minimize the
  impactson human settlementsand provide for a 200 meter bufferzone around the plant.

  111.       Beginningin 1995the neighborhood commission of BarrioNueva Esperanza has campaigned
  actively againstthe establishmentof this treatment plant. The commission alleges potentialimpactson
  health, tourism, environment,and recreationand has requested revisionsof these plans including the
  relocationof the proposed plant.

  112.        The EBY coordinatorfor the urban sanitationworks, and IDB officials indicatedthat the final
  design of the proposedtreatment plantwas going to be fully reviewed and alternativespresentedby an


                                                                                                       27

  independentconsultantchosenby the Municipalityand community groups. The final options for design
  and relocationwill be decidedbased on consultationwith the Municipalityand public hearings.

2.9          Findings
  113.       Based on the information gathered, review of existing documentation, and interviews with
  professionalsin EBY, universities,and private consulting firms, the Water Quality MonitoringProgram
  being implementedis providingadequate data on the evolutionof the reservoir, provides information
  for the actual management of the Yacyreta dam and guidance for implementationof the mitigation
  programs. However, more specificallytargeted data is required to assess risks to the population living
  near the stagnantlateral bays in urban areas.

  114.       Areas that may be strengthened or could benefit from further evaluation (especially to
  determine if the magnitudeof the efforts proposed in the Action Plan are enough) include:

  Hydrogeology: The present scope of the hydrogeological studies, which are about two years
  overdue, seems to be limited to the urban areas around Encarnación and Posadas and does not
  providea regionaloverviewof the effectsof the reservoirto permit mitigationof negativeeffectswhere
  necessary.
  Vegetation removal: The Mboi-Cae and Martires Stream sub-reservoirsmay benefit from improved
  vegetation monitoringlremovalprograms. Even with the improvements in wastewater treatment, there
  will still be significant nutrientloadingfrom urban runoff and retentiontimes will increaseas water level
  rises. It was unclearfrom the interviews and EBY documentation, to what extent vegetationremovalin
  these areas is contemplatedin the Action Plan.
  Reservoir Management:EBY personnel seem to be promoting a more integratedapproach to water
  quality management(andfisheries use)and this has beendemonstrated through efforts in establishing
  watershedmanagement guidelinesand legislation. EBY is reluctant though to take a leadershiprole in
  this processand is lookingto entities such as the Comision Mixta Paraguay-Parana (COMIP) to do so.
  However, given the realitythat the Entity is the largest water user and one of the financiallystrongest in
  terms of environmentalfunding (ascompared to localand nationalgovernment agencieslocatedwithin
  the watersheds), it is seen as the leader in this respect and might inevitably activate more discussion
  and implementationof policyfor sustainable managementof the dam zone of influence.
  Ana Cua Branch: Provisionfor participatoryplanning mechanisms- needed to mitigate the some of
  the social impacts highlightedin the POE review and other analyses-should be included in the design
  and implementationof the Ana Cua Branch mini-dam projects. .

3. EPIDEMIOLOGY
3.1 Overview
     115.     The Request refers to health and epidemiology issues in paragraphs 30,34, and 51. The
     impacts stated are: effects from contaminated wells and filled latrines; potential for increase in water-
     borne diseases such as diarrhea, anemia and parasiticdiseases; complaints by affected populationof
     fevers; inadequate healthcenter attention; and impoverished nutritiondue to adverse impacts on fish
     resources.

     116.     The EA indicates the presence of numerous water-borne diseases in the area prior to filling
     the reservoir. These includediarrhea, cholera, parasites, malaria, and typhoid. At the 76 mas1the EA
     does not predict major impacts on human health. Potential impacts include schistosomiasis, and
     malaria. Maximum potentialfor health impactsis predicted for higher levels of the reservoir,especially
     in the urbanand suburban areas.

     117.     Epidemiologicalinformationwas gathered through interviews with Ministry of Health officials
     on the Paraguayan side, on the Posadas side with EBY representatives from the Social and
     EnvironmentalDepartments along with professionals in epidemiology from the Ministryof Healthof the
     Provinceof Misiones.

3.2Paraguay
     118.     The Ministry of Health of Paraguay (MHP) collaborates with EBY through a cooperative
     agreement with the objective of monitoring health and epidemiologicaldata and to introduce specific
     programs to stem the increase of water related diseases such as diarrhea, parasitic infections, and
     malaria.

     119.     MHP statistics indicate no cases of Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever, or Malaria since 1992.
     Schistosomiasishas not been detected in the reservoir area. However the snail which is a vector has
     been detected and in coordination with Argentina, the snails are collected weekly for analysis.
    Statisticsfor diarrheaapparently show an increasesince 1993 but the numberof people includedinthe
    sample populationhas increased from 23,000 to 139,000.

     120.     The data indicate an increase in respiratory illnesses which are primarily attributed to poor
     living conditions in the marginal areas and the length of time people now are in contact with
    contaminatedwater and poor nutrition in those communities. Statistics are taken in a global context
     and populations affected or closest to the reservoir are not sampled independently or analyzed
     separatelyto determinechanges in their specific situationat new water levels. Therefore, since there
     is no specificallytargeted data for the populationat risk, it is not possibleto make any conclusion with
     respectto the impactof increased water levelson health conditions.

     121.     The incidenceof canine rabies also seems to have increased because of vampire bats that
     have come to the mainland from flooded islandsas well as a poor animalvaccinationprogram. A new
     programstarted in 1996aims to stem this problem through massive vaccination.

     122.     The MHP emphasizes educationas one of the most importantaspectsand is carried out with
     some support for salaries from EBY. They did emphasize that the amount received from EBY was
     somewhat small and did not provide funds to increase staffing in response to needs created by the
     reservoir. The funds have allowed them to improve the salaries of employees and extend their

      working hours, to strengthen some clinics, and to provide medicine. EBY will provide approximately
      US$150,000 in 1997for health programs on the Paraguayanside.

      123.      Monitoringof vectors are deemed to be very good. The Servicio Nacionalpara Erradicación
      del Paludismo (SENEPA) is responsible for vector monitoring and community control and education.
      Larval mosquitolevels are said to be low.


3.3Argentina
      124.      EBY has started its own program to support health education and extension in the
      neighborhoods in the face of diminished services from the Ministry.       The objective is to organize
      groups that can channel some of the needs and requests to government services. Some tradition
      medicinepractitionershave also been incorporated intotraining programs to help cover needs.

      125.      Vector monitoring is done periodicallythrough agreements with the Universityof La Plata for
      identification of entomological samples. Data was not available at EBY for basic health or vector
      statistics.

      126.      Information available was compiled from specific health centers around the city. Social
      workers in the neighborhoods known as "efectores"provide informationto the centers based on their
      knowledgeof the healthof individualsin each sectorof the city. Statisticsare compiledby disease and
      reporting from the local healthclinics is spotty. The best data came from the regionalor larger health
      centers, makingit difficultto determine the exact locationspecificcases of diseasecamefrom.

      127.      Malariaand Yellow Fever have been trackedfor many years in the Provinceand is not found
      even though the Aedes mosquito has been detected. Monitoring for Schistosomiasisis also done but
      has not beendetected.

      128.      Regarding the agreement with EBY, the representatives felt it was adequate. The greatest
      problem stemmed from the slow pace at which counterpart funds were made available by the
      Government of Misiones to implement the programs. These delays slowed implementation even
      though EBY was ready to provide support. Presently, an expedited mechanism has been found to
      circumventthe need to transferfunds from the Ministryof Finance and allow shorter reactiontimes.

      129.     As in Paraguay, the funding availablefrom EBY goes in great part to supplement salaries of
      personnel already working for the Ministry and to fund existing programs. Specific programs in the
      areas of Health ExtensionlEducationare enthusiasticallywelcomed by the Ministry, but they have few
      materialsto work with.

3.4 Findings
      130.      Based on the informationgathered it is not possible to distinguishthe effects of the reservoir
      on affected or at-risk populations, from the rest of the population in Posadas, Encarnación,and the
      neighboring areas. The data presented however, shows little or no presence of the more serious
      diseasesassociatedwith epidemics such as malaria and schistosomiasis.

      131.      The counterpart agencies on both sides of the Parana River seem to have the capacity for
      data collection and monitoringof diseases. The programs implemented by EBY are significant in terms
      of the financial support to the regional and Provincial health agencies but do not specifically address
      the needs of people in the riverside neighborhoods most affected by the reservoir. The funding is


                                                                                                          30

   general in its support of the Ministries and does not provide specific personnel to the support the
   impactedareas and populations. More specifically:

e  There is insufficient support for neighborhood extension and the presenceof doctors, especially for
   those waitingto relocateand are betweenthe 76 and 78 masl.
e  Disaggregated data is not available for population at-risk to allow accurate monitoring of health
   impactsand direct assistance.


4. BIODIVERSITY AND RESERVES

 4.I         Ovetview
   132.     A major emphasis of the Request is on the issue of biodiversity conservation and reserves
   (paragraphs 26,37,38,52-63). The Request criticizes the Environmental Assessment ("EA) for not
   having been prepared with local participationand having left out many importantenvironmentalissues.
   The lack of an Environmental Trust Fund, inadequate biodiversity baselines and compensatory
   reserves programs, and the undermining of internationalenvironmentaltreaties are alleged. Criticism
   is also aimed at the animal rescue program and the fact that most of the reserves established are in
   Argentina.

   133.     The EA providesbaseline biologicalinformationbased on studiesof the Centrode Datos para
   la Conservacion (Ministry of Agriculture - Paraguay), the Ministerio de Ecologia y Recursos
   Renovables Naturales de Misiones, EBY professionals, and consulting firms. The study indicates
   107,600 ha of differentecosystems to be flooded at 83 masl.
   134.     Mitigation measures are included in the REMP. Three major themes are emphasized to
   rehabilitate and protect natural resources: ecosystem rehabilitation,delineation and management of
   reserves,reforestationand re-populationof species of flora and fauna affectedby the reservoir.

   135.     In addition to a documentation review, visits were made to reserves and EBY personnel
   responsible for reserve management and implementation              were interviewed.      Biologists,
   representatives of NGOs and government officials were interviewed in Paraguay and Argentina
   regardingthe protectedareas programs established by EBY.

 4.2        Paraguay
   136.     Ecosystems that belonged to Paraguayconstitutethe largestportionof territory flooded by the
   creation of the Yacyreta Dam reservoir. Approximately 80,000 ha of Paraguayan ecosystemsare to be
   affectedat 83 masl.

   137.     According to the latest documentation regarding EBY's implementation of the REMP,
   protectedareas in Paraguay within the scope of the Action Plan (76 masi) includethe Yacyreta Island
   Protected Area (9000 ha) and continued support of the zoological collection in the Atinguy refuge.
   Approximately US$550,000 are budgeted in the Action Plan to consolidate tenure of the area and
   US$180,000 over three years to create the reserve. In 1999 implementation is planned for the
   Yabebyry Reserve (30,000 ha).

Fundacion Moises Bertoni
      138.     The areas of greatest biological importance are Yabebyry and the western tip of Yacyreta
      Island. The first is a mosaic of habitats adequate for the Marsh Deer and contains some tall forests.
      Downstream islands were assessed for their conservation potential.       However they are subject to
      periodicflooding and if otherdams were to be constructed in the future any effortswould be negated.

      139.     Yacyretá Island is seriously degraded by        human presence and the impacts of dam
      construction but it presents importantexamples of ecosystems that were lost on the east end of the
      island. Ecologicalstudies conducted priorto the flooding were general, providinginformationprimarily
      on structure and noton functionof the systems.

      140.     The Paraguayan System of Protected Areas lost a great deal in the flooding that has not been
      compensated. Paraguay lost a unique protectedarea that was not subjectto intense human pressure.
      The reliance of EBY on the decree establishing Yabebyry may be inadequate. The creation of
      Yabebyry and Yacyreta Island reserves would be a good start to the protected areas system of
      Yacyreta but EBY may need bettertrained staffto establishand managethe system.

      141.     During the public consultation on the design of the REMP and evaluation of the EA
      knowledgeableNGOsonly had two days to review the documentation providedfor the meeting.


Direccion de Parques Nacionalesy Vida Silvestre
      142.     DPNVS and EBY had a cooperativeagreement regarding fauna (during the rescue program)
      which has now expired. EBY had made a commitment to purchase the area but later said that the
      funds were not availablefor the purchase. The cadastrehas been prepared for the purchase.

      143.     The DPNVS feels that as in the case of Itaipu Dam, the EBY should also have its system of
      protected compensatory areas. The expectation is that a large entity such as EBY will provide the
      funds for purchasesimilarto the Itaipuexperience. The resources EBY is providingfor Yacyreta Island
      would be better used in the implementationof Yabebyry in their view. The tip of the island is subject to
      intense population pressure that will grow in time and doubts the capacity of EBY to implement it.
      Animals relocatedfrom the rescue operation are being hunted.

      144.     The priority for investments in land purchase at this time for the DPNVS is in areas of the
      SINASIP such as Ypoa Lake (proposed Ramsar site) and San Rafael (InteriorAtlantic Forest). These
      areas are subject to greater pressuresand are a higher priority for conservation. The limited funding
      for land purchasesand the presence of a large Bank financed project practically negate the possibility
      of receivingfunds for investingheavilyinthe Yabebyry Reserve.

      145.     Inquiries about the animal rescue program, which DPNVS collaborated with through a
      cooperative agreement with EBY and the Japanese Cooperation Agency (JICA), were made with
      responsible personnel. They indicatedthat the most recent telemetry data on relocated Marsh Deer
      had positive and negative results. The Marsh Deer seemed to have adapted well to their new
      environmenthowever, up to 50% of them had been hunted in the area of Yabebyry. Confirmationwas
      also obtained from CITES personnelthat sites used to release monkeys on Yacyreta Island had been
      cleared recently.

  146.       Regarding the issue of why the implementation of Yabebyry was delayed until the 83 mas1
  was not clear. Implementationof the reserves up to this point in time has been carried out by EBY
  without an agreement with the Sub-secretariat of Natural Resources and Environmentof Paraguay
  (SSRNMA).

  147.       Implementation is presently advanced for Yacyreta Island Reserve.          The TORS for
  infrastructure (including fencing and lookouts) and equipment for Park Guards have been prepared.
  The dumps on the Island have been closed and an agreement is being prepared to sign with the
  ParaguayanAir Forceto cooperate in protectingthe reserve.

  148.       Biodiversity studies are contemplated under the Action Plan in the amount of $27,000 and
  appearsto be for a Rapid EcologicalAssessment of one of the Paraguayan reservesby the SSRNMA.


4.3         Argentina
  149.      The majority of the protected areas proposed for the compensation and mitigation activities
  are in Argentina, largely in the Provinceof Corrientes, west of Yacyreta Dam. Approximately 120,000
  ha are contemplatedfor protectionunder 10 reserves with implementationdates rangingfrom 1997 to
  the year 2002. The immediate plan is the protectionof 52,500 ha in the reserves of Galana, Apipe,
  and Santa Maria. The development of these reserves is included in the Action Plan with estimated
  budgetsof $450,000.

  150.      The establishmentof the reserves in the Corrientes Province responds primarily to an urgent
  need beforethe filling of the reservoir. This fact is confirmed in the Management Response, paragraph
  3.55 (public land available, more favorable expropriation law). Implementation of the declared areas
  has been delayedfor several years since declarationfor lack of funds. In 1996 money began flowing
  for implementationwhich began with Santa Mana Reserve that now has one Park Guard and one new
  pickuptruck.

  151.      The specialists recognize that Santa Maria Reserve is ecologically poor but has some
  interesting grasslandsand is a good environmental education medium which they hope to emphasize
  in the implementation. Galana and Apipe Reserves are to be managed by the Sub-secretaria de
  Recursos Naturales(SSRN) of Corrientes Province. EBY will be funding the implementationof these
  areas under the Action Plan, includingthe hiring of Park Guards and the constructionof Guard Posts.
  One guard is plannedfor Galarzaand two for Apipe Reserve. Money restrictionslimited guardsto this
  number. The SSRN requested four Guards for Apipe and two or three for each unit in the Ibera
  wetlands.

  152.      The configurationof the Iberawetlands reserves (4) could not be explainedclearly. The four
  reserves are disseminated throughout the wetland area. Three are square in shape and one in a
  narrow L-shape. According to the EBY, it conforms to the need to conserve certain core areas. The
  Galarzareserveappears to cut a large lake intwo portions.

  153.      The capacity of the SSRN to manage the conservation units was viewed as weak. The
  Province is not managing any parks outside of the ones being implemented with EBY and therefore
  has little experience. The techniciansare trained primarilyas hunting and fishing wardens. Only one
  personis presentlythe liaisonbetween EBY and the SSRN.

      154.      Biodiversity studies were performed on the Argentina side primarily after funds became
      available in 1992. The Paraguayan side had begun somewhat earlier with the CDC studies of 1987.
      Areas which were highlighted for further studies include the floodplain of the Garupa Stream in
      MisionesProvince. These studies are notcontemplated in the present Action Plan.

      155.      In The Santa Maria Reserve the Guard Post is well constructedand has an adjacent storage
      shed. The facilities are not well configured to receive visitors at present. There do not seem to be
      significant pressuresfrom human settlements and its proximityto the dam and border crossing offers
      some measureof protection. The area seems to be coveredto a large degreewith pine trees and the
      grasslands have been used for rice planting. Plans are being made to slowly eliminatethe foreign tree
      species but keepingthe disturbanceto the MarshDeerat a minimum if possible.


Universidad Nacional de Misiones
      156.     According to the Universidad Nacional de Misiones, botanicalsurveys were done prior to the
      flooding and were focused primarily on the determining the presence of endangered species.
      Thorough surveys were not possible. Important areas for biodiversityconservationhave been lost in
      Misiones, such as Nemesio Parma and El Porvenirwhere EBY settlements were established.

      157.      Extensivesurveys of fish have been done over the years in the Parana from Yacyreta Dam to
      the Yguazu River in the North. Approximately 214 species have been identified to date. The
      floodplains of the streams to be flooded at future levels, especially the Yabebyry (AR.), appear to be
      important for fish spawning in the region and require further studies. The presence of birds such as
      Xanthospar flavus and the endemic Aylacostoma molluskare indicatorsfor the scientiststhat important
      species were very likely lost in the region and therefore studies on biodiversity must be deepened
      before higherdam elevations.


   4.4         Findings
      158.     The issue of compensatory reserves within the context of the Yacyreta Dam has two
     dimensions, an ecosystem dimensionand a politicaldimension. Presentlythe arguments betweenthe
      Requesters and EBYIBank Management revolve around these two dimensions.                      EBYIBank
      Management (and the Panel of Experts) response to the Request is that the number of hectares
      compensated for and the ecosystem types are roughly equal or greater. The political dimension of
      conservationis ignored, however, by this approach. Giventhe fact that the ecosystemslost cannot be
      replaced, the reserves program largelylies in the realm of politicaland financialconstraints.

      159.     A participatory planning approach would have prevented this unequal situation to arise
      between two cooperating countries. All the Paraguayan official agencies, scientists, and NGO's
      interviewedregardingthe reserve system of Yacyretá have assertedthat compensationfor Paraguay's
      lost natural patrimony should be responsibility of EBY through the creation (¡.e. purchase) and
      implementationof areas on the Paraguayan side. This expectationis heightened by the existence of
      another large dam project in Paraguay, Itaipu, that manages a large reserve program of its own. Few
      of the interviewed,includingseveralArgentine nationals, felt that the present configurationof reserves
      adequatelyaddressesthe principleof "repayment" (resarcimientoas the Panel of Expertshas referred
      to it).

      160.      The reliance on weak government conservationagencies with little funding in both countries
      (in the case of Argentina, a Provincial government) to carry out the protection of large expanses of

     territory was a decision made with littleanalysisof the institutionalcapacitiesof these agenciesto take
     on the responsibilityof purchasing and managingthese areas.

     161.       The budgets establishedfor the reserves to be implemented provide only minimal protection
     and much investmentwill go to infrastructurein the beginning. Recurrentcosts of protection,a needed
     increase in patrolling capacity, and effective outreach (especially in Ibera) will require larger
     investments not presently contemplated from the information available in the Action Plan and other
     reports.

     162.       The EA informationon biodiversitywas found to be generaland focuses mainlyon mammals,
     birds, fish, and to a lesserdegree, reptiles. Based on the preliminaryfindings availableat the time, one
     would expect mainthe examples of endemicity, on the Yacyreta Islandin particular,to be found among
     the reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Management Response regarding the lack of biodiversity
     studies is that the surveys would have taken years and the informationwould not be used to change
     project design or operation in any case. This comment is a fatalistic one that downplays the role of
     biodiversity conservation. Even though the dam could not be relocated at the time of the surveys,
     programs are established and modified based on the informationcollected and seeking to maximize
     protection of biodiversity. Examples of this at EBY are rescue programs such as those presently in
     place for the endemic mollusk and operation of the dam modified based on protectionof fish species
     affected by the gas super-saturation, Biological surveys (and resettlement programs) are largely
     limited bythe funding availableto carrythem out.

     163.       The issue of biodiversitystudies by EBY, with the exception of fisheries, does not appear to
     be directed in a meaningful way or done with the depth needed to understand what will be lost at
     higher dam elevations. This knowledge can be used to provide valuable inputs when determining
     environmental costs and future mitigation investments (as demonstrated by the EBY investment in
     zoo's, rescue programs, and captive breeding). A coherent program needs to be developed in this
     regardand has been highlightedby the Panel of Experts in its most recentreview.

     0     Increased investments in implementation of proposed reserves on the Paraguayan side including
          (at a minimum) a phased plan for purchase of Yabebyry and stronger presence of DPNVS.
          Alternatively; firmer commitments by the GOP to purchasethe area are needed (although, not in
           detrimentof investments in other conservation areas of higherpriorityin the SINASIP).
     0     Greater support for institutionalcapacity building of conservationagencies in both countries and
           incorporationof more technicalpersonnelin conservation in EBY management.
     0     Deepen biodiversity studies in areas programmed for future flooding, particularly within
          ecosystems such as the Interior Atlantic Forest of global importance and large floodplains of
          streamsadjacent to the Parana.
           Increased numbers of Park Guards for areas more vulnerable to human pressure such as
          Yacyreta Island and Galana and provide more funding for outreach programs, private reserve
           programs, etc.

5. FISHERIES

5.I Overview
     164.      The Request alleges that there have been significant effects of the dam Project on the
     commercial fisheries and biodiversity of the Parana River (paras. 38,4730 and 52). Most concerns
     relate to the interruptionof migrationpatterns of fish, but also addresses the impactto the incomeand
     livelihoodof fishermen in the vicinityof the dam.

     165.     The EA specifically addresses the issue of impact to fish populations. At the time of the EA,
    the river had already been affected by the civil works and the movement of fish had been impeded in
     large part since 1990. Major impactscited were: blockageof migratory patterns of fish; alteration of
    coastal habitats;water quality changes; hydrologicalchanges; and possibleincreasesin illegalfishing,
    among others.

     166.     Mitigation actions called for in the EA include scientific monitoring of fish transfer facilities,
    water flow management, fish re-population,and control of illegal fishing. Presently EBY has on-going
     programs for the study of fish populations and commercial fishing upstream, gas super-saturation
     monitoring, fish elevator efficiency, watershed management, and fish populationsdownstream of the
    dam. These programs are carried out with the support of the UNNE, UNAM, CERIDE and COMIP in
    Argentina, and by UNA in Paraguay.


5.2Paraguay
     167.     The UNA Veterinary Sciences Department is the counterpart institution studying fish
     population and composition, side-stream monitoring, and fisherman survey programs for EBY through
    a cooperative agreement. Sampling activities started under this agreement in 1997 and will continue
    through 1998.

     168.     The University expects that at least five years of data collection will be needed to provide
     good stock assessments. Informationgathered will be processed in computer models developed by
    the FAO. They hopetheir studies of the commercial fisherieswill provide a basic understandingof the
    dynamics and pressuresof this sector and provide management tools in relationto the productivity of
    the reservoir.

     169.     Their recommendation, based on the Itaipu Dam experience, is to implement some form of
     biological research program of aquatic life forms.     This program is deemed necessary, not to
     repopulatethe reservoirat present, butto understandcaptive breeding of the most importantspecies in
    case the populationstudies or managementof commercial stocks requireit.

     170.     The Action Plan includesa budget of $52,000 to maintainthe acquaculturefacilities in Ayolas.
    These facilities presentlyallow only the most basic research and have been establishedwith materials
    and infrastructure readily availableat EBY. Budgets are also includedto continue funding the studies
    with the UNA. Fundingwill continuefrom EBY budgets at this low level. the Bank did not consider the
     researchstation a priorityand statedthat the Bank would notbe funding it.

     171.     Fishermen believe that there have been changes in the river and in fish populations. Fish
    species captured are mainly Carimbata (PScrofa) and Boga (Leporinus spp.), of inferior commercial
    value as compared to Surubi (P. Corruscans) and Dorado (S. Maxilosus) species. Relocated
    fishermen were said to be returningor planned to return to the riverside, particularlythose located in
    San MiguelPotrero.

5.3Argentina
     172.     Most of the research activities on fisheries are carried out by universities and research
     institutes in Argentina. The UNAM is studying the fish populations in the reservoirand upstreamwhile
    the UNNE is studying them downstream. UNNE is also involved in the research on the gas bubble

     phenomenonand its physiologicaleffectson fish. The CERIDE, a researchinstitutein the city of Santa
     Fe is studyingthe efficiencyof the fish elevatorwhich is cited inthe Request (paragraphs48-50).

     173.     UNAM Department of Exact and Natural Sciences (FACEN) carried out the first ichthyology
     studies in 1982 with the COMIP for the Corpus Dam Project and the collection campaigns have
     continuedwith several interruptionsto this day.

     174.     The Yacyreta dam effectivelybecame a barrier in 1990. The closure was done at a bad time
     because it was done after fish the migration downstream, leaving only a small remnant population
     upstreamto continue reproduction,if viable. Sports and commercial fisheries have since moveddown
     river and the FACEN has been working with EBY since 1990to determine the impactsand monitorthe
     recovery. Commercial fishing dropped off strongly in 1990but is growing back slowly.

     175.     The generalfeeling is that fish are showing up and reproducing. Large older fish (6-8 years.)
     are being found and very young ones (1-2 years) indicating some reproduction is happening. The
     reproduction of species has to surmount not only the dam problem but also the fact that adjacent
     streamsare beingseverelydegraded by human interventionand contamination. The elevator is viewed
     as usefulfor maintainingthe genetic exchange betweenfishery stocks.

     176.     Fishing is not controlled effectively by the Ministry of Ecology in Misiones and needs to
     improve. Estimatesmade by acoustic methods will assist in determiningbiomasswhich can be used
     in the implementationof fisheries management programs. More emphasis on this type of estimation
     would be worthwhile.

     177.     UNNE feels that the studies are valuable and a great deal of data is being acquired with
     modest resources. The studies are unique for this region. The Parana is a huge system and very
     complex which makes it difficult to cover completely. The level of effort in data collection is adequate
     now but notenough.

     178.     Important information has been collected on the effects of gas super-saturation that has
     helped management of the spillways. The fish now present fewer signs of parasites and no evidence
     of gas bubbles. The studies are also providing informationon fish movements and reproductionand
     now that they know the reservoirwell, are ready to expand the samplingarea. They would like to look
     at biomass and productivity of fisheries in the future. Three years of data should provide enough
     informationfor biomass estimates.


5.4Findings
     179.     The monitoring programs appear to be comprehensive in their coverage of the zone of
     influence and the implementing organizations seem professional and well qualified for the data
     collection and analysis. There also is satisfactory use of the informationgathered, in the case of gas
     super-saturation,for modificationof the spillway management and minimizingthe fish-killsexperienced
     in previousyears.

     180.     Aspectsthat may be improved are the intensityof sampling and overall compilation,analysis,
     and use of data gathered. The fish sampling agreements with UNAM, UNNE, and UNA are using fixed
     points to collect fish. Generallytwo to four points are being sampled from the margins of the Parana.
     This type of sampling providesgood informationat those points but do not indicatewhat is happening
     inthe rest of the reservoirat that same pointintime.



                                                                                                          37

    181.      The reservoir is very large and the potentialfor missing important parts of the fish population
    may exist with few data points. Presently the EBY fisheries personnel plan to have the sampling
    stations moved to different locations. Over time this will permit the viewing of a "snapshot" of the
    reservoir (from the coast at least) by superimposing data from different locationsat similar times in the
    year.

    182.      EBY officials mentionedthat they are also assisted by the use of advanced sonar equipment
    to determine fish locations and densities. There seem to be some problems using this technique at
    some locations because of noise from turbines and bubbles from gas super-saturation but the
    problemsare beingstudiedfor resolution.

    183.      Data is being worked on by different groups with coordination in the methods used. There
    does not appearto be some centralcollectionpointor technicalperson in EBY heading the compilation
    and analysisof the datato present in a useable form by those charged with managing fisheries.

    184.      The issue of the fish elevators included in the Request seems to be under study by the EBY.
    Although the number of fish transferredseems low, most of those interviewedconsider it important to
    allow a flow of genetic materialacross the dam barrier.


6. ARCHEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL SITES

6.1Overview
    185.      The Request addresses the issueof archeological and cultural sites in paragraph54, alleging
    that cultural property was not properly assessed and protected before the flooding to 76 masl. The
    Request asks the Panel to determine to what extent the Bank complied with its policy on protection
    and enhancementof cultural properties.

    186.      The EA of 1992 briefly mentions the issue of impacts on cultural patrimony. Background
    infomation at the time indicated the existence of pre-Colombian settlements of the Umbu and Tupi-
    Guarani Indigenous Peoples. At the time most of the investigationhad been limited to the Argentina
    side of the Parana however it was assumed that the Paraguayan side also contained similar
    archeologicalsites.

    187.      The six Jesuit Reductions of the 1600's in the area of influence, the remains of several battles
    of the XIX century, Spanish colonial and early XX century historic buildings in Posadas and
    Encamacionwere also citedas culturallyrelevant.

    188.      The EA calledfor the followingmitigationprogramsto offsetthe impactsof the flooding:
        Archeologicalrescue programs
         Establishmentof museums and presentationof representativeartifacts
         Environmentalresearch

    189.      The REMP also calls for archeologicalrescue programs and indicatesthe need to coordinate
    with municipalagenciesto seek alternativesfor preservation of historicalbuildings.

6.2         Paraguay
  190.      The REMP lists more of the Argentinean cultural sites than Paraguayan sites, particularly
  regarding indigenoussettlements. This seems to be a result of the existenceof better informationon
  the Argentineside.

  191.      On the Paraguayan side, EBY has an archeologist on staff that is presently reviewing areas
  above 76 mas1 with emphasis on the important islands that are not submerged. There are several
  areas of interest to be prospected before final elevation of the reservoir such as the battlegroundsof
  Tacuary in the vicinity of the stream of the same name, the historic center of Encarnación(especially
  the train station), and the civil war of 1922nearCoronel Bogado.

  192.      The Jesuit World Heritage sites are above the flood levels and managed under the Tourism
  Directorshipof Paraguay. EBYdoes not have any program for these areas.

  193.      Regardingthe sites on the islands and below the 76 mas1the deadline for flooding was the
  determinantfor the investigations. Many sites were flooded even as they were being dug. Most of the
  important sites were explored and many artifacts extracted. Locations of items were mapped on the
  islands and laboratory analysis needs to be performed on the extracted items to accurately date and
  cataloguethem.

  194.      The Catholic University was contracted by EBY to implement the archeological rescue
  program before the filling of the reservoir. The program was not well implemented accordingto those
  interviewed, and aspects such as the construction of museums and historical aspects were
  emphasized rather than the systematic study and rescue of sites. Delays in designing and planning
  delayedthe rescueactivitiesupto the time of flooding.

  195.      Althoughstudies of pre-Colombian sites were concentrated inArgentina, the Paraguayanside
  seems to show a stronger indigenous presence and is richer in archeologicalsites. The reasons for
 this are unclearor only speculateduponat the time bythe individualsinterviewed.

  196.      A museumwas built by the EBY in Ayolas that houses the artifactsextracted. Presentlythere
  is no evidence of ongoing systematic analysis of the materials collected. The Action Plan does not
  contain archeological programs for this analysis. The significance of the archeological findings in
  terms of the ancestral rights of the Mbya, mentioned in the Request (paragraphs 35,36, and 58) has
  not been analyzed yet. These issues may be included in the Action Plan program for support and
  evaluationof the Pindo Mbya Indigenous resettlement but are notspecified.

  197.      The railroad station of Encarnación is a historically important structure for the city. It is
  unclearwhat the final solution, if any, for this structurewill be. There is interest inthe communityfor its
  protectionor relocation,howeverthe issuestill appears under negotiationbetween the city and EBY.

6.3         Argentina
  198.      As mentioned in the previous sections, Argentina has been investigating archeological sites
 for several decades. Investigationand rescue of artifactswas done primarilyin the decade of 1980.

  199.      Most of the material has been rescued for the pre-Colombianand some colonial sites in the
 town of Posadas. A map and guide of the archeologicalsites in Misiones were publishedin 1995 with
  EBY support. Activities that need more support would includefinishing the analyses on the materials



                                                                                                         39

    excavated and systematizing the information. Presently the Action Plan does not contemplate a
    programfor this.

    200.     The World HeritageSites (Jesuit Reductions) on both sides will not be affected. In Argentina
    these sites have museums and have beenstudied by the Universityof La Plata.

    201.     Colonial and recent urban historicallyand culturally important buildingswill be affected by the
    reservoir at higher water levels. Studies of the railroad stations and similar buildings have been done
    in the past however it is not clear what the final status of these structures will be. Documents
    presented by members of the Posadas City Council indicateEBY complementary works, includingthe
    preservation of the Posadas railroad station. The Action Plan does not have a program for the
    relocationor protectionof these structures at present.


  6.4        Findings
    202.     Aspectsof cultural and historicalproperty alleged inthe Request appear to have been carried
    out to a significantextent on the Argentina side of the Parana River.

    203.     The delays in the design and implementation of salvage and research programs on the
    Paraguayanside seemto have resultedin incomplete or rushed surveys being performedbefore rising
    water levels. Weak institutionalcapacity of counterpart entities that were to assist in the rescue also
    seem to be partly responsiblefor this outcome. More emphasis seems to have been placed on the
    rescue and exhibition of artifacts rather that systematic scientific analysis and study (hence the
    existence of a completemuseum and incomplete publicationand cataloguingof information).

    204.     The Management Response to the Request indicates that additional surveys (and salvage)
   will be done as requiredby the REMP before higherreservoirelevations. However there do not appear
   to be plans for consolidationof the informationalready collected and participationin the programs by
   communitiesinvolved. More specifically:
         Support to finalize the systematic analysis, publication, and conservationof artifacts salvaged on
         bothsides of the Parana.
         Disclosure and discussion with municipalities and communities of the proposals and plans for
        conservationof historicallysignificantbuildingsin Posadas and Encarnación to be affected by the
         reservoir..
         Determinationof the significanceof the archeologicalinformationcollectedon the flooded islands
        with respect to the culture of indigenous Mbya-Guarani communities in the region and regarding
        claims to ancestralterritories,if any.

PART 2: ASSESSMENT OF ACTION PLANS

General

   205.      At the February 28, 1997 Board Meeting of the Bank's Executive Directors, Management
   introducedthe categoriesof PlanA and Plan B to distinguishthose remainingactionsthat should have
    been but were not carried out before filling the reservoir(Plan A) from those related to the prolonged
   operationof Yacyreta at 76 masl.

PlanA
     206.      Plan A includes actionson both the Argentine and Paraguayan sides of the reservoir. On the
     Argentine side the Plan includes potable water supply for resettled populations, urban and rural
     housing, and issuing property titles for the resettled population. On the Paraguayan side, the main
     actions in the Plan include expropriations, biodiversity reserves, urban and rural housing,
     indemnification to tile makers, and titling for the resettled population. The total cost of Plan A is
     approximately $16 million and an initial deposit of $8.1 million was made in an escrow account at
     Banco Corrientesto provide the financialresources to support the Plan.

     207.      According to the Bank Task Manager, implementation of Plan A is now expected to be
     completedby December 1997.As of mid June 1997,total undisbursed amounts are $4.7 million (about
     29% of total cost). Even if completed according to the present schedule, these actions will have been
     delayed by over three years and these delays have resulted in additional risks to the population. The
     most importantpending actionsdeal with investments for the compensatory reservesof Apipe Grande,
     Galana and Isla Yacyretá as well as with issuing property titles to the resettled population. Another
     critical pending action is the hydrogeologicalstudies to asses the macro impacts of the reservoir on
     adjacentsoils and lands.

     208.      Although disbursement is often a useful indicator of overall progress, since Plan A has many
     different components, disbursement alone does not constitute a sufficient measure of progress in the
     execution of individualcomponents. According to the June 1997 Progress Report, the latest available
     data, the most important pending actions on the Argentine side are the provisionof potablewater and
     construction of an elevated tank for the resettled population, communal infrastructure for urban
     settlements and over 1700 titles for the resettled population.The most important pending actions on
     the Paraguayan side are expropriations, equipment for the Yacyreta Island Reserve, communal
     infrastructure for rural settlements, clay supplies and infrastructure replacement for brick makers,
     indemnificationfor tile makers, and titling for resettledpopulationin the BarrioSan Pedro.


Plan B
     209.      Plan B is based on the actions required for prolonged operation of the reservoir at 76 mas1
     elevation. This includes resettlementof the populationliving between 76 and 78 masl, and it implicitly
     recognizesthat the people living in this band have suffered the effects of prolongedreservoiroperation
     at this elevation. The cost of the program is approximately $117 million, $46 million for the Argentine
     side, $48 million for the Paraguayan side, and $23 millionto actions relatedto both sides. This Plan is
     presentlyscheduledfor completionby the end of 1999,overfive years afterfillingthe reservoir.

     21O.      More specifically, Plan B includes approximately $30 millions for expropriations and
     indemnification ($14.3 million in Argentina and $12.5 in Paraguay), $10 million for resettlement, $9
     million for environmentand sanitationand $8.5 million for consulting,civil works and equipment
     for equipment). In addition, there is a $12 million Bank loan funds that has not been assigned, most
     likely to be utilizedfor contingencies.

     21I .     The financial resources to carry out Plan B are primarily$52.9 million from Bank Loan 2854,
     $3.63 million from Bank Loan 3520, $50 millionfrom a commercial loan obtained by EBY and close to
     $2 million from the Inter-American Development Bank ("IDB"). Funds from the commercial loan
     obtained by EBY will be depositedin an escrow account specificallydesignatedto meet the objectives




                                                                                                         41

    of Plan B. EBY will prepare bi-monthly reports on the implementationof the Plan, and in June 1997
    agreedwith the Bank on the format of these reports.
    212.      Duringthe first semester of 1997, the Bank disbursed approximately $2 million, equivalent to
    1.73% of the total cost of Plan B. This is the latest report available to the Panel with regard to the
    implementationof Plan B. Given the early stages in the implementationof the Plan and the low levelof
    disbursements,it is difficult to assess progress.

    213.     While the Bank considers completion of Plan B essential to the future Project, its scope is
    limited since it deals only with environmental and social liabilities that the Project has incurred, and
    according to many people interviewed, including some local and federal authorities, the treatment of
    existing problems underPlan B is by no means complete.

    214.     Among the contentious issues related to Plan B are the questions of wastewater treatment
    for the cities of Encarnaciónand Posadas, the level and effectiveness of coastal treatment and the
    compensationand resettlementof highly heterogeneous groups ranging from merchantsto indigenous
    people. Design, constructionand operation of sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants for
    the cities of Encarnaciónand Posadas are essential to sustainable solutions to health and sanitation
    near both cities, and particularlyto affectedgroups living in low-lying areas. The original design of the
    wastewater treatment plant for the city of Encarnación is undergoing revision: both the technology
    chosen and the site are being opposed by local neighborhoods.

    215.     An additional contentious issue is the impact on fisheries and the economic losses suffered
    by fishermen due to the presenceof the dam on the Parana River. Although it is too early to be able to
    establish statistically significant conclusions, there appears to be some impact on commercial quality
    resourcessuch as'the Surubi and Dorado species.

    216.      Another critical area for specific target groups, such as the clay workers, is the loss of high
    quality clay resources. Although EBY has attempted to locate alternative deposits, and made
    commitments to supply displaced clay cottage-industrieswith up to 5 years supply, the low level of
    technology utilized somewhat limits the alternativesfor some people. The workers of the clay industry,
    identifiedalready by the Panelin its earlier report, constituteone of these groups.

    217.     Reporting schedules and formats appear adequate to guarantee successful monitoring of
    implementationof Plan A and Plan B. Full and timely completion of both Plans are critical elements in
    the deploymentof a permanent solution at 76 mas1for the people affected by the Yacyretá Project, as
    well as for rebuildingthe credibilityof the Bank and EBY with the entire population. Although, the main
    elements of the Plans, including identificationof the detailed actions to be carried out, as well as the
    financial resourcesfor their respectiveimplementation appear to be in place for timely completion of
    the project , a long history of delays and non-compliance tolerated by the Bank does not allow the
    Panelto providea realisticassessment of future projectperformance with any degreeof confidence.


Review Of ResettlementAnd Environmental Issues

    218.     The adequacy of Plans A and B can only be properly analyzed in the context of the overall
    resettlement and environment problems of the Yacyretá Project. For example, although over 13,000
    people have been resettled so far, this represents about one quarter of the total population of
    approximately 50,000 people that it was originally envisaged would be involuntarilyresettledonce the
    project was to reach its design elevation of 83 masl. However, given the long delays and persistent

     invasions of people to low-lying areas, present estimates of the total population to be resettled are
     70,000 people, with an annual growth rateof about 1,500 people peryear.


Resettlement
     219.     The resettlementactivities carried out under the REMP include housing communities for the
     relocated population on both sides of the Parana River, support for the rehabilitation of productive
     economic activities of affected groups such as the clay workers, and rural resettlement programs.
     Overall performanceof these programs is mixed and has been considered in detail by the Panel of
     Experts on Environmentand Resettlement ("POE"). Infrastructureand access to services for those
     relocatedhavegenerallyimprovedin urban areas, although there are specific groupswho do not share
     this view.Among these are the inhabitantsof Barrio San Pedro, in Encarnación.

     220.     There is general agreement that the lengthof time and processof implementingthe solutions
     has not been adequate. Brickmakers, for example, are only now beginningto organizeand consolidate
     their production once again. However, their long term future is uncertain. Rural resettlements and
     indigenous groups need longer-term support to diversify crops and provide sustainable sources of
     income.

     221.     Resettlement in the Yacyreta Project has been a particularly difficult task due to the large
     numbers of people affected, the heterogeneous nature of the specific groups (urban and rural poor,
     merchants, clay industries and workers, indigenous people), and the long delays that they have
     experienced. In addition, resettlement standards have changed during this period, lack of resources
     have paralyzedthe programs, and weak programs of social communication characterized by absence
     of informationhaveledto a significantbreakdown in community relations.

     222.            Given all these conditions, it is not surprising that there have been problems and that
     there are people who feel that they are not better off after resettlement. In particular the Panel
     received many complaintsin the Argentine side of people who felt that they could not afford to pay for
     the houses, and therefore they were refusing to accept title (which would make them liable for
     repayment and taxes). The POE has reviewed the situation and has concluded that, in general, the
     housing and infrastructure are considerably superior than existing ones and that agricultural lands
     could support sustainablesolutionsfor these groups. The longerterm survival of the clay industries is
     constrained by the raw material supply after the five years of EBY commitmentto supply them with
     clay.

     223.     Informationgathered by the Panel shows that there has been monitoringand oversight of the
     programs, primarily through the POE and the Resettlement Coordinator. The original 1992 REMP for
     the Yacyretá Projectaddressed mostof the issues raisedby the Request, namely the need for ongoing
     participation,the diverse natureof the populationto be resettled,the need to re-evaluatebeneficiaries,
     and the negative impacts of prolonging resettlement. However, the original document, which was
     intended to be flexible and subject to on-going reviews and participation by affected groups, became
     rigid in some basic aspects such as resettling people according to flood levels. This has led to a
     fragmentation of community networks and social structure that has caused significant stress and
     hardshipon the resettledpopulation.

     224.     Another importantissue raised by the POE is the lack of adequate identificationof vulnerable
     groups who required special assistance, among them indigenous people, island inhabitants and
     fishermen. These groups have particular vulnerabilities due to the dramatic changes in lifestyle that


                                                                                                         43

     they have undergone. All these groups were supposed to be resettledin agriculturalbased occupations
     which representsa radical departure from former lifestyles. Other groups, like indigenous people and
     brick makers (in particular those of Barrio San Pedro in Paraguay and Nemesio-Parma in Argentina)
     require prolonged assistance and special attention to consolidate their organizations and promote
     self-sufficiency.

     225.       Despite the many difficulties encountered, the experience of resettlement so far, and the
     capacity building that has been developed by EBY pose important lessons for the future. As noted
     earlier. today there is a much deeper appreciation for the problems of displacing and resettling very
     large numbers of people than there was when the project was designed over a quarter century ago.
     Resettlement under Bank standards introduced further complexities, in particular due to the
     heterogeneous nature of the groups affected. One essential element for any future solution must
     include preventingthe inflowof new people to the areas.


Environment
     226.       The basic framework for the present environmental management efforts was the
     EnvironmentalAssessment ("EA") for the Yacyretá II Hydroelectric Project carried out in 1992 under
     the new OD on EnvironmentalAssessment. This process introduced important changes in project
     design, the most important of which dealt with the proposed long-term solution for the so-called Ana
     Cua Branch of the Parana River (which carries approximately one third of total river flow). Under the
     originaldesign of earlierdecades, a 23 kilometersegment of the Ana Cua would have beendry 80% of
     the year. This solutionwas no longeracceptable and a satisfactorysolution has yet to be found. There
     are alternatives underconsiderationbut their respectiveimpactshave not been analyzed.The present
     solution of maintaininga minimum flow of 1,500 cubic meters per second is consideredacceptableon
     environmentalgrounds, but is very costly in terms of forgone generation, equivalentto two turbines or
     10%of total capacity.

     227.       Implementation of environmental management plans was difficult from the outset, due
     primarily to bureaucraticprocedures and lack of institutionalsupport in EBY, as well as due to the lack
     of financial resourcesto carry out agreed programs. One important example of this problem is the fact
     that EBY has not had an Environmental Coordinator (equivalentto its Resettlementcounterpart)for the
     past two years, without any effective remedy from the Bank. Overall, the collection of environmental
     data does not yet respond to a coherent set of goals established within a regional context with
     participation of government agencies, non-governmental organizations and affected communities.
     Much of the information generated could be utilized to provide key inputs for management of water
     quality, fisheries, waste and others. However, EBY has not been able to exert leadership in these
     areas due to its own weak internalstructure.This role is particularlyneeded with respectto water and
     biological resourcesdueto the large impact that the projecthas had on these resources.

     228.      Water quality monitoringprograms seemed adequate and comprehensive, except for specific
     programs targeted for the populationat risk, namely those living in low-lying areas and near stagnant
     bays or pools in both sides. One of the fundamental shortcomings of the environmental assessment
     process deal with the lack of hydrogeologicalstudies to analyze the impact of rising water levels on
     regional lands surrounding the 1,000 square kilometer reservoir, not only the urban areas of
     Encarnaciónand Posadas, but also includingother cities, among them Carmen del Parana. So far the
     impact of the reservoir on adjacent lands is not well understood and should be closely monitored by
     satellite imagery and GIS systems. Although the basic hydrogeologicalstudies were part of Plan A,
     they still remainto be carriedout.



                                                                                                         44

   229.     The reserves and biodiversity programs are deficient, and their implementation has been
   particularly difficult. Plans for many of these reserves do not yet exist, and the strategy for Yacyretá
   Island Reserve, one of the most important, has yet to be finalized. There are ongoing sporadic
   biodiversity assessments. The reserve system in Argentina is larger than that in Paraguay. However,
   most of the reserves were legally established before raising the level of the reservoir and lacked a
   strategyfor communityinvolvement or management plans.

   230.     Fisheries monitoring programs are numerous and starting to provide valuable management
   information for dam operations to reduce fish kills. Better compilation of data is needed and more
   intensivesamplingcampaigns should be undertaken. At the presenttime, notenoughdata is available
   to make statistically significant conclusions about the impact of the dam on fish populations or the
   effectivenessof the fish elevator.

   231.     The linkages between environmentalimpacts and health effects are not well established and
   specific data for the populationat risk is neededto address this issueon both sides of the reservoir. In
   1994, sharp increases in diarrhea coincided with filling of the reservoirs to 76 masl. Health officials
   considered that this phenomenon might be caused by increased monitoring and service coverage,
   however, there is no data to support this claim. Improved data collection and analysis for target
   communitiesis required.

   232.     Communities outside Posadas and Encarnación, such as Carmen del Paraná conveyedto the
   Panel their dissatisfactionwith EBY's lack of concern about potential impacts of the reservoir on their
   towns--in particular with respect to water supply and soils. EBY has not included this town in its
   mitigationplans.

   233.     Cultural propertyresources have been assessed to a significantdegreeon the Argentine side
   and more studies need to be carried out on the Paraguayan side prior to any future raising of the
   reservoirlevel.

PART 3: ADDITIONAL REQUESTS

   234.     During his second visit to the city of Posadas, Argentina in May 1997, the lead inspector Mr.
   Alvaro Umaña Quesada received several oral and written Requests for Inspection from local people
   who were allegedly affected by the design and executionof the project and related activities. He also
   receivedRequestsfrom localcommunity leaders and government officials.

   235.     As stated in the introduction to this Report, the Panel-after      seeking guidance from the
   Executive Directors-decided to ask Management to comment on the allegations made in these
   Additional Requestsand to includeits findingson them inthis Report.

   236.     The Additional Requests were submitted by people living in the A 1 and A 3.2 neighborhoods
   of Posadas, by brickmakers, members of the Association de Oleros Unidos de Misiones (the
   Associationof United Brickmakers of the provinceof Misiones), by members of the Honorable Concejo
   Deliberante(MunicipalCouncil) of the City of Posadas, and by members of the Honorable Cámara de
   Representantes(House of Representatives) of the Province of Misiones. In addition,the mayor of the
   city of Posadassubmitteda detailedstudy of the effects in urban areas of the project.

     237.      ManagementComments, receivedby the Panel on August 4,1997, (ManagementComments)
     provide a description, as well as specific comments on the main issues raised by the Additional
     Requests(see Attachment 1to this Report).

     238.      After a detailed review of the Additional Requests and Management Comments thereon, the
      Panel has concluded that a number of issues raised should have been dealt with by Management
     earlier on during project execution. The lack of participationof affected people and local authorities in
     project related activities and a tendency by Bank supervision missions to ignore or take lightly the
     concernsof area peoplemay be at the root of these problems.


Review of the Additional Requests
     239.      (a) The Main allegationsin the Requests by people living in the A.1 and A3.2 neighborhoods
     (see alsoAnnex 1of ManagementComments).


     terms includingunfairlyhighprices - determinedin an inconsistentmanneramong diferent areas of
     (0         That the housingprovidedunderthe project was beingsold to relocatees underunacceptable

     the neighborhoods- highinterest rates andpropertytitles encumberedby the mortgagesinfavor of
     EBY

               Management Comments were candid and straightíorward.              Originally EBY applied a
     resettlement policy whereby the relocateeswere expected to pay the difference between the value of
     their previous house and the new one provided by EBY, with the proviso that such paymentwould not
     exceed 35% of the value of the new house. Under this proposal the differences in price would be
     repaid to EBY in 30 years. This difference in price would be paid to EBY in 30 years, at an annual
     interestrateof 6% and the debtwould besecured by a mortgage onthe new house.

               Underloan 3520-AR, the Borrower and the Bank agreed on a new ResettlementPolicy in line
     with Bank OD 4.30, whereby all families affectedby the Yacyreta Project should be "given replacement
     houses in exchange for those affected by the Project, at no cost to the relocatees" (emphasis
     added). Only two exceptionswere allowed underthis policy: (a) people already relocatedat the time
     the loan was made (1992) who were already payingthe differentialin value between the old and new
     houses, and (b) people that requested a more expensive house and agreed to pay for the difference.
     According to Management, "During projectsupervision, in particular,after the raisingof the reservoirto
     elevation 76m, the issue of delays in the processing and issuing of property titled was discussed by
     every Bank supervision mission. EBY's explanations were that delays were due to slow and
     complicated legal/administrativeprocedures at the provincial agencies responsiblefor these matters,
     and to the shortageof personnelin EBY's legaldepartment."

               Since no contact was made with the affected people, the Bank believed that the old
     resettlement policy was no longer being applied. Only in June 1997, that is after the additional
     Requests were submitted to the Panel, Bank staff learned that "the majorobstacle for issuing those
     titles was the refusalof the affectedpopulationto sign the requireddocumentation, becauseof the debt
     imposedby EBY."

               A dispute between the Bank and EBY over the interpretationof existing legal agreementson
     resettlement policy ensued. Since the Bank believesthat the housing should be provided at no cost
     and EBY contendsthat it has the rightto change a pricefor the housing and is notwilling to "forgivethe
     totality of the debts" in cases which in its view are not covered by the Bank`s resettlementpolicy. To

the date of this Report, the Panel is not aware of a satisfactorysolution to this issue. However, EBY
has made an offer to relocatethat reduces the priceof houses by 90%to low incomefamilies and 50%
to the others. Also, the interestrate on debt has been reduced to 3% per year and all penalty interest
due to date would be forgiven by EBY. In addition, the Provinceof Misiones and the City of Posadas
haveagreedto forgiveall property tax debts that the relocateesmay have up to this date with regardto
housingprovidedby EBY.

          The Bank has statedthat according to Bank policy, new housing has to be providedat no cost
and consequently propertytitles issued to relocateesshould not be encumbered by mortgages. The
Panel has been informedthat both "EBY and the Bank are currently exchanging views in an effort to
resolvethis disagreement." However, untilthis issue is resolved, the Bank is not in compliancewith its
policies.

(ii)      Lackof adequate communalinfrastructure(schools, healthandpolicyposts) and watersupply
inneighborhoods, especiallyA 3.2 (See also Annex 2of ManagementComments).

           Management Comments providea good insighton how the resettlementpart of the project is
being monitoredand evaluatedby the Bank.

          Since the refusal by relocatees to sign purchase agreements is based not only on the price
and payments conditions but also on the claims in par. i) above, the Bank states that it is "the Bank's
understandingthat the charges levied by EBY are @ to recover the cost of public services" and that
"moreover, the issuance of the property title does not depend on the completion of communal
infrastructure(school, health post, police post, kindergarten, etc.), some of which did not even exist in
the affected neighborhoods locatednearthe river".

          After explainingthe cost and equipment on the new housing and the reasons that, in its view,
justis the delays in the construction of communal infrastructure, the Bank seems content with the
followingsituations:

          "Despitethe delays, the majority of relocated children (64%) have been attending classes at
          nearby schools located less than 2 km away from their homes, while 34% attend classes in
          more distant neighborhoods located more than 4 km away. The latter group usually takes a
          public bus at a cost of $0.40 per day. According to EBY, 18% of the children do not attend
          classes due to capacity limitations in nearby schools or due to economic difficulties of their
          families."

          For the affected people, without proper schooltransportationavailable, this situation implies a
lot of difficulties and sacrifices and for nearly one fifth of the school aged children, no school at all.
Management expectsthat the schoolwill be "fullyoperationalfor the nextacademic year".

          As for the health post, its constructionis also expected to be completed by December 1997
and its operationwould bethe responsibilityof the Ministryof Public Health. No referenceis madeto a
police post in Management Comments.

neighborhoodand the fact that the city has grown during the past decade "to the pointwhere the A 3.2
settlement is connectedto the urban transport net". Adding that those living in A 3.2 "can shop in the
small family businesses existing in the new settlement, which were relocated with EBY assistance.
There were also supermarkets and commercial areas locatedwithin a 3 km distance." No information
is provided about prices in the area of small businesses or how accessible the supermarkets 3 kms
away really are.

          Finally, it acknowledges that "because of the new urban transportation needs family
expenditures for this item have slightly increased (5% to 7%)" stating that this increment has been
documented by the Independent Evaluators of the Resettlement Plan and concluding that "the trade-
offs for such an incrementare bettersanitaryand livingconditionsand the avoidanceof floods."

          The Requesters believe that the incrementalcosts in monetary, time and human terms are
muchhigher. The Paneldid not havethetime or means necessary to ascertainthe facts regardingthis
contention and whether the settlers in this area are in the same or betteroverall living conditions in the
resettledarea as requiredby Bank policy.

240.      b) Mainallegationsby brick makers (oleros). (See Annex 3 of Management Comments)

i)        That many brick makers were not included in the censuses carried out by EBY and have,
therefore, beenexcludedfrom the resettlementprograms.

          According to Management "EBY's census carried out in I98911990 was updated in 1993 by
the Minesand Geology divisionof the Provincial Government" and "areas not previouslyincludedwere
incorporated in the revisedcensus." In fact, "all oleros affected by reservoir elevation 76 m, with the
exception of one olero who had not accepted any solution proposed by EBY, have been either
relocatedor been compensated incash".

          During his field visit, the Lead Inspector met with several people who claimed to have been
excluded from the resettlement programs and several oleros that claimed to be their witnesses.
Ultimatelyonly an independent survey can ascertainthe accuracy of their allegations. It is suggested
that in the meantime, Bank resettlement specialists visit the area and personally interview these
people.

(ii)      That the compensation received by fhe oleros were too low and accepted by the oleros
exclusivelybecauseof their desperate economic situation.

          Management Comments note that the compensation paid by EBY ranges from $6,500 for
small units to $16,500 for larger units producing more than 30,000 bricks per month and that these
amounts were "considered adequate to reestablish their lost productive unit and house"
(emphasisadded).

          Management also notes that for the "oleros who selected relocation instead of cash, the
average investment made by EBY per relocated family was about $27,500 (land and house and
serviced lot for production). These figures do not include the cost of the technical and social
assistanceprogramcarriedout during the lasttwo years".

          Nevertheless, Management believes that there is no justification for the olero's request since
they freely optedfor a cashcompensation.

          Although the Panel understands that there may be other factors in the consideration of this
request, as a matterof equity, it is difficult to regard as equivalentthe compensations received by the
different groups of oleros, when the one in kind (housing, lot, etc.) is equivalent on the average to
almost doublethe highest value of the cash compensation.

(iii)     That the oleros in the areas of Garupa and Candelaria must be relocated under the same
conditionsof those relocatedinthe Posadas area.

          Accordingto Management Comments these oleros have opted for cash compensationwhich
has been paid in full as of July 31, 1997, that is about two months after the additional Request was
signed.

          Since paymentof compensation was made recently,the Panelhas not been able to ascertain
whether such payment meets the concerns of the Requesters. It should be noted, however, that a)
the minutesof the meetingbetween EBY, provincialauthoritiesand the oleros of June 2, 1995 (where
the amounts of compensation to oleros were agreed upon) state that oleros receiving cash
compensation may opt for land, in which case the value of land will be deducted from their
compensation. The Panel was unable to establish whether the land option was offered to the
Requesters; and b) that the amount of compensation apparently has not been adjusted for inflation
since that date.

(iv)      That the workers of the brick industrieslost fheirjobs but have not been compensatedunder
the project.

          Management Comments state that the Resettlement Plan envisaged the relocation and
economic recoveryof the small brick industriesaffectedby the project. "However, 99% of the oleros to
be affected by further reservoirelevationsrequested cash compensation insteadof relocation assisted
by EBY. Once compensation was paid, owners of the olerías were free to exercise their discretion as
to whetheror notto continuewith their manufacturing activity. Many of them opted to continue...[while]
others in exercise of their entrepreneurialrights decided not to continue with the olería and shifted to
new economic activities", and conclude that: "In conformity with the Bank's resettlement policy, the
loss of employment due to the personalchoiceof the affectedownersfalls beyondthe previewof EBY
and the Bank (sic).

          It is a fact that clay deposits of the quality and amount of the deposits lost because of the
reservoir elevation have not been found (see Productive Activities under the Claim of the Municipal
Council of Posadas, paragraph (¡i) below), and therefore it is difficult to accept that the workers lost
their jobs because of a simple decision of owners of olerias to change economic activities. There
seems to be enough prima facie evidence that the loss of jobs by brick factory workers has been
caused mainly - if not directly - by the filling of the reservoir. If this is the case, the workers should be
compensatedaccording to Bank policy.

          The Panel urges Bank Management to undertake an independent technical review of this
matter on the Argentine and Paraguayan sides to determine to what extent brick factory workers have
lost their sourcesof income as a consequence of loss of high quality clay resources.

v)         That the oleros have been unemployedand with no land or means of productionand should
be compensatedfor the damagesufferedandprovidedwith housesandland.




                                                                                                          49

               Management Comments reiterate that no further compensation is required for those oleros
      that opted for cash compensation, and state that in addition to that EBY has assisted some of them
      afterthey invadedpubliclands.

               In the Panel's view, Management argues from a mere legalistic point of view with an
      assumptionthat the oleros freely opted for cash compensation and may have given up all other rights
      to rehabilitation. From a policy point of view, however, the Panel believes that Managementshould
      carry out an independent assessment on whether the requirements of OD 4.30 that "the population
      displaced by a project receives benefitsfrom it" and that people should be "assisted in their efforts to
      improve their former living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels, or at least to
      restorethem" are being metwith regardto the oleros inArgentina and Paraguay.

               Finally, Management has indicated that the relocationlcompensationof families who may
      have settled in the projectareas after the 1993censuswould be the responsibilityof the Governments
      of Argentina and Paraguay accordingto a proposed amendmentto the Third Owners' Agreement. The
      Panel has been unable to verib whether these additional obligations have been accepted by the
      respective governments. Management estimatesthat the number of additional families is growing by
      some 1,500 peryear, which complicates further any resettlement solution.

      241.     c) Main allegations by members of the Municipal Council of Posadas (see Annex 4 of
      ManagementComments).

               The members of the Municipal Inter-Institutional Council for the Yacyretá project - which
      includes representatives of Posadas' professional Associations - (doctors, lawyers, architects,
      engineers, economists, etc.), Provincial Representatives, NGOs, Unions and Municipality officials,
      among others - submitted a Request containing several complaints mainly in the following areas:
      environment, productiveactivities and social activities. The subject matters of these complaints have
      been dealt with in other parts of this Report and the Panel has been unofficially informed that the
      Municipality of Posadas and EBY have entered into agreements dealing with several of these
      complaints. The following summarizes this additional Request and the Management Comments in
      response.


Environment


      (i)      No studies have been carried out regarding behavior of underground water or for the
      preparation of coastal treatment

               Management Comments state that coastal treatmentstudies and project designs are not yet
      required since major coastal works are not envisaged until the reservoir is operating at 83 mas1level.
      As for the hydrogeologicalstudy, it should start afterthe consultantsare appointedin September 1997.

               The Panel has reiteratedthe importance and urgency of the hydrogeologicalstudies.

      ii)      Urban creeks are not receiving treatment resulting in the continuous growing of unhealthy
      vegetablemass.

               Management states that pollutionof urban streams is caused by untreatedsewage disposal
      not by reservoirlevels.


                                                                                                          50

                The Panel has noted that reservoir levels do affect the flowing of the creeks into the river
      thereby causingthe accumulation of untreated sewage in urban areas, primarilythrough the formation
      of stagnant bays along the streams.

      iii)      The improvement and extension of the overall sewage system of the city of Posadas has
      been delayedbecauseof EBY's failure to complete the maincollectorsand treatmentplant.

               According to Management delays in the sewage collection works in Posadas are the
      responsibilityof APOS, the localwater and sewage company and not EBY [orthe Yacyretáproject].


Product¡veActivities


      (i)       The fishing activity downstream of the dam has been substantially impacted because of
      reducedfish migrationthrough the fish transferfacilitiesat the Yacyretá dam.

               Management Comments state that it is true that the dam (as any other large dam of its kind)
      serves as a barrier to natural fish migration patterns but that "monitoring being carried out under the
      Yacyretá project indicatesthat many commercially valuablefish species remain abundant, both above
      and belowthe dam."

               The Panelhas noted that the fish monitoringstudies look adequate but could be improved. At
      the same time, the Panel heard dramatic testimoniesof fishermen who claim that they have lost their
      sourceof incomebecausethere are no commercially valuable fish (¡.e.surubi, dorado) left.

      (ii) Thatbecauseofthe Yacyretáproject, thebrickmakersproductionhasbeenreduced.                     The
      situation is aggravatedby the fact that the new clay depositsgiven to the relocatedoleros do nothave
      enough clayand, ifthey do, they are ofpoor quality.

               Management Commentsstate that:

                        "...based on the recommendations of the Technical Report prepared by the Mines
               and Geology Division of the Province of Misiones, EBY bought land with clay deposits in
               Nemesio Parma and relocatedoleros affected by elevation76m. According to the mentioned
               report,clay depositshad adequate and sufficientclay for ten years' production. For efficiency
               purposes in clay exploitationand because of the characteristicsof the material (not as good
               as the river clay deposits), the report recommended technological adaptations, technical
               assistance, and communal exploitationof the clay deposits. In 1994, ninety three productive
               units were relocated by EBY. The oleros rejected communal exploitation, and decided
               instead on a division of plots, individuallyowned and exploited, taking the risk that some of
               them might not necessarily have clay in their property (see records of the meeting dated
               20107194). In July 29, 1997, EBY received 6 offers in response to the biddingfor provision of
               the equipment (truck and excavation equipment). EBY is currently assessing the offers in
               orderto adjudicatethe contract.

                        EBY provided technical assistance to recover previous production levels but has
               encountered an unforeseen difficulty. Contrary to the findings of the Technical Report, the
               replacement clay deposits do not have the quantity and quality required for the



                                                                                                          51

                 brickmakingproduction. This was confirmed by an EBY study carried out in 1996, one and
                 a half years after the relocation. To solve this problem, EBY has developed several
                 complementaryalternatives including access to river clay deposits still available in the zone
                 alreadyacquired by EBY, technicalassistance to those using the available material (non-river
                 clay), productiveprograms for developingcomplementary incomesources, such as gardening
                 and domestic animals, and organization of a cooperative to help in solving production
                 problems. During a supervision mission in March 1997, EBY and the Bank agreed,
                 additionally, to provide the oleros with equipment (trucks and excavation equipment) for
                 transport and gathering of material from river clay deposits and other clay sources. This
                 agreementis currentlyunder implementation." (Emphasis added)

                 The Panel has reproduced in its entirety the Management Comments on this claim because
       they provide a glimpse of the problems that the resettled oleros have faced. Similar problems, but
       without the technical and material support of EBY, may well have been faced by the oleros who
       receivedcash compensation and tried to restore their productiveactivities.

       any eventThatsome
       (iig                  oleroshavenotbeenresettledand that the compensation receivedby them was in
                    not sufficient and accepted by the oleros purely because of their desperate economic
       condition.

                 Management Comments and the Panel's observationare already set forth above under(i).

Social Activities

                 Management Comments provide a good summary of these claims and its specific comments
       provide a good example of how the Bank has viewed the problems of affected people in the project
       area. Forthese reasons, they are reproduced below:

                 The Request claims: "Under Argentine law, the fact that realty in the Yacyrefá area has
       been declaredsubjectto expropriationsince 1980means that owners of affectedland are restrictedin
       their ability to improve their properties because improvements made affer the declaration of
       expropriability will not be compensated by the expropriating party. Also as a result of this legal
       situation, areas to be flooded by the Yacyretá reservoir do not receive basic services (water supply,
       transportationandothers) from the municipalorprovincialauthorities."

                 ManagementComments:
                          "Argentina's expropriation law (No. 21499, first published on January 21, 1977)
                 applies in the Yacyreta case and indeeddoes specify in its Article 11 that "compensationwill
                 not be awarded for improvements, except necessary ones, that are made to the propertyafter
                 the property was officially declared to be subject to expropriation" ("no se indemnizarán las
                 mejoras realizadas en el bien con posterioridad al acto que lo declaró afectado a
                 expropriación, salvo las mejoras necesarias"). This is no way means that owners cannot
                 improvetheir properties; in fact, owners who made improvementssoon after the Yacyreta
                 area was declared subject to expropriation in 1980 have had almost twenty years
                 duringwhich to enjoy such improvements. Itdoes mean, however, that such owners may
                 find a legal bar to compensation for such improvements when actual expropriationdoes take
                 place (prior to the actual expropriationof their properties), unless they can demonstrate that
                 the improvements were "necessary" (building an addition to a house to accommodate a
                 growingfamily is an exampleof a necessary improvement).


                                                                                                            52

                           Legal provisionssuch as those contained in the cited Article 11 have a sound basis
                 in that they are designed to discourage speculation improvements which can result in an
                 unwarranteddrain on the resources of the expropriatingauthorities and can thus harm the
                 interests of the tax-paying citizenry at large. Only when, as in the Yacyretá case, actual
                 expropriationof propertiesaffected by such provisions is unduly postponed (because of, for
                 example,constructiondelays) does the impact of such provisionsbecome larger. However, it
                 is possible that, in the face of such delays, Argentine courts may be persuadedto adopt
                 an interpretationof the term "necessary improvements" that takes appropriateaccount
                 of the effectof time.

                           "Asfor the claimthat the local authorities, because of the impact of the expropriation
                 law, do not provideadequate infrastructurein the areas to be flooded by the reservoir,the key
                 point is whether: (a) as a result of the Yacyretá project, services already present were
                 removed from those areas by the authorities and not replaced; or (b) whether it was
                 reasonable to expect, in the absence of the Yacyretá project, that additional services now
                 missing in the areas would have in fact been provided by the authorities. As for point (a), we
                 are not aware of any elimination of previously existing services. As for point (b), our
                 understandingis that at leasta portionof the areas in questionwould probably have remained
                 marginalizedsince the area is on a flood plain subject to annual inundations. Furthermore,
                 now that the project is underway, a portion of such areas is also subject to illegal invasion by
                 settlers and extending public services to the areas would only encourage even more illegal
                 settlers." (Emphases added)

                 Again, the Panel believes that closer contact with, and participation of affected people and
        local authorities would have provided the Bank a better understanding of the problems caused by the
        project.


List of Urban Projects

        242.     Finally, the Additional Requests present a list of priority urban projects related to the filling of
        the reservoir. Management Commentsstatethat:

                           "The reconstruction of affected urban infrastructure is one of the most serious
                 challenges for raising the reservoir to its highest operating level. The list presented in the
                 Council's letter represents a best preliminaryestimate of the total works that will be required
                 for elevation 83m. The necessary design, implementation chronograms and budgets for
                 carrying out the constructionof urban infrastructurewill be part of the tasks of an engineering
                 consulting firm to be hired in September 1997. Minor protection works are envisioned for
                 intermediate operating levels. Any urban area flooded at these intermediate levels will be
                 subject to standard clean up operations (sealingof latrines, and the removalof fences, trees,
                 constructionwastes, trash, etc.). Water quality and vector monitoringsystems have been in
                 place since priorto reservoirfilling. EBY, through a Convenio with the Universityof Misiones,
                 has prepared a proposalfor the implementation of an industrialpollutioncontrol systemfor the
                 uppershed(up to Itaipu)of the Parana River."

                 The Panel has commented extensively on these issues elsewhere in this Report. (See, for
        example, ExecutiveSummary, the sectionon Water Quality, and Parton Assessment of Action Plans).

243.     (d) Main allegations in the Request presented by members of the Honorable Chamber of
Representativesof the Provinceof Misiones (seeAnnex 5 of the ManagementComments).

(0       The Government ofArgentina (GOA) and BY have failedto implementthe resettlementand
environmental works (defined as complementaiy works) requiredby the project, as agreed with the
Bank, and the Bank has failed to exercise its leverage to press the Borrowerto comply with agreed
commitments. The Chamber requests the Bank to use all of its resources to ensure that all pending
works are completedasplanned.

         Although this issue has been dealt with by Management and the Panel in the past,

                  "..the Bank urged (on April 13, 1996) the GOA to agree on a plan of action to
         complete by December 1997 all pending action to complete by December 1997 all pending
         actions relatedto elevation76m, and to establishan escrow account for ensuringfinancing of
         these works. On May 1996the plan of action was agreed. On July 1996 a special account
         was opened to start implementation of the most urgent works, and in October 1996 the
         escrow account was established. As of June 30, 1997,74% of the plan has been executed
         and is expectedto be completed as scheduled.

                  Because of the macroeconomic crisis faced by Argentina, the GOA decided to
         reduce by half in 1995 and to eliminate in 1996 its budget contributionsto the project, which
         delayed and almost stopped implementation of environmental and resettlement works
         required for reservoir elevations 78m and 83m. In addition, because of the failure of the
         Governments of Argentina and Paraguay to complete these works through a privatization
         scheme (rejected by both Congresses), the GOA decided to keep operating the reservoir at
         elevation 76m until further decisions are taken to completethe project. On December 1996,
         the Bank urged the GOA to agree on a Plan of Action to address the adverse resettlement
         and environmentalimpactsresultingfrom the prolonged operationof the reservoirat elevation
         76m. On January 1997, a Plan of Action satisfactoryto the Bank was received, and by April
         30, 1997, the GOA and EBY satisfied the major institutional, administrative, and financial
         requirements to permit implementation of this plan. Implementation of this plan, to be
         completed by December 1999, started in May 1997, and is progressing as planned. An
         amendment to Bank Loans 3520-AR and 2854-AR to support partial financing of the above
         plan is underdiscussionand is expected to be signed in lateAugust 1997."

         As far as the Panel can ascertain, the proposed amendments to loans 2584-AR and 3520-AR
have yet to be agreedupon and signed. Specific comments on the Action Plans are providedin Part 2
of this Report.
(io76mandThe
          laterBank failed by approving a plan to raise the reservoirlevel by stages, first to elevation
                to elevations 78m and 83m (final design level). Consequently, investments for key
resettlement and infrastructure works were postponed, in favor of completing major civil works and
electro-mechanicalinsfallationsfor the powerhouse.

         Management Comments statethat:

                   "The GOA'Splan to raise the reservoir level to 76m was accepted by the Bank on
         the basis that: (i) reservoir elevation to 76m would take place in September 1994, after

                  completing all of the minimum strictly needed resettlement and environmentalworks; and (i)
                  reservoir elevation to 78m would take place on September 1995, after completion of all
                  agreed resettlementand environmentalworks needed for that phase; and then continue to
                  elevation 83m once the remaining resettlementworks were done. Constructionschedulesfor
                  major civil works and commissioning of generating units were to continue as planned, along
                  with the implementationof the environmental, resettlement and other complementaryworks.
                  Revenues from the GOA and from sales of electricity were to assist EBY in meeting its
                  counterpartfunds obligationsto the project. According to the plan, all works were to be done
                  in sequence, and it is not correct to say that the plan for elevation 76m included a
                  reprogramming and postponement of other resettlement and environmentalactivities required
                  for elevation78m and 83m.

                           Infact, reservoirelevationto 78m did not take place in September 1995, as planned,
                  becauseof the financialcrisis explained. Although the Bank did not foresee, at that time, the
                  adverse impacts because of the prolonged operation at elevation 76m, the Bank took a very
                  strong positionwith the GOA, immediately after the GOA informedthe Bank of its decision to
                  remain at elevation 76m for an unconfirmed period of time. The outcome of the Bank's
                  positionis preciselythe base program (Plan B) that EBY is implementingtoday."

                  The Findingssectionof this Report summarizes the Panel's positionon this issue.

PART 4: COMPLIANCE WITH BANK PROCEDURES

        244.      As notedat the beginningof this Report, the Executive Directorsdecidedthat the Panel-aside
        from its review and assessment of existing environmental and resettlementproblems of the Yacyretá
        project and the remedialAction Plans agreed upon between Argentina and Paraguay and the Bank-it
        was "expectedto look at the extentto which the Bank staff had followed Bank procedureswith respect
        to this project."

        245.      The preciseextent and scope of this decisionwas not subsequently determinedby the Board.
        Paragraph 12 of the Resolution establishing the Panel refers to the "operational policies and
        procedures". Procedures are includedin operationalstatements and other documents containing Bank
        policies. Such proceduralrules ensure that Bank policies are followed by staff. As stated by Mr. I.F.I.
        Shihatain his book on the InspectionPanell:

                  "Operationalpoliciesand procedures are defined in the Resolutionto includethe policies and
                  procedures stated in the Bank's documents, known as "Operational Policies," "Bank
                  Procedures," "OperationalDirectives"and earliersimilar documents. The practiceof the Bank
                  has seen several series of operationalstatements as well as ad hoc circulars embodying its
                  policies and procedures...Prior to the Bank's reorganizationin 1987, its operational policies
                  were containedmainlyin "OperationalManual Statements" known in the Bank as "OMSs"and
                  "Operations Policy Notes" known as "OPNs," which were both issued, under the authority of
                  the President,by the then existingoffice of the Senior Vice President, Operations, in the form
                  of general instructions, supplemented occasionally by "Operational Circulars" or less formal
                  notes from the Senior Vice President, Operations. Followingthe 1987 reorganization,OMSs
                  were gradually reflected in new documents called "OperationalDirectives"or "ODs," some of


1 See ibrahirnF.I. Shihata, The WorldBank Inspection Panel, Oxford University Press, 1994at 42-46.

                  which included changes from earlier OMSs and some of which were completely new...Some
                  ODs were seen to be too detailed or reflecting at times what should be sought and not
                  necessarilywhat could be done in each project. The limitsof flexibility in the applicationof the
                  ODs were not always clear either, especiallythose written beforetheir drafterswere aware of
                  the controversy regarding the nature of these documents. Differenceson this issue and the
                  desire of the Bank's Management to streamline and simplify the Bank's business practices
                  led, after an informaldiscussionby the ExecutiveDirectors, to the Management's decision in
                  late 1992to graduallyreplace the ODs by statements termed "OperationalPolicies"(OPs) and
                  "Bank Procedures"(BPs), which would be bindingon the staff, as well as by "Good Practices"
                  (GPs), which would disseminate knowledge and indicate successful examples without being
                  binding...At the time of writing (June 1994), not all OMSs and OPNs have been converted to
                  ODs and not all ODs have been converted to these instruments. This could lead to
                  controversiesbefore the Panel on whether certain details in a specific OMS, OPN or OD are
                  provided as technical advice to the staff or are mean to be strictly complied with, an issue
                  which will require a careful reading of these documents in the context in which they were
                  issuedand in the light of their objectivein buildingthe staffs work...."

       246.
       below-have been separated out into OPs, BPs and GPs:
                  To date not all ODs, OMSs and OPNs-including those applicable to this Request listed

            EnvironmentalPolicyfor Damand Reservoir Projects(OD4.00 - Annex B)
            EnvironmentalAssessment (OD4.01)
            InvoluntaryResettlement(OD4.30)
            IndigenousPeoples(OD4.20)
            Wildlands(OPN 11-02)
            Supervision(OD 13.05)
            Project Monitoringand Evaluation(OD 10.70)
            Suspensionof Disbursements (OD 13.40)
            Cultural Property(OPN 11.03)
            EnvironmentalAspects of Bank Work (OMS 2.36)

       247.       In other words, the policy statements in force at the time the different loans for this project
       were preparedand approved, and therefore, subject to the Panel's review do not distinguish between
       what is meantto be a policy and what should be regarded as a "procedure" or just a guidanceto staff
       (or "good practice").Also in the words of the Bank's General Counsel, the "limits of flexibility" in their
       application is "not always clear either". For example, OD 4.01 on "EnvironmentalAssessment" defines
       it as "a flexible procedure...which should vary in breadth, depth, and type of analysis depending on the
       project."

       248.       In view of the foregoing, the Panel decided to highlight the major areas where staff
       performance could or should have better followed operational statements rather than prepare an
       encyclopedicreview of all possibleviolations. The following are the three main areas of concern:


Participation of Affected Groups and Local NGOs.
       249.       Both OD 4.01 on EnvironmentalAssessment (previously OD 4.00 Annex A) and 4.30 on
       Involuntary Resettlement provide policy and procedural rules on the participation of affected people
       and local NGOs in the design and implementation of the different aspects of environmental
       assessments and resettlement and environmental protection and management plans. The lack of

         appropriate local participation is evidenced by not only the submission of the original Request for
         inspection and subsequent additional Requests but also by the inadequacies of the assessment and
         plans notedelsewhere in this Report. This is indeedone of the major flaws in the operational handling
         of the project by Bank staff noted by the Panel.

Supervision
         250.       While OD 13.05 (Project Supervision) contains general provisions on supervision and
         monitoring,ODs 4.01 (especiallyAnnex D on Environmental Assessment), 4.20 on IndigenousPeople
         and 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement, contain specific supervision procedures applicable to each of
         the matters they regulate. Had these general and specific procedures been followed more strictly,
         perhaps the claims about the bad quality of housing and community infrastructure- verified in certain
         instances by the Panel - would not have arisen and the issue of pricing of housing on the Argentine
         side could have been avoided. The inability or unwillingness to exercise available legal remedies is
         best summarized by quoting a recent supervisionreport:

                  "No Legal Covenant Report is attached to this form, because we are negotiatingand finalizing
                  with the Borrower and [sic] amendment, which will change most of the covenants and
                  conditionalities under the existing legal documents. It would make no sense to report now
                  non-compliance, when we are reaching an agreement on new covenantsand conditionalities
                  underthe loan."

Institutional Strengthening.
        251.      Several provisions in the operational directives dealing with environmental protection,
         indigenous people and resettlement identifystrengthening the capabilitiesof borrowers and executing
        entities as a key step in the preparation and implementationof assessments, plans and activities in
        these areas. Althoughgreat efforts were made by the Bank ,the fact is that even at the time of writing
        this Report, there is no independent environmental coordinator in EBY and the position has been
        vacant for over two years. At the same time the independent evaluation of the environmental
        managementplanscheduled since 1994has yet to be carriedout.

FINDINGS
        252.      The Yacyretá hydroelectric Project was conceived and designed over twenty five years ago
        under very different circumstances and standards from those of today, in particular with respect to
        environment and resettlement.The selection of the site locked the project into a series of inevitable
        and irreversibleimpacts, includingflooding of over 100,000 hectares and affecting over 50,000 people
        in two major urban areas. Today, there are considerably stricter environmental and resettlement
        standards, as well as a much deeper appreciationof the social costs and difficulties to communities
        posed by involuntary resettlement of large numbers of people. Nevertheless, integrated watershed
         modeling of the Parana River Basin could have exposed alternative generation sites with potentially
        lower impacts.

        253.      The Project has been under construction for over 14 years and has been affected by
        numerous and persistentdelays and uncertainties.One of the basic problems analyzed by the Panel
        was the imbalance that developed, and persists until today, between the completion of the civil and
        electro-mechanical works vis-à-vis the "complementary works" which include environment and
        resettlement plans. While the former are 99.8% complete, less than a third of environmental and
         resettlement plans have been completed. The Yacyreta project has incurred important environmental

and social liabilities that are causing increasing friction with affected populations which could have
been foreseenand avoided.

254.      The chain of events that led to the Request and to the Panel review started with the filling of
the reservoir to 76 mas1 in September 1994: it started prior to completion of all agreed actions on
environment and resettlementas required by Bank policies. The Bank and the IDB jointly signed the
"no-objection"based on the premisethat no irreversibledamage would take place and that completion
of remaining actions was proceeding satisfactorily. However, shortly after the reservoir was filled, an
unfortunateturn in macro-economic conditionson the aftermath of the Mexico crisis, causedArgentina
to suspend all financial support for the Project, which led to a complete paralysis of complementary
works for close to two years.

255.      Imbalance in execution between civillelectro-mechanical works on the one hand and
resettlementand environmentalmeasures on the other has been one of the fundamental problems of
the Yacyretá Project. This imbalance has been exacerbated by the usual Bank practice of financing
the former while leaving the latter for counterpart funding. Given that this phenomenon has been
observed in other casesthe Panel believesthat this practiceshould be reconsidered.

256.      Prolonged operation of the reservoir at 76 masl had not been foreseen and resulted in
predictable impactscaused by raisingof groundwater levelsthat impacted the populationliving in low-
lying areas above 76 masl who had not been resettled. This situation is aggravated in poor urban
neighborhoods of Encarnación and Posadas. Plans to correct this situation, including both actions
required prior to filling the reservoir (Plan A) and those required due to prolonged operation at this
elevation (Plan B) are an implicit recognition of non-compliancewith environment and resettlement
covenants. There are a number of additional examples of non-compliance including the lack of
complete hydrogeological studies and monitoring of the impact of the reservoir on lands and soils,
problems with creation and management of compensatory reserves, lack of outside review of
environmental management plans, and the inability to appoint an environmental coordinator for two
years.

257.      During the appraisalof the Yacyretá I1Hydroelectric Project in 1992, now underthe new ODs
on Environmentand Resettlement ( 4.01 and 4.30), the Bank made considerable efforts to bring the
project into compliancewith the relevantODs and introducedimportant changes in the design, such as
declaring unacceptable the original solution proposed for the Ana Cua Branch of the river. These
efforts met with institutionalresistanceand it was difficult to get EBYto make progress on these issues,
primarily due to bureaucraticproblems and lack of financial resources. Inspite of extensivesupervision
efforts, exemplified by the large number of missions, and the fact that Yacyretá environmentalactions
have been cited as a "model" by the Bank's Environment Department, the Panel has found that the
Bank has not been able to bring the project into compliance with the ODs. and is not likely to do so
until after the year 2000. Timely completion of both Plans A and B are the first critical steps in this
process,but they do not representall the actions that are required. Forexample:

     Due to the absence of sewage treatment in all cities surrounding the reservoir (Encarnación,
     Carmen del Parana in Paraguay, and Posadas in Argentina) unsanitary conditionsprevailin many
     of the stagnant bays created by the reservoir. These conditions pose health risks to poor people
     living in low-lying urban areas. Deployment of effective solutions to these problems will require
     several years. Designand constructionof wastewater treatment plants and sewerage systemsfor
     Encarnaciónand Posadas are part of IDB and Bank loans respectively,but they are not expected
     to be operational until after the year 2000. More specific schedules are not available at this time,
     but the processshould be monitoredclosely.


                                                                                                      58

258.     The Panel's review has been complicatedby the fact that critical studies included in Plans A
and B-essential to assess the adequacy of these Plans-have either not been carried out or were
incompleteduringthe period of this review. Among them are the hydrogeologicalstudy to analyzethe
impact of the reservoir on adjacent soils, the proposed solutions to the Ana Cua branch and related
environmental assessment, the final site and design of the Encarnación wastewater treatment plant.
These studies should be completed immediately because they constitute the basis for permanent
solution.

259.     The Panelreviewed the evolving positionof Bank Managementwith regardto the future of the
project. A central factor in such a position has been and will remain the strategy adopted by the
borrowerfor the project. The Panel has identified, irrespectiveof the changing circumstances of the
project, a set of criteriaessentialto a successful completionof the projectin terms of Bank policiesand
procedures:

0   continuingall pending environmental and resettlement actions;
0   involving the affected populationto a greater extent in planning and execution of complementary
    works;
0   guaranteeing that Bank policies have to be respected regardless of formal ownership and
    management of theYacyretaprojectin the future; and
    continuing Bank supervisionof currentand future actions.

Bank Management has stated that it will not abandon its commitment to the affected people, and that it
has an important role to play in supervisionof current and future actions. Those actions cannot occur
too soon, and Bank assistancewill be vital to sustainable outcomes.

                POPULATIONLIVING IN THE A.l NEIGHBORHOOD
Background:

        During the decade of the eighties and prior to the approval of the currentBank
loan 3520-AR, EBY applied a resettlement policy whereby the relocateeswere expected
to pay the differencebetween the value of their previous house and the value of the new
house given by EBY. Such payment would be capped at no more than 35% of the value
of the new house. Under that policy, relocated familieshad to agree on the establishment
of a mortgage in favor of EBY and acquire a debt to be paid in 30 years (360 monthly
payments), at an annualinterest rate of 6%. With this policy, EBY intended to recover
part of the investmentsmade in the settlementsalready built, whose construction
standards for the majority of the affected population were far better than those of the
affected areas. For those that had more valuable houses than those received, EBY gave
such difference in cash.

        Consistent with the above policy, again prior to the approval of the Bank loan
3520-AR in 1992, EBY built a new settlement known as A-1 or Barrio Yacyrefá and
relocated 1,113 families,and started the construction of a second new settlementknown
as A 3.2 or VillaLanus. In both cases, the houses were built with higher construction
standardsthan the majorityof those located in the lower lands near the Paraná river.

        Under loan 3520-AR, the Borrower and the Bank agreed on a new Resettlement
Policy, in line with Bank OD 4.30, whereby all familiesaffected by the Yacyretáproject
should be given new replacementhouses in exchange for those affectedby the Project, at
no cost to the relocatees'. The followingtwo exceptions were consideredunder the new
Resettlement Policy: (i) retroactive cases (families relocated before 1992) ,where
relocatees were paying the differentialvalue of their houses; and (ii) families that
voluntarily might request a more expensivehouse (higher construction standards)and
expressed their willingnessto pay for the difference. In the first case, EBY would offer
the alternative of moving to a new less costly house (reduced construction standards)and
would cancel the obligationto pay the debt. For the second case, families must be given
the opportunity to choose the alternative of a free house, and agree with EBY on the
payment conditionsfor the additionalcost if they choose to upgrade. For the rest of the
affected population and certainlyfor all those to be relocated under the agreement of loan
3520-AR, EBY should provide housing at no cost to the beneficiary.

        Despite the agreementunder Bank loan 3520-AR, EBY continuedapplying its old
policy, charging relocatees an average amount equivalent to 35% of the value of the new
house, including those affected by reservoir elevation 76m who were coveredby the new
resettlement policy. The Bank was not informed about the applicationof this policy.

              During project supervision,in particular after the raising of the reservoir to
     elevation 76m, the issue of delays in the processing and issuing of property titles was
     discussed by every Bank supervisionmission. EBY's explanationswere that delayswere
     due to slow and complicatedlegailadministrative procedures at the provincialagencies
     responsible for these matters, and to the shortage of personnel in EBY's legal department.
     As a result of the Bank's December 1995 supervision mission, the Bank understood that
     the old resettlement policy was no longer being appliedby EBY. (See Annex 1
     Attachment 2).

              During the June 1997Bank supervisionmission, the Bank again raised its concern
     about the delaysin the issuingof property titles, and learned that, on the Argentine side,
     the major obstacle for issuing those titles was the refùsal of the affected population to sign
     the required documentation,because of the debt imposed by EBY. The mission also
     observed that EBY was indeed not charging any urban affectedfamiliesfor houses on the
     Paraguayan side. EBY was fully aware of this problem and informed the mission that the
     issue was being discussedwith the local and federal governments,to solvethe problem on
     a global basis. The mission informedEBY that transferring resettlement costs, to those
     involuntarilydisplacedby the project, is against the resettlementpolicy agreed with the
     Bank, stated on pages 50-59 of the Resettlement Plan contained in the Environmental
     Management Program      (Em)and     referred to in the Loan Agreement for Loan 3520-AR.
     Consequently, the mission asked EBY to forgive the resettlers' debt to EBY in those cases
     where there is no optionto move to a cost-free house.

             EBY has sincenotified the Bank that, although it is taking measures to ameliorate
     the impact of such debt on resettlers, it disagrees with the Bank's interpretation of the
     ResettlementPlan on this point and therefore is not in a position to forgive the totality of
     the debts in such cases. In particular, EBY maintainsthat the "free resettlement" policy
     cited by the Bank and contained in the Resettlement Plan appliesonly in the case of
     replacement homes designed and constructed after the November 1992date of the Loan
     3520-AR Loan Agreement, and not to houses which were designed prior to that date and
     built in replacement of lesser quality structures occupied prior to the resettlement.

              The Bank contends that the free resettlement policy of the Resettlement Plan
     applies not only prospectively,but also retroactivelyto the housing solutions designed
     prior to November 1992(see para. 2 on page 59 of the ResettlementPlan, which text
     refers to the granting of alternative housing solutionsto those who had incurred debt in
     connectionwith pre-November 1992resettlement by EBY). Both EBY and the Bank are
     currently exchangingviews in an effort to resolve this disagreement.

     Claim 1. EBY has not compliedwith the quality standardsfor housingconstructionand
     has given houses of lesser quality (zinc roof, no internal doors, deficient electricaland
     sanitary installations).

     Response: The Bank is satisfiedthat construction of the replacement houses meets or
     exceeds the current local urban standardsfor the Province of Misiones. In a few cases (70

I                                                      3                                        ANNEX 1

     units out of 1,058),for cost-savings,but stillwith the current standards, EBY reduced the
     level of interior finishing and used galvanized corrugated zinc sheets for roofinginstead of
     ceramic tiles. Zinc roof is a common and highly acceptable solution in the Province of
     Misiones, and does not diminish the quality of the house. Electric and sanitary
     installations were given in good condition to relocated families. The EBY technicalteam
     reviewed them twice and familieswere given clear instructions for their use and
     maintenance. All installationswere tested in the presence of each family and, duringthe
     first months after the move, EBY technicians made all repairs at the request of the affected
     families.

             It should be noted that the houses in the A.1 settlement are of much better quality
     than those in the affected area, many of which were made out of wood and other non-
     durable materials, had no sanitaryservices and were periodically flooded. The average
     value of the previous houses ranged from: (i) $2,500 to $6,000 for houses owned by
     occupants (familieswith no legal rights on land), and (ii) $15,000to $45,000 for houses
     owned by legal tenants and middle income families. The estimatedvalue of the new
     houses provided by EBY to the population ranges from $20,000 to $36,000. The
     improvement in family patrimonyis not only recognized by the relocatees, but also
     documented by independentevaluators*.

     Claim 2: Accordingto the appraisal carried out by the ProvincialTribunalof Posadas
     (PTP), the value ofthe property in the A.1settlement is lessthan that estimatedby EBY.

     Response: The appraisal carried out by PTP in April 1997shows that property values in
     this settlement are about 21% - 25% below those estimated by EBY in 1995. PTP's
     appraisal is based on referenceunit prices of five other nearbyneighborhoodswith
     different characteristicsand servicesthat are not comparable among themselves nor
     comparable with the A.1 settlement. The appraisal carried out by PTP is not supported by
     a technical studythat would allow comparisons on the basis on homogeneous set of data.
     Because of the above, PTP estimations could only be considered as indicativevalues.

             Regardless of the assumptionsused by PTP, its appraisalshows a unit value of $17
     per square meter for plots located inside the compound, and $20 per square meter for
     properties facingthe main avenue (Avenida Lopez y Planes). These estimatesare not
     supported by the real market prices in the area. EBY is currentlypaying $21 per square
     meter in the Chacra 1023. There are also several properties for sale located on the main
     avenue with values of $41 and $46 square meter.

        Additionally,PTP estimatedthe value of infrastructurewith a methodologythat
assignsvalues to each plot in proportion to the number of square metersbuilt on it.
According to this methodology,the value of the property would be differentfor 2 plots
that have the same size, same location and same services, only because the number of
square meters of the house built on each one is different.

       Finally, sinceEBY and PTP appraisals were carried out on different dates, the unit
value for houses estimated by PTP may have been affected by lack of maintenance and
may not reflect the real value of the house when it was new and givento the affected
familyby EBY.

Claim 3: EBY must suspendthe title regularization process (boletode compraventay
cornodato)and proceed to review the conditions and covenants so far adopted by EBY in
such documents. Relocatees do not accept interest charges, financial obligationsor
mortgages (gravamen hpotecario) that will affect them for 30 years.

Response: We agree that property titles unencumbered by mortgages should be issued in
those cases to which exceptionsto the free resettlement policy (see third paragraph of
page 1 above) do not apply. In addition, ail debts arising in contravention of that policy
should be annulled and EBY shouldtake steps to reimburse relocatees for debt payments
collected in contravention of that policy.

                                Resettlement Program (PARR)

                                     Land Tenure Aspects


A        Introduction

1.       This note addresses land tenure issues related to the Resettlement Program

families: what are the procedures that need to be followed, where are the bottienecks, and
(PARR)of the Yaveta Iíprojem. The focus is on de!ivery of fuil titie to resettled

what can be done to speed up the process?

2.       The note begins with a synopsis of p e ~ e naspects of Iand law in .&gentina and
                                                         t
Paragay, and continues with destion of h e main issues related to the attribution of Iirll
titie to the prope.rties occiipied by resettled funilies. It conciudes with the next steps that
are recommended in order to ensure dehery of titles in the shortest possible time.


B.       Land Law inArgentina

3.       The basic e!emems of land le@slation hArgeritina are derived from the French
Napoleonic Code, put in place in the 19th c t m and still ~in use today. As Lithe French
                                                        ~ ~
sysrem, there are two types of public land (dominio publico del estado; dominio privado
de1 estado). Expropriation procedures u e the same, parUcuiuiy the key aspect that the
land expropriated can be used for the intended public purpose before the compensation
award is decided.

4.       Acquisition of landfor publicpurposes. There are two ways ar public authorities
to acquire Iand for project purposes: by agrement, and by expropriation. In Argentina,
the shonhand for these methods is "acuerdo" and "juicio." About hdf ofEBY's
acquisitions for Yacyreta have been by accierdo, and haif by juicio.
EBY may offer a premium of 10% overmarket price to encoura,oethe owner to agree

is regmered at the Registro Pubiico in the name ofEBY. The ecribano publico (a
amicably to the acquisition. Inthis acuerdo case, when agreement is reached the propexty
Govenrment civil servant acting as intermediary bemeen EBY and the beneficiary in this
case) is in charge of delivering titie to the beneficiary. EBY pays all costs of land titling,
including the expenses of the escribano. In the "juicio" cases, a few of the disagreements
have been over low prices offered by EBY, but far more hzve been because of clouded or
unclear title to the land. Law No. 21.499 of 1977, the basic expropriation law of

ExpropriationDecree (Declaracion de utilidad publica) signals the transfer of the property
Argentina, is included as Annex 1. In both the acuerdo andjuicio cases the issuance of the

into public hands, EBY in this case, for project use. The process does not have to be
long: the exproptiation of land at Santa Tecia by EBY took only two months (from
March to May 1993). The expopriation decree for Santa Tecla is attached as Annex 2.

for the past ten years. Without this attestation, the titlingprocess stops.
5.      In order to obtain title, evidence must be shown of payment of aii relevant taxes


6.      Application to Yacyreta. A separate Generic Land Law, approved in 1980,covers
the application of the above legislation in the specific case of Yacyreta. This original
GenericLand Law for Yacyreta, Law No. 22.3 13, is included as Annex 3. It was valid for

extends the GenericLand Law until 2000, and is consequently stillin force.
I O years, until 1990. Another law (No. 23.351, approved in 1990,included as h e x 4),


C.      Land Law in Paraguay

7.      In Paraguay, existing legislation is basically similar to that of Argentina, but the
application to Yacyreta reflects mo main dfierences. First, sincethe pace of
decentralization in Paraguay has been slow, local districts are by and large not geared up
to process land titles, even though a SeMcio de Catastro may exist. This means that
many key decisions in the titling process need to be made in Asuncion. Second, there is
no basic land law inParaguay comparable to Law 21.499in Argentina. This means there
is no ley-marco on which to draw for legislation applying specifically to Yacyreta, and that
legislation is therefore likelyto take much more time than in Argentina. A'Generic Land
Law for Yacyreta was approved in Paraguay only in September 1994. It is included as
Annex 5. It should be noted that unlike kgentina, this legislation covers up to Level 76
only. A new law coveringup to Level 83 was submittedto the ParaguayanLegislature in
November 1995,but has not yet been acted upon.

8.      The function of the escribano publico is identicalin ParagJay to that in Argentina.
The main differenceis that the escribano in Paraguay needs to deal more with the capital,
especiallythe Registro Nacional de Catastro Publico, in additionto the local district.

9.
for the past four years. Without this attestation, the titling process stops.
        in order to obtain title, evidence must be shown of payment of aiirelevant taxes



D.       Tenure and Titling Issues in Yaqreta Resettlement

10.     Whether in Argentina or Paraguay, families to be resettled typicallyhave no
written evidence of tenure. When they are resettled, they are given an occupancy
certificate called a contrato de comodato. The contrato de comodato in use in Argentina
is attached as Annex 6, and that used in Paraguay is included as h e x 7.

1I.      The comodato certificate confers only usuhct, or the right to occupy and use the
property. No payment is made to obtain it. The comodato cannot be sold, and cannot be
used at a bank as coIlateral. Sub-letting is prohibited (althoughis occurs with some
frequency at Yacyreta). For these reasons resettled families may be initiallypleased with a

comodato, but later on when they learn its limitations, end up placing a low value on it.
They want fulltitle.

12.     Before the process of conversion from comodato to titulo is described, it will be
usem to mention a third land tenure instrument, the boleto de compra-venta. This
instrument has several featureswhich make it inappropriate for resettlement. Monthly
payments are required for 30 years, like a mortgage, a financialburden which should not
be placed on families being involuntarily resettled. Also,unlike a mortgage, equity does
not build up. The payer of the monthiy amount does not own anything until ail payments
are made, at which time full title is given. Fortunately, the boleto de compra-venta was
used oniy at the first Argentine resettlement site ( k e a A.i), and EBY has sincemoved
away ?om it. An example of a boleto de compra-venta is included as Annexes 8 (with
housing credit) and 9 (without housing credit). The boleto de compra-venta is used rarely

boleto de compra-venta is attached as Annex 10.
in Paraway, and not at d in Yacyreta. An example of a model form for the Paraguay


12.
contrato de comodato to a titulo de propiedad. Examples of titles are included as Annex
        in summary, the land titling process in Yacyreta consists of moving familiesfi-oma
11 (Argentina) and 12 (Paraguay).


the authorizationto proceed, they can deliver titles fairly quickly and efficiently. This
13.     EBY's experience with escribanos publicos shows that once the escribanos receive

authorizationto proceed does not come from EBY. It comes from local governments or
other agencies in the form of approval of Site Plans (Plan de Loteamiento) for the
resettlement areas. Approval of Site Plans is the main bottleneck in the deliveryof
land titles in Yacyreta.

14.     Annex 13 shows, for each resettlement area in Paraguay and Argentina, the entity
responsible for approving SitePlans. The Site Plans are not compiicated, and approval
should be quick. Yet, as shown in Annex 13, some Site Plans were submitted for approval
up to two years ago, and are still pending. Where Site Plans have been approved, as in
Atinguy  - Phase I, Buena   Vista, and San Cosme (Paraguay) and Area A.1(Argentina), the
bottleneck is basically lifted and the process can be completed. Annex 14summarizes the
present status of change from comodato to titulo for each resettlement area. In 7of the 12
areas, this change has not begun and everyone still has comodatos.


E.      Recommendations

15.     The following next steps are recommended:
        *      Because of the weakness of local authorities, EBY with few staff is
                carrying out tenure and titling activities that the local governments
                should be performing. EBY should liaise with these authorities
               to gradually transfer responsibilities to them.

      *   A line item for training and other assistanceto local land offices
          should be included in the PARR budget.
      *   Contact should be made as soon as possible, and sustained
          through involvement of travelingmission staff and the
          FacilitatingOffice inAsuncion, with the agencies listed in
          Annex 13to encourage rapid approval of SitePlans
      *   EBY land units in both Argentina and Paraguay should designate
          a focal point for close monitoring of the land titling process,
          no matter which unit within EBY is in charge.
      *   Approval of Paraguay basic legislation for Yacyreta applying
          up to Level 83.
      *   Closemonitoring should also be carried out in the basic PARR
          tables, especiallythe table entitled "Solucionesrurales por
          asentamientos   - Margen   ParaguayaMargen Argentina." Land
          titling status can either be in a separate column, or in the
          existingbox ``Ir&aestmctura y servicios."
      *   Land tenure and titling aspects are not covered in the PARR
          monitoring reports, both dated March 1995,prepared by the
          Universityof Misiones. A section on such aspects should be
          included in each monitoringreport until aU titles are delivered.

                       POPULATIONLIVING IN THE A 3.2 NEIGHBORHOOD


  Background: Please refer to the background section in Annex 1.

  Claim 1: In at least one particular case, EBY is attemptingto collect an interest charge
  that has not been set forth in the purchase agreement signed between EBY and the
  beneficiary.

  Response: The interest payment is included within the Pesos 61.80installment payable
  every month over the 30-year period of the mortgage. These installments are explicitly
  mentioned in the sale agreement submitted to the InspectionPanel; thus, the relevant
  amounts have not been hidden from the buyer in question (although itemizingwhich
  portion of that Pesos 61.80payment was attributableto principal and which portion was
  attributableto interest would have made the text clearer).

  Claim 2: EBY is attemptingto colíect financial charges, despitethe fact that the school
  has not been completedyet, there is no permanent water supply, and the police and health
  posts do not exist to meet the neighborhood's needs.

  Response: It is the Bank's understandingthat the charges levied by EBY arenot to
  recover the cost of public services. Moreover, the issuance of the property title does not
  depend on the completion of communal infrastructure(school,health post, police post,
  kindergarten, etc.), some of which did not even exist in the affected neighborhoods
  located near the river.

          It is important to note that prior to the relocation of the population, the houses in
  A 3.2were equippedwith electricity, water and sewerage pipeline systems, at an average
  investment of about $29,000 per family. On the other hand, completion of school,
  kindergarten, health and police posts were delayed due to: (i) bankruptcy and
  abandonment of the contractorresponsiblefor the works; (ii) vandalism (details given in
  the Resettlement MonitoringReport No. 2 of March 1995)of the works after the
  contractor left; and (iii) EBY's shortage of hnds that delayed implementation. In June
  1997,EBY signed a new contractto fìnish the communal infrastructure.

          Despite the delays, the majority of relocated children(64%) have been attending

  classesin more distant neighborhoodslocated more than 4 km away. The latter group
  classes at nearby schoolslocated less than 2 km away from their homes, while 34% attend

  usually takes a public bus at a cost of $0.40per day. According to EBY, 18%of the
  children do not attend classes due to capacitylimitationsin nearby schoolsor due to
  economic difficultiesof their families.

          Attendance at other schools will continueuntil the new school for the A 3.2
  settlement is finished. To completethe works, EBY has hired a new constructionfirm

                                              2                                  ANNEX 2

which resumed works in June 1997. It is expected that the school will be ready by mid
August and the remaining of the infrastructureworks by December 1997. It is expected
that the schoolwill be hlly operationalfor the next academicyear.

        Regarding the health post, it should be noted that the permanent facilityis
presently being constructedand in the mean-time, the post operatesin a house provided by
EBY to the Ministry of Public Health. These health services are the responsibilityof the
MPH and followthe standardsagreed in the Ministry of Public Health.

        With regard to water supply, althoughthe pipeline has been installed, the system
will not be operationaluntil MOS (the local water company) completesthe expansionof
the treatment water plant to assurethe required water quantities. It is expectedthat by
December 1997both the water and the sewerage systemwill be operational. Meanwhile
and since 1994, when the first families settled in the new compound, EBYhas been
providing water by deep water wells and complemented by trucks to all relocated families.
This servicewill continue until the systemis fully operational and has been taken over by
APOS.

Claim 3: The housing developmentis located 10kms from downtownPosadas. Affected
people need to go downtown for food because there is no food market in the
neighborhood. This implies extra transportation costs and time that they did not have
before the relocation.

Response: The followingconsiderationsshouldbe taken into account to understand the
above claim: (i) the population settled in the A.3.2compound camefrom areas, near the
river, which were subject to periodic floods and characterizedby highly deteriorated
sanitaryconditions;(ii) due to the high demographicdensityin the city ofPosadas,it was
not possible to relocatethe populationdowntown without displacingthousands of
families; (iii)the A 3.2settlementhas good sanitaryconditionsand its locationwas known
in advance and accepted by the affected population; and (iv) duringthe present decade,
the city has grown to a point where the A 3.2 settlementis connectedto the urban
transport net. It is understandablethat there is no well developed commercial area in the
new settlement,precisely because it is new. It is also clear that prices and market
opportunities in A 3.2cannotbe compared with those in downtownPosadas. On the
other hand, downtownPosadasis not the only option for those living in A 3.2,who can
shop in the small familybusinesses existingin the new settlement,which were relocated
with EBY assistance. Thereare also supermarkets and commercialareaslocated within a
3 km distance.

        It is true that there has been a changein the compositionofthe relocatedfamilies'
expenditures. Becauseof new urban transportation needs, family expendituresfor this
item have slightlyincreased (5% to 7%). This increment has been documentedby the

            SMALLBRICK MAKERS OF GARUPA AND CANDELARIA


Background

         In 1993EBY and the Secretariat of Mines and Geology of the Province of
Misiones signed an agreement aimed at solving the problems suffered by brick makers
(oleros) resulting from the filling of the Yacyretá reservoir. To definethe total number of
affected oleros and therefore those entitled to resettlement, a new field survey was carried
out. The survey concluded that 443 oleros were to be affected, including 66 oleros of the
Garupa and Candelaria area who were not surveyed by EBY in the 1989-1990census, and
who are now included in EBY's official list of beneficiaries. EBY and the provincial
government agreed that 235 oleros (those included in EBY's 1989-1990census)will be
assisted by EBY, and the remaining 208 (settledbetween 1990and 1994)will be assisted
by the government of the Province of Misiones.

         In July 1994a mechanism for consultation and decisionmaking was created, the
so-called Mesa de Cuncertación,which included representativesof all affected brick
maker neighborhoods. Relocation alternatives, benefits, overall program and timetable
were discussed among participantsof theMesa de Cuncertación,EBY, affected parties
and the Provincial Government. Allagreements were reached by consensusor majority
(for details, see records of the meetings of theMesa de Cuncertación,dated August, 1994
and June 1995,in Attachment 1). Between 1994and 1995, 94 oleroswere relocated by
EBY in the Nemesio Parma area (identifiedby the Provincial Government as the best
source of non-river clay deposits, based on quality and reserves).

         In April 1995a group of brick makers requested cash compensation,instead of
relocation. Although cash compensation was not foreseenin the Resettlement Plan and
was not part ofthe policy agreed with the Bank, EBY accepted the request based on the
fact that 99% of the olerosto be relocated in the Second Stage did not want any solution
other than cash` (see Attachment 2). In June 1995,EBY, on the basis of an evaluation of
the production levels and characteristics of each productiveunit, made a proposal for
compensation, rangingbetween $6,500 to $16,000 per relevant unit. The oleros'
representatives did not object to EBY's proposals. Based on this agreement,EBY's
Administrative Council issued Resolutions Nos. 652/96 and 685/96, spelling out EBY's
official policy adopted on this matter as well as the plan, by stages, for implementation of
the oleros' relocationhndemnification. By receiving cash cornpensation,EBY's
obligations ceased and no further claims were to be accepted.

Current Situation

        At the present time the situation is as follows:
               94 oleroswere relocated in the Nemesio Parma area and received plots
               with clay and technical assistance that still is being provided;
               12oleros, by their own decision, were relocated in the rural areasof Santa
               Tecla and Campo Godoy;
               216received compensationin cash;
               one of the oleros died, five more left the area, and one, Mr. Ruben
               Femandez, did not accept any of EBY's proposals;
               48 oleros (SantaRita) received cash compensation. Paymentswere
               completed in September 1996;and
               66 oleros of Garupá and Candelariareceived 100%ofthe compensation
               agreed. Last payment were made on July 30, 1997.

Claim 1. The censuses carried out by EBY were not accurate and were not adjusted.

Response: EBY's census, carried out in 1989/1990,was updated in 1993by the Mines
and GeologyDivisionof the Provincial Government. Areas not previously includedwere
incorporated in the revised census. For details, please refer to the first paragraph in the
Background Sectionabove.

Claim 2. There arebrick makers affected by the reservoir elevation76m that have not
received any solutionup to date.

Response: All oleros affectedby reservoir elevation 76m, with the exceptionof one olero
who had not accepted any solutionproposed by EBY, have been either relocated or been
compensatedin cash. For details, please refer to the Background Sectionabove.

Claim 3. Payments made by EBY to indemnifjdcompensatebrick makers arenot enough.
Theywere accepted due to the necessity (economicsituation)and shouldbe reviewed and
increased.

Response: Compensationin cash paid by EBY ranges from $6,500 for smallunits
producing less than 7,500 bricks/ month, to $16,000 for largerunits producing more than
30,000 brickdmonth. In all cases, the amount paid is equivalentto the expectedfamily
income over a period of five years. This amount, estimated as the productive life of the
clay deposits moreover, is considered adequateto reestablishtheir lost productiveunit and
house.

       It is important to note that for those oleros who selected relocation instead of
cash, the average investmentmade by EBY per relocated familywas about $27,500 (land
and house and a servicedplot for production). These figures do not includethe cost of

                                              3                                  ANNEX 3

the technical and social assistance program carried out during the last two years. As a
result, it is not surprisingthat those who voluntarily selected cash compensationinstead of
relocation are now requestingadditionalmoney. We believe that there is nojustification
for such a request.

Claim 4. Olerosin Garupa and Candelariamust be relocated under the same conditions
as those relocated in Posadas.

Response: EBY and the oleros of Garupa and Candelariahave agreed on cash
compensation,currentlybeing paid by EBY, on the sameterms as for the other oleros.
For details, please refer to the Background Section above.

Claim 5. Compensationpaid by EBY onlybenefited the owners of the olerias(smallbrick
industries)but not their helpers, who lost theirjobs.

Response: The ResettlementPlan anticipatedthe relocation and economicrecovery of
the affected olerias,in order to assure continuity of the activity. However, 99% of the
oleros to be affected by furtherreservoir elevationsrequested cash compensationinstead
of relocation assistedby EBY. Oncethe compensationwas paid, owners of the olerias
were free to exercisetheir discretionas to whether or not to continue with their
manufacturing activity. Many of them opted to continue, for example, in the Arroyo
Zaiman area; othersin exercise of their entrepreneurialrights decided not to continuewith
the oleria and shifted to new economic activities. In conformitywith the Bank's
resettlementpolicy, the loss of employment due to the personal choice of the affected
owner falls beyond the purview of EBY and the Bank.

Claim 6. In the last two years, EBY has left the oleroswith no land, means of production
andjobs. They claim compensationfor the damage duringthat period, as well as houses
and land.

Response: Replacementhouses and land, as well as technical assistanceto continuewith
the brick making activity, were given to those who selected relocation assistedby EBY.
Ontop ofthis, EBY provided clay delivered at the siteof production. For thosewho
selected compensationin cash, no further entitlementfor housing and land is required.

Claim 7. All olerosthat selected cash compensationinstead of relocationreceived the
amount agreed upon with oleros representatives in June 1995(see records of the meeting).
Compensationwas based on the level of production of eachbrick maker and equivalentto
the expected family income over a period of five years. For those that selected cash
compensation,no other entitlement was required. However, after receivingthe money, a
group of oleros decided to invade emptypublic lands (tierrasfiscales)in the site called "El
Povenir" which had been selected by EBY and the Provincial Governmentto relocate
brick makers affected by elevation above 76m. After the occupation,they requested EBY
to improve accessand demanded servicesfromthe local government. Accesswere
improved by EBY and electricity was providedby the municipality.

Response: It is correct that there were families affected by the Yacyretá project who
were not initiallyincluded in EBY's census of 1989/1990, due to the followingfactors:
(i) many families cameto the area after the census was concluded; and (ii) the Garupa and
Candelaria area was not surveyed. Consequently, a follow-up censuswas undertaken in
1993 and adjustmentswere made to take into account all of the above cases.

        EBY has no obligationto assisting any oleros who may have settled illegallyin the
affected area since 1993. According to the last Provincial Demographic Census,
population migration from rural areas has resulted in the establishmentof 18new
neighborhoods (around 6,900 inhabitants) in the city ofPosadas. Likewise, according to
EBY estimates, there are about 1,800familiesthat recently settled in the project affected
area (between 76m and 83m). On average, this represents one new family per day.
According to the proposed amendment to the Third Owners' Agreement,the
relocationícompensation of these additional familieswould be the responsibility of the
Government of Argentina.

                MUNICIPALCOUNCILOF THE CITY OF POSADAS


        The MunicipalInter-institutionalCouncil for the Yacyreta project presented
several complaintsgrouped in three different areas: environment, productive activities,
and social activities. Below are the claimsand responses grouped accordingly:

Environment

Claim 1. No studiesnor finalprojects have been prepared for coastaltreatment,and the
urban creeks did not receive treatment. This resulted in a continuousgrowingof
unhealthy vegetable mass.

Response: Coastaltreatment studiesand designs are being planned for reservoir
operation at higher elevations. At the actual elevationof 76m, there has been a minimum
of disruption of coastal areas. Nevertheless,the areas that were flooded were cleaned of
construction wastes, latrines were closed and sanitized, and outstandingtreeswere
removed in some areas;in addition minor erosionprotection workswill be executed as
needed during reservoir operation at elevation 76m. Major coastal protectionworks are
not envisioned except for reservoir operationat 83m. For lowerreservoir operation,
water levelsin the flood plain will continueto behave in the same manner as in natural
conditionsfor flows above those that can be controlledby the operatinglevel. Lateral
bays are of minimum size at elevation 76m. Pollution of urban streamsis caused by
untreated sewagedisposal, not by reservoir levels.

Claim 2. There are no studiesto determineand monitor the behavior of underground
waters and fi-eaticlevels.

Response: Groundwaterbehavior will be studiedunder a hydrogeological studyto be
carried out by an international firm. Appointment of the consultant is expectedby
September 1997, and the works should start shortlyafter. The results of this study will
help to establishthe specificrequirements for reservoir operationat higher levels.

Claim 3. The projects and works to coverthe overall seweragesystemof the city of
Posadas have been stopped because the main collectors and treatment plant (underthe
responsibilityof EBY) have not materialized yet. No works have been executedto
alleviatethe existing environmentalimpact.

Response: The sewagecollection works for Posadas as a whole have not been affected
by delays in the constructionof the main collectors and treatmentplant by EBY. The lack
of progress to date has been caused by APOS's inabilityto handle the construction and
operation of the new system. World Bank financing of the water and sewagecollection
systems in Posadas is conditioned on improvementsin APOS's institutionalcapacityand
appointmentof a private operatorfor the operation and maintenance ofthe system and
construction of new facilities. The bids for the construction of the main collectors and

                                               2                                    ANNEX 4

treatment plant were received by EBY, and the construction contract is expectedto be
awarded in September 1997.

ProductiveActivities

Claim 4. The fishing activity downstreamof the dam has practicallydisappearedbecause
of the reduced fish migrationthrough the fishtransfer facilitiesat the Yacyretá dam.

Response: It is true that the Yacyretá Dam (and any other large dam of its kind) serves as
a barrier to natural fish migration patterns, with limited fish passage upriver throughthe
fish elevators and downriver through the turbines and spillways. Nonetheless, the
monitoring being carried out under the Yacyretá Project indicatesthat many commercially
valuable fish speciesremain abundant, both above and below the dam. Within one
kilometer upriver and down river of the dam, fishing is prohibited for safety reasons and to
improve sustainability,sincethe concentration of migratory speciesbelow the dam makes
them unnaturally easyto catch. Illegal fishingwithin this prohibited zone remains a
problem (mostly in Paraguayan waters), although it has apparently declined due to recent
enforcement efforts. Outside of this prohibited zone, fishingactivityremains high, both
up- and downriverof the dam.

Claim 5. Because of the Yacyretá project, the brick makers production has been reduced.
The situationis aggravatedby the fact that the new clay depositsgivento the relocated
oleros do not have enoughclay and, if they do, they are of poor quality.

Response: Based on the recommendations of the TechnicalReport prepared by the Mines
and GeologyDivision of the Province of Misiones, EBY bought land with clay depositsin
Nemesio Parma and relocated oleros affectedby elevation 76m. Accordingto the
mentioned report, clay deposits had adequate and sufficient clay for ten years' production.
For efficiencypurposes in clay exploitationand because of the characteristicsof the
material (not as good as the river clay deposits), the report recommended technological
adaptations,technical assistance, and communal exploitationof the clay deposits. In
1994,ninety three productiveunits were relocated by EBY. The olerosrejected
communalexploitation, and decided instead on a division of plots, individuallyown and
exploited, taking the risk that some of them might not necessarily have clayin their
property (see records of the meeting dated 20/07/94). In July 29, 1997,EBY received 6
offersin response to the bidding for provisionof the equipment(truck and excavation
equipment). EBY is currently assessing the offersin order to adjudicatethe contract.

        EBY provided technical assistanceto recover previous production levelsbut has
encountered an unforeseen difñculty. Contrary to the findingsof the TechnicalReport,
the replacementclay deposits do not have the quantity and quality required for the
brickmakingproduction. Thiswas confirmed by anEBY study carried out in 1996,one
and a half years after the relocation. To solvethis problem, EBY has developed several
complementaryalternatives including access to river clay depositsstill available in the
zone already acquiredby EBY, technical assistanceto those using the available material

                                                                                                m       x
.    I    i                                                 3                                             4

              (non-river clay), productiveprograms for developing complementaryincome sources,
              such as gardeningand domestic animals, and organizationof a cooperativeto help in
              solvingproduction problems.During a supervision mission in March 1997,EBY and the
              Bank agreed, additionally, to provide the oleros with equipment (trucks and excavation
              equipment)for transport and gatheringof material fromriver clay deposits and other clay
              sources. This agreementis currentlyunder implementation.

              Claim 6. There are200 brick makers still waiting for a solutionfrom EBYto their
              problems.

              Response: All the olerosexcept one have been either relocated or given cash
              compensation, includingthose located in Garupa and Candelaria.

              Claim 7. Someof the brick makers had to accept miserable compensationfromEBY and
              relocate themselvesto the Porvenir area.

              Response: All olerosthat selected cash compensationinstead of relocationreceived the
              amount agreedupon with olerosrepresentatives in June 1995(seerecords of the meeting).
              Compensationswere based onthe level of production of eachbrick maker and equivalent
              to the expectedfamilyincome over a period of fiveyears. For those that selected cash
              compensation,no other entitlement was required. However, afterreceivingthe money, a
              group of oleros decided to invade empty public lands (tierras fiscales)in the site called "El
              Porvenir" which had been selected by EBY and the Provincial Government to relocatethe
              brick makers affectedby elevation above 76m. After the occupation,they requestedEBY
              to improve access and demanded servicesfrom the local government. The accesswere
              improved by EBY and electrify was provided by the municipality.

              Social Activities

              Claim 8. Under Argentine law, the fact that realty in the Yacyretá area has been declared
              subjectto expropriationsince 1980means that owners of affected land arerestricted in
              their abilityto improvetheir propertiesbecause improvementsmade after the declaration
              of expropriabilitywill not be compensated by the expropriatingparty. Also as a result of
              this legal situation, areasto be flooded by the Yacyretá reservoir do not receivebasic
              services (water supply, transportationand others) fromthe municipal or provincial
              authorities.

              Response: Argentina'sexpropriationlaw (No. 21499,first published on January21,
              1977) applies in the Yacyretá case and indeed does specifjin its Article 11that
              "compensationwill not be awarded for improvements, except necessary ones, that are
              made to the property after the property was officiallydeclaredto be subjectto
              expropriation"("nose indemnizarán las mejorasrealizadas en el bien con posterioridad al
              acto que lo declaró afectado a expropiación, salvo las mejoras necesarias"). This in no
              way means that owners cannot improve their properties; in fact, ownerswho made
              improvementssoon afterthe Yacyretá area was declared subjectto expropriationin 1980

                                               4                                  ANNEX 4

have had almosttwenty years duringwhich to enjoy such improvements. It does mean,
however, that such ownersmay find a legal bar to compensationfor such improvements
when actual expropriation doestake place (prior to the actual expropriationof their
properties), unless they can demonstratethat the improvementswere "necessary"(building
an addition to a houseto accommodatea growingfamily is an exampleof a necessary
improvement).

         L,egalprovisions such as those contained in the cited Article 11have a sound basis
in that they are designed to discourage speculativeimprovementswhich can result in an
unwarranted drain on the resources of the expropriating authorities and can thus harm the
interests of the tax-paying citizenry at large. Only when, as in the Yacyretácase, actual
expropriationof propertiesaffected by such provisionsis unduly postponed (because of,
for example, constructiondelays) does the impact of such provisionsbecome larger.
However, it is possible that, in the face of such delays, Argentinecourts may be persuaded
to adopt an interpretationof the term "necessaryimprovements"that takes appropriate
account of the effect of time.

         As for the claimthat the local authorities, because of the impact of the
expropriationlaw, do not provide adequate infrastructurein areasto be flooded by the
reservoir,the key point is whether: (a) as a result of the Yacyretá project, servicesalready
present were removed from those areas by the authorities and not replaced; or (b) whether
it was reasonable to expect, in the absence of the Yacyretá project, that additional services
now missing in the areaswould have in fact been provided by the authorities. As for point
(a), we are not aware of any eliminationof previously existing services. As for point (b),
our understanding is that at least a portion of the areas in question would probablyhave
remained marginalized since the area is on a flood plain subjectto annual inundations.
Furthermore, now that the project is underway, a portion of such areas is also subjectto
illegal invasionby settlers and extendingpublic servicesto the areaswould only encourage
even more illegal settlers.

Comment on the List of Projects

         The reconstructionof affectedurban infrastructureis one of the most serious
challengesfor raising the reservoir to its highest operatinglevel. The list presented in the

required for elevation 83m. The necessary design, implementationchronogramsand
Council'sletter representsa best preliminaryestimate of the total works that will be

budgets for carrying out the constructionof urban infrastructurewill be part of the tasks
of an engineeringconsultingfirm to be hired in September 1997. Minor protection works
are envisionedfor intermediateoperatinglevels. Any urban area flooded at these
intermediatelevelswill be subjectto standard clean up operations(sealingof latrines, and
the removal of fences, trees, constructionwastes, trash, etc.).Water quality and vector
monitoring systemshave been in place since prior to reservoir filling. EBY, through a
Conveniowith the University of Misiones, has prepared a proposal for the implementation
of an industrialpollution control systemfor the uppershed (up to Itaipu) of the Parana
River.

  HONORABLE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVINCE OF
                                         MISIONES

Claim 1: The Governmentof Argentina (GOA) and EBY have failed to implementthe
resettlementand environmentalworks (defined as complementaryworks) required by the
project, as agreed with the Bank, and the Bank has failedto exercise its leverageto press
the Borrower to complywith agreed commitments. The Chamberrequest the Bank to use
all of its resourcesto ensurethat ailpending works are completed as planned.

Response: As previously reported to the Board, the Bank urged (on April 13, 1996)the
GOAto agree on a plan of actionto complete by December 1997all pending actions
related to elevation 76m, and to establishan escrow account for ensuring financingof
these works. On May 1996the plan of actionwas agreed. On July 1996a special
accountwas opened to start implementationof the most urgent works, and in October
1996the escrow account was established. As of June 30, 1997,74 % of the plan has been
executed and is expectedto be completed as scheduled.
         Because of the macroeconomiccrisisfaced by Argentina,the GOA decided to
reduce by half in 1995and to eliminatein 1996its budget contributionsto the project,
which delayed and almost stopped implementation of environmentaland resettlement
works required for reservoir elevations78m and 83m. In addition, because of the failure
of the Governmentsof Argentinaand Paraguay to completethese works through a
privatization scheme(rejected by both Congresses), the GOA decided to keep operating
the reservoir at elevation 76m until fùrther decisionsare taken to completethe project.
On December 1996,the Bank urged the GOAto agree on a Plan of Action to address the
adverseresettlement and environmental impactsresultingfrom the prolonged operationof
the reservoir at elevation76m. On January 1997,a Plan of Action satisfactoryto the
Bank was received, and by April 30, 1997,the GOA and EBY satisfied the major
institutional, administrative, and financialrequirementsto permit implementationof this
plan. Implementationof this plan, to be completedby December 1999,started in May
1997,and is progressing as planned. An amendmentto Bank Loans 3520-AR and 2854-
AR to support partial financing of the above plan is under discussionand is expectedto be
signed in late August 1997.

Claim 2: The Bank failedby approving a plan to raise the reservoirlevel by stages,first
to elevation 76m and later to elevations78m and 83m (finaldesign level). Consequently,
investmentsfor key resettlement and infrastructure works were postponed, in favor of
completingmajor civil works and electro-mechanicalinstallationsfor the power house.

Response: The GOA'Splan to raise the reservoir level to 76m was acceptedby the Bank
on the basis that: (i) reservoir elevationto 76m would take place in September 1994, after
completing all of the minimum strictlyneeded resettlement and environmentalworks; and
(ii) reservoir elevationto 78m would take place on September 1995,after completionof
ail agreed resettlement and environmentalworks needed for that phase; and then continue
to elevation 83m once the remainingresettlementwoks were done. Construction

                                               2                                  ANNEX 5


schedules for major civilworks and commissioning of generating units were to continue as
planned, along with the implementation of the environmental, resettlement and other
complementary works. Revenues from the GOA and from sales of electricitywere to
assist EBY in meetingits counterpart íùnds obligationsto the project. Accordingto the
plan, all works were to be done in sequence, and it is not correct to saythat the plan for
elevation 76m included a reprogramming and postponement of other resettlement and
environmental activitiesrequired for elevation 78m and 83m.

        In fact, reservoir elevationto 78m did not take place in September 1995,as
planned, because of the financial crisis explained . Although the Bank did not foresee, at
that time, the adverse impactsbecause of the prolonged operation at elevation 76m, the
Bank took a very strong position with the GOA, immediatelyaRer the GOAinformed the
Bank of its decisionto remain at elevation 76m for an unconfirmed period oftime. The
outcome of the Bank'sposition is precisely the base program (Plan B) that EBY is
implementing today.
