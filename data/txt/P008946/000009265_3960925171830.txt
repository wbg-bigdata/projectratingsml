SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2318-TU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Agricultural Credit Project (SACP) in Turkey, for which Loan 2318-TU, in the
amount of US$150.4 million, was approved on June 27, 1983. The loan was
closed on June 30, 1988, six months behind schedule. It was fully disbursed.
The PCR was prepared by FAO,CP. The Borrower, Turkiye Cumhuriyet
Ziraat Bankasi (Agricultural Bank of Turkey, TCZB) prepared its own PCR
excerpts of which are given in Annex 2.
Preparation of this PCR was initiated during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in October 1987, and is based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower;
internal Bank -emoranda; and information gathered by the FAO/CP mission which
visited Turkey in November 1989. The report was updated and appropriately
edited by Bank staff. The Government's and TCZB's comments to the PCR were
conveyed to us by letter of September 27, 1990 from the Undersecretariat of
Treasury and Foreign Trade (see Annex 3). The text has been revised in light
of these comments.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2318-TU)
Introduction
1.          The Second Agricultural Credit Project (SACP) was appraised in
November 1982 and approved by the Bank's Board in June 1983. Project cost was
US$363.5 million toward which the Bank provided a loan of US$150.4 million.
The loan closing date was extended once by six months from December 1987 as
stipulated in the Loan agreements to June 1988. The loan was fully disbursed.
Obiectives
2.          The main objectives were to: (a) increase agricultural production
and to raise the productivity and income of farmers by supporting TCZB in its
lending activities in those areas where the Government has undertaken to
intensify support services to farmers; (b) further encourage institution
building of TCZB through: (i) an agreed Action Plan for its reorganization and
strengthening, and (ii) provision of staff training and equipment; (c) address
sectoral issues of on-lending interest rates and strengthening of credit
cooperatives through seeking agreement with the Government to: (i) achieve
real positive on-lending interest rates in the agriculture sector by end 1984,
and (ii) arrange for a study to develop a 5-year plan for development of the
credit cooperative system, which may form the basis of a future project for
possible Bank financing.
ImRlementation Experience
3.          The loan became effective after 10 months in April 1984 following
two delays involving a total of six months. Despite initial delays, the
credit program was successfully implemented. Disbursements by TCZB under the
on-farm development component expressed in 1983 TL terms exceeded appraisal
estimates by 345% in the short-term credit category and 57% in the medium-
term credit category. Conversely, credit demand in Government-assisted
special schemes was far less than anticipated at appraisal. Accordingly,
funds from the slow-moving special schemes components were reallocated to the
short-term credit category in the on-farm development component.



- iv -
4.          There were initial delays by TCZB in implementing the
institutional reforms stipulated in the project. However, after 1986, TCZB
started in earnest to implement the reforms and, by the end of the project, it
had carried out most of them. Of the US$4.7 million allocation for vehicles
and equipment only US$147,000 was actually used for procurement, the remainder
reallocated to the on-farm development component. TCZB's request for
reallocation of proceeds was based upon a reduction in the number of armored
vehicles required. While this request may have been influenced by earlier
Bank refusal to modify Bank procurement requirements, the Bank chose not to
question the reasons given for the request and agreed to reallocate funds to
meet the larger than expected demand for short-term credit funds.
Results
5.          The project was successful in attaining its principal objectives
of providing credit for increased agricultural production and strengthening
TCZB. About 200,000 farmers or 74% of the appraisal target benefited from the
credits under the project, and there was substantial increase in production of
agricultural crops financed, particularly cereals. TCZB's lending policies
and procedures were modified to facilitate adequate credit flow to f.armers,
its organization made more functional and steps taken to introduce improved
management information and accounting systems. The project, however, did not
succeed in its sectoral objective of raising preferential on-lending in1:erest
rates to positive levels in real terms by end-1984. Interest rates were
raised to positive real levels in 1986 (the revised target) but accelerated
inflation made rates negative again thereafter.  A study of .ne agricultural
credit cooperative (TKK) system with a development plan was completed.
However, the institutional development component proposed for inclusion in the
Third Agricultural Credit Project was dropped because TCZ;3 refused to bear the
credit risk for onlending to TKK for such purposes.
Sustainability
6.          The sustainability of the credit program supported under the
project will depend on TCZB ensuring that farmers continue to get timely and
adequate loans. More cooperation will a4lso be required between TCZB and MAFRA
if farmers are to get the full benefits of credit and extension. The
sustainability of institutional reforms will depend on TCZB's ability to
continuously review its policies and procedures and introduce changes whenever
deemed necessary, even if it involves departure from traditional practices.
Findings and lessons
7.          The main lessons learnt from this project concern institutional
aspects. The project has shown how institutional reform is particularly slow
and difficuit in a government-owned organization with a long history and
established practices and traditions. Timely implementation of key decisions
requires the full involvement and commitment of senior officials which
sometimes proves elusive. The project has also shown that, in order to effect
basic changes down the line, the mere issuing of instructions from head office
is not adequate. The branch staff need to be educated and convinced about the
benefits and advantages that will be derived from the changes.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2318-TU)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BQAK'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Project Identity
Name:             Second Agricultural Credit Project (SACP)
Loan No.:         2318-TU
RVP Unit:         EMENA Region
Country:          Turkey
Sector:           Agriculture
B. Background
1.          The Second Agricultural Credit Project (SACP) was one of several
projects identified for possible Bank financing by an agricultural sector
mission which visited Turkey !n early 1981. The project, which was to
continue the efforts started under the first Agricultural Credit and Agro-
industries Project (ACAP), was prepared by TCZB with FAO/CP assistance in
September 1982, appraised by the Bank in November 1982, approved by the Bank's
Board in June 1983, and became effective in April 1984 after a delay of six
months. It closed at the end of June 1988 after a six-month extension. A
follow-up project, the Third Agricultural Credit Project, became effective in
November 1989.
2.          The agriculture sector in Turkey plays a significant role in
generating employment, meeting domestic food requirements, supplying
industrial raw materials and generating foreign exchange. Throughout the
1970s, the country's agricultural policies stressed self-sufficiency in food
production and, between 1972 and 1975, sought to achieve this through
subsidized inputs and producer prices. These policies stimulated rapid growth
in production. However, the sectoral growth rates slowed down to l.5X per
year in the late 1970s, largely due to a sharp reduction in the incentives,
ineffective investment policies, weak technical services and inadequate
marketing and credit systems. Beginning 1980, the Government, with Bank
assistance, started taking steps to carry out policy reforms and improve the
agricultural support services, including the credit delivery system.
3.          In mid-1982, a World Bank (WB) agricultural sector mission
concluded that there was a need to more than double in real terms the existing
flow of credit to the farming community by 1990 if production and export
growth targets for the agriculture sector were to be realized. The credit
requirements would consist mostly of short-term production credits at least
until the mid-1980s, but a strong investment credit demand could develop later
in the decade. The magnitudes clearly exceeded the existing capabilities of



-2-
the formal agricultural credit system to service, and probably exceeded the
financial sector's resource mob.'lization cap: ility as construed.  Remedial
actions were therefore called for both to generate additional funds for on-
lending to farmers, and to improve the loan generation, processing and
supervision capabilities of on-lending institutions. Because of its size and
importance TCZB - the largest bank in the country and the only one with
branches ir all rural areas - was to remain a key element of this strategy,
and strong mepsures were needed to improve its internal efficiency and expand
its resource base so that it could extend loans to more farmers on a timely
and adequate basis. The SACP was conceptualized with the above strategy in
mind.
C. Proiect Objectives and DescriRtion
4.          Proiect objectives.  In furtherance of the initiatives taken under
ACAP to build up th( a&icultural credit system in Turkey, the SACP objectives
were to: (a) increase agricultural production and to raise the productivity
and income of farmers by supporting TCZB in its lending activities in those
areas where the Government has undertaken to intensify support services to
farmers; (b) further encourage institution building of TCZB through: (i) an
agreed Action Plan for its reorganization and strengthening, and (ii)
provision of staff training and equipment; (c) address sectoral issues of on-
lending interest rates and strengthening of credit cooperatives through
seeking agreement with the Government to: (i) achieve real positive on-
lending interest rates in the agriculture sector by end 1984, and (ii) arrange
for a study to develop a 5-year plan for development of the credit cooperative
system, which may forr the basis of a futv'f project for possible Bank
financing.
5.          Project descriRtion.  The SACP provided for:
(a)   On-fam development.  Medium-term loans for farm machinery,
livestock, etc. to 6,500 farmers and short-term loans for working
capital needs to 70,000 farmers, in 10 selected provinces of
Turkey, where Government planned to intensify general extension
services;
(b)   Second croRs scheme.  Short-term loans to 60,000 farmers to grow a
second crop on about 220,000 ha of irrigated areas in 15
provinces;
(c)   Fallow reduction scheme.  Short-term loans to 50,000 farmers to
grow crops on about 265,000 ha of land in 12 provinces, which were
left fallow;
(d)   Igdir-Aksur-Ereghi-Ercis (IAEE) Irrigation comnonent.  Short- and
medium-term loans to 2',000 farmers, to meet their on-farm
investment and production credit needs in the areas covered by the
Government's irrigation development scheme (Loan 2433-TU);



- 3 -
(e)   Corum-Cankili  =.RgU=.  Sbort-term loans to 6C,,000 farmers in
areas covered by the Bank-assisted Corum-Gank4.ri Rur4l Development
Project (Loan 1130-TU);
(f)   Inatitutional strengthnLng of TCZB through: (i) implementation of
the Action Plan for its reorganization arid improvement in its
operatic-i; (i) provision of consultant services in carrying out
a system and procedures study, an accounting system study and any
other studies to be agreed between the Bank and TCZB;
(iii) provision of training abroad of selected TCZB staff; and
(iv) provision of -vehicles and equipment for TCZB.
6.          Total project costs were estimated at US$?63.5 million, of which
the Bank was to contribute US$150.4 million or 41X; TCZB US$138 million or
38X; and farmers the remainder amounting to US$75.1 million or 21X, as equity
contributions.
D. Project Design and Organization
7.          Desig.  The project concept and design were appropriate for the
purpose of facilLtatil.g increased and timely flow of credit to the farmers as
well as improving the efficiency in the operations of TCZB. However, at the
time of project design it was expected that inflation would continue its
downward trend. Therefore, the possible impact of inflation on the farmers'
decisions to borrow was not analyzed nor was it identified as a project risk.
With the advent of rapid inflation during project implementation, the loan
sizes stipulated at appraisal became inadequate for short-term loans. This
was remedied by linking loan amounts to the cost of inputs through farm
budgets. This was one of the reasons why disbursements of short-term credit
by far exceeded expectations. In the case of medium-term borrowing, this
linkage proved difficult and, in the early years of the project, many farmers
postponed their decisions to borrow because of the rapidly chaAlging prices
whicn meant that by the time the loan was approved, the amount would be
inadequate and TCZB's branch manager did not have the authority to change the
investment models which were accepted as basis for medium/long-term lending.
Also, in retrospect it appears that the arrangements in the protocol between
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) and TCZG
guiding the cooperation of the two institutions in implementing the special
schemes financed under the project should have envisaged coordination at
different levels. The protocol envisaged only semi-annual meetings at the
field level. A coordination committee for periodical review of overall
progress in financing of schame beneficiaries and redressal of difficulties
identified at the lower level may have helped in better utilization of funds
provided for these schemes.
8.          Organization.  TCZB was responsible for implementation of the
project. At the time of appraisal of SACP, TCZB was managing the credit
components of five Bank-assisted proj cts in the agriculture sector. Despite
this experience, TCZB took considerable time to organize itself adequately for
meeting the increased responsibilities under SACP. Guidelines for
implementation of the credit component of the project were issued to the



-4
branches in the project provinces in February 1985 (effective from ."Iril
1985), nearly one year from the date of effectiveness and about two years from
loan signature. This delay affected disbursement of loans by TCZB under the
on-farm development component in the initial years.
9.          For the special Government schemes (second crops and fallow
reauction), TCZB had limited responsibility. The actual administration of t'he
schemes lay with MAFRA. Under a protocol with MAFRA, TCZB was only required
to provide finance under SACP to the extent iLdicated by the MAFRA officials
for the schetmes. This arrargement did not work satisfactorily. The MAFRA
officials complained of lack of cooperation from TCZB branches in financing
scheme beneficiaries and the difficulties faced by the latter in obtaining
adequate credit. As noted in para 7 above, a coordination committee at the
national level could have contributed to alleviating the difficulties.
E.  Pro:.-sct Implementgtion
10.         Loan effectivelness and project start-uD.  Loan effectiveness was
delayed twice for a total period of six months from September 22, 1983 to
April 1, 1984, ten months after the loan agreement was signed. The delay was
largely due to: (a) slowness by both TCZB and MAFRA in finalizing the
execution of the protocol on their respective responsibilities under the
project and (b) the conflicting legal opinions within the Government as to
whether it had a legal right to guarantee foreign exchange losses on loans to
entities when Government is not the direct borrower. r.. latter issue took a
particularly long time to resolve and the Government could .tot ratify the loan
agreements until this issue was settled.
11.         Imnlementation schedule.  The slippage of six months in project
start-up put the project time-table behind and was not subsequently made up.
Therefore, although the project was originally scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1987, it had to be extended by a further six months to June 30,
1988 so as to allow for the futll disbursement of the loan and the completion
of the remaining project programs.
12.         The credit program, accounting for 83X of the project cost, was
successfully implemented despite about a year's delay in the issue of project
guidelines and in preparation of investment models. However, within the
credit program the implementation of different components varied. The on-
farm development component performed very well and TCZB loan disbursements for
on-farm development during the project period, expressed in 1983 TL terms,
exceeded the appraisal estimates by 57X for medium-term loans and by 345X for
short-term loans (Annex 1, Table 4). The much larger relative increase in
:sbursements for short-term production loans within the on-farm developmont
component resulted from: (a) the switch-over from the system of rationed,
norm-based credit to adequate, farm plan-based credit; (b) relaxation in
security requirements for loans; and (c) the changes in the agricultural
sector. Although medium-term lending was restrained by a depressed investment
climate resulting from inflatioa and price uncertainty. under tae on-farm
development component it still posted a 57X increase (in real TL terms)
compared with appraisal estimates. For reasons explained in para 13 below,



-5-
the performance in all other credit categories was poor. This resulted in the
reallocation of fin¶ds from these components to the on-farm development
component (para 19).
13.         The TCZB loan disbursements (in 1983 TL terms) under other credit
components tied to special schemes ranged from 16% of the appraisal estimate
for the Second Crops Scheme to 52% for Corum-Cankiri Project. The major
reasons for the short-falls were:
(i) possible overestimation of credit demand at appraisal;
(ii) excessive credit security requirements;
(iii)   inadequate cooperation between TCZB and MAFRA officials at field
level;
(iv) use of normal TCZB credit funds instead of project funds for
Second Crop and Fallow Reduction Schemes by farmers in certain
areas; and
(v) delays in the implementation of the Irrigation and Agricultural
Extension and Research Projects.
14.         Institutional aspects.  Despite considerable delay due to
legislative and management changes in 1984 and other factors, TCZB carried out
most of the institutional reforms expected of it under the Action Plan. The
implementation of the reforms gained new momentum during preparation and
appraisal of the Third Agricultural Credit Project.  The more important
reforms include the introduction of appraisal and lending on the basis of crop
budgets and investment models in 10 provinces covered by the on-farm
development program, substantial increase in the loan approval powers of
branch managers, relaxation in security requirements for loans, introduction
of annual and 5-year financial planning, and improvement in the frequency of
audit intervals of branches. Consultants were appointed through FAO in 1986
to carry out studies, agreed with the Bank, on systems and procedures,
accounting system and electronic data processing. The studies were completed
in June 1988.   Taking into consideration the suggestions of the consultants,
in November 1988 TCZB radically changed the head office organizational
structure, regrouping the various units on a functional basis. Action on the
other recommendations of the consultants and on the remaining items of the
Action Plan will be pursued during the period of the on-going Third
Agricultural Credit Project. TCZB sent selected staff for external training
at institutions in USA and Europe recommended by the FAO consultants.
15.         A study of the agricultural credit cooperative system was also
undertaken by a team of international and local consultants. The preliminary
findings of the study were discussed with the copsultants during the
preparation and appraisal of the Third Agricultural Credit Project and
incorporated in the project design. An additional proposed component under
this loan for technical assistance and training to carry out an institutional
development plan for the TKK was agreed in principle with the TKK. However,



-6
this proposed component was later dropped with the agreement of the Bank when
TCZB refused to take the credit risk for onlending to TKK for such purposes.
The Bank decided that the proposed TKK strengthening component, while
desirable, was not essential to the success of the project.
16.         Procurement.  Goods and services for farmers financed by TCZB
loans were procured as envisaged through normal commercial channels without
difficulties. For vehicles and equipment, US$4.7 million was allocated, most
of which was to be used for the procurement of armored trucks under ICB
proceduros (Part III, Table 5). However, only 10 vehicles were actually
procured for US$147.000 in part because the Bank was not willing to waive ICB
requirements contained in the Loan Agreement, and in part because not as many
armored trucks were needed as originally envisaged. TCZB's request for
reallocation of proceeds was based upon a reduction in the number of armored
vehicles required. While this request may have been influenced by earlier
Bank refusal to modify Bank procurement requirements, the Bank chose not to
question the reasons given for the request and agreed to reallocate funds to
meet the larger than expected demand for short-term credit funds.
17.         Project costs.  At appraisal, total project costs (principally the
credit program) were estimated at US$363.5 million. As shown in Part III,
Table 4, the actual costs came to about US$382.7 million. The higher cost of
US$19.2 million or 5% is attributable largely to inflation.
18.         Disbursements.  Part III, Table 3 sets out the loan disbursements
as estimated at appraisal and what was actually disbursed during
implementation. Loan disbursements in the first 3 years to 1985/87 were below
appraisal estimates due to late project start-up and delays by TCZB to adopt
project guidelines for on-farm development lending. There were also delays by
TCZB to submit loan reimbursement applications. Most of the handicaps were
resolved after 1986 and project disbursements picked up significantly
thereafter. Following project extension by 6 months to June 1988, the loan
was fully disbursed.
19.         _oan allocation.  The overall demand for short-term credits,
particularly those for on-farm development, far exceeded the appraisal target.
However, as explained 'n para 13 above, there was 'imited demand for project
credit by farmers in the Government Special Schemes. Therefore, in 1987 and
1988, part of the funds allocated to them and to medium-term loans were re-
allocated to on-farm development activities. Specifically, from the special
schemes US$8.5 million was reallocated from funds for medium-term credit and
US$38.4 million from funds for short-term credit, all to the short-term credit
category under the on-farm development component. To permit a Rari gassu
disbursement of funds until the Closing Date, there was also a reallocation of
US$20 million within the on-farm development component from the medium-term
category to the short-term category. Also the loan allocation to the purchase
of equipment under the strengthening of TCZB component (see para 16 above) was
reallocated to the credit program. The re-allocation of the loan proceeds
between various expenditure categories is shown in Part III, Table 5.



-7-
20.         Covenants.  As shown in Part III, Table 7, TCZB and the Government
met all but two of the covenants set out under the loan and guarantee
agreements. The notable exceptions were the ones whereby Government was to
(i) raise preferential on-lending interest rates to a level equal to or higher
than the prevailing level of inflation; and (ii) compensate TCZB on an annual
basis for losses resulting from failure of the sales cooperatives to service
their debt to TCZB. As shown in Part III, Table 2 (D), after initial progress
and achieving positive interest rates in mid-1986, Government introduced a new
subsidized interest rat- of 22% for livestock and fertilizer loans in December
1986 and May 1987, which made rates effectively negative when compared to
inflation as measured by the wholesale price index (Part III, Table 2 (C). As
inflation gathered pace in 1987 and 1988, the interest rates became
increasingly negative. The Government's measures of 1986 and 1987 were
therefore a retrograde step which was partly corrected in 1988 wnen interest
rates were increased again. The Bank followed the interest rate development,
which were also covenanted in the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan
(2585-TU) and the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (2714-TU), very closely and
processing of the Third Agricultural Credit Project (3090-TU) was suspended
until a time table for reaching positive rates had been agreed upon.
Regarding the compensation covenant, the Government failed to pay TCZB for the
losses resulting from price support programs of the sales cooperatives
financed by TCZB under Government guarantees in 1985-88. At the end of 1987,
TCZB's claims to the Government stood at TL 762 billion. Due to budgetary
difficulties, they were settled only in 1989.
F. Project Results and Impact
21.         Proiect objectives.  Overall, the project was successful in
meeting its principal objectives of providing credit support for increased
agricultural production and of strengthening TCZB. The credit funds were
fully utilized and helped in raising agricultural production and productivity
in the project areas. TCZB's lending policies and procedures were reformed to
facilitate adequate credit flow to farmers, its organization made more
functional and steps taken to introduce improved management information and
accounting systems. The project, however, did not succeed in its sectoral
objective of raising preferential on-lending interest rates to a positive
level by end-1984 or to adjust them periodically to take account of the rate
of inflation. Interest rates, charged by TCZB to farmers and the TKK remained
negative during most of the project period and currently range between 34% and
55%, well below the prevailing rate of inflation as measured by the WPI (70%
end-1988 and 68% end-1989). Interest rates were in fact brought to positive
real levels by 1986. However, subsequent increases in inflation exceeded
compensating interest rate adjustments. The other sectoral objective of
arranging for a study to develop a five-year plan for development of the
credit cooperative system which may form the basis of a future project for
possible Bank financing was only partially met (para 15).
22.         Physical results.  Key appraisal targets and what was actually
achieved during implementation are set out in Part III, Table 6. The project
substantially achieved its main lending target, reaching about 200,000 farmers
or 74% of 271,000 farmers estimated at appraisal. The incremental production



-8-
in industrial and cash crops was lower than anticipated at appraisal because
of the shortfall in lending tied to special schemes (see para 13) which was
expected to have a lar&er effect on production increases for these crops
because of effects on increases in cropped area and introduction of double
cropping. There was, however, a significant increase of about 1 million tons
in the key cereal crops. Eighty-eight staff or 68X of the appraisal target
were able to go for overseas training. All the staff trained are still with
TCZB. For reasons explained in para 16, most of the equipment was never
bought; for example only 10 trucks were purchased vis-a-vis an appraisal
estimate of 74. The shortfall was partly due to the Bank's unwillingness to
waive ICB requirements and partly because not as rany armored trucks were
needed by TCZB as originally envisaged. No reliable data is available as to
how many permanent full-time jobs the project created but taking the lending
program as a guide, these could be in the region of 46,000 of whom 370 were
employed by TCZB.
23.         Ingtitutional impaet.  The most important impact of the project
was in institutional building of TCZB. Increasing loan approval limits of
branch managers has enabled farmers to get credits more adequate to their
needs and without much delay. The introduction of computerized crop and
investment models has encouraged a more focussed appraisal of loan
applications. The introduction of 5 year budget cycles will enhance medium-
term financial planning while the eventual computerization of accounts and
introduction of a cost accounting system will facilitate the availability of
prompt and better management information.
24.         Financial imnact.  The farmers who participated in the project
enjoyed improved income levels. As shown in Part III, Table 6 (C), based on
the appraisal estimates for illustrative farm models under the Third
Agricultural Credit Project in 1986, the farmers achieved satisfactory
financial rates of retdrn ranging between 26X and 52X. This was significantly
in excess of the appraisal estimates which ranged between 19X and 29X and may
have been conservative in assumptions on yield increases. The economic rates
of return achieved by various activities varied between 371 and 711. These
too exceeded the appraisal estimates which ranged between 141 and 381. Also
TCZB calculated financial rates of return for investments financed with
medium-/long-term loans (page 21).
25.         Sin3e the total credits funded by the project were relatively
small compared to the global TCZB resource base and because of lack of a
proper cost accounting system, the project impact on TCZB's financial position
and performance cannot be accurately evaluated. Indeed, the bigger financial
impact of the project may not come from its credit funding but from the
institutional reforms it initiated. Over time, these reforms have taken root
and will continue to improve TCZB's management and operational efficiency
which in the end will be reflected in a stronger financial position and better
financial results.
26.         Annex 1, Tables 1, 2 and 3 show TCZB's financial position,
performance and key indicators, during the project period. As no financial
projections of TCZB were done at appraisal, there is no yardstick against



- 9 -
which to compare the figures in Annex 1. However, overall, the financial
position has improved. As shown in Table 1, in 1983 constant terms, TCZB's
total assets have increased by 31X from TL 1.6 trillion (US$8.7 billion) in
184 to TL 2.1 trillion (US$11.5 billion) in 1988. This improvement is
largely attributable to the increase in both agricultural and commercial
portfolios which have posted increases of 82% and 90X respectively in real
terms during the period. Resource mobilization has also increased with
deposits increasing by 191 in real terms from TL 0.9 billion in 1984 to TL 1.1
billion in 1988. During that period, TCZB's net worth has steadily improved,
more than doubling in real terms from TL 46 million in 1984 to TL 93 million
in 1988. Although, as shown in Table 2, TCZB's financial performance has not
been spectacular, it too has generally improved during the project period.
Total income increased by 126% from TL 253 million in 1984 to TL 574 million
in 1988. This, coupled with a proportionate decline in personnel costs (until
1987) and interest on deposits, resulted in an improved net income position
which topped TL 27 million in 1988, almost a six-fold increase over the 1984
level.
27.         Under the project, Government gave TCZB a spread of 3.51 on
project funds. This was to cover TCZB's overhead costs in administering the
project activities. Without a functional cost accounting system at TCZB it is
difficult to assess whether the above spread was adequate in relation to
TCZB's actual project-related costs. Data collected at the appraisal of the
Third Agricultural Credit Project indicate that the staff expenditure to
average portfolio ratio was 3.91 in 1983, fell to 2.41 in 1987 and increased
again to 3.41 in 1988 due to the transfer of staff to contract status. The
increase in staff remuneration for staff willing to give up civil service
security is expected to increase staff incentive and motivation leading to
improved efficiency over the medium-term. However, when trying to assess the
adequacy of the administrative spread of TCZB it should be kept in mind that
TCZB is called upon to act as collecting and disbursing agent for the
Goverr-    in areas where the central bank is not represented.  These services
are co. nsated by giving TCZB access to low-cost deposits of Government
institutions. The cost of these services adds to the administrative cost of
TCZB while the access to low-cost deposits reduces the funding cost.
Therefore, the spread may well have been sufficient for the administrative
cost directly related to making project subloans. In any case, the spread has
been increased to 41 in the next project.
28.         Information or. loan recovery is not separately available for the
loans made under the project. However, Table 9 of Part III shows the
collection ratios'/ for al: agricultural credit activities. Project loans are
included in the category 'cncouragement and Development Credits" which show a
consistent percentage of 641 in the years 1982-84 and improved to 751 in 1985.
After a slight decline to 741 in 1986, recoveries in this category improved
!      Defined as ratio of principal and interest collected to principal
and interest overdue at the beginning of the year and falling due
during the year.



- 10 -
further to 79X in 1988. This trend is partially the result of improved
appraisal and supervision that was introduced during project implementation.
G. Project Sustainabilitv
29.         During the project, considerable achievements have been made in
improving the organization and operational procedures of TCZB. To further
improve its efficiency, the institutional reforms started by the project will
need to be continued. The reorganization that took place in 1988 and 1989 is
a continuation of this process. The loan administration procedures will
require constant review as circumstances change. The computerization of the
accounts processing and the introduction of a cost accounting system need to
be implemented urgently to facilitate timely and more diverse management
information. In order to sustain the on-farm benefits which have been
attained with the help of the project, TCZB will have to ensure that farmers
continue to get adequate levels of credit and in a timely manner.
Additionally, more contacts with the technical staff of MAFRA will be needed
so that the farmers get the full benefits of extension advice.
H.  Bank Performance
30.         Bank performance during project preparation, appraisal and
implementation has been satisfactory. The consequences of rapidly increasing
inflation in the disbursement of medium/long-term credit (para 7) pointed more
to the inability of TCZB to change procedures than to any omission in project
design. A total of 8 supervision missions visited the project to monitor
implementation. As shown in Part III, Table 8, the missions comprised largely
of financial analysts, and credit specialists. As an agricultural program, it
would have been prudent to include agriculturalists in supervision missions
more often than was the case so as to technically address the agricultural
aspects of the project. Otherwise the missions were useful particularly in
prodding the borrower to implement the AP. Toward the end of the project,
supervision missions became less frequent based on the fact that in 1986 a
pre-appraisal and an appraisal mission for a follow-up project were fielded,
which clearly also assisted supervision although no formal supervision reports
were written in all cases. In 1986/87 there was a gap of almost one year
without a supervision mission. This was due to the fact that all mission
efforts during this time were concentrated on attempts to resolve the interest
rate issue which had re-emerged when interest rates were lowered in December
1986 and May 1987 and became negative in real terms. During this period, the
concerned staff were able to keep abreast of events relating to the project,
although the Bank's reorganization in 1987 caused some unavoidable
interruption.
31.         One of the lessons learned from this project is that institution
building, particularly for a 100-year old Government-owned organization like
TCZv, Is a long and cumbersome process. This is because over the years the
institution would have adopted certain practices and ways of operation which
naturally it would be reluctant to change within a short time. An aggravating
factor was the civil service status of TCZB's staff throughout the project



- 11 -
period (this changed in 1988-89) which did not necessarily foster efficiency
of operations.
32.         Two project design lessons have also been learned:
(a)   In countries where fairly high inflation is a possibility, project
design should ensure that the credit institution's appraisal and
lending techniques allow for flexibility to accommodate rapid
price changes during subproject implementation; and
(b)   when project implementation involves complementary input from two
or more organizations, it is desirable to have coordinating
committees comprising of senior officials from the parties
involved not only at the field but also at all other
implementation levels. These committees should meet regularly to
monitor implementation progress and smooth out any areas of
conflict. This view is fully shared by the Government (see
Annex 2).
I.  Borro-wer Perfo=armee
33.         Both Government and TCZB showed continuous commitment to the
project. Besides the initial delay to meet the necessary conditions for loan
effectiveness which resulted in -.Aie delay of project start-up, both the
Governmerat and TCZB performed satisfactorily under the project. Most
covenants were met. Exceptions were the ones relating to interest rates and
compensation for losses from loans to the agricultural sales cooperatives.
The only major draw back experienced was in 1985 when, for reasons unknown,
TCZB delayed by almost half a year the issuance of a new credit guideline for
borrowers under the project. This seriously hampered the project credit
program for that year.
34.         In retrospect, the following lessons may be learned in this
context:
-     full involvement of senior officials in reaching major decisions
affecting the operations of the institution is necessary to ensure
timely implementation of such decisions; and
-    basic change in operating policy and procedure cannot be
effectively brought about at the branch level by merely issuing
instructions from head office. The branch staff need to be
educated in advance of the proposed changes through
seminars/workshops and convinced about its advantages over the
existing system for successful implementation of the instructions.
J. Project Relationships
35.         The relationship between the Bank, Government and TCZB was
generally satisfactory.



- 12 -
K. Gonsulting Services
36,         The project provided consultancy assistance for a study of TCZB
and that of the credit cooperative system. Although bureaucratic delays
resulted in the late recruitment of consultants, all the studies were
completed and the reports respectively submitted to TCZB and Government. The
TCZB study was carried out by consultants under a trust fund agreement with
FAO. According to TCZB, the FAO input was highly appreciated and steps have
already been taken to implement their recommendations. The consultants who
carried out the credit cooperative system study also performed satisfactorily.
L. Project Documentation and Data
37.         Besides the lack of financial projections for TCZB during the
project period, the appraisal report was well prepared and provided a useful
reference and guide in monitoring project implementation. The loan and
subsidiary agreements were adequate but the protocol between TCZB and MAFRA
was in many instances not followed. At project level, the Encouragement and
Development Loans Department of TCZB kept adequate data to show project
progress and performance at all stages.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
TCZB prepared its own full PCR on this project. An excerpt from
this PCR is attached as Annex 2. The Government and TCZB were requested to
comment on the analysis included in Parts I and III of this report and were
also invited to comment specifically on:
(a)   The Bank's performance during the evolution and implementation of
the project, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
relevant for the future;
(b)   the Borrower's own performance during the evolution and
implementation of the project, with special emphasis on lessons
learned that may be relevant for the future; and
(c)   the effectiveness of the relationship between the Bank and the
Borrower during the evolution and implementation of the project.
The Government and TCZB comments are included as Annex 3; it will
be noted that Government and TCZB chose not to elaborate further beyond the
comments in Annex 3.

EXCERPTS FROM  PCR PREPARED BY TCZB
I. INTRODUCTI0N
The agricultural credit requirements of Turkey have increased in
parallel with the developments in the agricultural sector. Work towards
increasing resources in order to meet the requirements of this sector has been
continuing since the early 1970s.
The relationship between T.C. Ziraat Bankasi, the main provider of
institutional agricultural credits in Turkey and the World Bank, began and
developed during this period. Agzeements between the Government, T.C. Ziraat
Bankasi, and the World Bank led to the implementation of 11 projects which
aimed at contributing to the development of Turkish agriculture for a total of
US$384 million in Bank loans and credits.
The purpose of the Second Agricultural Credit Project (SACP) was
to meet the increasing requirement for agricultural credit parallel to the
development of the agricultural sector. The project which became effective
with the agreements dated 27.6.1983 is comprised of two parts as (A)
Agricultural Development and (B) Institutional Development. The breakdown of
these parts is as follows:
(A)   Agricultural Development:
- On-Farm Development
- IAEE-Irrigation Completion
- Second Crop Scheme
- Fallow Reduction Scheme
- Corum Cankiri Rural Development Project
(B)   Institutional Development
- Consultancy
- Training
- Equipment
The agreement foresaw the completion of the project on 31.12.1987.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION
The discussions held in 1981 between the World Bank, our Bank and
our Government representatives aimed at the purpose of meeting the ever
increasing demand for agricultural credits, led to the unanimous decision that
SACP would be prepared by our Bank. On the other hand, the World Bank agreed
that the funds allocated for the project would be made directly available to
our Bank under Government guarantee.

Subsequent to discussions among the World Bank, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs and the State Planning Organization,
the topics of the Project were determined as follows:
1.  This project would provide complementary financing for the
already existing projects funded by the World Bank, and further,
would enable the continuation of the Corum-Cankiri Project at the
second stage, within this project.
2. The credit requirements of the other World Bank financed
projects the implementation periods of which coincide with SACP,
would be handled in an integrated manner, and the agricultural
credit requirements of the Irrigation Completion Project, prepared
jointly by Devlet Su Isleri and Topraksu General Directorate,
would be handled within this project. It was planned that
agricultural credit requirements resulting from irrigation
investments in the Konya-Eregli, Antalya-Aksu, Kars-Igdir, and
Van-Ercis regions would be met within this project.
3. Agricultural credit requirements of the Second Crop and Fallow
Reduction Scheme both of which have Government priority and of
which the Ministry of Agriculture, F;restry and Rural Affairs has
completed preliminary studies, were planned to be handled and met
within the framework of this project.
4. It was envisaged to handle the credit requirements for
investment and operational credit of producers located in the 10
provinces (Afyon, Ankara, Balikesir, Burdur, Denizli, Diyarbakir,
Isparta, Kotahya, Mardin and Sanliurfa) in which the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs had been developing
agricultural extension services, within the framework of this
project.
5. The provision of funds within this project to the out-of-
country training of some bank personnel and the purchase of
vehicles and equipment was approved.
Project preparation groups were formed with TCZB. The work
related to the technical aspects of the project was carried out by project
groups formed at MAFRA in cooperation with our Bank.
In May 1982, FAO experts working on the World Bank/FAO Cooperative
Program joined the project. According to the disposition determined by the
three-member FAO team, relevant sections and their annexes would be prepared
by our Bank; the section dealing with Agricultural Expansion Services and the
annexes regarding the subject matter of projects mentioned above would be
prepared by MAFRA and the other sections would be prepared jointly by the FAO
group.

ANNEX 2
Page 3
In the same year, it was decided that the preliminary draft report
about the project would be prepared and that the final draft report would be
presented to the World Bank according to the results obtained from the work
done by our Bank, MAFRA and FAO.
The experts' documents were presented to the World Bank and the
result of their review of these documents their counter views were stated as
follows:
The World Bank has asserted that interest rates applied to
agricultural credits would cause problems and that interest subsidy,
preferential credit policies and low interest rates to agricultural credits
would result in the utilization of these credits in other areas. It was
requested from the Government that short-term interest rates be set according
to the inflation rate and that the interest rate be adjusted according to the
wholesale price index thus obtaining positive real interest rates; and that
long- and medium-term interest rates be equal to or 2 points lower than the
short-term interest rate and that changes in these interest rates be applied
to all loans.
The World Bank required that its approval be obtaineJ in the
reorganization work to be carried out to strengthen TCZB and that an
appropriate action plan be approved by the Board of TCZB and sent to the World
Bank. Among other views, raising of the loan limits of individual Branches to
TL 20 million and increasing this limit automatically according to the
inflation index, were also expressed.
It was also suggested that MAFRA have a seat on the Board of
Directors of TCZB so that cooperation between MAFRA and TCZB could be
achieved.
The fact that agricultural sales cooperatives were supported
despite the insufficient amounts of agricultural production credits was
mentioned and hope was expressed that TCZB would avoid deterioration of its
financial viability and the already limited credit resources, and that the
Government would immediately pay the overdue debts of the sales cooperatives
to TCZB.
It was alsn indicated that the Agricultural Credit Cooperative
system should be strengthened.
Our Bank's response to the views of the World Bank was as follows:
- It was indicated that TCZB determined its interest policies in
accordance with selective credit policies and in line with the
views of the Government. It was further stated that in the year
1982 the interest rate of 22% was not low compared to an increase
of 251 in the wholesale prices and that since higher interest
rates were applied to overdue accounts, the desired results were
obtained.

Page 4
- Within that context, plans regarding the reorganization of
authority and responsibilities of the General Directorate and
branches and the working princlples and responsibilities of each
one of them were prepared.
* Delegation of some of the authorities of the General DLrectorate
to Regional Directorates started during this period.
- Studies to increase loaning limits of the General Directorate and
branches, to be within the limits granted by the law of banking
were started.
- It was indicated that the arrangements regarding all the
cooperatives in the country had begun.
The World Bank, in its telex dated 15 Jurne 1983 informed that a
loan of US$150.4 million had been allocated for SACP. In the same telex, it
was indicated that the request of the Government of Iran (an interested party
because of riparian issues) regarding the delaying of talks on the
implementation of the IAEE-lrrigation Project for one month was accepted.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
The loan agreement regardlng SACP was signed between the World
Bank and TCZB on 27.6.1983. The project became effective on 1.3.1984.
The following factors caused the delay in project implementation:
1. The protocol between the parties regarding the sections of the
project (The Second Crops and Fallow Reduction Schemes) that were to be
jointly implemented with MAFRA.
2. Time required to obtain legal advice regarding the project.
3. Formalities regarding the Treasury's undertaking of the
exchange rate risk at the drawings from the project of TCZB as the direct
debtor.
On the other hand some factors which adversely affected the
implementation of the Project are as follows:
1. US$24 million were allocated from the project to the Second
Crops Scheme which aimed at providing vegetable oils and relatedly animal feed
materials. Although the fund was suitable to credit approximately 640,000 ha
of Second Crops production according to informaticai from MAFRA with loans made
available to the Second Crops Scheme outside this project, because the scheme
was included in the project after the agreement, and including the provinces
where loans were provided outside the project, in 1982 5,591 ha, in 1987



- 33 -
ANNEX 2.
Page 5
20,684 ha and in 1988 13,792 ha were credited, giving a five-year average of
16,417 ha. For this reason only US$3.0 million of the allocated funds could
be utilized and the balance was used in the other categories.
2. The same situation is true for the Fallow Reduction Scheme.
Since credits of TCZB are extended to farmers for fields sown during the year,
some of those fields not left to fallow were able to util4ze credits outside
the project and these credits were .aot handled within tthe program. Of the
US$16.5 million allocated for this purpose US$7.0 million was utilized and the
balance was channeled to the other categories.
3. The purpose of the IAEE-Irrigation Completion Project was to
meet the credit requirements of increased production that came about through
the construction irrigation facilities by Devlet Su Isleri in the Igdir, Aksu,
Eregli and Ercis regions. However, delays in the construction of irrigation
facilities adversely affected performance of this part of the project and not
all of the allocated funds could be utilized. For reasons described above
only US$1.5 million of the allocated US$10 million for medium-term loans
(category I-a-2) could be utilized. Our proposal to reallocate the balance
for short-term loans in the Farm Development Section (category l-b-2) was
accepted by the World Bank. Only US$1.5 million of the initial allocation of
funds amounting to US$4.6 million for short-term loans (category 1-b-4) was
utilized, again due to the reasons mentioned above. The balance was
reallocated for use in the short-term loans of the farm development component.
4. Initially it was found appropriate to allocate funds amounting
to US$60.4 million for category l-a-l use the medium-term loans of the farm
development component. Hcwever, besides changes after 1981-1982 in the
producer investment preferences, with equity investments in livestock
supported by HAFRA by 25 to 30X incentive premium, only US$40.4 million of the
allocated funds could be utilized. US$20 million was reallocated to the
short-term loans (cat. 1-b-l) of this project.
The original allocation for the short-term loans (cat l-b-l) of
the Farm Deveslopment Project %s US$17 million.  However, due to increases in
the annual expenditures of agLIcultural operations and changes in investment
priorities the allocated amount was completely utilized by the beginning of
1985. Transfers from other categories of US$17 million in 1985 and later
US$31 million and US$23.4 million in 1988, the closing year of the project
were made bringing the total drawings from the fund for this category up to
US$88.4 million.
5. The Corum-Cankiri Project was planned to be a continuation of
Loan 1030-TU which was implemented in the period prior to SACP. The purpose
of the project was to meet the seasonal expenditures of producers and to
reduce fallow land in these provinces. The US$12 million allocated by the
Loan Agreement was reduced to US$7 million. The credit finally drawn from the
World Bank amounted to US$7.2 million for this category.

6. In the institutional section of the project, of the US$4.7
million funds initially allocated for equipment US$146.997 was utilized for
purchasing armored vehicles. Due to changes and increases that occurred in
our Bank's equipment requirements and due to the fact that planning was made
at the macro level and that it was decided to meet equipment requirements from
our Banks own resources, US$4.55 million remaining in the (B-3) equipment
category was transferred to the farm development component.
7. Spending of the allocated US$800.000 fund for "Consultancy"
(Cat. B-1) and "Training" (Cat. B-2) in the institutional development
component was realized as US$801,467.
According to the Loan Agreement dated 27.6.1983 the project was to
be completed by 31.12.1987 but because of the following reasons was extended
until 30.6.1988:
- Delays in the beginning.
- In some of the provinces where the project was implemented, funds
from the Third, 'ourth and Fifth Livestock Projects, which lasted
until 1987, were utilized first.
In 1988 the final drawings from the allocated funds were made and
the US$150.4 million fund was fully disbursed.
Final figures showing allocated funds and realized drawings
according to categories in the agreement are given in the table below:

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The basic purposes of SACP were to increase agricultural
efficiency boy financing productive investments at the farm level and to
develop the sources of TCZB.
The agreement was signed in 1983 became effective in 1984 and
completed on 30.6.1988 by an extension of 6 months.
Operating performance of the proj'ect with respect to agritultural
operation for this period came about as follo*s:
A. Agricultural Credit:
1. On-Farm Development Component for farmers in the 10 provinces
to which agricultural extension services were provided:
The project aimed at the following.
- Mechanization
- Cattle and sheep fattening

- Orchard establishment
- Approximately 6500 medium-term sub-loans form financing the
investments in broiler and egg production.
- Approximately 70.000 short-term sub-loans for financing seeds
fertilizers, animal feed and other seasonal expenditures for crop
and livestock production.
The loans allocated during the project application are shown in
detail in Annex II.1/ As can be seen from the information in the tables in
the annex, during the 1983-1988 period a total of TL 95,122,404,000 medium-
term sub-loans was allocated to the producers in 71,004 loans.
The distribution of these loans for categories was as follows:
74.92 for agricultural machinery and equipment, 7.1X for stable facilities for
cattle fattening, 2.0X for stables for sheep fattening, 9.32 for fixed
investments of egg production, 2.62 for broilers and 4.2Z for orchard
establishment and repair expenses. Total investment amounts and loans
distributed regarding these categorie& are given in Table 2 below.

Short-term sub-loans in the Farm Development Component during the
1983-1988 period amounted to TL 305.5 billion for 846,467 loans.
Out of these sub-loans the credit distribution in percentages gas
as follows: 17.36X for cattle fattening, 10.26X for sheep fattening, 3.26X
for egg production, 0.6Z for broiler, 15.622 for fertilizer, 0.222 for
pesticides and 52.682 for seasonal expenditures of vegetable production.

Under the project medium-term loan drawings from the World Bank
amounted to US$40.4 million while short-term drawings amounted US$88.4
million.
2. The Second CroR Scheme:
In accordance with those participating In the Second Crops Scheme,
Decree No. B/4535 dated 2 May 1982, 60,000 short-term sub-loans were
allocated. These sub-loans are shown in the tables in the Annex-IV.'/ The
yearly distribution from this category is given in Table 4 below.

3. Fallow Reduction Scheme:
In order to reduce the area of fallow land, which currently makes
up approximately 1/3 of sowable land in Turkey, 50,000 short-term sub-loans
were planned to finance the purchase of seeds and fertilizers and other
seasonal expenditures.
It was seen that not all of the initial allocation of US$16.5
million would be utilized and portions of the allocation were transferred to
other categories and the final utilization was realized as US$7.0 million from
the World Bank.
Details of the loan allocated to farmers in provinces within the
scheme, for the period of 1983 to 1987 are shown in Annex III.'/ Total
amounts of the loans for fallow reduction scheme are given in Table 4 below.

4. IAEE-Ireigation Comnletion Scheme:
The State was to allocate (a) US$10 million in medium-term loans,
and (b) US$4.6 million in short-term loans so that approximately 25,000
farmers could benefit from the advanced irrigation schemes in the Igdir, Aksu
(Antalya), Eregli (Konya) and Ercis districts for procurement of machinery
financing of orchards and green houses in medium-term sub-loans for purchasing
required materials for vegetable production and financing of other seasonal
expenditures in short-term sub-loans.
However, as ind,cated in the previous section, only US$1.5 million
from the medium-term loans (Cat. l-a-2) and US$1.5 million from the short-
term loans could be used because of the delays in irrigation investments.
Details of loans allocated to producers within this scheme, for
the period 1983-1988 are shown in the Annex V. Annual summaries are given in
the following table.

The study of the loans distributed under this scheme shows that
93.6X of the mid-term loans were used for agricultural machinery and equipment
and 6.41 was used for orchard establishments and repair expenditures. Short-
term credits were distributed as follows: 73.31 for crop production, 26.4X
for fertilizers and 0.3X for pesticides.
5. Corum Cankiri Proiect:
60,000 short-term sub-loans were allocated for grain and livestock
requirements and other seasonal expenditures to farmers in Corum and Cankiri
provinces where the State was implementing an Integrated Rural Development
Project. Details of the loans for the period 1983-87 are shown in the tables
in Annex VI. An annual totals are given in the Table 6 below.

The breakdown of the loans is as follows: 80.61 for seasonal
expenditures, 4.9X for chemical fertilizers, 0.3X for agricultural chemicals,
7.3X for seeds and 7X for animal husbandry.
Of the US$12 million fund allocated for this section, US$7.2
million portion was utilized and the balance was transferred to other
categories.
As a result, out of the allocated US$150.4 million, US$149.1
million was used for agricultural loans and the remaining US$1.3 million for
institutional development.
The Project Evaluation Department randomly selected 45 debtors and
did an economic survey of them. Three of the 45 were found to have no
production activity, the satisfactory results of the other 42 are enclosed in
the Annex VII.1/
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT
TCZB is administered according to Law No. 3202 dated 1937 and
Addendum Law No. 2227 dated 1979. It is also subject to the stipulations of
Decree No. 107 dated 10.10.1983 regarding the establishment of TCZB.
With this decree full state ownership of the Bank wa.s preserved
while the formation of the Board of Directors was changed. The Assembly of
Managers was also abolished.
With Decree No. 233 dated 8.6.1984 regarding State Economic
Enterprises the formation of the board of directors was again changed.
According to the stipulations of the previously implemented TU-
1248 Agricultural Credit and Agro-Industry Project Loan Agreement, the
consultancy firm Touch-Ross Accounting and Consultancy was contracted to do
research on topics selected by the World Bank on how to increase
organizational efficiency pf TCZB. A further study on the application of the
acceptable results of this study was required and Hacettepe University was
commissioned to prepare a "Development Program and Application Plan Project".
This was prepared and submitted to the World Bank.
Those results of this study which could be categorized
chronologically were put in an "Application Calendar" and with the separation
of the others, was sent to the World Bank in 1982. The views which were
The Annex number refers to the main report.  Financial rates of
return for investments financed with medium-term loans were 26-

accepted by the World Bank were put in an "Action PlanH and were implemented
by relevant sections from 1 July 1983.
The secretariat of the implementation of the Action Plans was
carried out by the Economic Research Department and information regarding
developments was collected and reported to senior management every three
months. Reports were sent to the World Bank twice a year (April-October).
During the action plan implementation period the desired
performance could not be fully achieved due to circumstances beyond the
control of TUB.  Due to routine changes at the administrative and decision
making levels and the decision of the Council of Ministers to reorganize the
State Economic Enterprises, new arrangements were required and revised
programs were prepared on such issues as bank organization, determination of
interest rates according to inflation and the determination of authority
limits of lending units.
These studies and the consequent action plans have resulted in the
transformation of the management system of TCZB from being a problem-oriented
management system to a purpose-oriented management system.
Because of the fact that SACP was a means for institutional
development of TCZB the loan agreement included allocation of funds for
"Consultancy Services, Training and Equipment". To ensure consultancy
services and to provide training abroad of the Bank personnel, agreement
number UTF/TUR/030/TUR was signed with FAO on 12.2.1986.
US$400.000 were allocated for following subjects:
- Development of the Accounting System of TCZB
- Revision of procedures and actions.
The following work was conducted on these issues:
- The investigation of the correspondence volume and flow,
correspondence methods, forms and surveys and the preparation of
suggestions for improvement.
- The investigation of methods and communications, especially from
branches to head office through regional management and vice
versa, and preparation of suggestions for improvement.
- The investigation of credit operations taking into consideration
the responsibilities of Branch Regional and General Management and
reduction of centralization.
- Preparation of suggestions for a management information system to
ensure flow of information for managers at various levels.

- Investigation of credit application and evaluation forms used in
the branches and their simplification.
- Arrangement of the accounting system so that a reporting system to
management at appropriate intervals can be devised.
- The setting up of a cost accounting system at TCZB to determine
cost and revenues.
- The determination of required machinery and equipment.
The project also aimed at training of personnel at every level for
institutional development. This method of training was indicated in the basic
project of the World Bank and took place in the approved action plan of TCZB.
W!.thin the Project, Senior and mid-level Bank personnel have been trained
abroad in accordance with the plan prepared with FAO.
The subject, location and dates of training are shown in Table 7

US$4.7 million was allocated for the procurement of 74 armored trucks, 7
minibuses, and various equipment.
Only US$146,997 was spent for 10 armored vehicles for money
transport. The unutilized balance was later transferred to other categories
with the approval of the World Bank.
The growth of TCZB in number of branches and personnel for the
years 1984-1985 is as follows:

In the period 1984 - 1987, the number of branches increased by 6%,
the number of offices by 35% and the number of personnel by 131.
Furthermore, there was an increase in the personnel number working
in provinces an districts within SACP. The numbers are as follows:

VI. EVALUAION
A questionnaire was prepared requesting information, observations
and conclusions to be used in the general evaluation of the project and for
future reference. This questionnaire which included questions from the World
Bank's "Project Completion Report Guide" was sent to 400 branch managers and
the results based on information received from farmers and local farming
institutions have been used in the general evaluation of the project. The
evaluation is as follows:
(a)   Whether or not the project implementation was in line with the
requirements of the regional producers: In the replies received
from our branches 47.51 decided totally, 44.5X declared partially
and 81 declared not at all.
(b)   Whether or not production increased as a result of the project:
64.4X declared production increased in the region and 35.61
declared there was not much change in production.
However, as a result of studies conducted at regions where there
was no increase in production, it was determined that these were areas of low
agricultural potential with branches of low lending. Furthermore, the study
of the production of major crops in the selected 27 districts within the 11
provinces of the project, in the Annex VIII shows that the project was indeed
influential in the increase of production.
(c)   Our branches came to the conclusion that small and medium size
farmer groups benefitted from the project the most.
(d)   Two major factors were named as those most adversely affecting
project implementation: the high prices of agricultural input
materials and the low level of the product prices. These were
followed by high interest rates. It has been stated that high
cost and low sales price has directed producers to produce other
low cost products.
(e)   In cases where the revenues of the farmers increased they
reinvested these revenues in agricultural investments. In cases
where the revenues of the farmers decreased they were late in
repaying their loans and the demand for loans from our Bank
increased.
(f)   Responses from low income regions showed that the project was
effective in slowing down migration from the area.
(g)   In general, our branches indicated that this type of project was
useful.

In conclusion, it is determined that this type of project is
beneficial to Turkish agriculture and to Turkish farmers. The mistakes and
deficiencies seen in this project will be useful for future applications. It
is also determined that sufficient funds were provided in due time and that
TCZB's resources expended with the allocated funds. Positive results were
also observed in p:ovinces which were included in the project.

Subject: Second Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan 2318-TU)
Project Completion Report
Dear Mr. Yoon,
The Draft Project Completion Report (PCR) of the above project has been
reviewed by the Treasury and participating organizations. Comments and
findings are summarized below.
The Treasury finds the content of the report satisfactory and reflects
the project's effects on production and institutional changes. However, the
expansion of paragraph 22 and 24 would be more appropriate. That is, in
paragraph 22 in setting achievement of the project, it is stated that
unrealized procurement of the Important amount of equipment was a fact of the
project, the reasons of it should also be placed in the paragraph in order to
better understand the type of difficulties encountered in the project.
In spite of the statements made in previous paragraphs that unexpected
inflation increase affected input prices more than output prices, paragraph 24
points out that realized financial rate of return of farmers is considerably
higher than projected. An explanation about factors resulting high return
would be more helpful to understand project outcomes which effect farmers'
incomes.
We fully agree with the statement in paragraph 32 (b) indicating that in
the case of more than one organization involvement in a project coordinating
committees have important role in the sut.cess of the project. Setting up
committees at each implementation level is considered necessary by us for
timely and successful implementation. Therefore, this statement could be more
emphasized.

Project Implementation General directorate (PUGEM) also agrees on the
project's contribution increasing livestock and rice productivity and
production. The General Directorate has no further addition to the report.
TCZB, which was the main implementing agency of the project, states that
all the figures in the report matches with the Bank's (TCZB) records and
report's content are fully agreed except below corrections:
in paragraph 27 given spread to TCZB should be corrected as X 3.5
on page 12 part (A) should also include Corum-Cankiri Rural
Development Project.
The figures for the Sub-Loan credit distribution should be
corrected as follows:
Cattle fattening    :  17.36%
Sheep fattening     :  10.26X
Egg production      :  3.26X
Broiler             :  0.6%
Fertilizer          :  15.62X
Pesticides          :  0.221
Seasonal Expenditures:  52.68X
