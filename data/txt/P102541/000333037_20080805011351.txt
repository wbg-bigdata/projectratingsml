The objective for this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) is to review the
overall programmatic education sector development support credit (ESDSC) using the cumulative
experience of three operations (ESDSC I, II and III). The contribution of the first operation was
already discussed through a simplified ICR (SICR) completed on June 23, 2005. It was rated as
follows:

Outcome: Satisfactory; Sustainability: Likely; Institutional Development Impact: Satisfactory;
Bank Performance: Satisfactory; Borrower Performance: Satisfactory.

IEG has reviewed the SICR and rated the first credit as follows:

Outcome: Satisfactory; Sustainability: Likely; Institutional Development Impact: Substantial;
Bank Quality at Entry: Satisfactory; Bank Supervision: Satisfactory; Overall Bank Performance:
Satisfactory; Borrower Implementation: Satisfactory; Borrower Compliance: Satisfactory;
Overall Borrower Implementation: Satisfactory; ICR Quality: Satisfactory.

These ratings will continue to apply. This full ICR therefore rates the contributions of ESDSC II
and III to the results of the programmatic series.




1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The first development policy lending operation was prepared at the time when the Ministry of
Education (MOE) was undertaking the first phase of a medium-term reform agenda aimed at
addressing systemic governance issues in order to raise the quality and cost-effectiveness of
service delivery, and improve equity of access in secondary education. This bold initiative from
MOE took place in the context of the formation of a new Government which was elected in
October 2001.      The Government had taken rapid action to stabilize the macroeconomic
environment. An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was prepared on the basis
of extensive consultations with stakeholders and the process of preparing the PRSP was well
underway. These synergetic actions were critical and an integral part of government's strategy
for accelerating growth and reducing poverty.

To implement economic growth enhancing and poverty reducing reforms, the Government asked
the IMF and the World Bank for financial support. In response, the IMF put in place a Poverty
Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and IDA provided a one tranche Development Support Credit
(DSC) in June 2003, complementing the IMF's program. The DSC-I supported a subset of the
Government's medium-term reform agenda that focuses on supporting reforms in governance, the
financial sector, state owned enterprises, and the energy sector. The actions supported by the
credit were intended to increase transparency and accountability, help restore public and private
sector confidence, and improve the investment climate.        This, in turn, would contribute to
accelerating the rate of economic growth, employment creation and poverty reduction.

In complement to DSC reforms, the Government embarked on reforming secondary education in
2004.    While Bangladesh had made important strides in secondary enrollment ­of girls in
particular-, governance constraints contributed to the poor quality of education. Recognizing that
improving quality in the education sector is imperative in order to make substantial progress



                                                  1

towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Government launched
several reform measures to address these governance and accountability issues. The first
Education Sector Adjustment Credit was then launched to support the Government in its
aspiration to reduce poverty substantially within a generation through consolidating gains in
human development (CAS report).

The three budget support provided between 2004 and 2007 provided in a series (cf. Table 1) have
a common thread in that they all aimed at improving management of secondary education system,
enhancing teacher effectiveness and strengthening curriculum and textbooks. These areas of
reforms were identified to deal with the (i) expansion of demand for secondary education; (ii)
poor quality of education directly related to a lack of effective governance and accountability
mechanisms; (iii) low secondary completion rates and modest increase in pass rates at
standardized examinations at grades 10 and 12; and (iv) unequal access to school that the poor
suffer from.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The development objectives, as described in the PAD and Loan Agreement, were to enhance
governance and improve the quality and relevance of secondary education. The three pillars of
ESDSC are in the areas of system management, teacher effectiveness, and curriculum and
textbooks.

The key performance indicators include (i) share of new non government schools registered
following MPO criteria; (ii) share of public resources targeted to the poor as an indicator of
equity in access; (iii) gender parity in secondary education; (iv) GER in secondary education; (v)
SSC exam pass rate; (vi) HSC exam pass rate; (vii) rate of teacher absenteeism; (viii) share of in-
service teacher training; (ix) share of textbooks produced on competitive basis; (x) share of
transparent selection and employment of certified teachers.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The PDO and key performance indicators were not revised during implementation.



1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

The series of sector credits that supported the reform agenda in secondary education over the past
three years had three major pillars:




                                                  2

(I)      Improving System Management
The objectives were to establish greater transparency in the use and allocation of resources, to
increase the accountability of institutions to funding authorities and local stakeholders, and to
develop a more devolved and efficient management of the education system, with greater
stakeholder involvement. The reform aimed to reduce rent-seeking in school registration and
financing and to enhance quality in and access to secondary education, especially for the poor.

(II)     Enhancing Teacher Quality
Under the medium-term reform agenda, the objective was, for the Government, to develop a
transparent and high quality system of teacher recruitment and a comprehensive in-service
training system. Given the difficulty to improve the quality of teachers who are already in the
system within a short period of time, MOE aimed at preventing poorly qualified teachers from
entering the system, establishing a more effective system of pre-service training and gradually
improving the quality of teachers already in the system.

(III)    Strengthening Curriculum and Textbooks
The main objective of these reform initiatives was to improve transparency in the selection and
approval of textbooks, competitive production of better quality textbooks in a cost-effective and
timely manner, and to enhance the emphasis on curriculum development.



1.5 Revised Policy Areas

None of the Policy Areas were revised during the three year programmatic DPC.


1.6 Other significant changes

None

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Program Performance

There has been a good and steady progress in the implementation of ESDSC since 2004. In
the first sector credit, MOE was proactive in enforcing the establishment and registration of new
non government schools. In order to improve transparence, the Government issued administrative
orders to contract out the task of evaluating new schools for recognition and eligibility for
Government subvention, known as monthly pay order (MPO). To enhance equity in access,
overserved and underserved upazilas were identified and MPO subventions were provided to
schools created in underserved areas. To reduce local elite capture, amendment was also passed to
restructure School Management Committees (SMCs) and Governing Bodies (GBs) by requiring
that only the district commissioners, upazila nirbahi officers or retired government officials
nominated by MOE be chair and restricting any chairperson to a maximum of four committees.
As regards teacher recruitment and training, the Cabinet approved a legislation creating an
institution for teacher certification such as the Non government Teacher Registration and
Certification Authority (NTRCA) and the National Academy of Education Management (NAEM)
was given the exclusive responsibility of developing and coordinating teacher training to improve



                                                 3

the overall teacher quality. Finally, an action plan was agreed upon to reorganize the National
Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) to make it more effective.

By the second credit, these reform initiatives in system management, teacher effectiveness
and curriculum and textbook were broadened and deepened. In particular, no subvention was
granted to new schools established in the 115 overserved areas identified and about 368 low
performing institutions had their subventions suspended in 2006. About 126,000 SMC/PTA
members were trained on their roles and responsibilities and SMCs/GBs were elected according
to the new rules. Once established, NTRCA was able to successfully hold two certification
examinations. By tying MPO subventions to the recruitment of certified teachers, DSHE managed
to enforce the hiring of certified teachers by SMCs/GBs warding off any political influence in the
recruitment of teachers. The production of all textbooks at secondary level (grades 6-12) was
opened to competition and the separation of the textbook and curriculum wings of NCTB was
completed.

Under ESDSC III, the progress in strengthening the three pillars of reforms has been
satisfactory. In fact, most of the key performance indicators agreed upon at the beginning of the
programmatic operation were achieved and some outcome indicators exceeded targets. The share
of public resources targeted to the poor has gone from 24 per cent to 33 per cent pointing to the
likely role of the series of three DPLs in improving equity in access for the poor (cf. Table 2).
Table 2 also shows that the share of schools established and registered according to MPO criteria
has doubled over the course of the programmatic support credit from 30 per cent to over 60 per
cent. As the female stipend program was synchronized with ESDSC, gender parity in both
secondary enrollment and completion has been achieved. The enforcement of MPO criteria along
with the requirement to hire teachers from a pool of certified teachers has probably contributed to
better performance of schools at SSC and HSC exams: SSC and HSC exam pass rate have
respectively improved from 36 per cent and 38 per cent in 2003 to about 59 per cent and 64 per
cent in 2007. As far as teacher training is concerned, the share of in-service trained teachers has
increased from 10 per cent in 2003 to about 21 per cent in 2007. Finally, all textbooks produced
at secondary level have been subject to a transparent and competitive process since 2006.

While these achievements are remarkable, it should be pointed out that there has been some
inconsistency in reporting progress on outcome indicators in ISR between ESDSC II and III as
some indicators were omitted in ESDSC II and the baseline or endline values or dates did not
always match across the two operations. For instance, indicators of teacher recruitment, MPO

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Over the past three years, a number of factors combined have contributed to the success recorded
in some components of the reform agenda while progress was slowed down or even hindered in
other areas.

Bangladesh's favorable macroeconomic conditions have provided a fertile soil for the seed
of ESDSC reforms to take root and produce good crops. Specifically, real GDP growth has
been over 6% with the garment exports sector growing at a high rate (e.g., 10.4 per cent in 2006);
fiscal deficit was kept under 4 per cent of GDP; public debt as a share of GDP was continuously
decreasing from 53 per cent in 2002 to close to 44 per cent in 2007; exchange regime has been
floating since May 2003 and the robust performance of exports and remittances built up foreign
reserves and stabilized the foreign exchange market.

All ESDSC credits have taken place in a context of intensive and consistent consultations
with senior level Government officials, various stakeholders at the district, upazila and school
levels. This has generated a high level political support and the needed buy-in by stakeholders to
ensure country ownership of the reforms. For example, GoB took a politically difficult measure
like excluding "all political persons" from SMCs. In particular, an SMC chairperson cannot chair
more than four SMCs. While the short run impact is significant, it is worth examining to what
extent SMCs have complied on the ground with the decision, given the complexity of the problem
and            the           historically         entrenched            political         interests.

The successful implementation of reforms such as school registration, teacher certification
or privatization of textbook production has also required the commitment of MOE to carry
out the reform agenda. For instance, DSHE was able to enforce the application of eligibility
criteria for MPO and as a result, some poorly performing schools saw their MPO suspended.
Schools that were established in `overserved' upazilas were not eligible for subventions either.
On the other hand, the Government has taken a proactive role in assisting low performing schools
in remote and disadvantaged areas as they face severe constraints. In the area of governance, the
audit wing of MOE, despite being short of staff, managed to resolve most of the 3000 audit
objections, substantially reducing the backlog of audits that were pending since 2002.

Support from stakeholders has enabled the Government to pursue some bold reforms and
achieved success, despite potential resistance from vested interest groups. It is acknowledged
that well-intended education reforms enjoyed tremendous support from stakeholders neutralizing
any possible resistance from vested interest groups. In fact, during this series of DPLs, no visible
or insuperable resistance was faced by the Government.

Another important aspect that has facilitated the implementation of ESDSC reforms was
the institutional support through legal and legislative ordinances passed by the Parliament.
In particular, the Parliament approved the legislation for NTRCA to certify a pool of qualified
teachers for SMCs to recruit from. Legislation was also approved to grant pensions to teachers in
newly registered non government schools. In addition, the 1977 Regulations on managing SMCs
of non government schools were amended to reflect changes in their composition and the
redefinition of their roles and responsibilities.

Despite the good progress in reforms, the Government, in anticipation of elections, was
reluctant to pursue significant reforms in some areas, which may have slowed the pace of
reforms. Politically difficult reforms were likely to be backlogged. Specifically, there were


                                                 11

extended delays in the functioning of Independent Inspection Bodies (IIBs) which started
operating only in the third year1. The drop in rent-seeking associated with school recognition was
the result of a difficult process. As far as curriculum is concerned, it is worth mentioning the
continued indecision of GoB about which system to adopt (unitrack or multitrack) resulted in the
privatization of some books of grade 9-10 being held up.

The capacity constraints of Government have also limited the enforcement of regulations.
Financial management suffered from an inadequate control environment leading to backlog in
reconciliation affecting budget monitoring and the lack of internal audit function to review the
internal control system and management. Absence of professional financial management capacity
and accountability in line ministries has slowed down the pace of progress and many challenges
remain to strengthen the accounting and reporting mechanisms for timely, regular and reliable
information. Further, limited Government oversight capacity, political interference and rent-
seeking led to heightened fiduciary risk.

The success of reforms depends largely on technical capacity and the effective use of data
produced from monitoring and evaluating programs. Under ESDSC, the Government agreed
to allocate more resources to BANBEIS for data collection, monitoring and evaluation to
establish a culture of evidence based policy planning. However, administrative delays in releasing
those funds have considerably hindered BANBEIS's role in disseminating information on school
quality, conducting expenditure surveys and stipend evaluations, piloting student assessment and
also strengthening MOE's capacity to ensure greater accountability of schools and SMCs.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Since ESDSC operations incorporate measurable indicators for monitoring progress and
evaluating results on completion of the series of credits, monitoring and evaluation were
undoubtedly critical activities for a successful implementation of reforms.

Over the past three years, a number of third party evaluations have been conducted. In
particular, a means tested stipend scheme targeting poor boys and girls was piloted in some
upazilas and based on the recommendations of the study, some schools are now following a pro-
poor targeting mechanism for selecting stipend beneficiaries. Independent Inspection Bodies have
also evaluated non government schools for recognition and subvention support whereas NTRCA
certification process underwent a successful independent evaluation. Based on their observations,
rent-seeking in registering non government schools or certifying teachers has considerably
diminished in the past years.

Designated by MOE as the leading agency to manage and monitor education information,
BANBEIS has developed, within MOE, an integrated database platform, including a
website which exhibits general statistics about schools, teachers, enrollment, education
expenditures, etc. Grade 6 and 8 examinations were piloted in 2004 to test the entry level of
students. In 2004, grade 8 students were tested based on TIMSS and, in April 2007, a student
assessment in grade 12 using TIMSS tests was piloted in 100 colleges spread across 36 districts in



1IIBs were competitively selected to evaluate the readiness of schools/colleges for establishment or
recognition.




                                                  12

6 divisions. This international benchmarking of student achievement will be further
institutionalized under the proposed Secondary Education Quality and Access Enhancement
Project (SEQAEP). But, recent information on schools, enrollment, pupil attendance or teacher
absenteeism could not be obtained due to delays in conducting census. It is also not clear why
grade 12 students were chosen when in fact TIMSS tests are typically administered to grade 4 and
8 students2.

Under MOE reform initiatives, an expenditure tracking survey was piloted in 28 upazilas,
under the Financial Management Reform Program (FMRP) Project, assessing whether
inputs were present on the ground (e.g. whether teachers on the payroll were present in schools),
and comparing expenditures at the school level with national level data. The survey found that
while there were no major discrepancies on expenditures, there were some instances of
malpractices in the system - e.g. schools had to make `speed' payments to get resources, teachers
were absent, and there were still a significant number of girls who did not meet eligibility criteria
but were receiving stipends. Some 11 per cent teachers were absent. This was, however, an
improvement over the situation in 2003 when the teacher absenteeism was estimated to be about
17 per cent.



2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

The good progress achieved in improving governance and access to school for the poor,
enhancing the quality of the teaching force through more transparent certification and recruitment
processes and improving the production and publication of all textbooks in grades 6-12, still
leaves some areas of reforms that need further strengthening. This includes moving towards
performance based financing, strengthening of M&E agenda and developing a professional career
path for teachers, greater transparency and accountability of SMCs and better tightening of
financial management. In light of this unfinished agenda, the Government of Bangladesh has
requested the World Bank to continue supporting them in their medium-term reform agenda with
a second series of DPCs.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Bank's assistance in education has strictly followed GoB priorities as laid out in the PRSP
and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. Putting governance at center stage, the World Bank
Group's recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)3 aligns itself with the Poverty Reduction
Strategy. In particular, the CAS emphasizes empowering the poor as one of the two pillars.
Building on Bangladesh's impressive social gains, the World Bank seeks to help the Government
meet the MDGs related to human development in order to realize its aspiration to reduce poverty



2About 8097 grade 12 students were administered mathematics tests; 60% of college sample was
constituted of government schools and 64% of urban colleges.

3 Country Assistance Strategy for the People's Republic of Bangladesh ­ FY06-09, Report No. 35193, The
World Bank, 2006.




                                                  13

substantially within a generation. The CAS states that, notwithstanding the impressive gains in
education, especially in access, improving quality remains a major challenge ­ and should be the
focus of the Bank's assistance to Bangladesh. It also proposes to assist in improving the quality
and efficiency of service provision to the poor by strengthening sector governance, and enhancing
voice and participation. This is precisely what the series of ESDSC credits had been designed to
support. They took place in a context in which MOE had developed a medium-term reform
agenda seeking financing of its proposed reforms in secondary education subsector.



3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The three major areas of reforms (system management, teacher recruitment and training and
curriculum and textbook) undertaken under ESAC I, ESDSC II and ESDSC III have produced
positive results as presented below.

System Management
Tying Government subventions (MPO) to school performance and enforcing the strict application
of MPO criteria was relatively successful despite being politically difficult to implement. Over 60
per cent of all registered schools were following MPO criteria in 2007 compared to 30 per cent at
the beginning of the reform. DSHE has suspended MPO subsidy to more than 300 schools that
did not meet the performance criteria, thus sending a strong signal for other schools to
continuously strive for quality and excellence.

Over the past three years, there has also been increased transparency in establishing and
registering new non government schools as the private contractors who evaluated school
registration were selected through a competitive process. They found considerable progress made
in curbing corruption when granting subvention to schools.

Another important success regarding governance in secondary education is related to the
settlement of audit objections. Of the 3134 pending audit objections in January 2007, about 2395
were resolved. In other words, that corresponds to 89 per cent in total value of audit objections,
exceeding the original target of 80 per cent. Considering the fact that the audit cell of MOE has
currently only one auditor, the impact is quite substantial.

Collecting and managing information on secondary schools has been a major challenge for MOE.
Because of administrative delays in releasing the additional resources allocated to its M&E cell
(BANBEIS), no recent update of school information was available. However, BANBEIS
successfully managed to develop the same school code as all nine Secondary and Higher
Secondary Education Boards making it possible to integrate their database with school results
from SSC and HSC examinations at the end of grades 10 and 12 respectively. For monitoring and
planning purposes, this is a significant achievement and a step toward helping DSHE/MOE
cluster schools according to their relative performance so that specific interventions can be, for
instance, customized for poorly performing schools. This, along with the systematic learning
assessment under SEQAEP, will also help institutionalize an evidence-based M&E.

Teacher Effectiveness
The Non-government Teacher Registration and Certification Authority (NTRCA) was established
in March, 2005 by a legislation passed by Parliament. Its basic responsibility is to administer
tests to potential candidates for teaching positions in secondary schools and colleges. SMCs/GBs
can now only recruit teachers when they are certified by NTRCA. Otherwise they don't qualify for
Government MPO. The annual national demand for teachers is currently estimated to be around


                                                 14

10,000 and NTRCA is certifying more than double that number to meet the demand. Since 2005,
no single case of malpractice in teacher certification has been reported. Three national certification
examinations were successfully held between 2005 and 2007 and the results show that the
certification process has been tightened as the pass rate has gone from 57.3% in 2005 to about 19%
in 2007, reflecting the drive for excellence and the strong commitment to select the best teachers for
a better quality of secondary and higher secondary education (cf. Table 4). In an environment of
pervasive political interference, certifying and recruiting teachers in a transparent manner has not
been an easy task.

                            Table 3: NTRCA certification examinations
                                    Candidates     Passed      Share (%)

                        2007        85286          16020       18.8%

                       Source: NTRCA website

Textbook and Curriculum
As of today, 95 textbooks have been published by NCTB and 77 textbooks by private sector and
they all have followed transparent criteria for manuscript approval, thus substantially reducing the
scope for rent seeking. Specifically, authors of textbooks are given three months to submit the
manuscripts, which are then reviewed by independent experts (Independent Textbook Evaluation
Committee, ITEC) and once the books are approved, NCTB reviews them for conformity with
ITEC recommendations. Furthermore, the required quality of paper provided by NCTB to private
publishers has raised the bar of quality for all approved textbooks. Delays in delivering textbooks
to students on time and the artificial shortage in textbook supply observed in the past have been
considerably reduced by competition.



3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

The achievement of the development objectives for the series of three credits is overall rated as
satisfactory. Over the past three years (2005-07), the establishment of NTRCA has produced a
successful screening of secondary school and college teachers at entry level. With the
introduction of this certification system, not a single case of malpractice in teacher recruitment
has been reported and all SMCs/GBs are bound to only hire certified teachers as the Monthly Pay
Order (MPO subventions) is tied to school performance. This reform is thus likely to have raised
the quality and effectiveness of teachers, confirming the relevance of its objective and the quality
of its design. SSC and HSC results have almost doubled over the past three years, partly as a
result of tying subventions to school performance. The commitment of MOE to reforms also
explains the successful role of DSHE in enforcing the application of MPO criteria as over 300
schools had their MPO suspended for poor performance. Another important success in
governance reform in secondary education relates to the settlement of 89 per cent in the monetary
value of all audit objections beyond the original target by the audit Wing of MOE. In the area of
data management, uniform school codes were developed between BANBEIS and the nine
Education Boards for Examinations to improve MOE's monitoring of school performance.
Furthermore, all textbooks for grade 6 to 12 are currently produced and published following a
competitive and transparent selection process. As a result, their quality has significantly improved


                                                  15

and the artificial shortage in textbook supply is no longer existent. These textbook reforms have
led to an important reduction in rent-seeking activities. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that
these successful and much needed reforms in the secondary education sector (improvement of
governance, quality and relevance of secondary education) occurred in a context of political
turmoil and uncertainty dubbed with pervasive political interference.

The rating for each operation in the programmatic support credit and its justification are provided
below.

The First Education Sector Adjustment Credit
Rating: Satisfactory

A simplified ICR was prepared for the first credit and provided the ratings of ESAC I. Although it
was premature to impart any significant impact of ESAC I on the management system of
secondary education, on teacher effectiveness and curriculum and textbooks, the first operation
has enabled the medium term reform agenda to move forward with increased accountability and
transparency in the system. The first credit was rated as satisfactory for the following reasons:

System Management
· MOE issued an administrative order contracting out task of evaluating non-government
schools/colleges (grades 6-12) for: (i) receiving government recognition; and (ii) becoming
eligible for MPO subventions.
· 115 overserved upazilas had been identified out of 480. Further, since August 2004, no new
recognized schools have been constructed in these upazilas.
· MOE did enforce MPO criteria, with poorly performing institutions being informed that their
subventions would not be renewed until they meet performance criteria. About 1300 institutions
received notice regarding suspension of MPO in 2004; 226 institutions that showed no
improvement in performance had their MPO payments suspended. On the other hand, well
performing institutions were rewarded with financial incentives.
· Grade 6 and 8 entry examinations were piloted in some districts in 2004 to test the entry level
of students.
· MOE passed amendment to 1977 Regulations on Managing Committees of the registered
non-government schools and colleges and BTEB regulations of 1991 to state: (i) only the district
commissioners, upazila nirbahi officers, or retired Government officials nominated by them, can
chair SMCs/GBs; and (ii) any particular individual (other than deputy commissioners or upazila
nirbahi officers) can not chair any more than four committees.
· Formation of Upazila and District Education Oversight Committees in all districts
empowered to monitor school performance and ensure public disclosure of information (e.g.
examination passing rates, teacher absenteeism, class sizes, etc.) related to school quality.

Teacher Quality
· Establishment of NTRCA was approved by Cabinet in 2004. NTRCA is responsible for "pre-
qualifying" candidates for teaching posts on the basis of academic qualifications and standardized
examinations.
· Parliament approves legislation on granting pensions to teachers in non-government schools.
It came into effect in December 2002.

Curriculum and Textbooks
· Reorganization of NCTB started being implemented with the separation between Curriculum
Development Wing and Textbook Wing.



                                                16

· Production of all textbooks in grades 11-12 was privatized. Production of seven textbooks for
grades 6-10 privatized in 2005, and 34 more were in the process of being privatized in 2006.

The Second Education Sector Development Support Credit
Rating: Satisfactory

Building on the achievements of ESAC I, the second operation is rated as satisfactory for the
following reasons:

System Management
· About 368 of the worse performing institutions saw their subventions suspended in 2005 and
2006.
· No subvention was provided to any new school being established in 115 `overserved'
upazilas
· Secondary-level institutions established in 25 underserved upazilas with GoB support.
· Means-tested stipend program piloted in 404 schools to evaluate the extent of equitable
access for the poor.
· 27 per cent of secondary education public resources targeted to the poor as against a baseline
of 24 per cent in 2003.
· All nine Education Boards have hired competitively selected private contractors to evaluate
school registration.
· A third party evaluation of the Independent Inspection Bodies in 2007 showed that the
contracting process is transparent, and there have been considerable reduction of malpractices in
granting subventions.
· SMCs/GBs were selected using new procedures. Some 126,000 SMC/PTA members had
been trained on their roles and responsibilities.
· All political influences on the constitution of SMCs/GBs were removed and malpractices in
teacher recruitment by SMCs stopped.
· Individuals can no longer chair more than four SMCs/GBs. This number went down from 50
in some cases4.

Enhancing Teacher Effectiveness
· Two teacher registration certification examinations were held successfully by NTRCA.
· All new teachers being recruited come from the NTRCA certified pool of potential teachers.
· About 20.9 percent teachers have received one or other form of in-service training by 2007
against the baseline of 10 per cent in 2003.

Textbook and Curriculum Reform
· 50 per cent of grade 6-10 textbooks production were done following a competitive process.
· Quality of textbook paper was assessed to have improved.
· Textbooks delivered to students on time.
· Clear separation of roles and responsibilities of the two Wings of NCTB.

The Third Education Sector Development Support Credit




4Some anecdotal evidence gathered during the ICR mission indicates that, in Dhaka in partcular, some
were chairing over 100 SMCs.




                                                 17

Rating: Satisfactory

The third credit support is rated as satisfactory due to the results below.

System Management
· Overall secondary education budget was increased from 4.5 per cent in 2004 to about 20 per
cent in 2007 relatively to 2003.
· SSC and HSC pass rates have respectively increased to 59% and 64% in 2007 compared to
36% and 38% in 2003 respectively.
· Independent evaluation of the performance of service providers assessing school eligibility
for subvention has been completed and recommendations are being implemented.
· A means-tested stipend scheme was piloted and an independent evaluation of the pilot was
completed. Based on recommendations, a draft framework for a national approach has been
developed and some schools are currently following a pro-poor targeting of secondary stipend
(including poor boys as potential beneficiaries).
· Capacity of MOE/BANBEIS enhanced to update data annually, and carry out third-party
surveys.   A student assessment in grade 12 based on TIMSS internationally recognized
assessments was piloted in April 2007.
· An action plan was adopted to assist the ill-performing schools in the poorer or disadvantaged
areas.
· Implementation of MOE financial management improvement plan continues with an effective
financial management unit in place.

Enhancing Teacher Effectiveness
· Third-party evaluation of NTRCA registration and certification process was completed.
· Third teacher certification examination was successfully held by NTRCA in 2007.
· All teachers are now recruited by SMCs from the certified pool of teachers.

Textbook and Curriculum Reform
· All textbooks for grades 6-8 and 11-12 are produced competitively following a transparent
process of manuscript approval.
· About 36 books and 13 supplementary books were respectively produced in 2007 and 2008
by the private sector.
· Artificial shortage of textbooks experienced in the past is now completely removed and books
are now available on time without any delay as was the case in the past.



3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The focus of ESDSC on underserved upazilas and the assistance provided by DSHE in
establishing schools in those areas were geared towards enhancing equitable access to secondary
education. Consequently, the share of poor children enrolled in secondary schools has increased
from 24 per cent to about 33 per cent. The piloting of means tested stipend has also resulted in
more poor boys and girls enrolling in school as they are entitled to a stipend. The Government is
now considering scaling up its country-wide stipend program to target both poor girls and boys.

Gender parity in secondary enrollment has already been achieved. In fact, more than 52 per cent
of children enrolled in secondary school are female. ESDSC operations were synchronized with


                                                  18

the nationwide female stipend programs to increase female enrollment and improve their learning
levels. Grade 10 completion rate of girls now exceeds that of boys: about 18 per cent of girls aged
16-19 have passed the SSC exam compared to 15.3 per cent for boys of the same age group (cf.
HIES, 2005). The proposed SEQAEP project is building on the achievement of FSSAP II to
target non only poor girls but also poor boys so as to raise overall enrollment in secondary school.

Analysis of HIES data has also shown that the average social returns to schooling for females is
higher than that of males for the age group 15-45. It is estimated to be 17.2 per cent for females
compared to 13.2 per cent for males. The package of reforms under ESDSC which aimed at
improving system governance and teacher quality, in conjunction with demand side interventions,
is likely to have attracted poor children to school, thus raising the prospects for better labor
market outcomes and also higher social returns to their schooling.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Implementation of ESDSC has resulted in some institutional changes that can be summarized
below:
(i)   The creation of a teacher certification Authority in 2005 has allowed the recruitment of
teachers to be institutionalized and to escape the malpractices associated with the certification and
hiring of teachers in secondary schools and colleges.
(ii)  The launching of a pro-poor targeted stipend program in some upazilas is expected to be
scaled up throughout the country phasing out financial assistance only to girls and moving
towards institutionalizing a poverty targeted stipend program.
(iii) School codes are now uniform between BANBEIS and the nine Education Boards after
decades of un-integrated database that have rendered the monitoring and evaluation activities of
MOE extremely difficult. This institutional integration platform provides an opportunity to
improve the dissemination of information about schools, their quality and performance and other
key indicators useful for policy and planning purposes.
(iv) NCTB has two separate Wings with clearly distinct responsibilities. Staff of the respective
Wings are now totally devoted to their area of expertise to make NCTB a more effective body of
MOE by ensuring greater transparency in manuscript approval and textbook production.
(v)   The Government has established a National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) as an
arm of the NTRCA to replace the National Academy of Education Management (NAEM). NCTE
is given the overarching responsibility of looking after all arrangements related to teacher
education and training in Bangladesh.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

The results achieved under the three budget support credits in the area of system management and
governance may have inspired other sectors confronted with poor outcomes to follow some of the
best practices resulting from the implementation of this series of DPLs. This first series of DPLs
in Bangladesh have paved the way for other sectors such as power and railways to use similar
instruments. Moreover, the level and intensity of dialogue and interaction between the World
Bank and MOE/DSHE and other stakeholders could help, for instance, senior officials at the
primary education Ministry (MoPME) in their effort to implement programs along with other
development partners. Finally, the reorganization of SMCs may have far reaching impact on
redistribution of social power with larger participation of stakeholders in the rural society.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The First Education Sector Adjustment Credit
Rating: Moderate

The PAD outlined risks related to low Government capacity or to the likelihood for GoB to
maintain its political commitment to the reforms against entrenched lobbies. Given that these
reform initiatives were bold, a sequencing of the reforms was necessary to make them politically
sustainable. A number of risk mitigation measures were built into the program such as extensive
consultations with key stakeholders to gain buy-in or the collaboration with the private sector and
independent service providers to ensure that MOE's capacity is not unduly stretched.
Therefore, the risk to development outcome for ESAC I is rated as moderate at the time of this
ICR.

The Second Education Sector Development Support Credit
Rating: Moderate

In anticipation of elections scheduled a year from ESDSC II Board approval, GoB was expected
to be reluctant to pursue significant reforms in some areas, which could have affected the pace of
reforms. Despite prolonged opposition boycotts of parliament, frequent disruptions of work in
public sector and political turbulence, ongoing education programs and policies have undergone
little perturbation due partly to the fact that the benefits of the reforms were clearly
communicated to stakeholders by the Government and the positive externalities associated with
most education programs make it difficult to reverse the trend of reform.
The high fiduciary risk identified in the program document was mitigated by introducing a
Medium-Term Budgetary Framework across line ministries, by separating the external audit and
internal audit functions and by making the Comptroller and Auditor General independent
institution that does not rely on Government for its budgetary allocations and administrative
decisions.
The second credit is rated moderately risky at this time of evaluation because of the progress
made by GoB in implementing these mitigation arrangements.

The Third Education Sector Development Support Credit
Rating: Moderate

Over the past three years of programmatic credit, there has been a strong and consistent political
support from GoB, regardless of its political colour. In fact, despite macroeconomic risks related
to the weak financial condition of state owned enterprises, especially in the energy sector and to
the persistent low level of tax mobilization, the Government has clearly demonstrated, through
the PRSP, its commitment to maintaining a high level of investment in the education sector.
Allegations of corruption and resources meant for education being captured have been identified
as risks to the development outcomes but the current Care Taker Government has proven its
strong commitment to improving overall governance in Bangladesh and reducing the risk of
corruption and rent-seeking. The establishment of institutions such as NTRCA and the audit
Wing of MOE, and the reorganization of NCTB have contributed to significantly reduce
corruption risk. The Government has also taken several measures to strengthen the weak links in



                                                 20

the chain of public financial accountability in response to the persistent high fiduciary risk in
public spending.
Due to all these mitigation measures effectively implemented, the risk to development outcomes
is rated as moderate for ESDSC III.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

The sequencing of reforms justifies the programmatic approach in the reform agenda because,
although reforms in the education sector were essential, they nonetheless needed to be politically
sustainable. The series of three operations have exhibited a consistent medium term results
framework, including a set of outcomes for the overall program, and triggers and prior actions
needed to get to the next operation.
The Bank overall performance is based on the performance in ensuring quality at entry and
quality of supervision. The overall Bank performance is rated against the criteria presented below.


(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The First Education Sector Adjustment Credit
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance for quality at entry was rated satisfactory. The World Bank supported a
series of three Development Support Credits (DSC) from 2003 to 2005 focusing on governance
reforms to accelerate the rate of economic growth, employment creation and poverty reduction.
This new series of credits (ESDSC) complemented DSC by focusing on reforms in secondary
education and also building upon recommendations provided by a 51-member expert committee
commissioned by MOE in 2002/03. Extensive discussions with senior Government officials also
took place during the program design to ensure ownership of the reform agenda proposed by
MOE.

The Second Credit ­ESDSC II
Rating: Satisfactory

The quality at entry of the Bank team is rated as satisfactory. Following the footsteps of the first
operation, the Bank team has been proactively engaged with MOE since the beginning of the
program design through an extensive policy dialogue and regular district, upazila and field visits.
ESDSC II also built on lessons learned from ESAC I and the DSCs. The strong and continued
support from highest levels of Government has ensured country ownership of reforms and
prevented special interest groups from derailing key reform measures. Understandably, some
flexibility in the programmatic approach was introduced to account for the difficulty in radically
implementing the first phase of the reform agenda to make it politically sustainable. Furthermore,
the sector credit took place in a context of economic growth, providing an opportunity for MOE
to pursue the reform agenda.
Notwithstanding this satisfaction, some areas could have been improved during the preparation of
the operation: (i) some key performance indicators were not clearly defined and (ii) the design
could have benefited from a comprehensive analysis of the fiduciary environment in Bangladesh
as the risk in public spending was rated quite high.

The Third Credit ­ESDSC III
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall quality at entry is rated as satisfactory as the Bank team has been engaged in
extensive and constant dialogues with senior Government official and other stakeholders during
identification and appraisal missions as reported by aide memoires. There has also been
continuity in the Bank team as most of the task team members in ESDSC II were part of the third
credit. Over the course of the three year program, the Bank team has benefited from previous
analytical work and received inputs from PRSP highlighting quality of education as its fourth
goal.
But, the preparation of the operation could have gained from paying much heed to the following
issues: (i) the process and modalities of dissemination of school information were not clearly
spelled out and thus the implementation did suffer; (ii) the design could have benefited from
integrating a dynamic account of underserved upazilas or areas, especially with the number of
floods that hit the country over the past years and (iii) BANBEIS monitoring instruments were
not updated to account for recent achievements.

(b) Quality of Supervision

The First Education Sector Adjustment Credit
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance was rated as satisfactory. The Bank's task team was composed of
Human Development, PREM, Financial Management staff and international and national
consultants who contributed significantly through country and sector knowledge. The Bank has
also been closely engaged in policy dialogue with MOE at all stages of preparation of the
operation and this collaboration has continued during supervision. Dialogue with key
policymakers outside of the education sector, particularly Finance and Planning, also played an
important role in ensuring broad buy-in for the reforms within the Government.

The Second Credit ­ESDSC II
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in supervision is rated as satisfactory because the country office
management team has maintained a day-to-day dialogue with various stakeholders inside and
outside MOE to ensure the implementation bottlenecks are tackled and resolved in a timely
manner. In addition, the mix of sector experts during missions has combined in depth country and
sector knowledge to provide the necessary expertise. It is worth mentioning that collaboration
with other donors such as ADB, CIDA and EU who provided support to MOE in implementing
some of the proposed reforms under the medium term framework, has helped to avoid duplication
in the effort to assist Government counterparts.

The Third Credit ­ESDSC III
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in supervision is rated as satisfactory because of extensive consultations
with senior MOE officials and various stakeholders while preparing the third credit. The team
was composed of a mix of staff from various sectors providing the international expertise needed
to move the reform agenda forward. Moreover, continuity in the Bank team to maintain a
coherent dialogue with MOE and other stakeholders as recorded in official memorandums and


                                                22

missions'aide memoires, has substantially added to the quality of supervision. After six months, a
review meeting was organized to assess the progress achieved, under ESDSC III, with a particular
focus on areas that need closer attention such as financial management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Overall, the Bank's performance has been satisfactory. During the three years of budget support,
the consistent dialogue with senior MOE officials and other stakeholders, the international
expertise brought to Bangladesh and the critical role of CMU have allowed Bangladesh to
experience the level of success it has witnessed in some components of the reform agenda. The
level of attention given by management to challenges raised by the implementation of reforms
and the way the Bank team has leveraged "lessons of international experience" to support reforms,
have been instrumental in the Bank's overall performance in supervision. Continuity in the Bank
team to maintain a coherent dialogue with MOE and other stakeholders at the upazila and school
levels as evidenced by field visits to upazilas and schools during supervision missions, has
contributed to the quality of supervision. The aide memoires summarizing supervision missions,
progress and shortcomings in implementation of reforms have always suggested the needed
adjustments to smooth the process of implementation.

Ratings:

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The First Education Sector Adjustment Credit
Rating: Satisfactory

The borrower's performance was rated as satisfactory in the SICR. MOE has played a proactive
role as the key counterpart for this operation. MOE convened a 51-member experts committee in
2003 to recommend key areas of reform. The committee's recommendations aimed at
establishing a cost -effective, high quality and equitable education system through governance
reforms. To flesh out these recommendations, MOE commissioned in-depth studies in selected
areas. Based on this information, as well as relevant work undertaken by development partners,
MOE finalized its medium-term reform agenda, and led the dialogue with the Bank and other
development partners for support with the implementation of key sectoral reforms. In order to
generate    buy-in   for   these   reforms,    MOE     engaged   in  an    extensive   range   of
consultations/workshops with Government officials and other stakeholders at the central, district,
and upazila levels. MOE's active leadership in this process ­ supported by other key line
ministries ­ has resulted in IDA financing ESAC I.

The Second Credit ­ESDSC II
Rating: Satisfactory


                                                23

Borrower performance is considered satisfactory. In fact, by establishing NTRCA through
parliament and Government approval, by incentivizing well performing schools and sanctioning
low performing schools through DSHE, and by ensuring textbook production follows competitive
process and manuscripts are approved by NCTB using transparent criteria, the Government has
demonstrated its commitment to achieving the development objectives of ESDSC. In a context of
pervasive political interference, without Government commitment to reforms, the rent-seeking
activities associated with teacher certification and recruitment or manuscript approval or even
school registration, would not have sharply decreased. So, there is a need to continue exercising
vigilance so that the progress achieved is not reversed.

The Third Credit ­ESDSC III
Rating: Satisfactory

Borrower performance during the preparation of the third credit is satisfactory as MOE has been
actively engaged in dialogue with IDA and other development partners, with key stakeholders
such as NCTB, NTRCA, Education Boards, schools, teachers and SMCs. In addition to the
NTRCA certification required for teachers, the Government has proactively taken a policy
decision requiring SMCs to only hire teachers with a B.Ed degree as a signal of its commitment
to a quality teaching force.
Borrower performance in the implementation of ESDSC III is rated as satisfactory. MOE has also
played a key role in synchronizing ESDSC with the female stipend program. The creation of an
audit Wing within MOE has improved the backlogged audit objections by resolving over 89 per
cent in monetary value of all audit objections. The Government continued its reform program in
the midst of unprecedented political turbulence in the country and took a number of very bold
reform measures under the Care-taker Government in a relatively short period.

Unfortunately, M&E was not sufficiently utilized for decision making or resource allocation as
administrative delays have prevented BANBEIS from collecting recent data which could have
helped to monitor and evaluate activities under ESDSC III.



6. Lessons Learned

While gender parity in enrollment and completion was achieved, student performance at SSC and
HSC have improved, and teacher certification and recruitment and textbook production are now
free of malpractices, some challenges are yet to be met to clear the system from any
accountability and transparency hurdle and propel Bangladesh's education system to international
standards of quality and excellence.



6.1      System Management

Institutions could be clustered at the upazila level based on SSC pass rates and providing
yearly update of both low performing schools and flood prone school areas so that targeted
interventions can be customized. In collaboration with Education Boards, BANBEIS could
provide technical support in defining those clusters and monitoring progress of school
performance and improve information dissemination to schools. In addition to the official
removal of political influences in SMCs formation, the importance of involving SMCs in the




                                                 24

disclosure of school information to the public, particularly in non-FSSAP schools, cannot be
over-emphasized.

MOE agreed with IDA on the need to increase staffing of the Audit wing of MOE with more
qualified auditors to improve governance in secondary education. Under ESDSC, the Audit
cell which currently has only one auditor dealing with more than 2000 audit objections since last
year, managed to resolve 89 per cent of audit objections in monetary value. This clearly stresses
the need to provide more budget support to the Audit cell to strengthen its capacity and ensure its
independence in achieving its mission objectives.

It is recommended that the grant-based financing scheme be piloted in new schools to test
its attractiveness and merits, its potential impact on school performance as well as to
appreciate the degree of buy-in by teachers and SMCs. MOE is shifting to grants-based
financing system, where resources going to institutions will be linked more closely to students on
a per capita basis, rather than to teachers as it is currently the case. A draft grants-based financing
system has been finalized but not yet adopted and a decision was taken to suspend MPO for new
non government schools. As a result, newly registered schools are likely to experience financial
constraints which may have adverse effect on their performance.

There is a need to improve the capacity of BANBEIS to provide regular updates on schools
and better monitor education outcomes since the last school census was conducted in 1999 and
an update was undertaken in 2005. BANBEIS is expecting to start by June 2008 the next census
as it is already approved and the process of releasing the funds has begun. There may also be a
need to develop a platform for integrating multiple databases that fall under MOE as was already
evidenced by the uniformization of school codes between Education Boards and BANBEIS. This
integration process, across various units of MOE, would, for instance, help to institutionalize
student learning assessment as SEQAEP project intends to do by benchmarking learning levels in
Bangladesh to international standards such as TIMSS or PISA.


6.2      Teacher Effectiveness

Since NTRCA has the capacity to generate substantial amount of resources through holding
teacher examinations on a regular basis, a relative autonomy to allocate its budget
according to market needs is likely to strengthen its capacity and thus improve the overall
quality of the teaching force in the long run. The successful reform of screening secondary
school teachers at the entry level has established NTRCA as a leading agency in teacher
certification. All SMCs and GBs are now bound to recruit teachers from the pool of teachers
certified by NTRCA, particularly as they wish to receive Government MPO subventions.

In light of the poor performance in Math and English, there is a pressing need to tailor
specific and innovative interventions to improve English and Math scores in SSC exams so
that the learning levels in those two subjects can improve and meet the international
standards. In that respect, the proposed Secondary Quality and Access Enhancement Project
(SEQAEP) is currently designing interventions specifically aimed at improving learning levels in
English and Math. If these school quality interventions turn out to have a positive impact, they
could be scaled up to non FSSAP upazilas so that national learning outcomes in English and Math
can considerably improve. Discussions with students during the ICR mission's field visits
revealed that the subjects in which they feel extremely weak are overwhelmingly English and
then Math. Students at lower grades in secondary (6 to 9) and students appearing for SSC
examinations seem to experience tremendous difficulty in mastering the English language.


                                                   25

Teacher absenteeism demands more attention because of the critical importance of
teachers'time on task and their accountability at the school level to deliver quality teaching.
The fact that secondary schools are mainly privately managed and that MPO subventions are tied
to teacher performance are likely to limit the risk of pervasive teacher absenteeism. However,
since most of teacher salaries come from Government budget, the need to monitor teachers'time
on task is still warranted. There may be a need to carry out a systematic assessment of teacher
absenteeism to measure its scope in secondary schools and the extent to which it affects the
learning outcomes of students.


6.3     Curriculum and Textbook

The increased quality of textbooks has raised their cost. This is a problem for students from
poor families. For equity purposes, there may be a need to take that into account when
designing programs to improve access for students from poor families. While books are
delivered to students on time and some students even enjoyed the luxury of purchasing more than
one textbook per subject since 2005, many children from poor families cannot afford to purchase
those textbooks in the market. As a result, the issue of delays in providing textbook to students at
the beginning of the school year has become irrelevant as any textbook is readily available in the
market once the manuscript is approved by NCTB.

Unlike textbooks, less attention has been given to curriculum development. The curriculum
Wing of NCTB may need to be equipped with adequate staffing of curriculum specialists in
order to properly perform its duties. A decision was taken to postpone the revision of
curriculum to 2009. The emphasis should be laid on the content and relevance of the curriculum
to keep it consistent with labor market needs and international standards. Madrassa (religious
schools) are deemed to carry outdated curriculum and thus may necessitate revision, in keeping
with the curriculum of general secondary education.

             Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government of Bangladesh has given utmost importance to education for the socio-economic
transformation and advancement of the country. Under the Education Sector Development Support Credits I,
II and III, the Ministry of Education has tried to address three key areas of reforms : (a) Systemic
management to ensure greater efficiency, community participation and transparency in resource allocation;
(b) Teacher effectiveness through development of a transparent and high quality teacher recruitment and
training system; and (c) Curriculum and textbook improvement through effective separation of functions and
open competition in textbook production.

System Management

In the recent past the Ministry of Education outsourced the assessment of school eligibility for subvention to
independent service providers. Upon having their evaluation report the government has reviewed the
recommendations and is working on their implementation.
The Government has piloted a means-tested stipend scheme under one of its stipend programs, to target the
stipend program more toward poorer secondary school children, both boys and girls.

The Ministry of Education has taken a number of steps to enhance quality of Bangladesh Bureau of
Educational Information & Statistics (BANBEIS) to update data annually which in turn will help MoE with
better information and policy planning.      It has been realized that rigorous monitoring of criteria for school
financing and tying subvention to performance might affect the schools in the poorer and disadvantaged areas.
In view of this, MoE has approved an action plan to assist the ill-performing schools in the poorer areas. Also,
the Government is gradually moving toward a grants-based financing system.

With regard to the actions related to improving financial management, MoE undertook a plan of actions in
five important areas. Accordingly, the Ministry has (i) put in place an effective financial management unit;
(ii) settled audit objection, worth more than 80% in value, of the past three years; (iii) engaged private
auditors for performing internal audits; (iv) addressed the directives of the Public accounts Committee and (v)
instituted a system of regular monitor and reconciliation of the records of the Drawing and Disbursement

Education Engineering Department (EED) under Ministry of Education has reviewed their guidelines for
school construction and maintenance and finalized the guidelines in keeping with the overall environment
management framework.

Teacher Effectiveness

As you know, the Government set up a Non-government Teacher Registration and Certification Authority
(NTRCA) in 2005. After passing the take off stage NTRCA is working now in full swing. The School
Management Committees (SMCs), as representative bodies of the committee recruit the teacher from a pool
of candidates certified by NTRCA through a rigorous examination process. The Ministry of Education and its
secondary education wing DSHE are working on training the secondary school teachers on the basis of a five-
year in-service teacher training plan.

Curriculum and Textbooks

MoE has completed all aspects of restructuring the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) with
complete functional separation of curriculum wing and textbook wing. The curriculum wing now exclusively



                                                             31

focuses on curriculum related activities. The textbook wing has oversight responsibility for textbook
production and distribution through a transparent and open competitive bidding process.

The Government of Bangladesh is fully committed to pursuing comprehensive reforms in education to ensure
access and quality education for all children. The World Bank has been playing a vital role as a development
partner in this field since long. This is my pleasure to have gone through the details of the ICR of ESDSC-I, II
& III prepared by the esteemed staff of the Bank with considerable rigor. I would like to express my profound
thanks to all concerned as I have found the report has covered all the aspects and areas of reforms in
education sector very realistically. I am looking forward and requesting the Bank to move ahead with the
procedures for the Forth Education Sector Development Support Credit which will help the Government
deepen its reforms initiatives in secondary education in Bangladesh.
