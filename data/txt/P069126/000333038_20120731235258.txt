                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY


1.      This proposed restructuring would update the results framework for the Burkina
Faso Power Sector Development Project (IDA-Grant No. H133 BUR, P069126) and
amend the Development Grant Agreement for this purpose. In July 2011, the project
benefited from a twelve month extension of the grant closing date to July 30, 2012 and a
reallocation of funds within the original project description. The proposed restructuring
aims at (a) formalizing the inclusion during the 2011 restructuring of a new core indicator
which estimates the number of direct beneficiaries (including the number of women); and
(b) correcting an output indicator target which was modified during the project’s mid-
term review but not formalized1 (see annex 1, which sets forth the updated indicators).



B. PROJECT STATUS


PDO and Results

2.      The Development Grant Agreement providing for a grant in the amount of SDR
43.4 million (US$ 63.58 million equivalent) was signed on December 20, 2004 and
became effective on November 28, 2005. The main objectives of the project are: (1) to
enhance the policy and institutional environment for efficient sector development and
operation; (2) to improve the availability and reliability of electricity supply in the area
covered by the national utility; and (3) to promote rational and efficient use of energy in
public buildings through demand side management.

3.      The main PDO level results indicators are to: (a) increase reliability of the power
system materialized by an overall availability factor of the 225kV and 132 kV
transmission lines higher than 99.4%; (b) increase annual generation of about 86 GWh
delivered on the Ouaga regional network; (c) have 25 public administration buildings
adopt energy efficiency behaviors and equipment; and (d) realize energy savings in these
selected public administration buildings.

4.     The indicators show that the current availability factor of the 225kV and 132 kV
transmission lines are respectively 99.67% and 95%. The annual generation expected to
be delivered on the Ouagadougou regional network varied between 43 and 75 GWh


1
  During the 2008 mid-term review, original target for energy savings realized in selected public
administration buildings and peak demand reduced in selected public administration buildings were
reduced from 25% to 10%.
                                                   8
during the past two years. Regarding the efficient use of energy in public administration
buildings, 33 public buildings have already been equipped with energy saving equipment.


Project Status

5.      The project’s main activities have been completed and its objectives have been
globally achieved, the performance of the Recipient and implementing agencies is
satisfactory, and project performance has been satisfactory as indicated by the marginally
satisfactory DO and the satisfactory IP ratings in the ISRs. The project safeguards
category (B) and environmental screening category (“partial assessment?) remain the
same.

6.     There is no overdue audit report. The issues raised in the 2010 audit have been
addressed and the 2011 audit report has been sent to the Bank and is under review.


7.      Compliance with safeguard covenants is rated “marginally satisfactory? due to
delays in finalizing the social audit. The audit has now been completed, reviewed by the
safeguard team and an action plan is being prepared by the client to address the pending
issues.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

8.      The restructuring paper includes the project’s results framework (Annex 1),
updated to: (a) ensure that the mandatory indicator on project direct beneficiaries is
included; (b) ensure that the reduction of the target for energy savings and peak demand
agreed upon during the project’s mid-term review are formalized. These modifications
do not translate into PDO changes or changes in the Project activities.



9.    Based on the above, if you agree with this proposal, please sign the attached
amending letter to accommodate the changes in the indicators.
