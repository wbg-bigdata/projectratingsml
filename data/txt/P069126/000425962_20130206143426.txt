1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

General context

1.       The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted by the government of Burkina
Faso (GoBF) in 2000 outlined the following key objectives: (i) increasing annual per capita
gross domestic product (GDP) by a least 3 percent from 2000 to 2002, and by 4 to 5 percent
starting in 2003; (ii) reducing the incidence of poverty from 45 to 30 percent by 2015; and
(iii) increasing life expectancy by at least 10 years by 2015. It was widely accepted that
meeting these goals would require an accelerated pace of poverty reduction and economic
growth. Weak human resources, low labor productivity, inadequate infrastructure, high input
costs, limited size of the formal sector, and fragile institutional capacity were identified as key
obstacles to long-term growth and competitiveness. The 2003 Country Assistance Strategy
Progress Report (CAS-PR) confirmed that the strategy set out in the 2000 CAS remained
relevant and issues related to increased competitiveness needed to be addressed by a number
of projects in various sectors.

Sector context

2.     The GoBF recognized the role of energy services for strengthening economic
competitiveness and improving the economic and social indicators. Key sector challenges
included:

        x    High electricity supply costs, tariffs, and subsidy policy. Burkina Faso is a landlocked
             country with very limited hydro resources. Electricity generation was dependent on
             imported petroleum fuels. Therefore, the state-owned utility, Société nationale
             d'électricité du Burkina (SONABEL), had high electricity supply costs. Tariffs have
             been subsidized since 1994 due to devaluation of the currency (FCFA) to offset the
             increased cost of power supply. High electricity costs1 and emerging electricity supply
             constraints limited the economic competitiveness of the country, private sector
             participation in the industrial and service sectors, and put high pressure on the public
             budget.
        x    Increasing demand for electricity and capacity constraints. The electricity demand
             increased on the Bobo-Dioulasso Regional Network (CRCB) and the Ouagadougou
             Regional Network (CRCO) at an average rate of about 7 percent over the period
             1995–2004, creating severe capacity constraints. In addition, existing thermal units for
             CRCO were close to the end of their economic life.
        x    Inefficient utilization of electricity by end-user. Studies sponsored by the Danish
             International Development Assistance (DANIDA) in 2002 indicated potential energy
             savings of 40–50 percent in public buildings, resulting in (i) a 20–30 percent reduction
             of peak demand on CRCO network, and (ii) a reduction of about 12 GWh of



1
    The cost of pre-existing thermal generation valued at the variable cost of generation using HFO was approximately $0.13/kWh


                                                                      1
          electricity consumption in public administration buildings if demand-side management
          (DSM) measures were adopted.
     x    Low access to electricity in rural and peri-urban areas. In 2004, only 12 percent of
          the total population had access to electricity. Low access to electricity service had
          impeded the development of small and medium enterprises, productivity, income
          generation, health and education programs, and more.

3.      In this context, the government’s strategy for the energy sector focused on the
following actions: (i) creating an institutional, legal, and regulatory framework conducive to
attracting private sector resources to meet the growing absorptive capacity of the economy;
(ii) meeting the short-term generation deficit on the Ouagadougou system; and (iii) lowering
the cost and improving the reliability of supply. These goals were pursued in the wider
framework of the development of the West Africa Power Pool, sponsored by the member
states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

Rational for Bank involvement

4.      The Bank’s intervention was aimed at supporting the GoBF’s shift toward a new
paradigm of considering least-cost options, including the import of cheaper electricity from
neighboring countries. The Bank had not been involved in the power sector in Burkina Faso
for over 20 years, primarily due to the GoBF’s position of favoring high-cost investment
options. The Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) aimed to support the GoBF’s efforts
to increase economic competitiveness by strengthening institutional capacity, reducing the
energy supply cost through cheaper hydro- and gas-based electricity imported from Côte
d’Ivoire, and promoting the rational use of energy. PSDP was designed in a favorable context
characterized by policy and regulatory reforms in the energy sector. 2 In this positive
preparatory context, the Bank had the opportunity to rally the support of the donors for the
GoBF’s sector reform agenda.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.       The original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) were: (i) to enhance the policy
and institutional environment for efficient sector development and operation; (ii) to improve
the availability and reliability of electricity supply in the area covered by the national power
utility, SONABEL; and (iii) to promote rational and efficient use of energy in public
administration buildings through DSM initiatives.

6.     The original outcome indicators were: (i) increased reliability of the power system,
with an overall availability factor for the 225 and 132 kV transmission lines of greater than
99.4 percent starting September 30, 2008, and onward; (ii) increased annual generation of


2
  The Electricity Law (Loi N0060/98/AN) adopted in 1998 aimed at breaking SONABEL’s distribution monopoly. In 2000, the GoBF issued
a Letter of Sector Development Policy stipulating that SONABEL would be privatized and an independent regulatory agency would be
created. Following the recommendations of an International Development Association –financed power sector review in 2003, the GoBF
decided in 2004 on major sector reforms, including opening generation to competition; transmission and distribution bundled into two
subregions (SONABEL’s current perimeter and the area outside this perimeter); creation of an asset -holding company (100 percent state
ownership) and transformation of SONABEL into an operating/leasing company; competitive selection of a private operator/strategic partner
for management control of SONABEL; creation of the regulatory agency; and more.


                                                                   2
about 86 GWh delivered on the Ouagadougou Regional Network at an availability factor of
about 70 percent; (iii) adoption of energy-efficient behaviors and equipment in selected public
administration buildings; and (iv) energy savings realized and peak demand reduced in the
selected public administration buildings.

1.3 Revised PDO (as Approved by Original Approving Authority), Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

7.      The PDO has remained the same over project implementation. The restructuring in
July 2011 and July 2012 brought the following changes for PDO-level indicators:
    x Inclusion of direct project beneficiaries, of which female (%)—Bank core indicator.
    x Improved performance of the Direction générale de l’énergie (DGE), as measured by
       an operational policy framework and monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessment
       systems—indicator elevated from component level to measure the first part of the
       PDO.
    x Split the availability factor indicator for the transmission lines into two parts as
       follows: (i) 225 kV lines greater than 99.4 percent from September 30, 2008, onward
       and (ii) 132 kV lines greater than 99.4 percent from September 30, 2008, onward for
       separate sub-component progress implementation monitoring.
    x Revised increased annual generation indicator as follows: (i) generation capacity
       (MW) of conventional energy constructed under the project; and (ii) energy delivered
       (GWh) to Ouagadougou Regional Network to ensure alignment with new energy
       sector indicators.
    x Split the energy savings realized and peak demand reduced indicator into two parts: (i)
       energy savings realized in selected public administration buildings and (ii) peak
       demand reduced in selected public administration buildings to ensure better reporting.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.       The direct project beneficiary indicator included (i) SONABEL and DGE personnel
participating in the training programs under the project and (ii) the staff in the public
buildings benefiting from the energy-efficient equipment, information, and education
campaign conducted under the project. It was also expected that new customers, especially
from villages located along the transmission line, would benefit from access to electricity and
that existing customers would have a more reliable power supply. The works under the
project would create job opportunities for local contractors and residents. The public
institutions would expect energy savings resulting from DSM measures. Moreover, the
population at large would benefit from relocated public resources due to reduced government
support to SONABEL for fuel imports; public savings generated by the DSM component; and
cheaper and more reliable power supply and more.

1.5 Original Components

9.     Component 1: Institutional strengthening and capacity building (US$4.44 million).
The objective of this component was to build the capacity of DGE in terms of planning,
policy formulation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Specific activities (training,
consultant services, monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment tools) targeted various

                                              3
DGE sub-directorates. This component also included support for capacity enhancement of
SONABEL (procurement and project management capacity) as well as financing of the
second phase of the institutional study for the electricity and hydrocarbon subsectors.

10.    Component 2: Extension and reinforcement of transmission lines (US$83.44 million).
The objective of this component was to support the construction of the Bobo-Ouagadougou
transmission line and reinforce the existing transmission lines connecting Bagre, Kompienga,
and Ouagadougou.

11.    Subcomponent 2.1—Construction of the Bobo-Ouagadougou transmission line
included the following activities: (i) construction of the 338 km 225 kV Bobo-Ouagadougou
transmission line, with all the associated substations and telecommunications equipment; (ii)
connection of five villages along the transmission line; (iii) construction and installation of 90
kV lines and cables, extension and construction of four 90 kV substations for the
Ouagadougou Ring, and supply and installation of 90/15 and 90/33 kV transformers with a
mobile crane (co-financed with NDF); (iv) supervision of construction works; and (v)
implementation of the environmental and social management plan (EMP) to mitigate the risks
associated with the construction of the transmission line. The 225 kV line would interconnect
the CRCB and CRCO networks and fill the emerging supply gap on CRCO at a substantially
lower cost with energy imported from Côte d’Ivoire, rather than further investment in thermal
generation capacity.

12.    Subcomponent 2.2—Reinforcement of the existing transmission lines Bagre-
Kompienga-Ouagadougou consisted of (i) mechanical and structural reinforcement of 941
towers along those transmission lines and (ii) supervision of construction works.

13.     Component 3: Additional thermal generation capacity of 14 MW (US$17.10 million)
consisted of retroactive financing for (i) construction of a turnkey 14 MW diesel power
station and (ii) supervision of construction works.

14.     Component 4: Demand-side management (US$3.38 million) with the following
planned activities: (i) strengthening of the institutional framework to support DSM and
energy-efficiency initiatives; (ii) investment in efficient equipment (air conditioning and
lighting systems); and (iii) information, education, and communication to promote the rational
and efficient use of electricity.

1.6 Revised Components

15.   The original project components were not revised nor were the objectives of the
components changed.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

16.     The restructuring approved in October 2009 facilitated the reallocation of grant
proceeds to accommodate cost overrun for two contracts critical to the completion of the 225
kV line: (i) construction of power stations, transformers, and necessary additional works for
an agreed technical choice of three non-variable reactors instead of two automatic reactors, as
originally planned; and (ii) supervision of works to ensure full commissioning of the
                                               4
transmission line. The restructuring approved in July 2011 allowed a second reallocation of
grant proceeds to finalize the installation and management of the telecom system for the 225
kV line and additional works to secure the 132 kV line and prevent vandalism acts. Table 1
provides further details on allocation of grant proceeds.

17.   The closing date of the project was extended two times, from July 31, 2010 to July 31,
2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

18.      Project preparation took about three years from the review of the concept note and
Bank approval. This allowed a project preparation facility advance to be deployed for
preparatory work. This phase included intense consultations with the GoBF, co-financiers,
beneficiaries, and stakeholders as recommended by the Sector Policy Letter. Sound technical,
economic, financial (with complex sensitivity analysis) and safeguards studies were
completed. Overall, the risks were well identified and mitigation measures proposed. The
high fluctuation of price of raw material and equipment on international market particularly
affected project implementation. Moreover, due to the internal political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire
at the time of the commissioning of the 225 kV line, the estimated energy supply to Burkina
Faso was reduced during the first years of implementation.

19.     The PSDP design responded to key energy sector challenges regarding institutional
capacity, high electricity costs, optimization of grid system, as well as inefficient use of
electricity by the end-users. PSDP represented the reengagement of the Bank through
investments in the energy sector of Burkina Faso after a long period of time. It provided the
Bank with the opportunity to bring its knowledge and rally other donors to ensure a coherent

                                                                5
approach to sector investments favoring least-cost energy options. Lessons learned from
Bank’s operations in the region were incorporated into project design to facilitate the
implementation.

20.    GoBF showed strong commitment to project preparation and effectively coordinated
with the co-financiers on investments in the sector and reform agenda. A tariff increase was
approved before the Board approval. The project was prepared in an optimistic environment
of promoting investments for low cost energy solutions through regional integration along
with sector reforms.

21.     The project effectiveness was delayed from April 19 to November 28, 2005, almost a
year after the Board approval. Although there was some delay in meeting the legal and
fiduciary conditions of the Bank, additional requirements introduced by other co-financiers
exacerbated effectiveness delays. The French Agency for Development (AFD) and the
European Investment Bank (EIB) introduced additional conditions after World Bank Board
approval such as a guarantee by the GoBF of the payment default risk of SONABEL.

Key lessons reflected in project design

22.      Fundamental sector reforms are essential to ensure continued and sustainable
development of the energy sector. The project was prepared in an optimistic, well-articulated
energy policy context that encouraged sector reforms. In 2000, the GoBF issued a Letter of
Sector Development that emphasized private sector participation in the energy sector to
provide modern energy services to the population. In 2001, the Privatization Law on state-
owned entities provided for partial divesture of the GoBF from SONABEL. In 2004, GoBF
decided on major sector reforms based on the recommendations of the 2003 power sector
review. The World Bank–funded Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project
(CEDP) for Burkina Faso (approved in March 2003) was primarily designed to promote
economic competitiveness through sector reform, including the privatization of the utility,
improvement in the investment climate, and private sector development. PSDP complemented
CEDP and was mainly focused on investments, with some institutional capacity-building
activities.

23.      The reform agenda should be implemented in parallel with strategic investments.
PSDP offered the Bank the opportunity to coordinate the donors to support the GoBF’s
reform agenda and low-cost investment plans. Government agreement on a tariff increase was
reached before the Board’s approval of the project. At the same time, investments were
prioritized based on technical, financial, and economic merits. The project was consistent
with the GoBF priority to meet the short-term generation deficit on the CRCO and lower the
energy cost. The Bobo-Ouagadougou interconnection line would not only allow for imports
from Côte d’Ivoire, but it would also connect the two main regional centers, the CRCO and
the CRCB, thus bringing more stability to the network. Therefore, PSDP promoted strategic
investments coupled with institutional capacity building to ensure stakeholders were prepared
for project implementation.

24.     Regional integration paves the way for enhanced energy security and efficiency. These
objectives have been pursued through the development of the West Africa Power Pool
(WAPP). In 2003, 14 ECOWAS countries, including Burkina Faso, signed the Energy
                                              6
Protocol to the 1975 ECOWAS Treaty, which provides for the integration of the electricity
systems in West Africa with an ultimate view of creating a power pool. Against this
background, the extension of the existing Côte d’Ivoire–Bobo-Dioulasso transmission line to
Ouagadougou under PSDP represented a stepping stone toward better regional integration.
The project was designed to diversify and improve the reliability of supply for the CRCO.

25.     Power shortages should be addressed from both supply and demand sides. The project
design included investments aimed at improving the availability and reliability of electricity
supply and promoting rational and efficient use of energy through DSM initiatives.
Recommendations from DANIDA-funded studies on potential savings of DSM initiatives in
public institutions were incorporated into project design.

26.    Donor coordination is important to effectively support Burkina Faso’s reform agenda
and investments. The project was co-financed by the International Development Association
(IDA), AFD, EIB, the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), and the mechanism of Danish
mixed credits composed by resources of NORDEA Bank and subsidies from DANIDA. A
common platform was used by donors to convey specific messages to the GoBF on the reform
agenda and investment plans.

27.    Simplicity of design facilitates implementation. The initial project design envisaged a
wide-scale approach to energy issues in Burkina Faso, including energy access. However,
given the urgency of the problems on the main grid system and to facilitate project take-off,
two separated projects were considered: one specifically designed to increase capacity and
optimize the grid system, while strengthening institutions (PSDP); and the other project
designed to improve energy access in rural and peri-urban areas (Energy Access Project that
followed PSDP).

Assessment of Risks:

28.     Improve policy environment to support sector development strategy. GoBF readiness
to proceed with sector reforms, including private sector participation in the electricity and
hydrocarbon subsectors and the tariff increase, were overestimated. The GoBF decided to
keep SONABEL as a public entity rather than privatizing it as initially envisaged. The
decision was based on the assessment of examples of unsuccessful privatization of electricity
companies in the sub-region (for example, Senegal, Mali, and Côte d’Ivoire) and in the
international environment in general, which led to skepticism on private investors
participating in the bidding process to take over the national utility. Regarding the tariff
increase, a 10.5 percent increase was approved in 2004 and 12.5 percent in 2006, against the
original estimate of 30 percent increase over 2004–6. On the investment side, the GoBF took
actions to meet the short-term generation deficit on the Ouagadougou system, lower the
energy cost, and improve reliability of supply through regional integration.

29.     Assessment of availability of electricity supply from Côte d’Ivoire. The 2010–11
Ivorian political crisis, after the commissioning of the transmission line, led to constrained
domestic energy production, thus having a negative influence on exported energy to Burkina
Faso, which reached 450 GWh in 2011. Therefore, despite the initial commitment of Côte
d’Ivoire to the GoBF and SONABEL, confirmed through a letter on the terms of energy
exports, the internal situation in the exporting country led to reduced volumes of transited
                                               7
energy in the first years after the commissioning of the 225 kV line. The transit is expected to
improve as the macro-economic stability in Côte d’Ivoire is achieved. Moreover, taking into
consideration the slow implementation of the investment plans in other countries of the
region3, it is possible that other factors also had a negative impact on the transited energy
volume between the two countries.

30.     Assessment of institutional arrangements. The overall project coordination was
ensured by UER (Unité d'exécution de la réforme du secteur de l'énergie), DGE and
SONABEL were the implementing agencies and handled specific components and technical
aspects of the project. DGE implemented components 1 (institutional strengthening and
capacity building) and 4 (DSM). SONABEL was in charge of implementation for components
2 (extension and reinforcement of transmission lines) and 3 (additional thermal generation
capacity of 14 MW). A retrospective analysis of the functioning of the institutional
arrangements shows that the complexity of the relationships among various coordinating/
implementing entities (three structures situated at the same level in the sector hierarchy, and
with various technical knowledge, project implementation experience and perceptions on the
fiduciary procedures) was not properly anticipated at project preparation.

31.     Financial covenants should be realistic. In general, the financial covenants were well
established except for the self-financing ratio. The self-financing ratio indicator was not
relevant in a country with significant need for investment for access scale-up and reliable
energy supply. The debt service capacity ratio (DSCR) would have been a more relevant
indicator and would have ensured the alignment with indicators used by other donors.

32.    Delays and cost overruns for Bobo-Dioulasso–Ouagadougou transmission line.
Despite measures taken to accelerate the procurement, such as early preparation of bidding
documents before Board approval, the process was delayed mainly due to underestimation of
resources and time at project preparation and an unanticipated price increase of raw material
on international market since 2007, long negotiations with contractors, and many contract
amendments.

33.    Delays in construction of the 14 MW thermal plant. SONABEL has very long and
solid experience in dealing with thermal plants – installation, operation and maintenance.
However, operational and maintenance challenges led to implementation delays. SONABEL
and the contractor shared responsibility for reparations.

34.    Adoption of DSM by the public. Despite the implementation delays of the DSM
component, more than 25 buildings (original target) have benefited from energy-efficient
investment. The investments have been coupled with an intensive public information
campaign on the rational use of energy. A survey conducted at project closure showed
behavior change with regard to rational use of energy (annex 5). However, considering the


3
 Other countries in the region, which were not affected by political crisis over this period such as Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria have not
been able to implement their investment plan.




                                                                      8
delayed implementation of the DSM initiatives, it is difficult to have an accurate assessment
on behavior change after just a short period.

2.2 Implementation

35.     Overall project implementation. Overall project implementation has been satisfactory.
Three restructurings (2009, 2011, and 2012) have accommodated the cost overrun for the 225
kV line, technology improvements, adjustments of the indicators and extension of closing
date to ensure that the project is completed and the PDOs are met. A mid-term review was
conducted in October 2008 that assessed project status and explored solutions to accelerate
project implementation.

36.      Institutional strengthening and capacity building was satisfactory implemented. The
sector institutions benefited from various capacity-building activities financed under this
component on planning, M&E, procurement and financial management, safeguards, project
management, and others. DGE and UER were equipped with information technology (IT) and
office equipment to improve efficiency. DGE and SONABEL played an important role in the
revision of the law on the general regulation of the electricity subsector adopted in 2007 in
Burkina Faso. In December 2010, the GoBF adopted the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and
Sustainable Development (SCADD) as a new framework for public intervention regarding
economic and social development in Burkina Faso. The strategy is expected to be
implemented through sectorial policies. In September 2011, the GoBF adopted a
methodological guide for sectorial policies. In this context, the Ministry of Energy is updating
the Energy Sector Development Letter. The project also financed the second phase of the
institutional study for the electricity and hydrocarbon subsectors that contributes to sector
policy strengthening.

37.     Implementation of extension and reinforcement of transmission lines was moderately
satisfactory. The Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou 225 kV line was commissioned in December
2009, after a two-year delay. The availability factor was 99.67 percent on December 31, 2011.
The mechanical reinforcement work on the Kompiengra-Bagre-Tenkodogo-Ouagadougou
132 kV line with an availability factor of 95 percent was completed in October 2010, after 10-
month delay. These delays have been caused by various factors including:
 (i)     a long procurement process and cumbersome administrative, fiscal, and customs
         procedures;
 (ii)    unanticipated cost increase due to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and
         equipment;
 (iii) claims for price actualization for key contracts and long negotiations;
 (iv)    challenges related to contract management resulting in a significant number of
         amendments;
 (v)     changes in technology choices;
 (vi)    difficult working relationships among various coordinating/implementing entities ;
         and
 (vii) donor coordination, delays in issuing “no objections? and others.

38.    The mid-term review analyzed these challenges and proposed recommendations such
as simplification of the administrative procedures of the procurement process, improvements
in contract management, actualization of the procurement plan, coordination with the
                                              9
financiers etc. Cost overrun/reallocation for key contracts related to the execution of the 225
kV line (construction of power stations, transformers, works, and supervision related to a
technology change), finalization of installation and management of the telecom system for the
225 kV line, and additional works to secure the 132 kV line and prevent vandalism acts were
accommodated through project restructuring. However, some equipment (for example, a
back-up transformer) was not procured under PSDP due to the cost increase of the
component; it was included in the procurement plan of follow-up projects to ensure the
quality envisaged for the 225 kV line. Moreover, the establishment of the National Control
Center, initially envisaged under PSDP, was financed by SONABEL due to the evolution of
project cost.

39.      Implementation of additional thermal generation capacity of 14 MW was moderately
satisfactory. The construction works for additional thermal capacity (of the 14 MW power
plant) were completed with about a 10-month delay. The annual generation delivered on the
Ouagadougou Regional Network was about 55 GWh on average (against the target of annual
generation of 86 GWh), at an availability factor of 71 percent, and 79 percent for the two
diesel generators financed under the project (against the initial target of 70 percent). The
initial annual thermal production exceeded the annual target (88.8 GWh in 2006) but a major
incident faced by the alternator at one of the thermal plants led to an annual average
production below the target. The long procurement process for spare parts required for repairs
further delayed operation of the plant at full capacity over project implementation. The
changes in the national procurement system in 2008, which require the National Procurement
Directorate (DGMP) to review all procurement packages regardless of type or threshold,
which is very low, further delayed the procurement process. The spare parts are expected at
the beginning of 2013.

40.     Implementation of DSM initiatives was satisfactory. The Energy Management Unit
(Cellule de gestion de l'énergie, CGE) at DGE, in charge of this component, was created in
2006 and the implementation has been delayed. CGE benefited from capacity building and
logistics support. The component financed energy audits, studies, and training programs as
well as the acquisition of software to better manage and monitor energy consumption in
public buildings. For DSM investments for public institutions, the procurement under this
component was particularly affected by changes in the national procurement system. An
active information, education, and communication campaign on energy efficiency has been
conducted, including DSM days (December 2011), TV spots, adds in local newspapers, and
others. The late establishment of the structure in charge with the implementation of DSM
component, the procurement delays and the reduction of the resources allocated to this
component due to the cost overrun of the 225 kV transmission line led to the revision of the
final energy efficiency targets though project restructuring.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

41.     Project restructuring allowed better monitoring of the PDO (by including PDO
indicators on policy and institutional strengthening), more clarity on the results framework,
and adjustments to the implementation schedule. The definition of the outcomes for the first
PDO—enhancing policy and institutional environment for efficient sector development and
operation—is broad. More specific outcomes (for example, new policy adopted, monitoring
system in place, and so forth) and result indicators would have improved the presentation of
                                              10
the results chain. However, the ISRs reported on the number of DGE and SONABEL staff
trained, policies adopted, and the completion of studies financed by the project. On the second
PDO—improving the availability and reliability of electricity supply—the results chain was,
in general, well defined and allowed review of the implementation of components B and C. A
more detailed results framework (km of transmission line constructed/rehabilitated under the
project, substations, and so forth) would have ensured better documentation of the project’s
results and utilization of the data for preparation and evaluation of other power sector projects
and documents. The imported energy from Côte d’Ivoire was regularly reported in the
progress reports. The results chain for the third PDO—promoting rational and efficient use of
energy in public administration buildings through DSM initiatives—was well articulated,
containing both quantitative (number of public buildings that have adopted energy-efficient
behavior and equipment) and qualitative indicators (energy savings). The original target for
the energy savings at peak demand was revised from 25 percent to 10 percent. The indicators
can be used for other DSM initiatives.

42.     UER consolidated the inputs provided by DGE and SONABEL and submitted the
progress reports to IDA regularly. The reports were adequate for the evaluation of project
implementation status and the operation of adjustments through restructuring in order to
ensure the achievement of the PDOs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

43.     Overall, the project complied with the identified safeguards policies (Operations
Policy [OP] 4.01, 4.04, 4.12, and 4.36). The Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the transmission
component were prepared and publicly disclosed by the GoBF and the Bank. The EMP and
Resettlement Policy Plan (RAP) were prepared for the Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou
transmission line. An inter-ministerial committee was set up with some delay, at the
beginning of 2010 to oversee the safeguards implementation. The committee benefited of the
support of local commissions established in the villages affected by the transmission line. The
Bank did not ensure close safeguards supervision and guidance to the client during the first
part of project implementation, which was necessary to avoid implementation delays taking
into consideration the limited prior experience of the client with Bank’s safeguards policies
and procedures. Subsequently, this was rectified and implementation support on safeguards
was ramped up effectively. Despite the delays related to the establishment of the inter-
ministerial committee, the reforestation plan, including the classified forests, 4 has been
implemented with the participation of local communities, which is considered good practice.
The GoBF plans measures to ensure the conservation of the forests and avoid deforestation.
On the social side, an independent firm implemented the compensation process. 5 A social
audit was commissioned in 2011 to take stock of actions taken as recommended by the Bank.
The Bank reviewed the social audit and provided recommendations to the client in a timely
manner. An action plan was prepared by the GoBF. The action plan includes information


4
    Reforestation of 165 hectares (ha) in 60 localities, and restoration of nine classified forests (145 ha).
5
    One thousand two hundred fifty-five persons were resettled; compensation amounted to FCFA 240,617,215.
                                                                     11
measures on the safety risks posed by the transmission lines, as well as further analysis and
additional compensation in case of potential complaints from resettled households. Four
villages have been electrified along the 225 kV line as a social mitigation measure.

44.    An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared and implemented for the 14
MW Kossodo thermal generation plant. There were measures put in place for fuel waste
treatment and disposal. Other measures included sound attenuation, protection equipment for
workers, and electrification of nearby villages.

45.     SONABEL has gained experience in working with the safeguard policies and
procedures of the Bank, which is valuable for implementation of follow-up projects.
SONABEL has an environmental service that ensures projects’ compliance with national
regulations and donors’ policies; this service also includes social aspects. Social expertise is
also outsourced for project-related social issues.

Fiduciary compliance

46.     Procurement and financial management aspects of the project were consistently rated
“satisfactory? or “moderately satisfactory? throughout project implementation. All project
components were implemented following applicable Bank guidelines for works, goods, and
services. Procurement delays for the 225 kV line caused by cost increase, long negotiations
with the contractors, numerous amendments, coordination of several donors etc influenced the
project implementation schedule. The Bank worked closely with the coordinating and
implementing agencies to address the cost overrun challenges through restructuring and
handle the contract amendments based on available information. There were no mis-
procurement or INT issues. Overall, financial management adequately covered the project’s
accounting and reporting arrangements, internal control procedures, planning and budgeting,
counterpart funding, funds flow arrangement, and external audit reporting arrangements. The
audit reports were in general submitted on time. Qualifications raised by some of the audit
reports were addressed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

47.    PSDP operation & maintenance (O&M) arrangements. SONABEL prepared an
operation and maintenance plan for infrastructure constructed under PSDP to ensure
continuous achievement of project objectives, as per the requirements of the Project
Agreement. The plan includes annual maintenance activities of the transmission lines by
SONABEL, which already has spare parts in stock, procurement of spare parts to ensure the
functioning of the 14 MW thermal plant at full capacity, maintenance of the energy-efficient
equipment, and a continuous information campaign and training of beneficiaries on DSM
equipment and the rational use of electricity.

Follow-up actions/operations

48.      Institutional capacity building and sector reform. PSDP continued to build on the
institutional capacity program designed under CEDP, which aims to provide support to the
Ministry of Energy and Mining for management of the mining subsector, the Energy Sector
Regulator, and to SONABEL. In the context of the GoBF decision to keep SONABEL as a
                                              12
public entity, CEDP’s initial objective of privatizing the utility has been reformulated.
Therefore, a capacity-building program is being developed based on three audits
(infrastructure, human resources, and tariffs) with the aim of improving SONABEL’s
management and service delivery. The assistance program is implemented in two steps:
diagnosis of the current situation and the implementation of recommendations aimed at
improving the technical, commercial and organizational performance of SONABEL.

49.    Improving reliability of supply. The GoBF continued the regional integration strategy
under the WAPP. Therefore, PSDP was followed by the first phase of the Inter-Zonal
Transmission Hub Project (approved in June 2011) that finances the interconnection with
Ghana (Bolgatanga-Ouagadougou interconnection) to improve security of supply to Burkina
Faso and to lower energy costs.

50.     Expanding access to electricity. Although the original PSDP design envisaged energy
access, the project was later simplified to facilitate implementation. A follow-up Energy
Access Project was prepared (approved in July 2007) to increase access to energy services in
rural, peri-urban, and urban areas to ensure economic growth and poverty reduction.

51.    DSM initiatives in new projects. Based on the successful initiatives piloted under
PSDP, DSM scale-up is envisaged through the Electricity Sector Support Project, currently
under preparation. Moreover, similar to PSDP, the new project aims to increase generation
capacity and optimize the grid system, while continuing to provide support for institutional
capacity.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

52.     The relevance of project objectives remains “high?. Project objectives to enhance the
policy and institutional environment for efficient sector development and operation, improve
the availability and reliability of electricity supply, and promote rational and efficient use of
energy remain relevant to Burkina Faso’s development priorities, as stated in its Strategy for
Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development 2011–15, the new policy framework for
economic and social development: “meeting the challenge of accelerated growth and
sustainable development will require a permanent supply of electricity at low cost.? The
strategy includes the following actions to foster economic competitiveness:
 (i)    establish an institutional framework that can mobilize actors and raise resources;
 (ii)   secure the country’s supply and reduce energy costs;
 (iii) expand access to electricity; and
 (iv)   improve energy efficiency.

53.    The 2010–12 CAS mentions that limited access, unreliability, and high costs
associated with the economic infrastructure represent major obstacles to private sector
investment and economic competitiveness. The project specifically addressed the institutional
capacity enhancement, reliability, and cost of energy supply as well as energy efficiency.


                                               13
54.     As already noted, project design incorporated support for policy and institutional
development, investments aimed to reduce the energy cost through regional integration,
increased capacity and optimization of grid system, as well as DSM measures. Despite the
delays, the overall implementation approach remains relevant. Adjustments were effected
through project restructuring to respond to cost increase, changes of technology choice and
delays in the implementation schedule in order to meet the PDOs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Efficacy)

55.     The overall achievement of the PDO is rated as “moderately satisfactory.? The
outcome indicators with regard to enhanced policy and institutional environment, improved
availability and reliability of electricity supply, and the rational and efficient use of energy in
public administration buildings through DSM initiatives have been generally met, and some
of them even exceeded. As far as improved availability and reliability of electricity supply,
external factors such as the political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire had a negative impact on the
energy volume imported by Burkina Faso in the first years after the commissioning of the
Bobo-Ouagadougou 225kV transmission line. Moreover, O&M challenges prevented the 14
MW Kossodo thermal generation plant from functioning at full capacity over the entire
project implementation period. The overall rating is based on the considerations that lower
energy cost and improved reliability of supply were the key drivers of this project.

56.     The outcomes achieved related to enhanced policy and institutional environment for
efficient sector development and operation are “satisfactory.? About 297 people have been
trained to (i) support the capacity-building activities of the DGE in terms of planning, policy
formulation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and (ii) enhance the procurement and
project management capacity of the power utility, SONABEL. Following the mid-term
review recommendations, a survey conducted in 2010 concluded that the knowledge acquired
from the capacity-building activities under the project have been well utilized by the
beneficiaries. DGE and UER also benefited from IT and office equipment to improve their
efficiency.

57.      DGE and SONABEL contributed to the revision of the law, adopted in 2007, on the
general regulation of the electricity subsector in Burkina Faso. To follow up on the 2010
SCADD, the Ministry of Energy is updating the Energy Sector Development Policy Letter to:
    (i) elaborate through a participatory process a policy document based on the new
         methodological guide adopted in 2011;
    (ii) review the existing subsectorial strategies on electricity and traditional energy;
    (iii)elaborate the national strategy for hydrocarbon and renewable energy;
    (iv) prepare a budget that supports sectorial policies;
    (v) prepare a document that incorporates cross-sectorial issues (environment, gender, and
         human rights); and
    (vi) prepare an energy sector policy and action plan that address rural electrification,
         hydrocarbons, and traditional and renewable energy.

58.    The project has financed studies on energy supply for Burkina Faso, for example, the
second phase of the institutional study for the electricity and hydrocarbon subsectors that
contribute to the energy sector policy.

                                                14
59.      The outcomes achieved related to improved availability and reliability of electricity
supply in the area covered by the national power utility, SONABEL, are overall rated as
“moderately satisfactory.? The construction of the Bobo-Ouagadougou 225 kV transmission
line with an availability factor of 99.67 percent and reinforcement of the 132 kV transmission
line with an availability factor of 99.5 percent (availability factors better than the initial target
of 99.4 percent for the 225 and 132 kV lines) was completed. External factors such as the
political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire have had a negative influence on the imported energy transited
through the Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou 225 kV line in the first two years of operation.
The imported energy in 2011 was 449,474 MWh. The energy import is expected to increase
once the macroeconomic situation in Côte d’Ivoire improves. The project also provided
retroactive financing for additional installed capacity of thermal generation of 14 MW. This
has led to additional annual generation of about 55 GWh on average delivered on the
Ouagadougou Regional Network (against the target of annual generation of 86 GWh), at an
availability factor of 71 percent, and 79 percent for the two diesel generators (against the
initial target of 70 percent). Although the annual generation started with 88.8 GWh in 2006,
production has been affected by consecutive O&M challenges. Repairs are in progress to
facilitate the two generators functioning at full capacity and reaching the final target.

60.      The outcomes achieved related to the objective of rational and efficient use of energy
in public administration buildings through DSM initiatives are rated “satisfactory.? The
project has contributed to rational and efficient use of energy in public buildings and energy
savings of 8.9 percent realized at peak demand (close to the final target of 10 percent 6). About
33 public buildings have been equipped with energy-efficient equipment and 150 other
buildings benefited from installation of energy-efficient lamps (more than the initial target of
25 buildings).7 Once all installations of energy-efficient equipment are completed, the final
target of energy savings at a peak demand of 10 percent is expected to be met. Audits, studies,
a public information campaign on the rational use of energy, training programs, and other
activities have also been funded under this component to achieve behavior change.

3.3 Efficiency

61.     Efficiency is rated “significant? due to the substitution benefits of the Bobo-
Dioulasso-Ouagadougou 225 kV line (displacement of expensive local thermal generation
with lower-cost imported energy) in the context of steadily climbing world oil prices, 8
particularly since mid-2009, due to political instability in oil-exporting countries. Overall, the
compliance of SONABEL with the financial covenants has been satisfactory. Tariff increase
was approved in 2004 and 2006. The GoBF’s fuel subsidy to the utility has been decreased.

62.     Economic analysis for the Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou 225 kV line. The
economic benefits, as analyzed below, consist of displacement of existing thermal generation
by imported energy from Côte d’Ivoire. Thermal generation is conservatively valued at the
variable cost. It is assumed that the transmission line remains backed up 100 percent by


6
  The energy savings at peak demand target was revised from the original value of 25 to 10 percent. The revision was formalized through the
restructuring approved in July 2012.

thermal capacity. Project costs include the transmission line investment, line operating cost,
cost of energy from Côte d’Ivoire, and associated line losses. The assumptions of the
economic analysis are presented in detail in annex 3.

63.     Despite the reduced imported volumes, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR)
has slightly increased to 26.5 percent (initially forecasted at 24 percent) due to the substitution
benefits.

64.    A comparative assessment of the cost of interconnection Bobo-Dioulasso-
Ouagadougou (completed in December 2009) and Ferke-Bobo (constructed over the period
1998–2001) shows a difference in the average cost per kilometer of transmission line of 12.5
percent. This difference is explained by high prices for raw materials over PSDP
implementation period.

65.    On energy savings, although data show a decrease in the electricity bill of audited
public institutions, it is difficult to accurately assess the impact of the project DSM
component on this reduction considering the influence of other factors such as bill
management.

66.    Financial analysis of the project. The economic analysis methodology reflects solely
the economic benefits from substitution of costly domestic generation with cheaper imports
and not the potential benefits for end-users of increased access, which are less easy to
quantify because they would require an assessment of the counterfactual without the project,
in which part of the demand for electricity is left unserved. Under the methodology used for
economic analysis, all costs and benefits from the project are captured by SONABEL.
Therefore, the financial rate of return (FIRR) for SONABEL is identical to the EIRR.

67.     Financial analysis of SONABEL. Overall, SONABEL complied with the project’s
financial covenants. The status of compliance with the financial covenants is presented below:
    x Self-financing ratio of (i) no less than 40 percent of the three-year average of its
        capital expenditures until 2008 and (ii) no less than 70 percent of the three-year
        average of its capital expenditure from 2009 onward. This requirement was met until
        2010, and deteriorated in later years. The deterioration after 2010 was mainly caused
        by an increase in capital cost. However, it was unrealistic to assume that after a large
        investment related to the 225 kV transmission line SONABEL would reduce its
        investments, considering the low electrification rate in rural areas and the need for
        continued reliable power supply. Debt service capacity ratio (DSCR) would have been
        a more relevant indicator and would have ensured the alignment with indicators used
        by other donors.
    x Maintain its net accounts receivable from electricity sales at all times at no more than
        (i) 120 days of electricity sales in 2005, (ii) 105 days of electricity sales in 2006, and
        (iii) 90 days of electricity sales in 2007, from the beginning of each calendar year and
        onward. SONABEL has complied with this requirement, which is a way of monitoring
        the payment discipline on the GoBF side and proper accounting of commercial losses.
    x Maintain a ratio of net current assets to current liabilities of not less than 1.2 at all
        times. SONABEL complied with this condition. This reflects the decision of the


                                                16
       authorities to maintain the financial viability of the state-owned utility, in contrast
       with neighboring countries.
   x   Communicate SONABEL’s investment program to IDA every year. The utility
       complied with this requirement.

68.      Despite the financial losses experienced by SONABEL in 2011, the utility’s financial
performance since 2005 compares favorably with other countries’ utilities in the sub-region.
The GoBF took several measures to maintain the financial viability of the state-own utility.
The electricity tariff was increased in 2004 by 10.5 percent, and in 2006 by 12.5 percent.
Moreover, the fuel subsidy mechanism shielded SONABEL from exposure to oil price
volatility, but its budgetary burden was becoming unbearable. The GoBF was able to cap it to
FCFA 15 billion per year based on lower energy costs expected from imports. The fuel
subsidy provided by the GoBF to SONABEL in 2011 represented 56.47 percent of those in
2006. Therefore, based on this fuel subsidy reduction, public resources are being shifted to
other sectors/activities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.      The overall outcome rating is “moderately satisfactory? based on the “high? relevance
of objectives, “significant? relevance of the design, “moderately satisfactory? achievement of
outcomes, and “significant? efficiency. All achievements of the project - institutional capacity
building, interconnection line that ensures lower energy cost for Burkina Faso, network
reinforcement, additional installed thermal capacity, and rational use of energy through DSM
initiatives - remain highly relevant for Burkina Faso’s energy sector. Despite the supply
constraints in Côte d’Ivoire negatively impacting the energy volume exported to Burkina Faso,
the substitution benefits for the Bobo-Ouagadougou 225 kV transmission line are substantial
(the cost of local thermal generation was almost 50 percent higher than those of energy
imported from Côte d’Ivoire in the first years after the commissioning of the transmission
line). The transited volume of energy is expected to increase as the macro-economic stability
in Côte d’Ivoire improves. The transmission line also brings more stability to the national
network by connecting two main regional centers, the CRCO and the CRCB, and significantly
contributes to a unified grid in Burkina Faso.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

70.    Taking into consideration the relationship between power supply and economic
development, the project contributes to poverty reduction by addressing one of the key
obstacles to the country’s competitiveness, namely the limited and unreliable electricity
supply. Improved reliability and availability of lower-cost power positively influence
productivity and income generation. Benefits of DSM initiatives include reduction of GoBF’s
energy bills through better utilization of electricity by public administration and reallocation
of resources to other areas. Project restructuring has also allowed monitoring of women
beneficiaries for institutional capacity building and DSM.

                                              17
71.     Further, the replacement of thermal generation by cleaner energy imported from Côte
d’Ivoire and gradual adoption of energy-efficient appliances through the project contribute to
lower carbon emission reductions.

Institutional change/strengthening

72.     The project had a component that specifically targeted institutional strengthening in
terms of planning, policy formulation, and M&E to lay the ground for sector reforms.
Moreover, since PSDP was the first Bank investment project in Burkina Faso after a long
absence, it enhanced the project management and fiduciary and safeguards operational
capacity of the institutions involved, particularly SONABEL, with positive impacts on the
preparation and implementation of follow-on projects. Finally, public institutions were among
the beneficiaries of DSM training programs, awareness campaigns, and energy-efficient
equipment that are expected to yield long-term behavior change toward the rational use of
energy.

Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)

73.     Surveys conducted in the villages electrified under the project (as a social mitigation
measure) revealed positive effects on the beneficiaries. Almost all of the households (94.83
percent) surveyed stated that the electricity service provided under the project improved their
living conditions. Prior to electrification, the majority of households surveyed (58.5 percent)
used kerosene as the main source of energy, followed by solar panels and diesel generators,
primarily for lighting. Connection to the grid has enabled them to take advantage of
household appliances and diversify energy benefits. Most frequently cited benefits include, in
order of importance, the creation of new income-generating activities (34.48 percent), better
access to information (51.72 percent), improved learning conditions for children (24.14
percent). The majority of the companies that have had access to electricity service under the
project stated that their customers, sales and benefits increased. An important improvement
that has been observed is the growth of businesses located around streetlights at nighttime.
The results of the survey are presented in annex 5.

74.     The political crisis in Côte d’Ivoire had a negative impact on the estimated imported
energy at lower cost. Moreover, fluctuations in the price of raw materials led to higher
contract values. Local companies had weak capacity and did not qualify for contracts under
the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

According to a survey conducted among the beneficiaries of the DSM initiatives for public
institutions, almost all the respondents (98.3 percent) admit that they have been influenced by
the training program and awareness campaign on rational use of energy conducted under the
project. This indicates that the various communication outlets utilized by the CGE for
awareness campaign – posters, conferences, media, gadgets, etc. have been appropriate and
effective at reaching public administration employees and beyond. The results of the survey
are summarized in annex 5.


                                              18
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

75.     The risk to the development outcome of this project is rated “moderate.? SONABEL is
taking measures for maintenance of the transmission lines constructed and reinforced under
the project, as well as for the functioning of the Kossodo thermal plant. The macroeconomic
stabilization in Côte d’Ivoire, supported by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF)
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) is expected to have a positive effect on the energy supply to
Burkina Faso. On the demand side, the Electricity Sector Support Project will scale up the
DSM initiative piloted under PSDP and continue to provide capacity building on rational use
of energy. The GoBF would need to continue the reform agenda, which is very important for
the sustainability of the project and the development outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

76.     The Bank’s performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project
was rated “moderately satisfactory.? The Bank provided adequate resources, in terms of staff
weeks and budget, to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work. The preparation took
approximately three years and involved two task team leaders (TTLs) since the Bank resumed
its support for the energy sector after a long period and several studies were commissioned.
The initial project design was comprehensive, including rural energy access. It was simplified
in 2003 to effectively respond to urgent sector challenges regarding institutional capacity and
optimization of the grid system and facilitate project take-off. A comprehensive economic and
financial analysis was conducted and technical alternatives explored. A number of risks were
identified and risk mitigation measures highlighted. Some risks, such as the GoBF’s
commitment to sector reforms, and the resources and time for the implementation of the
Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou transmission line, were underestimated. Moreover, the team
did not fully anticipate the difficult working relationship among various entities involved in
project implementation. The Bank played a key role in coordinating donor financing for the
project and dialogue with the GoBF on the sector’s reform agenda. The Bank team supported
the GoBF in adopting a first tariff increase before the approval of the project by the World
Bank Board and preparing the bidding documents.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

77.     The Bank’s performance for       supervision quality during project implementation was
rated “satisfactory.? Positive aspects   include a strong focus on supervision to achieve PDOs;
proactive responses to emerging          issues (such as cost overruns and delays in the
implementation schedule) through         project restructuring and flexibility in incorporating
                                                 19
technology improvements; accelerated implementation performance after initial slow
disbursement; and development of the results framework based on the Bank’s M&E advanced
guidance for the teams. The team composition changed during project implementation,
including three TTLs. During the second half of implementation, the core team was located in
the field, including the TTL who conducted an intensified dialogue with the Borrower and
local staff, energy and procurement specialists, with good knowledge of Burkina Faso’s
energy sector. Some delays were recorded in providing No Objections on bidding documents
but they were not more significant than those related to other Bank funded projects. Moreover,
the Bank’s procurement evaluation time improved once local energy and procurement
specialists were in place. The team worked closely with the client on numerous contract
amendments. Financial management supervision was satisfactory and the adequacy of
financial management arrangements was reviewed regularly. Safeguards supervision initially
did not fully take into account the limited prior experience of the client with Bank’s policies
and procedures. However, the Bank stepped up its safeguards supervision and provided
hands-on support during the second part of project implementation. Following the Bank’s
recommendations, a social audit for the transmission line was commissioned in 2011 to take
stock of the implemented actions. The Bank reviewed the social audit and provided guidance
to the client in a timely manner to address the issues presented by the document. As follow up,
an action plan was prepared by the client. The project was completed with no major
safeguards issues. The supervision reports were candid and of good quality, including
reporting on the outcome indicators. Lessons learned from the design and implementation of
PSDP have been incorporated into follow-up operations.

(c) Justification of rating for overall Bank performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

78.     Overall Bank performance is rated “moderately satisfactory.? The quality at entry was
moderately satisfactory because some of the risks were underestimated. The underestimated
resources and time at entry in particular led to implementation challenges for the 225 kV line.
Close supervision of project implementation contributed to good achievement of the PDO and
full disbursement. Despite some procurement delays, overall, the project development
objectives have been reached and the disbursement rate reached 100 percent.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government performance

Rating: Satisfactory

79.     The Government performance is rated “satisfactory?. GoBF commitment to
development objectives was strong from the outset, as demonstrated by the initiatives aimed
at strengthening institutional capacity, securing a lower-cost energy supply, and promoting
efficient energy use. Several reform agenda items have been accomplished, such as the tariff
increase, a reduced fuel subsidy for SONABEL, improvement of the legal framework
regarding energy supply, establishment of the Rural Electrification Fund, with a focus on
rural electrification, and so forth. Moreover, the GoBF effectively coordinated with a number
of donors on the design and implementation of the project.
                                                20
80.    As far as project implementation, changes in the new national procurement system
adopted in 2008 have complicated the procurement process and led to delays in the later years
of implementation.

Implementing agency or agencies performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

81.    Overall, the performance of the coordinating and implementing agencies is rated
“moderately satisfactory?. The working relationship among the coordinating unit, UER, and
the implementing structures/institutions, DGE and SONABEL, was sometimes challenging
and contributed to some processing delays. However, the project was completed with no
major issues related to fiduciary and safeguards policies, despite multiple donor policies and
procedures applicable under the project and limited prior experience of the coordinating and
implementing structures with these policies. The institutions/structures involved developed
project management and implementation expertise, which are valuable for follow-up
operations. They also gained experience with donors’ fiduciary and safeguards policies.

Overall, UER ensured good coordination of procurement, financial management, and
monitoring activities. The implementation progress reports, audits, and financial reports were
diligently submitted to the Bank. SONABEL had solid technical expertise accumulated from
the design and implementation of previous projects. However, the management of the
contracts, which involved numerous amendments, contributed to implementation delays. On
safeguards, an inter-ministerial committee was set up, with some delays, to oversee the
implementation of safeguard policies for the Bobo-Ouagadougou 225 kV transmission line.
The reforestation plan for the transmission line and social compensation measures for
resettlement were implemented. Environmental and social measures have been also taken for
the 14 MW thermal generation plant. DGE significantly delayed the establishment of the CGE
for implementation of the DSM initiative but the component yielded good results by project
completion.

Justification of rating for overall Borrower performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

82.     Overall Borrower performance was rated “moderately satisfactory.? The GoBF
showed strong commitment to the PDOs. Challenges related to contract management,
coordination on safeguards, and late establishment of CGE for the DSM initiative contributed
to delays in the implementation schedule. However, despite the lack of prior experience with
the Bank’s and other donors’ fiduciary and safeguard policies and procedures, the borrower
ensured a good achievement of PSDP outcomes. No major issues regarding the fiduciary or
safeguards policies were recorded. The coordinating and implementing agencies developed
project management expertise.

6. Lessons Learned

83.     It is difficult to foresee and calculate the impact of externalities such as political risk,
thus appropriate mitigating measures should be identified. Political risks (for example,
regional context) should not be underestimated at project preparation. Countries in the region
should be encouraged to proceed with regional integration for lower-cost energy options.
However, to ensure energy security, national generation capacity should not be neglected,
particularly considering the fragility of the states in West Africa.

84.     Sector reforms should be pursued in parallel with investments. PSDP had a strong
investment focus. However, since the project involved a significant number of donors, it
offered the opportunity for a cohesive dialogue with the client on sector reforms to ensure
sector development sustainability. Strong momentum was created at project preparation.
However, skepticism raised by unsuccessful privatization of electricity companies in the sub-
region slowed down the reform agenda.

85.     Institutional arrangements should involve few entities if possible. It is difficult for a
structure without hierarchical influence over the implementing units/institutions to ensure
effective coordination of complex projects. Relationships among the institutions/structures
involved should be carefully analyzed at project preparation and the responsibilities clearly
defined.

86.     Thorough      assessment     of    fiduciary    and      safeguard     capacity      of
coordinating/implementing structures is necessary during project preparation and
appropriate mitigation measures implemented to avoid implementation delays. Strong
contract management knowledge is very important to facilitate project implementation. Early
preparation of bidding documents for complex components even before Board approval is a
good practice, especially when several donors are involved. A realistic assessment of the
client’s safeguard capacity should be conducted during project preparation, especially in cases
where the institutions involved do not have experience with implementation of the Bank’s
safeguard policies and procedures. Support from the country office on fiduciary and
safeguards is important to avoid implementation delays.

87.     Realistic estimation of components’ costs at preparation and anticipation of price
fluctuations for key raw materials and equipment are important to avoid cost overruns. Poor
estimates can lead to implementation delays and put the quality of the project at risk. Solid
preparatory studies and a conservative economic and financial analysis are necessary to
establish realistic allocations.

88.      Simplicity and clarity in project design are important to facilitate project
implementation. Although there are many sector challenges that need to be addressed,
selectivity is very important at project design to reduce transaction costs for the client and to
facilitate implementation.

89.     Financial covenants should be realistic relative to the client’s capacity. The capacity
of the client to meet the financial covenants should be well assessed. The self-financing ratio
indicator was not relevant in a country with a low rate of electricity, which relies on external
support for investments in expanding access and ensuring reliable energy supply.

Borrower/implementing agencies

Comments on the ICR

90.     The ICR reflects the summary of project preparation and implementation. The changes
in the national procurement system in 2008 did not only influence the implementation of the
DSM component. All the entities should comply with these rules.

Summary of PSDP completion report submitted by the GoBF:

91.     The project is part of a strategy aimed at ensuring lower energy cost to respond to
challenges posed by national supply constraints and high cost of thermal generation. Overall,
the project objectives have been achieved. DGE benefited from capacity building and
technical assistance for studies on the revision of the laws on electricity supply for Burkina
Faso and privatization of SONABEL. It also benefitted of office and IT equipment. The
implementation of the interconnection line was satisfactory. The transmission line would
allow energy transit from Côte d’Ivoire at maximum capacity of 121 MW. High investments
in thermal generation have been avoided (especially in the context of high oil price) as a result
of this project. Despite an imported volume below the optimal level during the first year after
commissioning, the energy transit in the following years confirmed the importance of the
transmission line. The high availability factor of the transmission line is a qualitative feature
of the project. The interconnection contributes to the stability of CRCO. Power shortages that
affected the activity of the industrial and service sectors have been ameliorated. The
retroactive financing for the 14 MW thermal plant has not fully reached the annual target due
to operational challenges. The plant had an average performance of 64 percent over the period
2006-2011 or 59 percent if the 2012 data is included in the calculation. The low performance
over 2012 is also due to the fact that one of the thermal generation groups was stopped, taking
into account the expected increased energy transit from Côte d’Ivoire. The DSM component
has yielded results since 2011 as reflected by a reduction in the cost of electricity for the
public administration. The GoBF’s project completion report is presented in annex 7.

Cofinanciers

92.     NDF: the scope of the activities financed by NFD was reduced as the most favorable
offers exceeded the credit amount by 64 percent. It was agreed that SONABEL would cover
the costs outside the scope of NDF’s budget.

93.     AFD: The project responded to the expectations of the stakeholders – GoBF,
SONABEL and its customers, and donors. The 225 kV line was completed by a qualified
team, based on high quality equipment to ensure the sustainability of the project. The
technical restrictions imposed by limited allocated resources (particularly for the transit of the
energy transported by the 225 kV line to customers through the 90 kV distribution circle,
which does not currently have a back-up transformer) should be addressed in order to ensure a
good functionality of the project. The volume of imported energy was about 60 percent of the
expected energy transited from Côte d’Ivoire for 2011. However, the economic subst itution
benefits of the transmission line were significant. The progressive increase of the energy
                                               23
volume imported from Côte d’Ivoire allowed a reduction of the GoBF fuel subsidy, which
was capped to FCFA 15 billion per year over the period 2012-2015. Moreover, the project
brings stability to the national network. Therefore, it would allow the development of
renewable energy with intermittent characteristics (such as solar energy) and the provision of
lower cost electricity to rural areas. Lessons learned/recommendations include (i) proper
estimation of resources at project preparation to avoid implementation delays; (ii)
strengthening of the fiduciary capacity of the client; (iii) better communication on safeguards
policies and procedures; (iv) long term regional integration strategy including technology
options that would allow a good administration of the imported energy. The summary of the
AFD report is presented in annex 8 and the full report is saved in the project file.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      Economic analysis for the Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou 225 kV line. The
economic benefits, as analyzed below, consist of displacement of existing thermal generation
by imported energy from Côte d’Ivoire. Thermal generation is conservatively valued at the
variable cost. It is assumed that the transmission line remains backed up 100 percent by
thermal capacity. Project costs include the transmission line investment, line operating cost,
cost of energy from Côte d’Ivoire, and associated line losses. Compared to the original PAD
economic analysis, the current evaluation is based on the following assumptions:
    x The cost of the 225 kV line is close to the original estimate since some equipment (for
        example, a back-up transformer) was not procured due to the increase in price.
    x The estimated imports have been delayed and reduced because of the supply
        constraints in Côte d’Ivoire.
    x Substitution benefits have considerably increased due to high local thermal generation
        cost (US$0.25 per kWh in 2012). This has been driven by high oil prices recorded in
        recent years and rental generation (2011–12).

2.      Therefore, despite the reduced imported volumes, the economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) has slightly increased to 26.5 percent (initially forecasted at 24 percent) due to the
substitution benefits.

3.     A comparative assessment of the cost of interconnection Bobo-Dioulasso-
Ouagadougou (completed in December 2009) and Ferke-Bobo (constructed over the period
1998–2001) shows a difference in the average cost per kilometer of transmission line of 12.5
percent. This difference is explained by high prices for raw materials over PSDP
implementation period.

4.     On energy savings, although data show a decrease in the electricity bill of audited
public institutions, it is difficult to accurately assess the impact of the project DSM
component on this reduction considering the influence of other factors such as bill
management.

5.     Financial analysis of the project. The economic analysis methodology reflects solely
the economic benefits from substitution of costly domestic generation with cheaper imports
and not the potential benefits for end-users of increased access, which are less easy to
quantify because they would require an assessment of the counterfactual without the project,
in which part of the demand for electricity is left unserved. Under the methodology used for
economic analysis, all costs and benefits from the project are captured by SONABEL.
Therefore, the financial rate of return (FIRR) for SONABEL is identical to the EIRR.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results9

Summary of the results of the survey for the beneficiaries of the DSM initiatives for public
institutions

1.       A survey on the behavior change of the beneficiaries of the DSM initiatives for public
institutions was conducted at the end of the project. It should be noted that the survey analysis
has its limitations, particularly in terms of demonstrated behavior change, as it is based on
statements of the interviewees and not on direct observation, and may thus be biased.

2.     It appears from the survey that almost all the respondents (98.3%) admit that they
have been affected by the training program and awareness campaign on rational use of energy
conducted under the project. This indicates that the various communication outlets utilized by
the CGE for awareness campaign – posters, conferences, media, gadgets, etc. have been
appropriate and effective at reaching public administration actors and beyond.

3.      The vast majority of the interviewed users believe that the measures for reducing
energy consumption are adequate (71.9%), with only a very small minority (5.3%) holding
the opposite view. Similar results are reported regarding the perceived feasibility of the
proposed DSM actions. About 84.2% of the interviewed beneficiaries consider these actions
feasible, and none see them as completely unfeasible. Both of these indicators are very
important since the reasonableness and feasibility of an action can significantly support the
DSM initiative implementation.

4.     The survey also presented a breakdown of newly adopted attitudes towards energy use
among public administration servants. The analysis of that breakdown indicates that the
methods that users appear to apply the most include (in order of importance): stopping the air
conditioner when absent from the office for extended periods (97.50%), keeping doors and
windows closed when the air conditioner is running (94.80%), switching off the computer
when absent from the office for extended periods (93%), switching off the light when absent
from the office for extended periods (90%).

5.      In general and based on the statements of the respondents it appears that there is a
good level of application of DSM activities and the beneficiaries are aware of rational use of
energy.

Summary of the results of the survey for customers connected to the grid under the project
(villages connected along the transmission line as social mitigation measure)

6.     The surveyed customers connected to the grid under the project noticed a positive
impact of the electricity service on their lives. Prior to electrification, the majority of
households surveyed (58.5%) used kerosene as the main source of energy, followed by solar



9
 It should be noted that the surveys were conducted at the closure of the project. Therefore the limited implementation time was not
sufficient for the assessment of the results with full accuracy


                                                                    31
panels and generators, primarily for lighting. The vast majority of households have been
unable to take advantage of household appliances as refrigerators (96.7%), television (73.3%),
radio (78.3%), fans (96.7%), etc. Connection to the grid has enabled them to access these
amenities. The current access rate to lighting has reached 100% in electrified villages, the
television use almost 68.3%, fan use 45% and refrigerator 16.7%.

7.      These changes have resulted in positive reaction from the population that has
benefited from electrification. Almost all of the households (94.83%) believe their living
conditions have improved. Most frequently cited changes include, in order of importance, the
creation of new income-generating activities (34.48%), better access to information (51.72%),
improved learning conditions for children (24.14%). Some of the income generating activities
as a result of electrification under the project include the sale of soft drinks (the most
practiced at 20.69%), followed by the installation of mills (5.17%) and opening of kiosks
(5.17%).

8.      The impact of the project on local business was also assessed. A large portion of
companies surveyed (39.3%) did not have access to power prior to electrification. The
majority of these customers used solar panels, generators, gas and kerosene, with high
operating costs or limited use (mostly lighting). As a result of electrification, the total number
of employees of the surveyed companies has increased from 29 to 37 (an increase of 27.59%).
The firms recognized that this increase is mainly attributable to electrification that allowed
them to grow the business. The majority of companies stated that their customers, sales and
benefits increased after electrification. An important improvement that has been observed is
the growth of businesses located around streetlights at nighttime. In total, 85 small businesses
that benefited of lighting provided by lamps were registered at the time of the survey,
including repair shops (40), soft drink stands (14), fruit stands (16), vegetable stands (7), etc.

9.     While at the moment of the survey very few schools were connected to the grid and
the effects did not appear to be quantifiable, in the health sector, about 40% of health
providers and veterinary services benefited of electricity service. This has resulted in longer
working hours, use of electrical medical equipment and better lighting.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


Summary of Borrower’s ICR:

1.      The project is part of a strategy aimed at ensuring lower energy cost to respond to
challenges posed by national supply constraints and high cost of thermal generation. Overall,
the project objectives have been achieved. DGE benefited of capacity building and technical
assistance for studies for the revision of the laws on electricity supply for Burkina Faso and
privatization of SONABEL. It also benefitted of office and IT equipment. The
implementation of the interconnection line was satisfactory. The transmission line would
allow energy transit from Côte d’Ivoire at maximum capacity of 121 MW. High investments
in thermal generation have been avoided (especially in the context of high oil price) as a
consequence of this project. Despite the imported volume below the optimal level during the
first year after commissioning, the energy transit in the following years confirmed the
importance of the transmission line. The high availability factor of the interconnection line is
a qualitative feature of the project. The interconnection contributes to the stability of CRCO.
Power shortages that affected the activity of the industrial and service sectors have been
ameliorated. The retroactive financing for the 14 MW thermal plant has not fully reached the
annual target due to operational challenges. The plant had an average performance of 64
percent over the period 2006-2011 or 59 percent if the 2012 data is inputted in the calculation.
The low performance over 2012 is also due to the fact that one of the groups was stopped,
taking into account the expected transit from Côte d’Ivoire. The DSM component has yielded
results since 2011 reflected by a reduction of the cost of electricity for the public
administration. The estimated financial savings for 2011 are about FCFA 1.5 billion and
energy saving of 211,507 kWh.

2.      The overall evaluation of the Bank’s performance is satisfactory. The Bank identified
the challenges faced by the energy sector in Burkina Faso. The project components were well
defined for strengthening the electricity sub-sector. The supervision missions were held
regularly (twice a year) and the Aide-Memoires presented recommendations that allowed a
good project management for achieving the PDOs. The Bank team had an active role in
addressing challenges posed by the project and supported the structures involved in
strengthening the fiduciary and safeguards capacity. However, the delays in providing No
Objections on procurement documents negatively influenced the completion of the inter-
connection line as scheduled.

3.      The GoBF showed strong commitment to the project. National resources were
allocated for the implementation of environmental and social safeguards. However,
differences between national and Bank’s procurement procedures had a negative impact on
the client’s performance. All the structures involved played an active role during the project
implementation.

4.     Lessons learned. More precise feasibility studies need to be completed at project
preparation to avoid cost overrun. Environmental and social studies should be finalized
during preparation to avoid implementation delays. The harmonization of national and Bank’s
procedures is very important. Particular attention should be paid to the delays in the
evaluation of procurement documents.
                                            34
5.      The capacity building considered by the Bank as a catalyst for project implementation
should be well emphasized. Indeed, this contributes to the preparation and implementation of
future projects. The quality of the procurement documents significantly improved by the end
of the project.

6.     Based on the lessons learned from the design and implementation of PSDP, the
duplications that need to be avoided are related to (i) institutional arrangement; (ii)
harmonization of technical and fiduciary procedures among partners; (iii) evaluation of
developed competences.

      1.      Contexte, Objectifs de développement et conception du projet

           1.1.      Contexte

Dans le Document de stratégie pour la réduction de la pauvreté (DSRP), élaboré en juin 2000,
le Gouvernement du Burkina Faso a décrit les grandes lignes de sa stratégie de réduction de la
pauvreté autour de trois (3) objectifs quantitatifs qui sont les suivants :

(i)               L’accroissement du produit intérieur brut (PIB) par habitant d’au moins 3 % entre
                  2000 et 2003 ;
(ii)              La réduction de l’incidence de la pauvreté de 45 % à 30 % d’ici 2015 ;
(iii)             L’accroissement de l’espérance de vie d’au moins dix ans d’ici 2015.

Il a été généralement admis qu’il faudra accélérer le rythme de réduction de la pauvreté et, par
conséquent, la croissance économique, pour atteindre ces objectifs. Bien que le PIB réel soit
en croissance de 5 % par an en moyenne durant la dernière décennie, ces résultats ne pourront
avoir d’impacts durables que si les principaux obstacles à la croissance à long terme et à la
compétitivité internationale sont éliminés. Il s’agit notamment :

      x    De l’insuffisance des ressources humaines et la faible productivité de la main-
           d’œuvre ;
      x    De la faiblesse des infrastructures de production et du coût élevé des facteurs ;
      x    De la taille limitée du secteur structuré ;
      x    Des faibles capacités institutionnelles.

Le rapport 2003 sur l’état d’avancement de la stratégie d’aide-pays confirme que la stratégie
définie dans la SAP 2000 reste appropriée et que la question de l’accroissement de la
compétitivité reste à l’ordre du jour et doit être abordée dans différents projets et secteurs.

A cet effet, le Gouvernement a pris des mesures au titre du quatrième crédit d’appui de la
réduction de la pauvreté approuvé en mai 2004, afin d’augmenter l’investissement dans le
développement des infrastructures de façon à relever le défi de la croissance impulsée par le
secteur privé.

Au niveau sectoriel, l’importance des services d’électricité pour accroître la compétitivité
économique et améliorer les indicateurs sociaux est une préoccupation du Gouvernement. En
effet, le coût élevé de l’électricité entrave la compétitivité, limite la participation du secteur
privé dans l’industrie et les services, et impose une lourde charge aux finances publiques. Par
ailleurs, les nouvelles contraintes qui pèsent sur la production d’électricité risquent de grever
encore davantage l’économie.

Face à cette situation, le Gouvernement a initié une réforme du secteur de l’énergie par
l’adoption, en décembre 2000, d’une Lettre de Politique de Développement du Secteur de
l’Energie (LPDE) qui propose la mise en place d’un cadre réglementaire adéquat impliquant
le privé dans la gestion du secteur d’une part et d’autre part la poursuite des investissements.
Pour ce faire, le plan opérationnel, adopté en septembre 2001, a permis la réalisation des
activités préalables à la mise en place du Projet de Développement du Secteur de l’Electricité
                                                   37
(PDSE) dont la vocation essentielle est la réalisation d’investissements par la construction des
infrastructures suivantes :

   x   La construction d’une liaison électrique reliant Bobo-Dioulasso à Ouagadougou et
       d’une boucle autour de Ouagadougou ;
   x   le renforcement mécanique de la ligne de transport Kompienga-Bagré-Tenkodogo-
       Ouagadougou ;
   x   la construction de centrales thermiques.

Le projet comprend aussi un important volet renforcement des capacités des institutions et la
maîtrise de la consommation de l’énergie électrique de l’administration publique.

       1.2.    Objectif de développement du projet et indicateurs clés tels que approuvés à
               la mise en vigueur

L’objectif de développement du projet était d’améliorer la compétitivité de l’économie en
réduisant le coût des facteurs de production par un approvisionnement à moindre coût et
l’utilisation rationnelle de l’électricité. Les objectifs spécifiques visés étaient les suivants :

   x   renforcer le cadre de l’action publique et l’environnement institutionnel afin de
       permettre la mise en valeur et la gestion du secteur ;
   x   améliorer la fiabilité et l’accès au service de l’électricité dans les zones desservies par
       la SONABEL ;
   x   promouvoir l’utilisation rationnelle et efficace de l’électricité dans les édifices publics
       par des initiatives de gestion axée sur la demande.

Les principaux résultats attendus étaient la sécurisation et la sûreté de l’approvisionnement du
Centre régional de consommation de Ouagadougou (CRCO) en énergie électrique d’une part
et l’assainissement des finances publiques d’autre part.

L’annexe 1 présente le cadre des résultats qui sont mesurés sur la base de quatre indicateurs :

   9   Le taux de disponibilité global du réseau électrique ;
   9   Le taux de disponibilité des capacités additionnelles de production thermique ;
   9   Le taux de réduction du montant des factures d’électricité des édifices publics ;
   9   Le taux d’économie d’énergie dans les édifices publics.

Des indicateurs de résultats intermédiaires sont attribués à chaque composante. Au total, six
résultats intermédiaires ont été établis pour les quatre composantes.




                                               38
       1.3.    Amendements apportés à l’objectif de développement du projet et aux
               indicateurs clés tels que approuvés à la mise en vigueur

L’objectif de développement du projet n’a pas subi d’amendement. Par contre, les indicateurs
clés initiaux, relatifs à la maîtrise de la demande d’énergie, ont été revus lors de la revue à mi -
parcours. La cible initiale de 25% a été ramenée à 10%, confère l’Aide mémoire de la mission
de revue à mi-parcours de juin 2008.

       1.4.    Principaux bénéficiaires du projet

Les principaux bénéficiaires sont :

      La Direction Générale de l’Energie par son renforcement dans son rôle de formulation
       de politiques énergétiques ;
      La SONABEL par une amélioration de ses capacités et la fiabilité de la fourniture
       d’électricité au CRCO ;
      L’Etat du Burkina Faso par une réduction des subventions accordées à la SONABEL
       et des factures d’électricité de l’Administration ;
      Les populations par un meilleur accès aux services modernes de l’énergie.

       1.5.    Les composantes du projet à la mise en vigueur

Le PDSE a été mis en œuvre à travers quatre composantes qui sont.

               1.5.1. Composante « Renforcement institutionnel et des capacités »

L'objectif de cette composante a été de renforcer les capacités de la Direction Générale de
l’Énergie et de services techniques du Ministère en charge de l’énergie. Les activités
spécifiques (formation, services de consultants, outils de suivi-évaluation et dotations) ont été
réalisées sur la base des besoins exprimés par les différentes directions du ministère. Les
activités de cette composante ont été financées par l’IDA et le budget de l’Etat.




                                                39
                  1.5.2. Composante « Extension et renforcement des lignes électriques de
                         transport »

Cette composante comprend deux sous- composantes.

La sous-composante construction de la ligne d’interconnexion électrique Bobo- Dioulasso -
Ouagadougou et la sous-composante renforcement des lignes de transport électrique
Kompienga –Bagré –Tenkodogo- Ouagadougou.

La première sous-composante concerne :

  I.      la construction de tronçons de ligne de 225 kilovolts, longs de 338 kilomètres reliant
          Bobo- Dioulasso à Ouagadougou, de 3 postes de transformation et des équipements de
          téléconduite ;
 II.      l’électrification de 5 villages situés le long de la ligne ;
III.      la construction d’une boucle 90 kV autour de Ouagadougou pour l’évacuation de
          l’énergie ;
IV.       la supervision des travaux de construction ;
 V.       la mise en œuvre du plan de gestion environnementale et sociale (PGES) pour atténuer
          les impacts associés aux travaux.

L'objectif de cette sous-composante a été d’étendre au CRCO les avantages de l’importation
d’énergie, meilleur marché de la Côte-d’Ivoire. En effet, la ligne d’interconnexion
Ferkessédougou - Bobo-Dioulasso, en service depuis avril 2001, était sous utilisée car ne
transitait que 25 MW pour les besoins du Centre régional de consommation de Bobo-
Dioulasso (CRCB) contre une capacité nominale de 121 MW. La rentabilité de cette
infrastructure s’en trouvera améliorée. Cette sous composante est cofinancée par l’IDA, le
NDF, l’AFD, la BEI, les Crédits Mixtes danois, DANIDA, le budget de l’Etat et la
SONABEL.

La 2ème sous- composante a concerné le renforcement mécanique et structurel de la ligne de
transport Kompienga, Bagré, Tenkodogo et Ouagadougou afin d'accroître la fiabilité de
l'évacuation de l’énergie électrique provenant des centrales hydroélectriques. En effet, cette
ligne a connu des pannes mécaniques récurrentes dues aux intempéries.

Financées entièrement par l’IDA, les activités menées sont les suivantes :

       a) la réalisation des études d'ingénierie ;
       b) le renforcement mécanique et structurel des 941 pylônes de la ligne de transport ;
       c) la supervision des travaux.

                  1.5.3. Composant « Mise en place de deux centrales thermiques de
                         production de 14 MW »

Cette composante est relative au renforcement des capacités de production thermique du
CRCO par la construction clef en main de deux centrales électriques diesel de 14 et 18 MW
respectivement. Ces centrales devront servir de réserve froide pendant le fonctionnement de la

                                                 40
ligne. La composante est financée par l’IDA, les Crédits Mixtes danois, DANIDA, la
SONABEL et le budget de l’Etat.

                1.5.4. Composant « Gestion de la demande d’électricité de
                       l’Administration »

Cette composante a réalisé des activités devant conduire à la réduction de la facture
énergétique de l’État par la mise en œuvre de trois sous-composantes qui sont :

   x   Le renforcement institutionnel et des capacités en matière de maîtrise de l’énergie ;
   x   La réalisation d’investissements dans la gestion de la demande d’énergie ;
   x   La réalisation de campagnes d’informations, d’éducation et de communication pour la
       promotion de l'utilisation rationnelle de l'électricité dans les bâtiments de
       l’administration.

La sous-composante renforcement institutionnel et des capacités a eu pour objectif : (i) la
conception d’un cadre de politique de gestion de la demande et des mécanismes de
réglementation ; et (ii) le suivi et l’évaluation des programmes de maîtrise de l’énergie. Pour
ce faire, il a été crée au sein du Ministère en charge de l’énergie une Cellule de gestion de
l’énergie (CGE). La CGE a travaillé en étroite collaboration avec les services techniques du
Ministère en charge des finances et les directions techniques clefs de l'administration afin de
définir un programme national de gestion de la facturation de l’administration.

Une base de données a été élaboré à partir des audits énergétiques et des enquêtes de terrain
qui à terme servira à élaborer un code de construction et des normes d’importation des
équipements de bureau et des appareils électroménagers.

La Sous-composante « Investissements dans la gestion de la demande » a financé l'acquisition
et l’installation d’équipements à haut rendement d’appareils de climatisation, d'éclairage et les
films réfléchissants dans les bâtiments de l’administration publique.

La Sous-composante « Information, éducation et communication » a appuyé les campagnes
de sensibilisation, les ateliers de travail, la formation et l’éducation sur la gestion de la
demande et l'efficacité énergétiques.

        1.6.    Amendements apportés aux composantes

Aucun amendement technique n’a été apporté aux composantes initiales du projet. Le
principal amendement a concerné la composante maitrise de l’énergie en son volet indicateur
de résultat. Les économies d’énergie et financières initiales ont été ramenées de 25% à 10% à
la faveur de la revue à mi parcours de juin 2008.

Il y a lieu de souligner que des ajustements et arbitrages ont été faits sur certains lots de la
sous composante construction de la ligne d’interconnexion Bobo-Dioulasso -Ouagadougou.
En effet, des équipements constitutifs de l’ouvrage ont été supprimés à l’allotissement de
l’appel d’offres ce qui aurait pu avoir un impact sur la qualité et la fiabilité de l’infrastructure.

            1.7.   Autres faits marquants

La date de clôture, initialement fixée au 31 juillet 2010 a été prorogée deux fois d’une année
chacune, soit au 31 juillet 2012. Toutes ces deux prorogations ont été suivies de réallocations
budgétaires des catégories de dépenses afin de faire face aux surcouts des contrats de
construction des postes 225 kV et de supervision. Le tableau N°1 ci-dessous résume les
réallocations opérées.

            1.8.   Instrument de prêt

L’instrument retenu pour le PDSE est un prêt d’investissement spécifique (SIL). Le SIL a été
préféré afin de permettre au Gouvernement d’engager les premières étapes de la réforme du
secteur de l’énergie en vue de son développement. Les autres options qui avaient été
envisagées sont :

        x    Un prêt à des programmes évolutifs qui a été écarté parce que la réforme du secteur
             de l’énergie n’était pas suffisamment avancée pour déterminer de manière
             raisonnable la nécessité et l’ampleur d’un programme à plus long terme regroupant
             plusieurs projets ;
        x    Un prêt au développement des connaissances et à l’innovation qui n’a pas été retenu
             en raison des investissements requis pour atteindre les objectifs du projet ;
        x    Un prêt à l’ajustement structurel, qui a été rejeté parce qu’il n’abordait pas les
             problèmes fondamentaux du secteur de l’électricité.

    2.         Facteurs ayant eu un impact sur la mise en œuvre du projet et les résultats

            2.1.   Préparation et conception du projet

Le projet a été initié par le Gouvernement du Burkina Faso pour faire face aux contraintes
sectorielles qui sont notamment l’accroissement de la demande, le déficit de production et
l’utilisation inefficace de l’électricité.



                                                      42
La pré-évaluation du projet est intervenue au cours du second trimestre de 2004. Tous les
critères d’évaluation jugés satisfaisants ont permis l’évaluation en octobre 2004.

Le projet a été mis en vigueur le 28 novembre 2005 et mis en œuvre à travers un plan général
et un plan spécifique de passation de marchés des dix huit premiers mois élaborés à cet effet.

Au plan institutionnel, le projet est sous la tutelle technique du ministère en charge de
l’énergie et sous la tutelle financière du ministère des finances. En outre, le ministère en
charge de l’environnement est partie prenante au projet. Le cadre institutionnel du projet
s’articule autour de quatre (04) types d’intervenants :

      Les structures d’orientation et de suivi (CASEM, Comité de pilotage) ;
      Les structures d’exécution (DGE, SONABEL, UER);
      Les structures de contrôle et de supervision (IGAME, IGF, IDA) ;
      Les partenaires techniques et financiers : IDA, AFD, BEI, DANIDA & Crédits mixtes
       danois, Fonds Nordiques de Développement.

Le projet dispose d’un manuel de procédures administratives, financières et comptables qui a
connu quatre (4) révisions, un manuel d’exécution et de suivi-évaluation et un logiciel intégré
de gestion comptable. Les audits annuels ont été régulièrement réalisés par des auditeurs
externes.

       2.2.    Modalités de mise en œuvre du projet

En référence au document du projet, l’Unité d’exécution de la réforme du secteur de l’énergie
(UER) est chargée de la coordination générale du projet. A ce titre, l’UER, créée par arrêté
N°2007-197/MCE/SG du 30 novembre 2007, a soumis au Gouvernement et aux PTF, les
rapports d’activités trimestriels consolidés sur l’exécution du projet.

Le dispositif institutionnel mis en place a permis aux différentes structures d’exécution de
travailler en synergie pour la réalisation des activités qui les concernent. A cet effet, les
activités du projet ont démarré par l’atelier traditionnel de lancement suivi d’une formation
des acteurs sur les outils et instruments de gestion du projet.




                                              43
Pour ce faire, la DGE a eu en charge la mise en œuvre d’une sous composantes relative au
renforcement des institutions et de la composante gestion de la demande d’électricité de
l’administration. Quant à la SONABEL, elle a supervisé la construction et l’extension des
lignes de transport d’électricité et ainsi que la mise en place des capacités thermiques
additionnelles.

Durant la vie du projet, les organes d’orientation, de contrôle et de supervision ont assumé
leurs rôles. Les sessions du Comité de pilotage se sont tenues régulièrement, les audits des
comptes ont été réalisés à date et les missions de supervision de l’IDA menées suivant les
dispositions de l’Accord de don.

Le dispositif institutionnel peut être jugé satisfaisant malgré quelques contraintes engendrées
au cours de l’exécution et qui du reste ont pu être surmontées à travers les concertations
permanentes instaurées entre les acteurs du projet.

       2.3.    Dispositif de suivi-évaluation, modalités de mise en œuvre et dissémination
               du rapport

   ¾ Dispositif de suivi-évaluation :

Le dispositif de suivi-évaluation est fondé sur le dispositif institutionnel du projet. Sur cette
base, conformément au document du projet, le suivi-évaluation s’est fait à travers les
structures impliquées dans la gouvernance du projet au niveau national et l’IDA.

   ¾ Modalités de mise en œuvre :

La SONABEL et la DGE élaborent des rapports d’activités trimestriels pour chacune des
composantes dont elles ont la charge. Lesdits rapports qui capitalisent, entre autres, les
réalisations du projet, sont soumis à l’UER pour examen et consolidation.

Les rapports trimestriels consolidés du projet, à savoir le rapport de suivi financier (RSF) et le
rapport d’activités, sont transmis à la hiérarchie et aux partenaires techniques et financiers.

Les rapports et les programmes annuels d’activités sont soumis à l’examen et l’approbation
du comité de pilotage qui se réunit statutairement deux fois par an.

Les rapports périodiques sont ventilés à toutes les structures impliquées dans la gestion du
projet. Le cadre de résultats qui présente l’ensemble des indicateurs de performance du projet
est renseigné et joint aux rapports trimestriels et annuels. Les missions d’audit des comptes
sont réalisées annuellement par des auditeurs externes. Les rapports desdits audits sont soumis
à l’avis du comité de pilotage puis de l’IDA et du Ministère en charge des finances.

       2.4.    Gestion environnementale et sociale du projet

Au cours de la préparation du projet, il a été élaboré un cadre de gestion environnementale et
sociale (CGES) et un cadre de politique de réinstallation et de compensation (CPRC) qui ont
fait l’objet d’une publication au plan national et à l’Info shop de la Banque mondiale.

                                               44
Au titre de la sous composante construction de la ligne d’interconnexion Bobo-Dioulasso-
Ouagadougou, une étude d’impact environnemental et social assortie d’un plan de gestion
environnementale et sociale a été réalisée en septembre 2004. Une enquête publique a été
conduite par un consultant indépendant nommé par le Ministre en charge de l’Environnement,
par arrêté n° 2004-031/MECV du 30 novembre 2004. Cette enquête a été conduite de février à
avril 2005, dans les 17 départements concernés par le tracé de la ligne électrique. Un avis
motivé portant sur la faisabilité environnementale du projet a été émis par le Ministère en
charge de l’Environnement, par l’arrêté 2005-008/MECV/CAB en date du 12 avril 2005. Par
la suite, le Conseil des Ministres a pris, en date du 10 octobre 2005, le Décret N°2005-
524/PRES/PM/MCE/MFB/MEDEV/MATD /MECV portant autorisation d’exécution et de
déclaration d’utilité publique du projet d’interconnexion électrique Bobo-Dioulasso –
Ouagadougou.

La mise en œuvre du PGES a débuté par l’inventaire détaillé des biens suivi des opérations de
dédommagement des personnes affectées par le projet. Un comité interministériel pris par
arrêté 2010-029/MCE/MECV/MEF du 22 mars 2010 portant création, attribution,
composition et fonctionnement assure la supervision et le suivi de la mise en œuvre du Plan
de gestion environnementale du projet d’interconnexion électrique Bobo Dioulasso-
Ouagadougou avec l’appui de commissions locales installées dans les quinze communes
traversées par la ligne.

Sur le plan environnemental, des reboisements communaux et des forêts classées ainsi que la
stabilisation des berges ont été retenus. Au niveau des communes, il a été reboisé 165 ha dans
60 localités traversées au cours de la saison hivernale de 2010 et celle 2011 a été consacrée à
la restauration de 9 forêts classées d’une superficie de 145 ha et 45 ha la stabilisatio n de 45 ha
de berges des cours d’eau.

Une campagne de communication a été organisée du 9 au 18 octobre 2010 au profit des
populations traversées par la ligne.

Sur le plan social, le dédommagement a concerné 1255 personnes pour un montant total de
240 617 215 FCFA.

En vue de la pérennisation de ce volet, un audit environnemental et social a été réalisé en avril
2012. Ledit audit a fait les constats suivants :

      Les Travaux ont été réalisées de concert avec les DREDD, les services
       départementaux locaux, les communes concernées avec la participation des
       populations locales dans les actions de trouaison, plantation, entretien ;
      Le taux de reprise au niveau des plantations communales avoisine 75% surtout au
       niveau des plantations individuelles par rapport aux collectives environ 45 a 50% ;
      Les reboisements de récupération de zones dégradées des FC ont été réalisés par les
       services forestiers concernés (reboisement avec des espèces locales utilitaires,
       végétalisation des berges des cours d’eau).Les entretiens des plantations ont consisté a
       des sarclages autour des plants et a la mise en place de pare- feux périmétral et de
       cloisonnement ;
      La non réalisation de l’inventaire des reboisements compensatoires pour connaitre le
       taux de survie après le reboisement de 2011 afin de poursuivre avec des actions de
                                              45

Par arrêté n°2012-094/MEDD/CAB en date du 18 juillet 2012, le Département en charge de
l’environnement a déclaré la conformité environnementale du projet d’interconnexion
électrique 225 kV Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou.

En conclusion, bien que le volet environnemental de la ligne ait connu des difficultés de
démarrage, toutes les activités prévues ont été réalisées de façon satisfaisante. Les
recommandations pertinentes du rapport d’audit et du décret sont en cours de mise en œuvre.

Pour ce qui est de la centrale de 14 MW, le rapport final de l’EIE a été déposé le 22 août 2003.
Par arrêté n°03-022/MECV/CAB, le Ministère de l’Environnement et du Cadre de Vie a émis
un avis motivé sur la faisabilité environnementale du projet d’installation de la centrale. Le
plan de gestion environnementale et sociale a été mis en œuvre à travers la mesure des
effluents et des rejets gazeux de la centrale. Le suivi environnemental effectué
périodiquement par les services techniques de la SONABEL et celui réalisé par le ministère
en charge de l’environnement en novembre 2011 a conclu aux respects des normes en matière
de rejets.

       2.5.    Mesures prises pour assurer la pérennité du projet

Conformément au rapport d’évaluation du projet, la pérennité du projet devrait reposer sur
cinq critères :

   x   Accroître la participation du secteur privé dans le secteur ;
   x   Réduire les subventions accordées à la SONABEL et alléger les finances publiques ;
   x   Opérer des ajustements tarifaires pour recouvrer l’intégralité des charges
       d’exploitation de la SONABEL ;
   x   Promouvoir les interconnexions électriques ;
   x   Accroître l’accès à l’électricité aux populations des zones périurbaines et rurales.

Le premier critère s’inscrivait dans un contexte de privatisation de la SONABEL. Cette option
a été abandonnée, cependant le secteur privé notamment le secteur bancaire intervient dans le
financement du secteur à travers des prêts d’investissements.

Le second critère connait une application avec le plafonnement des subventions accordées par
l’Etat à la SONABEL d’un montant de 15 milliards d’une part et la stabilisation des factures
de l’administration publique d’autre part.

Le troisième critère a connu une mise en œuvre avec deux ajustements tarifaires opérés en
d’octobre 2004 et septembre 2006.

Quant au quatrième critère, à la suite de l’interconnexion électrique Bobo-Ouaga, le projet
Bolgatanga-Ouagadougou est en phase de démarrage. D’autres projets d’interconnexion sont
en cours de préparation, notamment dans le cadre du système d’échanges d’énergie électrique
Ouest africain de la Communauté Economique des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (CEDEAO).


                                              46
Le projet d’interconnexion Han-Sikasso-Bobo Dioulasso, l’interconnexion Niger-Nord Benin-
Burkina Faso.

En ce qui concerne le dernier critère, cinq localités ont été électrifiées dans le cadre du PDSE.
Le Projet d’accès aux services énergétiques (PASE) annoncé comme solution à
l’accroissement de l’accès aux services d’énergie moderne en zones urbaines et périurbaines
est en cours d’exécution.

Il y a lieu de noter les projets majeurs qui participent à l’accroissement de l’accès de
l’électricité dans 150 localités en milieu rural qui seront alimentées par le système
interconnecté du CRCO et profitant ainsi de l'approvisionnement et de la stabilité du réseau
régional Il s’agit :

   ¾ Du Projet de renforcement et d’électrification en milieu rural (PRIELER) financé par
     de la Banque Africaine de développement ;
   ¾ De TEAM9 financé par l’Inde pour l’électrification de 94 localités ;
   ¾ De la facilité énergie de l’Union Européenne qui finance le projet « Electricité dans le
     Sahel »ELSA ;
   ¾ Du programme présidentiel pour l’électrification des Chefs lieux de département.

En plus des critères énumérés ci-dessus, la protection, la durabilité et la maintenance des
ouvrages peuvent être relevés car sont très pertinents au regard de l’état actuel des ouvrages
construits.

Les ouvrages acquis sont de qualité et conçus selon les règles de l’art. Cependant,
l’installation de réactances variables en lieu et place de réactance fixes aurait permis une plus
grande flexibilité dans l’exploitation de l’ouvrage. De même, la formation du personnel
exploitant aux travaux sous tension aurait permis de maintenir la qualité de fourniture de la
ligne.

Quant à la ligne 132 kV Bagré-Tenkodogo-Ouagadougou, la pérennité de l’ouvrage a été
assurée grâce à la mise en place d’un dispositif de sécurisation des haubans.

Concernant la gestion de la demande d’électricité dans les bâtiments administratifs, une veille
s’impose dans la qualité des équipements à acquérir et la poursuite de la sensibilisation des
usagers.

   3.      Résultats et impacts

        3.1.   Pertinence des objectifs, de la conception et de la mise en œuvre

Le projet, à sa conception, s’est inscrit dans les objectifs du Cadre stratégique de réduction de
la pauvreté (CSLP) principalement en son volet amélioration de la compétitivité de
l’économie à travers le développement des infrastructures. La pertinence du projet est
également avérée avec les dispositions de la Stratégie de croissance accélérée et de
développement durable (SCADD) qui est le nouvel référentiel de la politique de
développement économique et social du Burkina Faso. En rappel, les deux premiers axes sont
consacrés entre autres au secteur de l’énergie : le développement des piliers de la croissance
accélérée et la consolidation du capital humain et la promotion de la protection sociale.

Le projet s’inscrit également dans la stratégie d’appui pays de la Banque mondiale. C’est à cet
effet que la Banque mondiale a réitéré son soutien aux efforts du Gouvernement dans la
réduction de la pauvreté et à l’amélioration de la compétitivité de l’économie durant la
préparation et la mise en œuvre du projet.

Au plan de la pertinence au niveau sectoriel, le projet s’inscrit dans une dynamique
d’approvisionnement sûre et sécurisé et à moindre coût du pays face au déficit de production
et aux coûts élevés des combustibles. Le PDSE cadre bien avec la Lettre de politique de
développement du secteur de l’énergie adoptée en décembre 2000 et de la loi n°027-2007/AN
du 20 novembre 2007 portant réglementation générale du sous secteur de l’électricité au
Burkina Faso.

        3.2.   Atteinte des objectifs du projet
               3.2.1.     Renforcement institutionnel et des capacités

L’exécution de cette composante visait à doter la DGE de nouvelles compétences pour jouer
son rôle d’institution gouvernementale chargée de la conception et du suivi de la politique
énergétique de l’État, d’une part, et son rôle de catalyseur pour la privatisation de la société
nationale d’électricité et l’élargissement de l’accès à l’électricité dans les zones rurales et
périurbaines, La DGE a pu bénéficié au cours de la vie du projet de renforcement de capacités
humaines à travers la formation de ses agents et des assistances techniques diverses pour la
conduite d’études spécifiques dont la relecture de la loi portant approvisionnement du Burkina
en énergie électrique, et celles relatives à la privatisation de la SONABEL. Sur le plan
opérationnel, elle a été dotée de matériels de bureau et informatique aussi bien qu’en matériel
roulant.

Le bilan des activités réalisées au titre de cette composante atteste de l’atteinte des objectifs
fixés.




                                               49
              3.2.2.       Ligne d’interconnexion Bobo-Ouaga

Le projet dans sa conception visait comme principaux résultats, la sécurisation, la sûreté de
l’approvisionnement à moindre coût en électricité du CRCO et la réduction des subventions
directes ou indirectes octroyées à la SONABEL. Les résultats atteints sont satisfaisants. En
effet, la mise en service de la ligne permet le transit de la Côte d’Ivoire d’une puissance
maximale de 121MW.

Au plan de l’exploitation de la ligne, l’indisponibilité de celle-ci demeure inférieure à 10% de
2010 à 2012. En effet, le taux de disponibilité est passé de 97,97% en 2010 à 98,80% en 2011.
Ceci peut être une indication sur la qualité de la ligne et la maitrise de l’ouvrage par les
exploitants. Cependant, le taux de la continuité de la fourniture qui était de 97,2% en 2010 est
tombé à 91,3% en 2011 à cause de la crise post-électorale en Côte d'Ivoire.

Il faut noter que la présence de la ligne a donné une stabilité au réseau du CRCO car les
ruptures de fourniture d’énergie qui engendraient des pertes de production pour le secteur
industriel et tertiaire sont désormais résolues. De même, le niveau de subvention qui allait
près de 30 milliards par an a été plafonné à 15 milliards de FCFA.

La centrale de 14 MW a été construite à travers la procédure du financement rétroactif. Les
travaux de construction de la centrale ont connu un très grand retard. Les travaux démarrés en
juillet 2004 étaient prévus être terminés en mai 2005 ce qui a conduit à l’approbation d’un
second contrat pour la supervision. La réception opérationnelle partielle a été prononcée en
mars 2006 et il a été procédé à la levée de toutes les réserves le 31 décembre 2006 suivie de la
mise en exploitation. Il y a lieu de souligner que la centrale, qui devait servir de réserve froide

En ce qui concerne la production d’énergie, il ressort du tableau n°4 ci-dessous que celle-ci a
été en deçà des prévisions. En référence aux indicateurs de performance du projet sur ce volet,
il était attendu une production annuelle de 86 GWh avec un taux de disponibilité globale de
70% de la centrale. Aussi, au regard des données des tableaux 4 et le graphique n°1, il ressort
que les objectifs n’ont pas été atteints car la performance moyenne de la centrale a été de 64%
entre 2006 et 2011 au plan de la quantité d’énergie produite. Cette performance tombe à 59%
s’il est inclus les données au 31 octobre de l’année 2012.

Quant à la disponibilité globale des groupes, elle est en moyenne de 70% au cours de la même
période. Cependant, il y a lieu de souligner la forte variation de ce facteur, allant de 83% à la
2ème année d’exploitation à moins de 30% au cours des 10 premiers mois de 2012. La
situation de l’année 2012, peut s’expliquer par l’arrêt depuis le début de l’année du groupe
n°7 mais aussi par la mise en réserve froide du groupe n°6 compte tenu du bon niveau de
transit d’énergie atteint par la ligne d’interconnexion au 3ème trimestre 2012.

Concernant les factures d’électricité de l’administration, celles-ci qui connaissaient une
croissance de 12% par an, ont été stabilisées à partir de 2010 pour les bâtiments ayant
bénéficié des actions de la MDE. Ainsi, pour l’ensemble des bâtiments audités, le montant
annuel des factures d’électricité est passé de 1,675 milliards de F CFA en 2006 à 2,690
                                                                                       54
milliards de F CFA en 2010. Les premiers résultats des actions de la MDE sont constatés à
partir de 2011 avec une légère baisse du montant des factures d’électricité. La mise en œuvre
des activités ont permis d’estimer les économies financières réalisables à 1,5 milliards de
FCFA et celles des économies d’énergie à environ 211 507 kWh au 31 décembre 2011. Les

       3.1.              Justification de l’évaluation d’ensemble du projet

Le projet dans son ensemble est jugé pertinent dans la mesure où sa non réalisation aurait créé
davantage de difficultés en matière d’approvisionnement du Centre régional de consommation
de Ouagadougou. En effet, la ligne d’interconnexion a permis d’éviter d’avoir recours à des
investissements coûteux en thermique pour une capacité équivalente avec pour conséquence
des coûts de production élevés dans un contexte de renchérissement du prix des
hydrocarbures. La preuve est la location d’une capacité de 61 MW opérée au cours de l’année
2011 qui a coûté 6,5 milliards par semestre auquel il faut ajouter les frais des combustibles et
de la maintenance. Bien que la première année de l’exploitation de la ligne n’ait pas permis un
transit optimal, les années suivantes ont confirmé la pertinence du projet.

L’objectif de développement du projet est jugé satisfaisant. En effet, il répond aux
préoccupations identifiées par le Burkina Faso dans la contribution de l’amélioration de la
compétitivité de l’économie nationale d’une part et s’inscrit dans la stratégie d’appui pays de
la Banque mondiale dans sa quête de croissance d’autre part.

La conception du projet dans son ensemble est jugée pertinente. Malgré une insuffisance du
cadre logique initial, notamment l’absence d’indicateurs clés caractérisant le sous -secteur de
l’électricité, les résultats atteints traduisent une bonne conception du projet.

L’ensemble des objectifs fixés par le projet ont été pleinement atteints et l’efficacité globale
du projet est jugée satisfaisante au regard de la réalisation des résultats et de l’impact attendu.

En effet, les coûts de réalisation du principal ouvrage malgré l’inflation sont proches des
coûts de 2001 pour la liaison Ferké-Bobo-Dioulasso soit environ 60 millions FCFA/km. De
même, le coût du MW de la centrale de 14MW est de l’ordre de 750 millions FCFA tous frais

                                                                55

travaux).

       3.2.    Autres résultats et impacts

(a) Impact sur la pauvreté, le genre et le développement social

L’enquête réalisée dans le cadre de l’évaluation finale du projet a révélé une amélioration des
conditions de vie des populations des cinq communes rurales électrifiées. En effet,
l’électricité a permis le développement d’activités génératrices de revenus et la création
d’entreprises contribuant ainsi à la réduction de la pauvreté.

(b) Changement/renforcement institutionnel

Le projet a contribué partiellement à la réforme institutionnelle du secteur à travers la
relecture des textes portant approvisionnement du pays en énergie électrique. La structuration
du sous secteur de l’électricité a été également opérée avec la répartition en deux segments :
le périmètre de la SONABEL et celui du FDE. Cette disposition, le mécanisme financier et
les mesures d’accompagnement ont permis un accroissement notable de l’accès des
populations rurales aux services d’électricité.

(c) Résultats et impacts inattendus ou exceptionnels (positifs ou négatifs)

La crise ivoirienne a constitué un impact exceptionnel négatif ayant affecté le projet. De
même, la flambée du cours du pétrole a contribué à renchérir le coût du principale ouvrage du
projet avec l’actualisation du coût des contrats.

     5.      Evaluation de la performance de la Banque mondiale

          5.1.   Performances de la Banque mondiale à la conception du projet

La Banque mondiale au cours de la préparation du projet a identifié la problématique des
besoins du Burkina Faso en matière d’énergie. Les composantes du projet ont été bien
définies pour un renforcement du sous secteur de l’électricité. Les activités programmées ont
permis d’atteindre l’objectif de développement du projet. La performance de la Banque est
jugée satisfaisante.

          5.2.   Qualité de la supervision de la Banque mondiale

Les missions de supervision ont été régulièrement réalisées conformément aux dispositions de
l’accord de Don, soit une moyenne par semestre. Les aides mémoires produits font ressortir
des recommandations qui ont permis d’améliorer la gestion du projet en vue d’une atteinte des
objectifs assignés au projet.

          5.3.   Appréciation globale de la performance de la Banque mondiale

L’appréciation globale de la Banque mondiale est jugée satisfaisante au cours de la vie du
projet. Les équipes de la Banque mondiale sont restées à l’écoute des acteurs du projet dans la
résolution des contraintes de réalisation et a assuré une bonne coordination de l’ensemble des
PTF. Elle a appuyé les acteurs dans le renforcement de leurs capacités en gestion financière et
décaissements, passation de marchés, suivi-évaluation et gestion environnementale et sociale.
Cependant, il a été relevé de longs délais dans le traitement des dossiers de passation des
marchés. Le retard dans la mise en service de la ligne est imputable à cette situation. En effet,
les autres volets ont été achevés certains au moins six mois auparavant.

6.       Evaluation de la performance du bénéficiaire
           6.1.   Performances du Gouvernement du Burkina Faso

La performance du Gouvernement est jugée satisfaisante. Au démarrage du projet, les
conditions suspensives ont été toutes levées grâce à la volonté du Gouvernement pour
l’aboutissement du projet.

Au cours des différentes phases de la vie du projet, il a montré toute sa détermination à la
réalisation du projet. Le Gouvernement a multiplié les contacts avec les différents PTF à
travers quatre réunions de concertation avec les bailleurs de fonds du secteur de l’énergie et
plusieurs réunions bilatérales.

La contre partie de l’Etat dédiée au volet environnement et à l’électrification des localités
traversée a été entièrement libérée. Enfin, tous les Département ministériels impliqués ont
activement joué leur rôle dans la conduite du projet.

          6.2.   Performances des structures d’exécution

     x    Performances de la DGE

La performance de la DGE à travers les actions de la CGE est jugée satisfaisante mais
certaines études prévues pour le renforcement de ladite structure n’ont pas été conduites. Il
                                               59
s’agit, entre autres, de la mise en place d’un système de suivi-évaluation et évaluation
d’impact, l’identification exhaustive du gisement MDE dans les secteurs secondaire, tertiaire
et résidentiel ; la normalisation de la qualité thermique du bâtiment, l’organisation de
l’approche MDE en liaison avec le MDP. Les autres dossiers exécutés par ses soins ont été
accomplis cependant, la lenteur enregistrée dans le processus de passation de marchés a
quelque peu affecté sa performance globale.

     x    Performances de la SONABEL

La performance de la SONABEL est jugée satisfaisante. L’ensemble des activités a été réalisé
avec le concours très appréciable de la Cellule de Projet Bobo-Ouaga. Cependant, les
dépassements budgétaires et le long délai de validation et d’approbation des dossiers de
passation de marchés ont également affecté ses performances.

     x    Performances de l’UER

La performance de l’UER est jugée satisfaisante. La coordination de l’ensemble des activités,
la gestion financière, la passation des marchés, le suivi-évaluation sont appréciables. Les
rapports trimestriels d’activités, les rapports de suivi financier, les rapports d’audits des
comptes et les comptes rendus des sessions du comité de pilotage sont livrés à date. Les
recommandations des différentes missions de contrôle sont traitées avec diligence. Cependant,
le constat général de la lenteur des procédures de passation de marchés a affecté ses
performances globales.

          6.3.   Appréciation globale des performances du bénéficiaire

L’appréciation globale de l’emprunteur est jugée satisfaisante. Cependant, il est à souligner
que la non possibilité de superposition des procédures nationales avec celles de l’IDA en
matière de passation de marchés a affecté la performance du client.

7.       Principaux enseignements

Les leçons apprises découlent des contraintes rencontrées au cours de la vie du projet. Les
dépassements budgétaires enregistrés dans les différents appels d’offres recommandent la
réalisation avec plus de précision les études de faisabilité. En outre, les questions
environnementales et sociales peuvent entrainer des retards dans l’exécution. Aussi, ces
études devraient-elles démarrer pendant la préparation des projets/Programmes.

Les projets étant conçus pour un délai d’exécution déterminé, les longs délais d’approbation
des dossiers méritent une attention particulière. Une harmonisation des procédures nationales
et de la Banque s’impose s’avère nécessaire.

Le renforcement du capital humain que la Banque a considéré comme catalyseur dans la
conduite du projet mérite d’être salué et s’inscrit comme une bonne expérience pour les
projets futurs. En effet, la qualité des dossiers s’est considérablement améliorée vers la fin du
projet. Enfin les acquis du projet montrent que des duplications sont à envisager en matière :
(i) de montage institutionnel ; (ii) d’harmonisation des procédures des partenaires techniques
et financiers ; (iii) de valorisation des compétences formées.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


NDF comments:

1.      The original plan was that NDF would finance a) three 90/33/15 substations
including transformers (Kossodo, Ouagadougou 1 and Ouagadougou 2), b) a 33/15
substation (Ouagadougou 2000) and c) some additional equipment (mobile crane and
vehicles).

2.      Since the most favorable offer exceeded the credit amount by 64%, it was agreed
to reduce the scope to be financed by NDF and that SONABEL would cover those costs
outside the scope of NDF’s budget. NDF thus ended up financing substations,
transformers and other equipment relating to Kossodo (90-33-15), Ouagadougou 1 (90-
15), Ouagadougou 2 (90-15) and Patte d’Oie (33-15). One contract was signed on
27.6.2007 and implemented with a total final value of EUR 10,218,531.

AFD – summary of the evaluation report:

3.      The project responded to the expectations of the stakeholders – GoBF,
SONABEL and its customers, donors. The 225 kV line was completed by a qualified
team, based on high quality equipment to ensure the sustainability of the project. The
technical restrictions imposed by limited allocated resources (particularly for the transit
of the energy transported by the 225 kV line to customers through the 90 kV distribution
circle, which does not currently have a back up transformer) should be addressed in order
to ensure a good functionality of the project. The volume of imported energy was about
60 percent of the expected energy transited from Côte d’Ivoire for 2011. The GoBF and
SONABEL negotiated a volume higher than 450 GWh for 2012. The economic
substitution benefits of the transmission line were significant, reaching FCFA 5.62 billion
in 2011. The progressive increase of the energy volume imported from Côte d’Ivoire
allowed a reduction of the GoBF fuel subsidy, which was capped to FCFA 15 billion per
year over the period 2012-2015. Moreover, the project brings stability to the national
network. Therefore, it would allow the development of renewable energy with
intermittent characteristics (such as solar energy) and the provision of lower cost
electricity to rural areas. Lessons learned/recommendations include (i) proper estimation
of resources at project preparation to avoid implementation delays; (ii) strengthening of
the fiduciary capacity of the client; (iii) better communication on safeguards policies and
procedures; (iv) long term regional integration strategy including technology options that
would allow a good administration of the imported energy.

AFD - EVALUATION RETROSPECTIVE DU PROJET D’INTERCONNEXION
ELECTRIQUE BOBO DIOULASSO-OUAGA

Conclusions

Conformité du projet par rapport au cadre logique. Comme premier point à aborder
au niveau des conclusions, il est opportun de vérifier que le projet tel que conçu dans le
début des années 2000, paramétré en termes de résultats dans un cadre logique revisité
par le consultant, a effectivement répondu positivement aux attentes des parties prenantes
qui étaient d'un côté le gouvernement Burkinabé, sa compagnie d'électricité la
SONABEL et ses abonnés et d'autre part la communauté des bailleur de fonds qui ont
contribué à la réalisation du projet.

Un ouvrage conforme à la règle de l'art, toutefois sans redondance. L'évaluation a
permis de conclure que l'interconnexion électrique 225 kV Bobo Dioulasso –
Ouagadougou qui a été mise en service le 31 décembre 2009 a été construite suivant la
règle de l'art. Suivant les avis recueillis, la phase de construction a été conduite par une
équipe de professionnels que ce soit au niveau de l'ingénieur conseil ou les différentes
entreprises et avec un matériel de qualité qui présage d'une bonne durabilité et une grande
fiabilité de l'exploitation de l'ouvrage. Toutefois, il faut quand même noter que les
restrictions imposées par l'enveloppe budgétaire sur l'acquisition d'équipements de
secours ou de pièces de rechange sont de nature à amoindrir la fiabilité de l'exploitation,
la rendant vulnérable et dépendante desde délais de livraison de pièces de rechange. Ces
aspects sont particulièrement vrais pour le transfert de l'énergie de Côte d'Ivoire du
niveau 225 kV au niveau des consommateurs ( 15 et 33 kV) par l'intermédiaire de la
boucle de distribution 90 kV qui aujourd'hui n'a pas de transformateur de réserve comme
cela avait été prévu mais annulé par défaut de financement, ni pièces de rechange.
D'ailleurs, un des transformateurs 90/15 kV de la centrale Kossodo est défaillant et est
présentement sous investigation technique. De même, il est fortement recommandé que
l'ensemble des disjoncteurs automatiques des postes 225 et 90 kV soient réhabilités de
façon à rétablir toutes les fonctionnalités de ces équipements, entre autres l'utilisation des
réactances qui sont momentanément hors service.

Une capacité de transfert en deçà des attentes de 2012 à 2013/14. La ligne d'une
capacité de transfert de 121 MW avait été conçue pour permettre un transit planifié en
2005 de près de 795 GWh. En fait la capacité actuelle d'exploitation de la ligne est de 90
MW avec des pointes pouvant atteindre 106 MW, cette capacité étant limitée aujourd'hui
par celle de la compensation réactive offerte par les batteries de condensateurs. En termes
d'énergie, la ligne n'a pas fourni ce qu'il était attendu d'elle puisque les importations de
Côte d'Ivoire se sont limitées à 339,5 GWh en 2010 et 449,5 GWh en 2011, soit
respectivement 47 % et 60 % de ce que la ligne aurait pu fournir pour un transit moyen de
90 MW. L'État burkinabé et la SONABEL négocie un volume de transfert pour 2012 qui
devrait être supérieur à 450 GWh, ce qui reste bien en deçà de la capacité d’exploitation
de transit qui pour une puissance de 90 MW donne un minimum de 720 MWh.

                                             62
Un projet restant toutefois très économique avec un temps de retour sur
l'investissement inférieur 5,9 ans pour la SONABEL et de 4 ans en termes
économiques. Par rapport à une alternative 100% hydrocarbures pour le CRCO,
l'exploitation de la ligne a permis des économies substantielles. Bien que déficitaire en
2010 en raison du faible transit, ce gain s’élève pour la SONABEL à 5,62 milliards de
FCFA en 2011. Toutefois, il est à noter que ces bénéfices sont surévalués par le fait que
la SONABEL a utilisé prioritairement le DDO (plus de 60%) sur le fioul lourd,
présentant un différentiel de prix de 6,4 et 7,4 FCFA/kWh par rapport à un mix
économique de carburants pour lequel le FO est prépondérant (plus de 60%). Dès 2012 et
pour une importation de 500 GWh le bénéficie sera de 9,95 milliards de FCFA pour
atteindre un plafond de 20 milliards de FCFA/an pour une pleine exploitation de la ligne
et un coût de hydrocarbures calé sur mai 2012 (60% de FO dans le mix)

Par contre, compte tenu des difficultés d'approvisionnement liées à la crise ivoirienne,
l’état a loué 60 MW dans la période avril 2011 à juin 2012 des groupes d’urgence pour
un montant de 12 milliard FCFA qui vont réduire les gains sur les économies de
subventions sur les hydrocarbures. Ces dernières étaient toutefois de 3,84 milliards de
FCFA en 2010 et de 9,77 milliards de FCFA réduite de 7,4 milliards de FCFA par la
location des groupes.

Actuellement, la SONABEL utilise dans ces simulations une capacité maximale de
transfert correspondant à 640 GWh alors que la ligne pourrait facilement donner en base
de 720 à 750 GWh si la Côte d'Ivoire pouvait livrer toute l'énergie que le Burkina
pourrait consommer sous sa courbe de charge avec 90 MW de transfert. Sur une base
d'un accroissement constant des importations à partir de 2014 où la situation devrait
revenir á la normale en raison d'investissement important en Turbines à Gaz (TAG) et
Cycle Combiné (CC), le temps de retour sur investissements de la ligne est estimé à 5,9
ans. En termes économiques, c'est à dire en incluant également le gain de l'état en
réduction de subvention payée sur les carburants de la SONABEL (essentiellement
CRCO), ceux de la SONABEL ainsi que les locations de groupes d’urgence de 2011-12,


                                                                         63
le projet est bénéficiaire dès 2010 avec 3,83 milliards de FCFA d’excédent et le temps de
retour sur investissement est de 4 ans.

Stabilisation des subventions sur les hydrocarbures de la SONABEL à un niveau de
15 milliards de FCFA. Il était prévu que la mise en service de la ligne permettrait de
supprimer les subventions sur les hydrocarbures puisque le prix de revient de l'énergie de
ligne serait plus ou moins équivalent à celui de la production diesel subventionnée pour
un baril de pétrole à 30 $. La demande en énergie a fortement augmenté et la production
résiduelle thermique évoluera dans les années à venir autour de 450 GWh, ce qui
correspondait à la production totale et importée des années 2001-2002. L'augmentation
progressive des livraisons d'énergie ivoirienne au CRCO permettra de stabiliser les
besoins en subventions sur les carburants de la SONABEL à un niveau de 15 milliards de
FCFA de 2012 à 2015. La nouvelle interconnexion en provenance du Ghana sera celle
qui pourra de nouveau faire infléchir la place de la demande thermique dans le panier de
production du Burkina Faso et réduire le montant des subventions.

Qualité et stabilité de l'approvisionnement renforcée. Même si en termes
économiques l'interconnexion ne fournit pas encore pleinement les quantités d'électricité
attendues, elle apporte une stabilité et une qualité de l'approvisionnement en termes de
tenue de la fréquence et de tension. Ce niveau de satisfaction a été exprimé par le
secrétaire général du groupement professionnel des industriels pour la profession dans
son ensemble et a été confirmé par un industriel dont le groupe est le treizième plus gros
consommateur de la SONABEL. En fait, les spécialistes avaient nourri quelques
inquiétudes quant aux possibilités de stabiliser la tension sur une ligne en antenne dont
les sources de production étaient très éloignées (plus de 1500 km) du centre de
consommation. L'exploitation de la ligne a montré que ces préoccupations n'étaient pas
fondées et que le transit est stable et fiable.

La performance actuelle de la ligne n'est pas due à des causes endogènes, qui pourraient
être des difficultés d'appropriation de la technique ou des défaillances de l'équipement,
mais elle est essentiellement due à des causes exogènes liées aux difficultés rencontrées
en Côte d'Ivoire. Toutefois, l'absence de pièces de rechange pour certains éléments vitaux
comme la répartition de l'énergie sur la boucle 90 kV et aux postes 225 kV pourrait être
un élément limiteur de l'utilisation de la ligne dans l'avenir. Le retour à un
approvisionnement non bridé est prévu à partir de 2013 et surtout 2014, date à laquelle
les nouvelles puissances thermiques des centrales de CIPREL et d'AZITO (763 MW)
seront mises en service, complété par celles d'un nouveau producteur indépendant Abbata
(450 MW). La capacité hydroélectrique de 270 MW du barrage de Soubrè pourrait-elle
devenir opérationnelle à partir de 2017.

Projet s'inscrivant dans la durée et ouvrant de nouvelles perspectives pour
l'électrification rurale et les énergies renouvelables. Sur la base des arguments avancés
ci-devant, la pertinence de cette interconnexion électrique identifiée lors les études de
faisabilité de 2002, et des études d'impact financier de 2004 est largement confirmée,
même si le contexte de sa mise en exploitation n'a pas été optimal. Ce projet s'inscrit dans
une perspective d'intégration régionale, permettant de mutualiser par un réseau

                                            64
d'interconnexion haute tension les potentiels de production de l'espace CEDEAO pour la
création d'un marché unique de l'électricité. Le Burkina Faso ne disposant pas de
ressources fossiles a été dépendant de la production thermique qui au fil de l'évolution du
prix du baril s'est montrée financièrement insoutenable.

En termes de coûts, les attentes burkinabè n'ont pas été pleinement exaucé car le coût de
cession de 34,6 FCFA/kWh sur lequel les 2 parties s'étaient entendues dans les années
2005 et revu aujourd'hui à la hausse avec comme base de négociation une fourchette
comprise entre 40 et 47 FCFA/kWh, le prix de cession à Ferkessedougou. Toutefois, le
coût de revient de l'énergie de ligne arrivée à Ouagadougou qui était de 66,6 FCFA/kWh
en 2010 devraient se stabiliser a un niveau de 55 à 57 FCFA/kWh dans les années à venir
en fonction du prix de cession a Ferkessedougou, ce qui est nettement plus avantageux
que la poursuite de la production thermique optimisée à 81,6 FCFA/kWh pour un prix du
baril fluctuant autour de 100 à 110 US$. Le schéma directeur révisé du WAPP considère
dans ses projections la possibilité d'approvisionner le Burkina Faso avec une énergie de
qualité à un coût de 59 à 75 c€/kWh soit 38,7/49,1 FCFA/kWh après 2017, ce qui
évidemment suppose la réalisation de grandes infrastructures de transport, de production
thermique et hydroélectrique dans l'ensemble de la région.

Le fait que le centre national des mouvements de l'énergie soit aujourd'hui au top de la
technologie et en communication directe avec Bobo Dioulasso et Abidjan est un élément
très positif de l'intégration rapide du système Burkinabè dans le réseau régional. De plus,
cette intégration qui apporte déjà un élément de stabilité de la fréquence et de la tension
est également propice à l'installation de production électrique de caractère plus
intermittent comme les centrales solaires photovoltaïques pour lesquelles des projets
d'une puissance totale de 40 MW sont actuellement en gestation.

La mise à disponibilité d'une quantité d'énergie à moindre coût comparé à la production
thermique a rendu possible une réflexion sur l'accès aux services énergétiques pour les
milieux ruraux. Le livre blanc national de l'accès aux services énergétiques a permis de
mobiliser des fonds qui permettent l'électrification de plus de 150 localités dans le cadre
de différents projets (Projet PRIELER de la SONABEL (AfD), PASE (BM), Facilité
Energie (EU), et le projet Team9 (Inde)).

De plus, il a introduit une nouvelle technologie qui est celle de l'alimentation en
monophasé ou triphasé au profit des localités situées sous la ligne de transport par
l'intermédiaire de la mise sous tension des câbles de garde. Même si l'on doit constater
que la mise en œuvre de cette technologie a été un peu frileuse puisque deux localités
seulement bénéficient d'un raccordement sur câble de garde, elle a permis de convaincre
la SONABEL et le FDE de sa pertinence et actuellement 4 nouvelle localités seront
alimentés par cette technologie, qui pourra également être mise en œuvre sur la ligne
Bolgatanga-Ouagadougou.

De meilleurs outils de gestion financière et de suivi tarifaire pour la SONABEL. Le
fait que le projet d'infrastructures se soit déroulé sur fond de réforme du secteur de
l'énergie avec à la clé une volonté de privatiser la SONABEL n'a pas eu de répercussions

                                            65
négatives sur sa mise en œuvre. Après une période de discussions de 2000 à 2001 dont la
productivité reste à ce jour très relatif, les projets de réforme du secteur et de la
réalisation de l'infrastructure électrique sont dissociés à partir de 2003. Le projet de
réforme sera conduit jusqu'en 2007 avec l'approbation de la révision de la loi portant sur
l'approvisionnement du Burkina Faso en énergie électrique qui confirmait les options de
privatisation définie par le gouvernement en mars 2004, pour être finalement abandonné
en 2011 par le retrait de la SONABEL des listes des sociétés d'État à privatiser. Par
contre, le projet de réforme a permis d'introduire des outils de gestion et l'utilisation d'un
tableau de bord commun à la SONABEL, au ministère en charge de l'énergie au ministère
en charge de l'économie et des finances et bailleur de fonds. Sur la base de ce tableau de
bord, il est possible d'anticiper le besoin d'augmentations tarifaires, ce qui n'existait pas
de par le passé. D'une certaine façon, ce tableau de bord répond à un des résultats
demandés par les bailleurs de fonds est inscrit au cadre logique, et 2 augmentations
tarifaires en 2004 et 2006 valident pleinement son utilisation. Actuellement, une nouvelle
augmentation est envisagée, mais elle est présentement différée en raison du climat social
de vie chère.

Une procédure environnementale bien conduite mais sanctionnée par un audit
environnemental sévère, mettant en exergue le rôle de la communication.
L'évaluation de la procédure environnementale de suivi du projet demandée par les
bailleurs de fonds dès 2002 est positive. Elle s'est articulée autour de l'élaboration d'un
plan de gestion environnementale et sociale dont le but était d'identifier tous les impacts
environnementaux et sociaux liés à l'ouverture d'un couloir de plus de 340 km ayant une
emprise de 30 à 60 m de large, de celui de la boucle 90 kV et l'implantation de 7 postes
de transformation dont 2 postes 225 kV, 4 postes 90 kV et un poste 33 kV.

Ces implications sont de nature différente, les expropriations de propriétés touchées par
le couloir,       où les emprises du projet qui demandent une politique claire de
dédommagement, les reboisements compensatoires pour réhabiliter et compenser le
couvert végétal détruit par le projet et l'atténuation de certaines nuisances sonores ou
visuelles de l'infrastructure par rapport aux populations locales et aux paysages.

Le projet a suivi la procédure conforme à la loi avec la demande d'un avis motivé du
ministère en charge de l'environnement déclenchant une procédure d'enquête d'utilité
publique qui a permis au gouvernement de décréter l'utilité publique du projet en 2006.
Une activité d'inventaire détaillé des propriétés, bois et bosquets ainsi que les arbres dans
les champs a été suivie par le paiement des dédommagements dont la plupart ont été
réalisés en 2007 et par la réalisation des reboisements compensatoires réalisés en 2010
pour les forêts communales et en 2011 pour les propriétés domaniales.

Aux dires de certains acteurs rencontrés tous (témoignages de l'entrepreneur, du maire de
la commune de Sabou, du directeur des études environnementales du ministère en charge
de l'environnement qui intervient en 2009 et de celui du bureau de communication
NEGOCE9), ces activités de dédommagements et de reboisement compensatoire se sont
déroulées d'une façon très satisfaisante sans générer de contentieux notoire. Il est certain
que la procédure telle que demandée par les bailleurs de fonds n'a pas été tout à fait

                                             66
respectée pour ce qui est le 'Cadre politique de déplacement et de compensations' dans un
souci d'efficacité pour permettre une ouverture rapide du couloir mais également par
manque d'information sur la procédure. Cela a conduit à la mise en place, en 2099 très
tardivement, d'une structure de suivi du PGES alors que l'infrastructure était en passe
d'être achevée. Une information plus professionnelle a été dispensée à ce moment. Les
évaluateurs sont étonnés de la déperdition de ces informations 2 ans plus tard lors de la
conduite de l'audit environnemental et de la résurgence d'un certain nombre de
contentieux liés au dédommagement de propriété ou d'arbres ou aux reboisements
compensatoires. Bien que reconnaissant l'engagement du maître d'ouvrage à œuvrer pour
minimiser les impacts environnementaux, l'audit d'impact environnemental n'en conclut
pas moins aux besoins d’actions correctives évaluées à la somme de cent soixante-deux
millions sept cent soixante-onze mille (162.77.1000) FCFA, (dédommagements et
reboisements complémentaires, nouvelle campagne d'information envers les populations)
soit près de 15 % des sommes déjà payées. Il est opportun de bien vérifier que les
contentieux débusqués par l'audit ne soient pas le fait d'un certain nombre de spéculateurs
qui délibérément s'installent dans le couloir touché par les mesures environnementales
dès la mise en œuvre du projet et qui ont été déboutés lors de la première vague de
compensations.

Un effort de communication tout au long du projet mais l'absence d'une
communication professionnelle itérative. Le service de la communication de la
SONABEL a encadré les efforts de communication tout au long du projet par un contact
récurrent avec les autorités locales et la production de matériel audiovisuel de qualité qui
d'ailleurs ont été validées et utilisés par les professionnels de la communication
embauchés en fin de projet. Cette communication a été présente tout au long du projet
mais a été dispensé par des consultants l'intégrant dans leurs approches pour la résolution
des tâches qui leur étaient confiées (communications en relation avec l'élaboration du
PGES, de l'enquête d'utilité publique, de l'inventaire détaillé et des campagnes de
dédommagement). Ce n'est qu'en fin de parcours qu'un professionnel de la
communication est intervenu pendant une période ciblée de 6 semaines dont 3 en
couverture médiatique multimédia. L'audit environnemental conclut toutefois à un déficit
d'information, ce qui pourrait laisser supposer que la qualité de l'information n'a pas
toujours été à la hauteur des attentes et que la présence d'une communication
professionnelle itérative serait souhaitable dans les projets à venir.

Besoins de formations un leitmotiv récurrent du personnel d'exploitation ou un
véritable besoin? La formation du personnel d'exploitation est un élément central de
pérennité des équipements et de leur bonne exploitation. La mission a rencontré au
niveau de l'exploitation de la ligne 225 kV, des postes 225 kV et 90 kV des doléances de
formation complémentaire qui n'ont pas pu être réalisée dans le sillage du projet
d'infrastructures. Il s'agit de formation du personnel de maintenance de ligne pour
pouvoir travailler sur une ligne sous tension permettant de minimiser les coupures pour
maintenance. Il s'agit également de formation pointue en maintenance des mécanismes et
des automatismes liés aux appareils de coupures permettant outre le fait de faire le
diagnostic du défaut ( ce pourquoi le personnel a déjà reçu une formation) de pouvoir les
réparer de façon sécuritaire pour le système. Enfin, il s'agit de formation relative au

                                            67
matériel installé dans les postes qui en raison de l'évolution technologique demandent des
compléments de formation pour des exploitants aguerris aux anciennes technologies.

Les évaluateurs trouvent pertinents les besoins de formation relative au travail sur ligne
sous tension et à la possibilité d'intervention sur les disjoncteurs. Par contre, en fonction
de l'évolution de l'automatisation intégrale de certains postes de tension intermédiaire, les
évaluateurs recommandent que ces formations soient dispensées à un personnel
d'intervention sur ces équipements et non pas sur le personnel de surveillance (1
personne) de l'équipement en question.

Un projet complexe financé par 5 bailleurs de fonds, l'État et la SONABEL et
administré par 2 structures. Le montage du secteur était relativement complexe avec 5
bailleurs de fonds (BM, AfD, BEI, NDF, NORDEA-Crédits mixtes) et l'État burkinabé
réparti sur 8 lots différents n'étant pas moins de 7 entreprises différentes à contribution
pour sa réalisation.

La réalisation de la boucle 90 kV financée sur fonds danois a été conduite comme un
projet traditionnel sous la responsabilité d'un ingénieur-conseil financé par le bailleur de
fond et n'a eu que peu d'interaction avec le reste du projet. D'ailleurs les infrastructures
étaient réalisées dès 2007 alors que le reste du projet entrait dans sa phase de réalisation.

En termes d'organisation on doit conclure qu'il y ait eu une dichotomie entre l'unité
d'exécution de la réforme, unité d'implantation de projet de la Banque mondiale d'une
part et l'unité de suivi du projet de la SONABEL mise en œuvre par le maître d'ouvrage.
Même si l'idée de concentrer toutes les compétences qu'elles soient techniques,
procédurales, relatives à la passation des marchés, ou fiduciaires au sein de l'UER, ce
point de vue n'a pas été partagé par le maître d'ouvrage qui détenait le savoir technique et
certaines compétences juridiques et en passation de marchés. Toutefois le PDSE a
contribué fortement aux capacités en passation de la SONABEL, de l’UER venant en
appui à la SONABEL et au Ministère et celle du Ministère. L'UER a essentiellement joué
un rôle de contrôle fiduciaire des financements mis en œuvre alors que l'unité de projet
SONABEL s'est concentrée sur toutes les étapes de la mise en œuvre du projet allant du
suivi de la préparation des dossiers d'appel d'offres à travers toutes les phases des
négociations conduisant jusqu'à la mise en vigueur des contrats d'entreprise et l'émission
de certificats de réception des ouvrages. On doit reconnaître qu’indépendamment des
tensions qui ont pu se manifester entre l'UER et la SONABEL, ce modèle bicéphale a
fonctionné assez correctement, tout au moins en termes de contrôle rigoureux des
dépenses.

Un point de conclusion sur les retards et les dépassements. L'un des enjeux du projet
était également lié à sa réalisation rapide afin de se libérer de la dépendance des
hydrocarbures dont le prix était en constante évolution à la hausse. De la décision finale
sur les allotissements en juin 2004 à la mise en vigueur du dernier contrat en juin 2008
une période de 4 ans s'est écoulé au cours de laquelle les principaux thèmes de discussion
ont été liés au contenu des dossiers d'appel d'offres, la conformité de ce contenu par
rapport au projet initial, les réajustements du contenu du projet avec un certain nombre

                                             68
d'élagages, les coûts, les surcoûts, les dépassements des budgets initialement prévus pour
le projet et les rallonges envisageables pour boucler le projet. C'est au cours de cette
période que le projet perd plus en efficience car il diffère des économies que l'État aurait
pu faire sur la subvention des hydrocarbures et annule l'avantage financier pour la
SONABEL lié aux périodes de grâce de certains prêts, la mise en service de la ligne
correspondant aux remboursements. Deux points de vue contradictoires s'opposent sur les
causes de cette perte d'efficience, celui de la SONABEL qui incrimine les consultants des
bailleurs pour avoir procédé à des élagages et des sous-estimations d'items de projets et
celui de la banque mondiale et certainement de NDF, pour qui l'évaluation contradictoire
des dossiers d'appel d'offres visait à faire revenir le projet dans son concept initial de
robustesse sans redondance. Sur la base des informations remises, les évaluateurs n'ont
pas pu trancher entre les 2 parties. Toutefois, il faut remarquer que la période pendant
laquelle les offres ont été préparées correspondait à une période de surchauffe de
l'économie mondiale avec une évolution rapide du prix des métaux comme l'aluminium et
le cuivre et des produits pétroliers. Le processus a été marqué par un nombre
considérable de non objection demandée et obtenue auprès des bailleurs de fonds sur
chaque modification du projet, ce qui est aussi de nature à en ralentir son instruction.
Quoi qu'il en soit, après révision des quantités et du niveau d'ambition, l'enveloppe
financière ne suffisait pas à couvrir l'ensemble des équipements nécessaires à l'attention
d'un projet opérationnel. À ce niveau, on doit reconnaître que la procédure de passation
des marchés de SONABEL a offert une flexibilité dans la possibilité de négocier à la
baisse des contrats avec les entrepreneurs retenus et de passer des contrats
complémentaires sur fonds propres pour boucler le projet.

Leçons et/ou recommandations

Nécessité de définir précisément les besoins et les attentes de la partie nationale et
des PTFs quant à l'envergure technique du projet et les possibilités offertes par
l'enveloppe financière.

Une des causes de retard dans la mise en œuvre du projet doit être recherchée au niveau
de sa conception technique et des moyens financiers qui étaient mis à la disposition de la
réalisation des ouvrages. L'évaluation a montré qu'il y a eu divergences de points de vue
sur la conception physique du projet d’infrastructure entre les PTFs (principalement la
BM et le NDF) et la partie nationale et que ces divergences sont la cause de retards au
niveau de la préparation des dossiers d'appel d'offres et de la passation des marchés. Il ne
faut pas pour autant exclure non plus un certain nombre de phénomènes exogènes au
projet comme l'augmentation des prix des métaux et des combustibles, mais également
une surchauffe des marchés mondiaux de la fourniture électrique comme en témoigne les
difficultés et les délais d'approvisionnement de certains lots. La question qui semble s'être
posée dans la phase de conception, et de préparation des dossiers d'appel d'offres était de
savoir jusqu'à quel niveau de redondance des équipements on pouvait aller dans le cadre
du budget qui était alloué. Les avis sont partagés entre des PTFs estimant que le maître
d'ouvrage avaient ajouté des items non initialement prévus (qu'ils soient redondants ou
oubliés), et un maître d'ouvrage ressentant les activités d'ajustement du contenu à
l'enveloppe financière comme une réduction des fonctionnalités de l'ouvrage. Ce projet

                                             69
était le premier du genre pour le maître d'ouvrage pour ce qui était du volume de
financement mobilisé et de la complexité du montage financier. La référence technique
est souvent celle d’EDF, qui n'est pas nécessairement la plus économique ou la moins
redondante

Le consultant recommande que les discussions de compatibilité de la conception
technique avec l'enveloppe financière disponible soient abordées lors du bouclage
financier pour éviter toute discussion stérile sur ce qui fait ou ne fait pas partie du concept
initial et sur les solutions financières envisageables dans le cas de dépassement de prix.

Renforcement de capacités de la partie nationale en suivi de dossiers et de passation
de marchés, en suivi de contrats et suivi fiduciaire de l'ensemble du projet.

Il y a une certaine tendance à minimiser les besoins de capacités des institutions
nationales lors de la mise en œuvre de projets de cette taille mobilisant des acteurs
internationaux qui eux ont une très grande expertise de la lecture et la gestion de contrats
d'entreprises et qui sont entourées de juristes internationaux. Cette remarque est d'autant
plus importante que d'une part le régime de passation des marchés doit nécessairement
suivre celle des marchés de l'État, et que d'autre part le rôle de spécialiste joué par l'Unité
d'exécution de la Réforme ne sera plus disponible pour les prochains projets, puisque le
ministère en charge de l'énergie ne souhaite pas maintenir cette structure de gestion pour
le troisième projet de la Banque mondiale, voulant internaliser ses fonctions au sein du
ministère.

La procédure des marchés publics ne donne pas les mêmes marges de liberté que les
procédures suivies par la commission d'attribution des marchés de la SONABEL suivant
l'ancien régime, qui ont permis dans des situations tendues en termes de calendrier de
pouvoir négocier à la baisse directement les contrats d'entreprise financés par les PTFs et
de pouvoir passer des contrats parallèles complémentaires pour les équipements
nécessaires ne pouvant pas être maintenu dans le contrat principal12. Il sera donc pertinent
pour l’avenir d’avoir des spécialistes des marchés qui puissent faire preuve d’une grande
anticipation sur les procédures nationales et en assurer un suivi pugnace.

Même si l'action de l'UER n'a pas été toujours appréciée au sein du projet, il faut
reconnaître que cette dernière a exercé pour les bailleurs de fonds à un contrôle financier
rigoureux de l'ensemble des activités. Cette fonction n'étant éventuellement plus
reconduite pour les prochains grands projets d'investissement, entre autres celui de
l'interconnexion Bolgatanga-Ouagadougou, il sera nécessaire de créer ou de renforcer ce
type de fonction au sein du ministère en charge de l'énergie.

   Ici le consultant met en exergue une constatation faite par tous, voir le PCA de l’ONEA. Ce n’est pas pour autant qu’il demande à ce
que l’on déroge à la règle communautaire de l’UEMOA. Le coordinateur de l’UER ne partage pas cette appréciation et indique da ns
ses commentaires que la SONABEL ne doit pas déroger à la règle.



                                                                 70
Il en est de même pour le suivi des contrats d'entreprise qui demande une grande rigueur
et une grande expertise afin de limiter le nombre de réclamations posées sur des bases
contractuelles par des entrepreneurs avertis permettant ainsi de justifier les demandes
d'avenant aux contrats. Cette expertise doit d'ailleurs être disponible dès la préparation
des dossiers d'appel d'offres afin de pouvoir décrire précisément le type de travail ou
d'équipements souhaités tout en connaissant les conséquences financières d'une telle
demande.

Communication et information

De façon générale, un effort de communication a été déployé tout au cours de ce projet,
effort encadré par le service de la communication de la SONABEL, et relayée par
différent consultant ayant des tâches particulières nécessitant une bonne information et
compréhension des populations riveraines touchées par le projet. C'est essentiellement
dans le cadre de l'ouverture de couloir de la ligne demandant à la fois de faire jouer la
règle de l'expropriation, mais également celle des compensations pour les propriétés
expropriées et celle des reboisements compensatoires pour assurer sur le plan de
l'écologie et l'environnement une reconstruction du couvert végétal détruit au cours du
projet d'infrastructures. Toutefois, l'audit environnemental met en exergue le fait que
toute information et communication doit être un processus itératif tout au long de la mise
en œuvre d'un tel projet, au risque d'être oublié si elle n'est pas dispensée par des
professionnels de la communication. Pour cela, il est recommandé de concevoir dès le
départ un programme de communication plus consistant conduit par un bureau
professionnel qui pourrait se dérouler en 3 phases, une phase d'information initiale au
début du projet qui devrait se dérouler en parallèle avec l'étude d'impact environnemental
et la préparation d'un PGES, une phase se déroulant préalablement au paiement des
indemnisations et à la mise en œuvre des reboisements compensatoires afin d'informer les
populations touchées sur leurs droits et leurs devoirs ainsi que les droits et les devoirs de
l'entrepreneur et du maître d'ouvrage qui sont à l'origine de ces indemnisations, et une 3e
phase dès la mise en service de la ligne pour tous les aspects sécuritaires et
comportementaux des populations locales au regard de l'infrastructure mais également
envers la protection et le suivi des reboisements de façon que ces derniers puissent
effectivement remplir leur fonction compensatoire. Il est certain qu'une telle entreprise de
communication demandera un budget plus conséquent que celui qui a été accordé dans le
cadre de ce projet.

Durabilité/ vision long terme

Indépendamment de la première recommandation faite dans ce chapitre, le consultant
souhaite mettre en avant le fait que les équipements de téléconduite qui eux aussi ont
conduit à des dépassements budgétaires importants répondent à des normes de l'état de
l'art en la matière permettant d'inscrire directement le nouveau réseau interconnecté
Burkinabè sur la carte du WAPP. La place du Burkina Faso dans le cadre du marché
régional est celui d'un pays essentiellement importateur d'énergie à partir des ressources
hydroélectriques et thermiques des pays côtiers. Il est donc pertinent d'introduire une
technologie de pointe qui de plus est déjà bien maîtrisé par les opérateurs Burkinabè qui

mais qui permettra l'intégration de nouvelles sources d'importation, comme celles en
provenance de Bolgatanga dès 2016.
