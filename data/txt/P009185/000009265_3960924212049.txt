PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
TENTH AND ELSVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECTS
(LOANS 1578-YU AND 1819--YU)
Preface
The following is a Project Completion Report for the Tenth and
Eleventh Highway Projects in Yugoslavia. Together, the two projects covered
all eight republics and provinces which make up the Yugoslav Federation. In
addition, the two projects were implemented over the same period between
1980/81 and 1985, a time of increasing economic difficulties and severe
reductions in funding for the highway sector. These factors provided an
opportunity to prepare a combined Project Completion Report giving
comprehensive nationwide csierage of developments in the hignway sector and
a retrospective analysis of the main issues ir the sector during the past
five years.
The Tenth Highway Project focussed primarily on the
lesser-developed areas of the country and included five borrowers - Kosovo,
Montenegro, Macedonia, Vojvodina and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The project was
conceived as a sector loan with the primary aims of strengthening investment
planning in the highway sector and of providing greater flexibility in
project implementation. The project included a wide range of works, but
focussed mainly on road rehabilitation and the upgrading of primary roads in
several areas in order to complete the basic road network. A loan (Loan
No. 1678-YU) of US$148 million was made for the project on March 27, 1979.
The Eleventh Highway Project helped maintain the impetus
established by the previous Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Highway Projects on
improvements to key sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH). The
project was the second to focus entirely on Yugoslavia's main road artery
serving both domestic and international long distance traffic. The project
was prepared immediately after the Tenth Highway Project and covered the
remaining republics and provinces, namely Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, as
well as Vojvodina which was also included in the Tenth Project. A loan
(Loan No. 1819-YU) of US$125 million was made fcr the project on
March 25, 1980.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the EMENA
Transport Division with the assistance of the Borrowers. In particular, the
PCR draws upon the comprehensive statistical data provided in a report
prepared by the Federal Association of Republican and Provincial Road
Organizations (FARP) in Belgrade. The report is entitled:
Savez Samoupravnih Interesnih Zajednica Za Puteve Jugoslavije (FARP),
Yugoslavia; Project Completion Report Loan 1678-YU - Tenth Highway Project,
Loan 1819-YU - Eleventh Highway Project, Institut Saobracajnog Fakulteta,
Beograd, January 1986.

In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

TENTH AND ELEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECTS
(LOANS 1678-YU AND 1819-YU)
Highlights
The Tenth and Eleventh iligtway Projects were implemented during a
period which was marked by a considerable slow-down in the Yugoslav ezonomy,
partly due to external factors and partly due to high inflation. A
combination of rapid inflation, depreciation of the Dinar exchange ra:e, and
a lag in adjusting road user charges (an earmarked tax on fuel), all lhad a
major impact on the highway investment and maintenance programs. Becatuse of
shortages of funds, both projects were l.acluled under the Bank's Special
Action Program (SAP) in mid-1983. Following a detailed review of highway
sector expenditures and funding as part of the SAP processing, both projects
were rescheduled for completion by about two years beyond the originally
expected completion dates. Actual implementation from 1983 onwards was
reasonably close to this revised schedule. Previously, all highway projects
in Yugoslavia had been completed on schedule.
The two projects together covered the entire country (eight Road
Organizations) and financed a wide range of improvements to the primary and
secondary road network, ranging from the upgrading of gravel roads to the
improvement of Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) sections to four-lane limited
access standards. Although the two projects had somewhat different
objectives, this approach was successful in that both projects were
implemented during the same time frame and were supervised together.
Moreover, given the different objectives of the two projects, the inclusion
of all eight republics and provinces in one project would probably have
proved unmanageable and would have led to delays in preparation.
Both projects had an important institution-building impact,
particularly the Tenth Highway Project, which introduced a sector-lending
aprroach to highways in Yugoslavia and focussed attention on such matters as
investment planning and road user,taxation policies. This approach was
later extended to all eight Road Organizations, initially during processing
of the projects for SAP and subsequently during preparation of the current
Highway Sector Project (FY86).
The following points of interest in connection with the projects
are highlighted below:
- The road investment programs included under the Tenth Highway
Project were developed from Highway Master Plan studies prepared
by the five borrowers (para. 2.03).



- xi -
- The selection of TYH sections under the Eleventh Highway Project
was based on a TYH Master Plan Study completed in 1978 duiing
preparation of the Ninth Highway Project which also focussed
entirely on TYH (para. 2.04).
- The Eleventh Highway Project attracted US$107.7 million in
commercial bank co-financing provided through the Swiss Banking
Corporation, but disbursement of the funds was not tied to
progress iin project implementation (paras. 2.05 and 4.27).
- Total expenditures on roads in Yugoslavia declined from an
annual average of US$900 million during the 1976-80 Plan to less
than US$500 million in 1984 and 1985 with debt servicing
accounting for over 30% of the total compared to less than 20%
during 1976-80 (paras. 3.06 to 3.09).
- Both projects were subject to major revisions during
implementation because of the shortage of funds and they were
some of the first projects to be included under the Bank's
Special Action Program (SAP) in mid-1983 (paras. 3.11, 4.15 and
4.28).
- The loan closing dates were extended twice for each project,
both projects closing on June 30, 1985. Extension of the loan
closing date a second time for the Tenth Project was mainly to
allow completion of the training program (paras. 3.12, 4.04 and
4.19).
- In US Dollar terms, project costs were close to the appraisal
estimates, while Dinar costs increased by over 100l in all cases
because of higher than expected local inflation. This reflects
the gradual depreciation of the dinar against the dollar during
project implementation, thus offsetting the effects of high
inflation. However, in some cases, particularly in Macedonia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, individual sub-projects had to be scaled
down to remain within the cost estimates, either by deleting
sections or reducing the scope of works (paras. 4.14 and 4.26).
- There were wide variations among the road organizations in
coping with the shortage of funds:
In Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, project components were
appropriately redesigned to lower standards while in
Macedonia, most of the program as completed is over-designed
for current and planned traffic volumes. Macedonia's program
was probably over-designed even at appraisal. Nevertheless,
an opportunity was missed during project implementation to
scale down the scope of works (paras. 4.09 and 5.04).



- xii -
Several republics, particularly Montenegro and
Bosnia-Herzegovina, avoided major difficulties in
implementing the Bank-financed program mainly by eliminating
many of the lower-priority non-Bank financed road sections
from the investment programs as soon as the shortage of funds
began to be felt (paras. 4.07 and 4.10).
- Equipment procurement was delayed under both projects primarily
because of delays in obtaining approval for foreign exchange
expenditures. In addition, the absence of an agreement at
negotiations on a breakdown of equipment funds among the four
borrowers under the Eleventh Highway Project lead to major
delays and only 60% of the equipment was procured under that
project (paras. 4.11 and 4.24).
- Difficulties with foreign exchange approvals also hampered the
training program under the Tenth Project. A detailed training
pro-ram involving local seminars and overseas study tours was
drawn up during SAP discussions, and this was largely
implemented during 1985 (para. 4.12).
- The Eleventh Highway Project included a highway safety program
comprising equipment and training. The main achievement under
this program was the successful organization of a Road Safety
Conference in Belgrade in October 1981 with the joint
participation of the Institute of Traffic Engineers (para. 4.25).
- The Eleventh Highway Project included an innovative study of
tolls on TYH which is now being used as a guideline in
establishing toll facilities and toll levels on the TYR route
(para. 4.25).
- Both projects show acceptable revised ERs, but there are
considerable variations among the individual road programs.
Traffic on most road sections has increased at only 1 to 2% per
year and actual opening year traffic levels are only about 60%
of the appraisal forecasts. However, vehicle operating cost
savings increased steeply and offset the effects of reduced
traffic and increases in construction costs (para. 5.03 and
5.04).
- Despite major problems during implementation, Bank field
supervision effort was relatively modest but adequate (45.3
man-weeks and 33.2 man-weeks). Supervision of both projects was
always carried out together and was usually combined with other
ongoing projects and the preparation of the current Highway
Sector Project.

TENTH AND ELEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECTS
(LOANS 1678-YU AND 1819-YU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Because of its location, Yugoslavia is an important crossroads,
with its transport system traditionally providing access to the sea for a
number of central European countries as well as connections for
international traffic between Western Europe, Greece and the Middle East.
The main northwest-southeast corridor following the Sava/Danube Plain,
shared by the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) and the main trunk railway route,
serves the maior centers of population and economic activity in the
country. The transport network is extensive and diversified and comprises
about 130,000 km of roads, including 48,000 km of primary and main regional
roads, 9,400 km of rail lines, 7 main ports, 15 airports and a sizeable
network of inland waterways. The transport system is administered by
independent transport authorities in each of the eight republics and
provinces which make up the Yugoslav Federation (Map).
1.02     The Yugoslav authorities have long recognized the importance of the
transport sector in the growth of the economy and its role in achieving
balanced regional development. During the past decade, emphasis has been
given primarily to alleviating major bottlenecks in the primary road
network, including many sections of TYH, where inter-city traffic volumes
range from 12,000 to 25,000 vehicles per day. Attention has also been paid
to completing the primary road network in the less-developed regions and to
establishing routine rehabilitation programs throughout the country. Both
the Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were designed to support these
objectives and together provided coverage for the whole of the country.
1.03     Previous projects had often incorporated fairly broad objectives in
that they included upgrading key links in the primary road network while at
the same time promoting regional development by improving selected roads in
the lesser-developed areas. However, by the end of the 1970s, congestion
had become so acute on parts of TYH that improvement of this route had
become the primary objective of the Ninth Highway project. It was natural
therefore that the Tenth Highway Project, which wa,s appraised one year later
in October 1978, should focus almost entirely on t:he lesser-developed
regions while the subsequent Eleventh Highway Project again provided
continuity in the improvement of TYH. The current Highway Sector Project
(FY 86), which is expected to be effective through 1990, provides
comprehensive coverage of road investment and maintenance programs in four
republics and includes upgrading of TYH sections, completion of key road



-2-
sections in the lesser-devieloped regions as well as emphasis on routine
rehabilitation programs.
1.04     As implementation of the Tenth and Eleventh Projects began in
1980/81 Yugoslavia experienced a considerable slow-down in the economy,
partly due to external factors and partiy due to high inflation. A
combination of rapid inflation, depreciation of the Dinar exchange rate, and
a lag in adjusting road user charges, a specific tax on fuel which provides
the major share of highway financing, all had a major impact on the highway
investment and maintenance programs. Because of the shortage of funds,
which became particularly acute in mid 1982, both projects were included
under the Bank's Special Action Program in early 1983. At that time, based
on a nationwide review of highway sector expenditures and funding, both
projects were rescheduled for completion by about two years beyond the
originally expected completion dates. Previously, all highway projects in
Yugoslavia had been completed substantially according to schedule.
Moreover, during the latter part of the implementation period, expenditures
on the two projects constituted the only investments on roads in Yugoslavia
apart from routine maintenance operations.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT
A. General
2.01     Bank-assisted highway projects in Yugoslavia have done much to
institutionalize the basic administrative functions of planning, project
preparation and implementation. At the same time, the Bank has for many
years encouraged and support the establishment or strengthening of important
central planning and coordinating institutions for the sector. As a result
of their long association with Bank-financed highway projects, the
Republican Road Organizations (ROs) have developed adequate capabilities for
the preparation and implementation of projects according to acceptable
criteria and procedures. For this reason, an overall investment planning
approach was introduced under the Tenth Highway Project in order to
strengthen planning procedures and to introduce a more flexible approach to
the selection of c'tb-projects according to changing needs and resource
availability. Although financing specific sections of TYH, implementation
of the subsequent Eleventh Highway Project has served to extend the broader
investment planning concept to all areas of the country. In this way, Bank
projects provided a total overview of developments in the highway sector
since the late 1970s and established a sound basis for preparation of the
current Highway Sector Project (para. 3.15).
2.02     With the advances that were made in transport-related institutions
in Yugoslavia during the 1970s, the Bank and Government agreed that further
lending in the highway sector should be based on more comprehensive views
including highway master plans for each region's total highway needs. The
lenth Highway Project was therefore conceived as a sector-lending operation
in which lending was related to mutually agreed highway development programs
for each concerned republic or province taking into account the ability to
finance and administer the respective programs. The thrust of future



- 3 -
transport sector lending was to consolidate progress in institutional
development, particularly in investment planning and in strengthening
financial discipline.
B. Tenth Highway Project
2.03     The Tenth Highway Project, which was identified in March 1978
provided for direct participation in a three-year tranche (mid-1979 -
mid-1982) of the road investment programs of the five lesser-developed
republics/provinces (Kosovo, Montenegro, Vojvodina, Macedonia and Bosnia
Herzegovina). These programs, which were developed from Highway Master Plan
Studies prepared by each Borrower, covered the construction of new roads,
the reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing roads, the procurement of
specialized equipment for planning purposes and a training program to assist
the ROs in improving the administration of the road network. At appraisal,
each Borrower identified an outline investment program including a financing
plan. Individual sub-projects were prepared according to an agreed
methodology and were submitted to the Bank for approval during project
implementation. The project also provided for monitoring of implementation,
progress reporting and updating of the investment programs. The project
financed the improvement and rehabilitation of some 700 km of primary and
regional roads in the five participating republics. This included a section
of TYH between Popinci and the Serbian Border (13 km) and part of the
North-South Trans-European Motorway between Novi Sad and Feketic (40 km),
both located in Vojvodina (Map). The total cost of the five investment
programs, including sections not financed by the Bank, was estimated at
appraisal at US$795 million. The Bank-financed part of the program was
estimated at US$487 million. The Bank provided a loan of US$148 million of
which US$45.3 million covered the foreign exchange cost of civil works while
the remaining US$2.7 million was for equipment and training.
C. Eleventh Highway Project
2.04     The Eleventh Highway Project was identified in September 1978 and
responded to a specific need to continue with the upgrading of high priority
sections of TYH. The sections included in the project totalled 160 km and
were identified from a TYh Master Plan Study prepared in 1977/78. As
finally constituted, the project covered four participating
republics/provinces (Slovenia, Croatia, Vojvodina and Serbia) and included
the following TYH sections (Map):
(i)  in the Republic of Slovenia, a new four-lane controlled access
highway on a new alignment from Naklo to Ljubljana (28.8 kmi);
(ii)  in the Republic of Croatia, two additional traffic lanes and the
reconstruction of the existing two lanes to provide a four-lane
controlled access highway from Lipovljani to Okucani (35.9 km);
(iii)  in the Province of Vojvodina, two additional traffic lanes and
the reconstruction of the existing two lanes to provide a
four-lane controlled access highway from Ruma to Popinci
(17.3 km); and



- 4 -
(iv) in the Republic of Serbia, two additional traffic lanes and the
reconstruction of the two existing two lanes to provide a
four-lane controlled access highway from Vojvodina Border to
Belgrade Airport (9.6 km), from Deligrad to Nis (37.1 km) and
from Batocina to Cuprija (35.1 km).
2.05     The project also included the procurement of equipment for
maintenance of TYH, traffic and load monitoring equipment and a highway
safety program comprising elements of training, technical assistance and
equipment. The total project cost was estimated at US$785 million. The
Bank provided a loan of US$125 million, of which US$123 million covered
about 55% of the foreign exchange cost of civil works. US$2 million were
provided for technical assistance and training. The project also attracted
US$107.7 million of commercial bank cofinancing, which was provided through
a Swiss consortium, and was intended to cover the remaining 45% of the
foreign cost of civil works.
III. BACKGROUND TO IMPLEMENTATION
A. Road Network
3.01     Yugoslavia's road network comprises some 130,000 km of roads of
which about 49,000 km are primary and regional roads (Table 1). During the
period from 1970 to 1980, the length of the paved network doubled and now
accounts for about 50% of the total network. Modernization of the network
continues to be a major priority for the republics and provinces. In the
more developed areas of the country, the primary focus is on eliminating the
major bottlenecks, particularly on TYH, while in the less-developed areas
the main focus is on upgrading and modernization of the basic primary
network. Maintenance has been generally satisfactory, but has suffered
recently because of budgetary constraints (para. 3.03). As much of the
paved network is still relatively recent, routine rehabilitation programs
have not been a major part of the road investment programs. However,
increasing attention is now being paid to establishing rehabilitation
schemes in order to strengthen and preserve the existing infrastructure.
3.02    The TYH system provides the backbone to Yugoslavia's highway
network and is a vital link between Western Europe, the Balkans and the
Middle East. Although some 500 km of the 1,170 km of TYH have been improved
over the past decade or are currently under construction, it is estimated
that a further 360 km could be justified for upgrading to four-lane
standards during the coming decade. Of these sections, about 100 km will be
improved during the period 1987-89 with financial assistance provided by the
European Investment Bank and the World Bank. The sections covered by this
program include a start on the critical TYH sections in Slovenia between
Ljubljana and Zagreb, the continuation of improvements eastwards in Croatia
towards Vojvodina and Serbia, and the completion of the last major link in
Serbia on the route between Belgrade and Nis. Beyond this program, a
further 260 km of critical TYH sections in Slovenia, Croatia and Vojvodina
would remain for improvement in the medium-term with implementation
continuing beyond 1990.

B. Economic Developments
3.03     Since 1980, Yugoslavia has experienced a considerable slowdown in
the economy, partly due to external factors such as increases in oil prices
in 1979 and a slump in the world economy, and partly due to domestic shocks
such as high inflation which has increased from about 40% in 1981 to over
80% in 1985. During the period from 1981 to 1985, it is estimated that the
economy has grown at less than 1% annually compared with a rate of 5 to 6%
per year throughout the 1970s. The combination of high inflation and a
rapidly increasing debt service burden through depreciation of the Dinar
exchange rate, severely curtailed the availability of funds in all key
sectors of the economy. Although investment levels have fallen on average
in real terms by about 302 since 1980, the reductions have been much greater
in the highway sector. In line with the lower growth of the economy, total
traffic has increased at an average rate of only 1 to 22 per year since 1980
with most of the growth being for rail traffic. Road traffic has stagnated
mainly because of shortages of fuel during 1983 followed by a period of fuel
rationing during 1984. This restriction was lifted in January 1985 and
traffic is now picking up again.
C. Sector Financing
3.04     Road expenditures are financed at the Republican and Provincial
levels from earmarked sources which include taxes on fuel, vehicle
registr. -ion fees and road tolls, as well as from budgetary contributions
made available by community work organizations and through bank credits.
The less-developed areas also receive small amounts from the Federal Fund
for Less-Developed Regions (LDR). Since the beginning of the current
1981-85 Plan, the ability of the road organizations to fund a reasonable
level of investments has declined (para. 3.06). This situation has resulted
from the fact that the highway authorities depend heavily on revenue from
earmarked contributions, mainly a specific road user charge which represents
about one-third of the tax on fuel. In recent years, the road user charge
has not been increased in line with the price of fuel nor with the other
taxes on fuel. Revenue from the road user charge has therefore failed to
keep pace with inflation at a time when the authorities have had to devote a
larger part of available funds to cover the higher debt service burden from
foreign credits following depreciation of the Dinar.
3.05     Revenue from the road user charge now represents about 50% of the
total funding for the highway sector. Additional funds from foreign and
local credits provide about 152, contributions from communities about 15%,
and the remainder from vehicle registration fees, highway tolls and taxes on
foreign vehicles. In order to ease the tight financial situation
experienced by the road organizations in 1981 and 1982, the Federal
Government introduced a major increase in the road user charge on fuel in
July 1982. However, subsequent increases did not keep pace with inflation
and the charge levied on diesel fuel lagged behind that on gasoline.
Moreover, despite the earmarked nature of the additional revenue, the
Republican Governments allocated much of the increase to other sectors of
the economy. In this way, the level and structure of road user taxation
became an important focus of the preparation of SAL I in early 1983. Based
on the updated findings of a Bank-financed Road User Charge Study, it was
found that when considered as a whole, taxes on fuel and vehicle



- 6 -
registration fees are set at realistic levels and total revenue is adequate
to cover road maintenance and a substantial part of new investments. These
fees and taxes are in fact set at levels comparable to those in most Western
European countries. The study also confirmed that no change is required in
the structure of road user taxation. In order, therefore, to ensure
adequate revenue for a minimum program of expenditures on road
infrastructure, agreement was reached with the Federal Government under
SAL I for the periodic indexing of the road user charge for inflation as
well as the specific earmarking of the charge for road expenditures alone.
These adjustments would be made at the time of tLe regular fuel price
increases which are necessary to offset the effects of the depreciation of
the Dinar against the US Dollar, fuel prices generally being comparable to
West European levels. As of the end of 1984, all of the republics had
reverted to the earmarking of a substantial part of the road user charge for
road infrastructure. This is considered to be a significant step in
maintaining a sound road investment and maintenance program. In addition,
the road user charge was adjusted in May 1984 by 3 Dinars on both gasoline
and diesel fuel providing about a 50% increase in revenue which was adequate
for the 1984 programs. Although there was an increase in the road user
charges in August 1985, this was not adequate to offset the effects of
inflation. Further adjustments were made in January 1986 and May 1986 in
order to maintain a minimum program of investments and maintenance, these
adjustments being Board Presentation and Loan Effectiveness conditions for
the current Highway Sector Project (para. 3.10).
D. Investment and Maintenance Programs
Overall Developments
3.06     During the 1976-80 Plan, total annual expenditures on roads
averaged US$900 million with a maximum level of about US$1.1 billion being
reached in 1919. Since then, total expenditures have declined steadily in
real terms while the share of debt servicing has increased from only 15% of
total expenditures in 1976 to over 30% at present. Total expenditures on
roads have averaged about US$640 million annually during the period
1981-85.
3.07     Tables 2 and 3 show actual expenditures on the road network for the
periods 1976-80 and 1981-85 respectively for each of the eight republics and
provinces. This information is summarized below for Yugoslavia as a whole.

3.08     While total expenditures on the highway network have decreased by
about 30 during 1981-85 compared with 1976-80, the main reductions have
been felt in new investments which fell to only 40% their previous level.
The amount of debt servicing has almost doubled and accounted on awerage for
about 36% of total expenditures during 1981-85 compared with less than 20b
during 1976-80. During 1981-85, very little rehabilitation was undertaken
while maintenance expenditure at the end of the period had fallen to about
US$2,000 per kilometer compared to US$2,800 per kilometer during 1976-80.
While the maintenance of the primary road network is generally adequate, the
condition of the secondary network has deteriorated as a result of the
budget reduction. Maintenance issues are being addressed under follow-up
projects.
3.09     The following table summarizes annual expenditures on roads during
the period from 1981 to 1985 as well as sources of financing (Table 4).

3.10     Total expenditures on roads declined frow close to US$1 billion in
1981 to less than US$500 million in 1984 and 1985. During the period there
was a general decline in al- sources of funds for highway expenditures.  The
major decline has been felt in revenue from road user charges partly because
these charges have not been adjusted for inflation and partly because of the
rationing and physical shortages in the supply of fuel during 1983 and
1984. However, other road user taxes such as vehicle registration fees,
tolls and taxes on foreign vehicles have shown increase since 1983. In
addition, fuel rationing was lifted in January 1985 and recent adjustments
have been made in road user charges as part of the conditionality of the
current Highway Sector Project (para. 3.05). Implementation of this project
will ensure a minimum program of high priority investments and maintenance
in roads through 1989.
Impact on Bank Pro ects
3.11     The increasing shortage of funds for investments in roads during
1981-85 had a marked impact on im:)lementation of both the Tenth and Eleventh
Highway Projects. Delays in implementation began to be felt during 1982 as
rapid inflation and depreciation of the Dinar exchange rate started to have
an impact in the expenditures of the road organizations. The situation
deteriorated even further during 1983 as inflation exceeded 502 and the
Dinar exchange rate continued to depreciate at an even faster rate, thereby
placing a considerable debt service burden on the road organizations. Due
to the external liquidability and balance of payment problems, the Yugoslav
Government introduced a wide-ranging stabilization program. Although World
Bank projects were subsequently granted priority status and most other lower
priority items were excluded from the investment programs, all Bank
subprojects suffered from shortages of funds and con:.equent delays in
implementation. The problem appeared to be particularly acute in Vojvodina,
Macedonia and Croatia, mainly because of the ambitious scope of the
investment programs in these republics/provinces. In several cases, the
scope of Bank-financed components was changed in order to reduce costs
(Chapter IV, paras. 4.09-4.10 and 4.20). The shortage of funds was further
compounded by the increasingly smaller US Dollar amounts being disbursed on
the indirect foreign exchange costs due to the fact that the depreciaoion of
the Dinar exchange rate was at a much faster rate than local inflation. The
share of indirect foreign exchange costs in total costs was therefore
increasing.
3.12    As a result of this situation, revised investment and financing
plans were prepared for all eight road organizations during the early part
of 1983. These plans showed expected expenditures and financing for much
reduced road programs through the end of 1985. However, because of the
minimum levels of investment and maintenance and uncertainties over the
effects of inflation on local funds, the two projects were included under
the Bank's Special Action Program effective April 1, 1983. On the basis of
estimated costs-to-complete, the disbursement percentages were adjusted for
each individual borrower in order to cover the anticipated increases in the
foreign component, as well as part of local costs, thereby easing financial
constraints and releasing valuable funds for routine maintenance and
rehabilitation programs which would otherwise have to be deferred (paras.
4.14, 4.15 and 4.28).



-9-
3.13     Based on the revised implementation schedules established in early
1983, the loan closing dates were subsequently postponed for both projects
by 15 months for the Tenth Project from June 30, 1983, to
September 30, 1984, and initially by one year from June 30, 1983, to
June 30, 1984, for the Eleventh Project. However, the revised
implementation schedule for the Eleventh Project showed that a further
extension would be necessary and a second routine extension of the loan
closing date for this project was made in July 1984, extending the date to
June 30, 1985. Although the civil works component of the Tenth Project was
implemented generally in line with qhe revised schedules established in
early 1983, the loan closing date for t=ts project was then later extended
to June 30, 1985, to allow for completion of the training program and
procurement of equipment. Further details of project implementation are
given in Chapter IV.
E. Institutional Developments
3.14     Since the mid-1960s, there has been a gradual transfer of authority
to the republican/provincial transport agencies, thereby increasing the
number of decision-making bodies and making transport planning and
coordination more difficult. In supporting tranisport infrastructure
development, the Bank has emphasized the need for improving coordination
between sub-sectors at regional and national levels as well as the need for
developing adequate institutions and an appropriate policy framework. At
the national level, the Bank has encouraged and supported the establishment
or strengthening of important planning and coordinating institutions.
Notable among these is the Council of Republican and Provincial Roads
Organizations (CRO), which was established in the early 1970s to cover the
nationwide standardization of engineering and design criteria in the highway
sub-sector as well as other matters such as highway safety. However,
because of the increasing concern during the early 1980s with meeting the
needs for reasonable maintenance and rehabilitation of the network, the ROs
decided to establish a new coordinating body in 1983, known as the Federal
Association of Republican and Provincial Road Organizations (FARP), with
even broader responsibilities for overall planning and monitoring of
developments related to road infrastructure and road transport.
3.15     In addition to this development, the increasing shortage of funds
from 1982 onwards brought a need for better financial discipline and a
complete reassessment of the investment and maintenance programs. The SAP
discussions during the early part of 1983 enabled Bank supervision missions
to introduce an investment planning approach to all road organizations, a
concept which was introduced initially to the five borrowers under the Tenth
Highway Project. The experience gained from revising the investment and
maintenance programs proved to be particularly useful in the subsequent
preparation of the Highway Sector Project.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
TENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
A. General
4.01     The Loan became effective on August 14, 1979, after a postponement
from the projected date of July 9, 1979. In each Republic/Province, a
Highway Master Plan covering the period 1980-85 was prepared by local
institutes assisted in some cases by foreign experts. The methodologies and
approaches used in the economic analyses were applied uniformly by each road
organization. Based on the recommendations in the Highway Master Plan
Studies, feasibility studies and detailed engineering began for road
construction/improvement works to be carried out or initiated in the
concerned Republics/Provinces during the mid-1979 to mid-1982 slice of the
investment plan. Although all the sub-projects which the Bank would finance
had not been identified and fully prepared at appraisal, the subsequent
selection and preparation of road sections for inclusion in the project were
undertaken according to agreed procedures and criteria. Feasibility studies
and detailed engineering and bidding documents were adequately prepared by
competent local engineering organizations to standards satisfactory to the
Bank.
4.02     As in previous projects, the CRO in Ljubljana acted as fiscal agent
for the project, coordinator of disbursement requests to the Bank and acted
as liaison agent between the Republics/Provinces and the Bank on all
project-related matte-s. The CRO was also responsible for procurement of
equipment and coordination of training arrangements which were taken over in
1983 by the newly established Federal Association of Republican and
Provincial Road Organizations (FARP). Supervision of the construction and
improvement works was undertaken by the respective Road Organizations
assisted, as in the past, by Yugoslav consulting engineers and technical
institutes which had prepared the feasibility studies and the detailed
engineering.
B. Civil Works
4.03     Separate prequalification of contractors by each Republic/Province
followed the Bank's guidelines for International Competitive Bidding and
took place during the months March to June, 1979. Details of
prequalification are summarized below:

Totals are not provided since some contractors applied for prequalification in
two or more Republics/Provinces.



- Li -
Over the years, few foreign contractors have shown any interest in
prequalifying and bidding for civil works in Yugoslavia. The basic reason
is believed to be the competitive edge of the local contractors on their own
ground.
4.04     The construction program began rapidly in all five
Republics/Provinces on the first tranche of contracts a.d by October 1980,
40 contracts out of a total of 50 with Bank financing and 23 contracts out
of a total of 34 with local financing were awarded. however, a shortage in
local resources (para 1.04 and 3.10) for both Bank financed items as well as
for items to be entirely locally funded, caused a slow down in implementa-
tion. However, there was considerable variation in progress among the five
borrowers as explained below. As a result of the delays, the Loan Closing
Date was postponed twice, first to September 30, 1984 and finally to
T!une 30, 1985.
4.05     The mid-1979 to mid-1982 implementation program had to be extended
due to the shortage of funds and the necessary reduction in the scope of the
investment programs. However, despite about a two year delay in implementa-
tion, physical accomplishments generally achieved their targets. Overall
accomplishments by the five Republics/Provinces combined totalled 715 km of
Pink financed roads against 772 km planned, an achievement of 93%
completion. For locally financed roads, 380 km were constructed/improved
against 431 km planned, achieving 88% completion. In total 1,095 km of
roads were constructed/improved against 1,203 km planned, resulting in an
overall total accomplishment of 91%.

4.06     Kosovo - The three-year program resulting from Kosovo's master
plan study focused on the construction and improvement of 148 km
inter-regional and 181 km regional roads. The main components of the
program were strengthening, rehabilitation and widening of paved roads, but
also included 79 km of new regional roads for construction. Due to
shortage in local resources, it was decided at an early stage to revise the
master plan program. Updated feasibility studies that took almost a year
to complete lead to changes in the original, program. Four locally-financed



- 12 -
road sections, Titova Mitrovica-G. Klina, D. Kormiljane-Konkulj,
Lebane-Milosevo and Crnoljevo-Komorane, totalling 44 km, were deleted to
provide funds for the Bank financed program. The main focus of the program
was on the rehabilitation of the main north-south E-27 trunk route which is
part of the Adriatic Highway. The program was also revised 'o include the
rehabilitation of three major bridges on the Titova Mitrovica-Ribarice
section of the E-27 road leading towards the Adriatic Coast. These
revisions resulted in completion of only 36% of the locally-financed
program or 25 km against 69 km planned. However, all road sections with
Bank financing were completed totalling 259 km. A total of 284 km of roads
were constructed/improved representing 86% of the target of 329 km. The
planned implementation period, mid-1979 to mid-1982, was revised and all
roads were completed by the third quarter of 1984, with a time overrun of
75%.
4.07     Monteiegro - The project roads are part of the regional and
inter-regional network and their construction and improvement enabled much
of the basic road network to be completed. The three primary objectives of
the road investment program were to: (i) improve access from Titograd, the
Republican capital, to the northern Adriatic coast of Montenegro
(Titograd-Cetinje road); (ii) open up undeveloped areas in the hinterland
presently with poor access (i   grad-Murino road); and (iii) improve
connections with Bosnia-Herzeg       and Dubrovnik to the north and west
(Niksic-Vilusi road). Capital g. ,s in the three-year program included the
construction and improvement of 49.6 km of inter-regional and 79.8 km of
regional roads. The inter-regional road program included the construction
of new roads between Titograd and Cetinje and between Niksic and Vilusi
providing substantial distance savings for long-distance traffic
respectively to the Montenegrin coast and the Dubrovnik area. The
remainder of the program included the strengthening and widening of paved
roads and upgrading of gravel roads.  The implementation program was not
adversely affected by the shortage of financial resources. This was due
primarily to the timely completion of the civil works with hardly any time
overrun and consequently lesser contract price escalation as well as
substantial design changes to the lower priority non Bank-financed roads.
All Bank-financed items were completed almost as originally scheduled
between June 1979 and December 1982 with only a 17% time overrun. In total
130 km of roads were constructed/improved against a target of 125 km.
4.08     Vojvodina -  The priorities in Vojvodina's program were given to
the Province's two primary routes: the north-south E5 highway and the
east-west E-94 Trans-Yugoslav Highway. The program included the
construction of 87 km of inter-regional roads and 11 km of regional roads.
Problems with funding and the subsequent late inclusion in the
Bank-financed program of an additional 9.1 km link on the E-5 trunk route
from Srbobran northwards to Feketic caused a time overrun of 103X. The
Srbobran-Feketic section was originally proposed in the Highway Master
Plan, but not included in the project at appraisal due to budget
limitations. However, during 1984 the RO of Vojvodina requested that the
Bank include the section in the program ia order to realize the full
potential for diverted traffic and hence the full benefits of the



- 13 -
sub-project as a whole between Novi Sad and Feketic. Total accomplishments
were satisfactory, 87 km being improved under the Bank-financed program
compared with 74 km planned while the locally-financed program included
11 km compared to 9 km planned.
4.09     Macedonia - During the 1970s, road development plans were mainly
concerned with the expansion of the network of regional roads to serve key
areas of development in the Republic. Although expansion of the network
continued under the program to provide needed links, the program also
addressed the need for consolidation of previous investments in terms of
the improvement and upgrading of roads to better provide for the
increasingly heavy vehicle flows. Under the program new construction of
inter-regional roads and regional roads totalled 110 km and 100 km
respectively while strengthening and widening of paved regional roads by
reconstruction to acceptable standards of old roads with weak pavements and
poor geometry accounted for 49 km. Four of eight locally financed links
were completed by 1981, some ahead of the original schedule but at costs
which were at 70-80% greater than the planned estimates. Apart from minor
works on locally financed links, all construction activities ceased in 1981
and the first half of 1982 because of the shortage of funds. As priority
had been given in the beginning to the locally financed links, the Bank
financed links, Miladinovci- Stip, Ohrid-Risen and Risen-Bitola, suffered a
reduction in the length of improvement works. Given the much lower traffic
expectations, it would have been better to have reduced the scope of works
by lowering of the design standards and improving mainly the existing roads
rather than constructing new alignments with excessive cuts in the hilly
sections. As a result only 110 km out of the 174 km planned under the
Bank-financed program were completed. Combined Bartk and locally-financed
links totalled 259 km or 85% of the planned 305 km. The last Bank-financed
link was completed in June 1984, resulting in an 83% time overrun for the
program as a whole.
4.10     BosLnia-Herzegovina -  Priority under Bosnia-Herzegovina's road
program was given to improving clearly identifiable "bottleneck" sections
as well as the completion of the basic primary network. Completed capital
works in the three year program included strengthening and widening of
inter-regional and regional roads totalling 156 km and 139 km respectively
and new construction of inter-regional and regional roads totalling 17 km
and 11.5 km respectively. The shortage of local funds required a reduction
in the scope of the Bank-financed program and the locally-financed 12 km
link between Podmilacje and Jajce was deleted from the investment plan.
Substantial design changes were made to a key link in the Bank-financed
program, the Bradina-Konjic section of the main route from Sarajevo to the
Adriatic coast. This road was reconstructed on the existing alignment
instead of the construction of the first stage of a new highway. Among the
five Republics/Provinces, Bosnia-Herzegovina's program comprised the
largest number of links, namely 27 links accounting for 31% of the total
road length constructed/improved under the project. All Bank-financed
links totalling 173 km were completed while locally financed links were
reduced to 151 km or 832 of the planned 182 km.

C. Equipment
4.11     The project included funds for procuring specialized equipment to
assist the five Road Organization concerned in monitoring the operation and
utilization of their networks. This equipment included automatic traffic
counters, portable and fixed vehicle weighing scales, maintenance equipment
and laboratory equipment. Details of the equipment are shown in Table 6.
Procurement was delayed as procedures for import of equipment were tightened
in Yugoslavia due to a shortage of foreign exchange. Similar problems were
also experienced under the Ninth Highway Project. Equipment procurement
totalled US$1.95 million or 89% of the planned total.
D. Training and Technical Assistance
4.12     The impact of training provided through Bank highway projects has
been quite considerable, particularly in developing capabilities for
preparation of feasibility and design studies, traffic analyses and highway
development programs in general. However, during implementation of the two
projects, little interest was shown in the training components because of
difficulties in obtaining approval for the foreign exchange expenditures.
This matter was taken up with the Federal Committee for Transport as Well as
with FARP during discussions for inclusion of the projects in the special
Action Program in 1983. Agreement was reached at that time on a program of
short overseas study tours as well as a series of lozal seminars in order to
allow for greater participation at a minimum of costs. This form of
training gave middle management staff practical experience in highway safety
and maintenance related activities. Two group overseas study tours were
organized in 1985 followed by four local seminars organized by the Institute
for Roads in Belgrade. The local seminars, which included participation of
foreign experts, were held in Portoroz (two), Budva, and Ohrid. A total of
40 participants attended each seminar which lasted three weeks. The seminar
programs covered feasibility studies, design, construction, maintenance and
maintenance management.
4.13    As part of the Tenth Highway Project, the findings of the Road User
Charge Study financed under the Eighth Highway Project were reviewed in late
1982 resulting in an updated report and a revised summary report. The
results of the updated road user charges study showed that generally the
structure of road user charges was satisfactory but that periodic
adjustments had to be made in order to offset the effects of inflation. The
results of the study were used during the revision to the investment
programs and financing plans during preparation of SAP in mid-1983 and a
commitment to adjust road user charges for inflation was included under
SAL I in the same year.
E. Project Cost and Disbursement
4.14     In US Dollar terms the cost of individual projects and the overall
totals generally correspond with the appraisal cost estimates. However, due
to the higher than anticipated local inflation individual and overall
project costs in Dinar terms exceeded the appraisal estimates.  Table 5
shows the comparison of appraisal estimates and actual costs of
construction. It is interesting to note the effect of time on the
construction costs of the individual construction programs. In general

terms, allowing for changes in scope of works and minor adjustments in
lengths, those ROs who were able to complete their civil works construction
program earliest had the smallest price escalations. Summarized below is a
comparison of percentage increase in Dinar value of Bank-financed projects
and time overrun.

4.15     The rapid depreciation of the Dinar versus the US Dollar during
1982 and early 1983 led to a reevaluation of the percentages of civil works
financed by the Bank for most of the Republics/Provinces. Effective
April 1, 1983, the project was included under the Special Action Program.
In order to cover the estimated increase in the foreign component of the
construction costs as well as part of local costs, the disburzement
percentages for civil works financed by the Bank were amended as shown below
(para. 3.12):

Taking into account an estimated increase in the foreign component of civil
works from 30% to 352 for the balance of the projects, the increases in the
disbursement rates for the Tenth Highway Project implied, on average, Bank
financing of 12% of local coste on works after April 1983 or 2% of local
costs over the total project.
4.16     The schedule of disbursements seen in Table 7 shows, except for the
end of the first period to December 31, 1979, actual disbursements ahead of
appraisal estimates up to June 30, 1981. Thereafter, actual disbursements
began to lag behind appraisal estimates. After adjustment of the
disbursement rates actual disbursements stayed within 4% of the revised
disbursement schedule.
ELEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
A. General
4.17     The loan became effective on August 8, 1980 after a short
postponement from the projected date of July 31, 1980. The sections
included under the project were consistent with an overall master plan for
the Trans-Yugoslav Highway and were determined on the basis of detailed
feasibility studies. Engineering of the project road sections was based on
design standards satisfactory to the Bank and carried out by competent
Yugoslav consulting engineering firms. The concerned Road Organizations
were responsible for their respective construction works while the CRO acted
as general coordinator for the project.
4.18     CRO was responsible for the execution of a study of tolls on the
Trans-Yugoslav Highway study and for the Highway Safety Program that
involved an international conference in Belgrade with foreign and local
instructors. In 1984, FARP began taking an active part in procurement and
training matters but CRO continued in their role as fiscal agent on behalf
of the Road Organizations.
4.19     Prequalification of contractors started in early 1980 and bids were
received in May 1980 in Croatia, in June 1980 in Serbia, in July 1981 in
Vojvodina and September 1982 in Slovenia. Bidding in Slovenia was delayed
by the preparation of a new feasibility study due to a slowdown in traffic
growth and an increasing shortage of funds. This resulted in a complete
redesign of the Naklo-Ljubljana road based on stage construction of a
two-lane limited access road instead of a four-lane facility. Awards were
made to the lowest evaluated bidder and all procedures followed the Bank's
guidelines for International Competitive Bidding. The details of the
contractors prequalified and bidding are shown below.

At appraisal, the planned starting date for construction was July 1, 1980
with a 24 months implementation period except for Serbia with 18 months.
The subsequent shortage of funds led to an initial postponement of the loan
closing date from June 30, 1983 to June 30, 1984, followed by a further
postponement to June 30, 1985. Details of implementation for each borrower
are described below.
B. Civil Works
4.20    Slovenia - The 28.7 km Naklo to Ljubljana section of the TYH was
originally designed as four-lane controlled access facility constructed on
a new alignment since the existing two-.ane section of TYH, which serves
the major traffic generating area of Kranj, was highly congested and had
poor operating characteristics as a result of ribbon development along 75%
of its length. However, following an increasing shortage of funds in 1981,
a revised feasibility study was prepared, reflecting a slowdown in traffic
growth. The study recommended a reduction of design standards from a
four-lane facility to a two-lane stage construction alternative over an
8 km section of the alignment from Naklo to Kranj. On October 29, 1981 the
Bank amended the loan documents, agreeing to the above change. Construction
started 30 months later than scheduled with completion in May, 1985, 35
months behind schedule with a time overrun of 146Z. Actual construction
time was 29 months.
4.21    Croatia - The 35.9 km Lipovljani to Okucani section extends the TYH
southwest to a point about 125 km from Zagreb where TYH connects with the
arterial network serving the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This link, by
addition of two new traffic lanes to the existing two-lane road, was
designed as a four-lane controlled access facility. Throughout most of the
existing two-lane road the pavement was reconstructed in order to
effectively serve projected traffic and meet design standards for the
four-lane facility. The project road was packaged and bid with four road
contracts and one structure contract. Construction started in May 1981,
with a ten month delay. Subsequent budgetary constraints caused
construction to proceed at a very slow pace, particularly until mid 1982.
All contracts were completed after a period of 50 months in mid-1985, 36
months behind schedule with a time overrun of 150%.
4.22    Serbia - The program included three TYH sections totalling
83.2 km. The sections, by addition of two new traffic lanes to an existing
two-lane road, were designed as four-lane controlled access facilities with
reconstruction of the existing pavement to meet design standards for a
four-lane facility. The sections were: the 9.5 km link from the Vojvodina
border to Surcin (Belgrade Airport), completing the TYH improvement for the
section between Ruma, an important urban center in Vojvodina, and Belgrade;
the 37.1 km link Batocina-Cuprija completing the TYH from Belgrade to
Cuprija and the 36.5 km link from Deligrad to Nis which connected two
sections constructed under the Ninth Highway Project (Pojate to Deligrad
and the Nis Bypass). The last section of the TYH between Cuprija and
Pojate (22 km), necessary to provide a four-lane facility from Belgrade to
the major interchange at Nis, where TYH traffic splits, was completed by
Serbia with EIB financing during 1985 (Map). All three road sections



- 18 -
constructed under seven contracts started one year behind schedule. The
Serbian road organization concentrated its construction effort on building
two new lanes on each section and in June 1982 requested permission from
the Bank to disburse funds entirely against these works while guaranteeing
comple'ion of reconstruction of the existing two lanes during 1984 with
local funds. The Bank agreed to this procedure thereby ensuring early
disbursement of the Serbian portion of the loan. The three road sections
were finally completed in December 1984, in line with the commitment given
by the road organization. Overall completion was about 36 months behind
the original schedule.
4.23    Voivodina - Construction of the 17.3 km Ruma to Popinci section
together with the construction of the section Popinci-Serbia border under
the Tenth Highway Project extended the TYH northeast from Belgrade to the
major intersection with the arterial network serving Vojvodina near Ruma.
This link, by addition of two new traffic lanes to the existing two-lane
road, was designed as a four-lane controlled access facility with
reconstruction of the existing pavement to meet design standards.
Difficulties in obtaining local financing caused a delay in the start up of
almost 14 months. The new lanes were opened in late 1984, while the
reconstructed section was completed in September 1985 after a total
construction period of almost 50 months, 39 months behind schedule
amounting to a time overrun of 163%.
C. Equipment and Technical Assistance
4.24    Equipment - The loan provided for procurement of weighing scales to
monitor and control axle loadings on TYH and its arterial network. In
addition specialized road maintenance equipment was included. Table 9
shows details of the type of equipment purchased by each Republic/
Province. Delays were incurred due to the difficulties in establishing the
share of the equipment fund for each Republic/Province, particularly
between Serbia and Vojvodina. This matter was not discussed at
negotiations and only a global allocation was established at that time. In
addition, import procedures and restrictions in the use of foreign exchange
affected equipment procurement as under the Ninth and Tenth Highway
projects. In the end, Serbia was unable to obtain approval for foreign
exchange expenditures for equipment amounting to about US$ 600,000.
4.25    Technical Assistance - A relatively small amount (US$100,000) was
included for foreign technical assistance under the loan. This was used
for expenses incurred by foreign lecturers in a locally arranged Highway
Safety Conference in 1981, attended by approximately 500 participants
including 70-80 foreigners, and for funding of expatriate consulting
services for a toll study. The toll study undertaken by the Road Institute
in Belgrade with the assistance of foreign consultants started in November
1980. The final report was issued in July 1982 followed by a supplementary
study dated December 1983 which responded to Bank comments on the final
report. The study provided useful guidelines on the level of toll rates in
relation to user cost savings and the effect of differjnt rates on traffic
diversion. Recommendations from the study are now being used in
establishing toll facilities and the level of toll rates on TYH.

D. Project Cost and Disbursements
4.26    The total cost of the road construction component is US$784.6
million, which is 2.42 above the appraisal estimate. Due to high local
inflation, individual and overall project costs in Dinars far exceeded the
appraisal estimate. Table 8 shows the comparison of appraisal estimates
and actual costs of construction. Except for Vojvodina, the actual cost of
construction in US Dollar terms was comparable to the appraisal estimates.
For Vojvodina, the construction cost of the link Ruma-Popinci was 3.1l
above the appraisal estimate. The overall total construction cost exceeded
the appraisal estimate by 2.4%.
4.27    One of the objectives of the Bank's involvement in the Eleventh
Highway Project was to act as a catalyst for attracting cofinancing from
other bilateral, multi-lateral or privete financing sources. After lengthy
delays, arrangements for cofinancing for US$107.7 million were completed in
October 1980, with a consortium led by the Swiss Banking C3rporation.
However, disbursement of the cofinancing funds were not linked to project
implementation and the road organizations began to withdraw the funds upon
loan effectiveness to cover local costs (para. 4.28). Although there was a
cofinancing agreement, this did not tie the disbursement of cofinancing
funds to the release of counterpart funds by the Bank. In hindsight, the
Bank should have coordinated its disbursements with those of the
cofinancing consortium.
4.28    As in the case of the Tenth Highway Project the general shortage of
funds for road expenditures and the very rapid depreciation of the Dinar
versus the US Dollar led to a reevaluation of the disbursement percentages
during 1983 as part of the Special Action Program. Effective April 1,
1983the amended percentages of civil works financed by the Bank are as
shown below:

Based on an increase in the foreign cormponent of civil works from 30% to
35% of total costs for the balance of the works, Bank financing covered on
average about 19% of the local cost of wvorks after April 1983 or 71 of
local costs of the total project. With the possible exception of Serbia,
the major increases in the disbursement percentages reflect the fact that
most road organizations had used cofinancing funds to cover local costs at
the start of construction. However, the increases in disbursement rates
were authorized in order to ease the tight financial situation prevailing
in 1983, thereby releasing valuable funds for essential road maintenance,
while at the same time ensuring the use of the balance of the loan funds.
4.29    The first claim for disbursement was 18 months late compared to the
appraisal schedule as shown in Table 10. The slow pace of construction
caused by the shortage of local funds and high local inflation resulted in
only about 17% disbursement at the end of the planned implementation period
in June 1982. After adjustment of the disbursement rates and revisions to
the implementation schedule, actual disbursements were within an average of
about 13% of the revised disbursement schedule.
V. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
5.01    The main objectives of the civil works components of both projects
were to relieve congestion and reduce transport costs on major arterial and
regional highways. The main benefits of the TYH program are savings in
transport costs which eccrue to a wide variety of road users from various
sectors of the economy and from a range of income groups throughout the
country. Similarly, benefits to international traffic will ultimately
accrue to Yugoslavia through transit traffic agreements and partly through
the participation of international traffic in Yugoslavia's foreign trade
and tourism. Similarly, the road rehabilitation and betterment programs
which formed the bulk of the Tenth Highway Project provide substantial
benefits to road users on many heavily-trafficked primary and regional
routes. Several of the roads are part of routes which carry heavy volumes
of tourist traffic, while the upgrading of gravel roads in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Montenegro have helped to close gaps in the
primary network and help improve integration with the rest of the country.
The projects also contributed significantly to improvements in investment
planning, including providing attention to such key issues as road user
charges.
5.02    The roads improved under the two projects carry traffic volumes
ranging from about 17,000 vpd on the TYH sections under the Eleventh
Highway Project to about 2,000 vpd on many of the regional roads included
under the Tenth Highway Project. Actual road traffic levels are
substantially lower than those forecast at appraisal, reflecting the
considerable slow-down in the economy since 1980/81 as well as the
shortages and rationing of fuel which were felt particularly during 1983
and 1984.  In general, present road traffic levels are similar to those in
1980/81, traffic having shown modest increases in 1984 and 1985, these
being the first increases for several years. In particular, private car



- 21 -
traffic is now returning to its former level following a decline during the
period 1980-83, due largely to the removal of fuel rationing.
5.03    In view of the large number of individual road sections improved
under the Tenth Highway Project, an economic re-evaluation was undertaken
only for selected representative sections (Table 11). Together, these
sections account for about half of the total road construction program
financed under the Tenth Highway Project. On the other hand, an economic
re-evaluation was conducted for all of the TYH sections improved under the
Eleventh Highway Project (Table 12). Actual traffic volumes in 1984 range
from about 501 to 602 of traffic volumes as forecast at appraisal. The
estimated benefits derived from the project are reduced vehicle operating
costs and time savings for business and commuter traffic. Table 13 shows
unit vehicle operating costs as estimated at appraisal of the two projects
compared with actual 1984 costs. The revised estimates show annual
increases in operating costs of about 451 per year over the period from
1978/79 to 1984, mainly due to the higher cost of fuel and increases in
vehicle prices and spare parts. Over the same period, construction costs
increased at an average annual rate of about 30% which is in line with
local inflation. Vehicle operating costs increased at a faster rate
because of regular adjustments in fuel costs in line with the rapid
depreciation of the Dinar exchange rate.
5.04    In the economic re-evaluacion, actual project costs and estimated
benefits were adjusted to constant 1984 prices. The updated user cost
streams have been estimated based on actual traffic. Traffic is forecast
to increase between 1984 and 1985 by 4 to 51, followed by a 3 to 4% annual
increase in the longer term. These growth rates are in line with the
expected improvement in the economy. Tables 14 and 15 show the economic
rates of return (ER) for each individual road section, as estimated at
appraisal compared with the updated estimates, which take into account the
recent fall in oil prices. Despite the substantially lower traffic volumes
than those foreseen at appraisal, both projects show acceptable ERs,
reflecting the faster increases in vehicle operating costs compared with
construction costs over the period from 1978/79 (para. 5.03). The Tenth
Highway Project shows a revised ER of about 181 compared with an appraisal
estimate of about 251 while the Eleventh Highway Project shows a revised ER
of 161 compared with an appraisal estimate of about 241.
5.05    The range of ERs for the Tenth Highway Project was estimated at
appraisal between 12% and 501. While the updated ER for the project as a
whole is estimated at 181, there are considerable variations within the
five road programs. The highest ERs are found in the rehabilitation
programs in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina and also in the construction of
new routes in Montenegro, such as Titograd-Cetinje and Niksic-Vilusi, where
there are major benefits from diverted traffic. In contrast, however, the
M4acedonian program shows only marginal ERs as a result of projects which
are basical3v over-designed for current and expected traffic levels. Even
at appraisal it would appear that the proposals to construct the
Pritep-Bitola and Bitola-Ohrid road sections along essentially new
alignments were not the most attractive alternatives. In addition, during



- 22 -
revisions to the Macedonian program in 1982 as a result of the shortage of
funds, an opportunity was missed to scale down the scope of work on these
links to provide for rehabilitation along the existing alignment, rather
than continuing with higher standard improvements but over only part of the
route. Similarly, the Novi Sad-Srbobran road in Vojvodina, which is part
of the E5 trunk route and involved the stage construction of a two-lane
motorway, appears as a premature investment. This project which provided
only a marginal ER at appraisal, would have shown in an even lower ER had
the Srbobran-Feketic link (14 km) not been added during the latter stages
of the project in order to encourage the diversion of transit traffic to
the new road. In hir.dsight, Vojvodina should have concentrated more of its
program on the main east-west Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH).
5.06    The revised ERs for the TYH sections under the Eleventh Highway
Project range from 13% to 18% with an overall average of about 16X. The
appraisal estimates ranged between 20% and 30% with an average ER o; about
24X. In general, traffic levels on TYH are about 60% of the appraisal
forecasts and have increased at only 1% to 2% per year since 1979 as
opposed to forecast increases of 5% to 10X. Traffic levels are currently
in the order of 20,000 to 25,000 vpd near Belgrade and Zagreb, falling to
about 12,000 vpd in most of Croatia, and about 17,000 to 20,000 vpd in
Serbia between Belgrade and Nis. While the improvement of TYH sections in
Croatia, Vojvodina and Serbia involved the widening of the existing road to
four-lanes, the Naklo-Ljubljana section in Slovenia involved the
construction of a road on a new alignment. Given the lower than forecast
traffic on this new road, the decision made in 1982 to adopt a two-lane
stage construction alternative over part of the alignment instead of the
original four-lane proposal, has proved to be a sound decision.
5.07    The Eleventh Highway Project was particularly beneficial to the TYH
program, providing for the improvement of over 160 km of high priority
sections. In particular, the project has had a major impact on improving
conditions for long distance traffic in Serbia. Together with the
Popinci-Serbia border section of TYR under the Tenth Highway Project, the
improvements under the Eleventh Highway Project enabled the TYH program to
be essentially completed between Ruma, 55 km west of Belgrade, and the town
of Nis in Southern Serbia, 240 km southeast of Belgrade. Following the
project, only one short section of the route remained for improvement in
Serbia, namely a 22 km section in the vicinity of Paracin which was
subsequently completed in November 1985 with European Investment Bank
financing.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
6.01    The Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects were both implemented
during a period of structural adjustment which involved a substantial
reduction in the level of expenditures on roads. The Tenth Highway Project
introduced a sector-lending approach which provided some flexibility in
adjusting to the reduced level of funds and in redefining priorities.
The increasing shortage of funds which began to be experienced in mid-1982
required that increasing attention be given to the preparation of balanced



- 23 -
programs of expenditure in the highway sector, including adequate provision
for rehabilitation and maintenance, and to the main underlying issue of
road user taxation which, in part, provides earmarked funds for road
investment and maintenance. These issues were addressed during preparatory
work for inclusion of both projects in the Specia'l Action Program (SAP) in
mid-1983. In this way, a comprehensive sector-lending approach was
introduced to the country as a whole and provided a firm basis for
preparation of the follow-up Highway Sector Project.
6.02    Following rescheduling of the investment programs under SAP in
mid-1983, implementation was generally satisfactory and in line with the
revised schedules established at that time. Despite up to a two-year delay
in the completion of most items, most of the road improvement programs was
completed as originally planned. In all, 715 km of roads were improved
under the Tenth Highway Project, compared with 760 km forecast at
appraisal, while under the Eleventh Highway Project all sections were
completed, although one section was subject to us,jor design changes. The
response of the various road organizations to the increasing shortage of
funds was somewhat variable. For instance, several republics deleted many
non-Bank financed lower-priority sections from their investment programs
and also reduced design standards on several key Bank-financed links.
However, in some other republics, investments had already been started on a
broad front and opportunities were missed to revise design standards
consistent with reduced funding and lower traffic expectations (paras. 6.05
and 6.06).
6.03    Following the increasing attention which had been shown to TYH
during Bank financing of TYH sections under previous projects, the Eleventh
Highway Project attracted a substantial cofinancing element covering just
under half of the indirect foreign exchange cost of the 160 km TYH
improvement program. Although the lead Bank in the commercial bank
consortium was closely involved with the project in its final stages of
preparation, the disbursement of the commercial bank financing was not tied
in any way to actual project implementation. As a result, most of the road
organizations drew upon the funds as soon as the project became effective.
In hindsight, the Bank should have coordinated the disbursement of
cofinancing funds with its own disbursements on the project.
6.04    Several significant institutional improvements were achieved during
implementation of the two projects. Although not directly related to the
projects themselves, the creation in early 1983 of FARP, a new coordinating
body for roads, came at an opportune time. Although assisted during the
early stages by the Federal Committee for Transport, FARP has now
established itself in a monitoring and coordinating role and is currently
dealing with many aspects of the planning, preparation and implementation
of highway investment and maintenance programs. The Tenth Highway Project
encouraged the preparation of an updating of a road user charges study
which had been prepared earlier under the Eighth Highway Project. The
updated study proved to be particularly useful in analyzing the level and
structure of road user charges during the preparation of SAP in 1983 and
the inclusion of a commitment to adjust road user charges under SAL I in
the same year. The Toll Study which was financed under the Eleventh



- 24 -
Highway Project was an innovative study and has now been adopted as a
guideline for implementing toll systems on TYH. Although the training
programs under the Tenth Project ran into delays because of foreign
exchange approvals, a satisfactory program was finally accomplished during
1985. On the other hand, the only significant achievement under the
Highway Safety Program in the Eleventh Highway Project was the
International Road Safety Conference organized in Belgrade in October
1981. As in previous projects, equipment procurement was delayed because
of difficulties in obtaining import licenses and a substantial part of the
allocation for equipment under the Eleventh Project was cancelled.
6.05    Despite much lower than expected traffic levels, the revised ERs
for most project components are at acceptable levels. This is explained by
a more rapid increase in vehicle operating costs compared to construction
costs, thus offsetting the effects of lower traffic volumes. There are
considerable variations in ERs among the individual road programs. The
highest ERs are found in the rehabilitation programs, particularly in
Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, several road sections are clearly
over-designed, particularly the Prilep-Bitola and Bitola-Ohrid roads in
Macedonia and the Novi Sad - Srbobran-Feketic road in Vojvodina. In these
specific cases, closer attention might have been paid to design standards
at appraisal and revisions might have been introduced during the SAP
discussions.
6.06    Overall supervision effort on both projects was relatively modest,
namely 45.3 man-weeks for the Tenth Highway Project and 33.2 man-weeks for
the Eleventh Highway Project. The projects were implemented during a
period of economic difficulties which required adjustments in
implementation consistent with reduced levels of expenditures on roads.
The supervision effort was responsive to the changes required and
particularly the inclusion of the projects in SAP during early 1983.
However, in certain cases opportunities may have been missed to bring about
revisions in project scope in line with the lower traffic expectations and
reduced funding. On the other hand, this would have required major
revisions to ongoing construction contracts which might have resulted in
significant delays or cost increases.
