HOZANBIQUE
SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SMI4ARY
Borrower:                 People's Republic of Mozambique.
Beneficiaries:            Ba'! of Mozambique, Ministry of Industry and Energy
Institutc Nacional da Desenvolvimento de Industria
Local (IDIL), participating banks, and eligtble
small to medium scale business enterprises.
Amounts                   SDRs 25.1 million (US$32 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity
Onlendina terms           From the IDA funds of US$32.0 million equivalent,
the Bank of Mozambique (BM), acting as executing
agent, would make available approximately US$28.5
million to the participating financial institutions
MPFIs), for onlending on the basis of actual loan
approvals and agreed eligibility criteria. The
remaining total of about US$3.5 million would be
retained by BM (Central) for technical a. sistance
to  the  banks  and  the  industrial  promotion
organization (IDIL), and for training. The PFIs
would onlend the credit proceeds in local currency
to beneficiary enterprises at adjustable interest
rates based on the structure of rates prevailing in
Mozambique.
The onlending credit risk would be borne by the PFIs
who would receive a spread as determined within the
banking system. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by the BM (Central) on behalf of the
Government, and would be covered by the interest
yield on funds onlent, net of the service charge on
the IDA credit, the administration costs, and the
spreads of the PFIs on onlending.  Subloans under
the Credit would have a maturity of 3 to 12 years
with 1 to 4 years grace period. The onlending terms
and conditions are to be reviewed annually.
Prolect Obiectives
and Description:          The aims of this project are: (a) to promote the
rehabilitation and development of manufacturing,
processing, and a range of service industries by
providing foreign exchange financing to small an!
medium enterprises capable of efficient operation
within the reformed business environment; (b) to
restore the capacity of the banking system for the
delivery and management of credit to enterprises;
and (c) to assist the Government in the formulation
of industrial policy.



- li -
There are two components, nanely (a) financing, and
(b) technical assistance and training. The financing
component is to be based on an apex line of credit
which will be made available to BM (Central) through
a Subsidiary Administration Agreament and onlent
to the commercial arm of BM, the Banco Popular de
Desenvolvimento (BPD), and the private sector Banco
Standard Totta (BST).   The project as a whole,
including the line of credit, will be supervised by
an apex unit in BM and there will be a project
steering committee. Subject to meeting efficiency
(including environmental) criteria, subloans will
be available for fixed investment, permanent working
capital, and sub*-oject preparation service.
Technical assistance will finance consultancy inputs
to set up the apex unit and the initial operations
of the Credit, to advise on upgrading the accounting
capabilities of the commercial banks, and to carry
out policy advisory studies in the industrial and
financial sector. There would also ba support to
the IDIL to set up a small business advisory
service, part of whose role would be to support
subloan applications. A training program for bank
employees, initiated with UNDP financing, will be
completed under the Project. A Business Environment
Study has been completed which provides the policy
basis for the project.
Proiect Benefits
and risks                 Subprojects using the line of credit would be
expected to earn a rate of return above the
opportunity cost of capital. For subloans of over
US$250,000, the economic rate of return would be
expected to exceed 122.  For all subprojects the
required financial rate of return would also exceed
12Z. Thus the total financing component would be
expected to earn a return of over 12X. Significant
economic benefits would arise from the startup and
rehabilitation of SMEs which are efficient earners
or savers of foreign exchange, and capable of
yielding substantive employment and income. In
addition, benefits would flow from improvements in
financial infrastructure.



- tit -
There are three main areas of risks (a) problems
in the banking reorganization, the lack of credit
experience of the banks themselves, and the need to
resolve entorprise financing problems, could result
in delays in implementation; these potential
problems would be addressed through technical
assistance and training; (b) social or political
pressures might cause a slow-down in the price
reform under the ERP; however the commitment shown
by Government suggests that these risks are amall;
finally, (c) there is the risk of deterioration of
the security situation; however because of t.heir
small capacity and because the large majority are
urban-based (and these are likely to comprise the
bulk of subloan applications), SMEs are likely to
be  less  vulnerable  to  disruption  of  rural
infrastructure, supplies and markets.

MOZAMBIQUF
SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique has requested
an IDA Credit of US$32 million for a Small and Medium Enterprise Development
Project (the Project). The Project comprises two principal components - an
enterpr.se financing component (EFC), and an institutional strengthening
component. The EFC consists of a line of credit to be onlent through the
banking svstem.   The institutional strengthening component consists of
technical assistance and training, designed to upgrade the lending capability
of the banks and the industrial promotional infrastructure, and to support
industrial policy formulation.
1.02      This Project supports and complements the Government's ongoing
Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) launched in 1987, by assisting with the
rehabilitation of the industrial and financial sectors. The ERP has had a
significant impact on industry through changes in exchange rate policy and
foreign exchange allocation, interest rate reform and credit control, reform
of public expenditure and its financing, and by decontrol of enterprise
pricing, output and distribution, previously under the control of the central
planning authorities. The private sector, both in industry and banking, has
been accorded a revitalized role, and the Government is actively seeking ways
to introduce private sector participation into the state and 'intervened'
companies. Aid flows which have supported the ERP have also been used to
provide short-term import support for industrial enterprises, permitting
production to continue during the adjustment phase.
1.03      The Project builds on the short-term import support assistance
which has up to now been the main focus of external aid efforts to industry
in Mozambique, and starts to address the longer term issue of industrial
investment and rehabilitation, focussing upon the smaller enterprise sector,
which has shown potential as an important source of future growth. At the
same time the Project is concerned to stimulate the recovery of the banking
sector and the revival of prudent investment lending to enterprises, which
has in recent years all but ceased as a result of inter alia shortage of
foreign exchange, and the need to support short term enterprise operating
deficits.
1.04      The Government of Mozambique, over the period 1987 to 1989, has
demonstrated clearly its commitment to reform of the financial sector, in
order to restore the position of the banks as mobilizers of savings for
efficient investment. Of most significanci have been reform of interest rates
and credit controls, carried out in conjunction with the IMF, cessation of
lending to finance enterprise operating deficits, enterprise asset
revaluation and debt clearance, and the reemergence of private banking along
with a major reduction in the lending share of the Central Bank and progress
towards separation of its commercial from its central banking functions. The
latter measures, also supported by the IMF, are aimed at the revival of the
Central Bank's regulatory and policy making role.



-2-
1.05      Total cost of the Project would be about US$50.2 million including
approximately US$39.5 million in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA credit
would amount to US$32.0 million, 64S of the total Project costs. Cofinancing
of US$0.5 million has been provided by UNDP for project preparation; US$7.0
million has been provisionally proposed by the European Investment Bank.
11. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
The Economic Backsround
2.01      At independence the economy of Mozambique was built up around four
main activities - subsistence agriculture, processing of agricultural
commodities for export, migrant labor, and transititourism services. The
external account depended on merchandise exports (principally cashew nuts,
prawns, cotton and tea),   transit trade (from South Africa, Zimbabwe and
Malawi), tourism, and mine workers remittances, (largely from the South
African coal mines). The revenue from remittances and services was usually
sufficient to offset deficits on the merchandise trade account, which ranged
between 20? and 352 of import value over 1960 to 1973. The industrial sector
expanded rapidly from a low base in the five years preceding independence,
following the opening up of the economy to private foreign investment.
2.02      Following independence a series of major setbacks occurred. These
included the departure of 90? of the settler population, and virtually all
skilled manpower over 1974-77, which forced the Government to take over
control of numerous industrial enterprises. The emigration also had
particularly savere effects on plantation agriculture, rural distribution and
the railways and ports. In 1974, foreign exchange reserves were almost fully
depleted. The overall situation was aggravated by the diversion of transit
trade to South Africa, reductions in mine labor remittances, and fall off in
tourism earnings.
2.03      In 1980 serious problems arose with the intensified attacks by
armed bandits. Inter alia this led to a 602 reduction in exports over 1980
to 1984. In addition, the central c-ntrol of prices and production resulted
in major exchange rate and price distortions in the production and banking
sectors, with diversion of goods on to parallel markets. The shrinking of the
tax base as a result of the departure of the settlers, and the subsidies to
enterprises assisted the growth of the fiscal deficit which grew to 30? of
GDP. In addition by 1987 external debt exceeded US$3.0 billion and the debt
service requirements exceeded 200? of exports of goods and services. The
balance of payments gap was met by donor assistance amounting to 80 - 85? of
Mozambique's foreign exchange inflows. As a result of the fundamental
problems facing the economy GDP per capita is estimated to have declined by
50? in real terms between 1973 and 1983.
2.04      In January 1987 the Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) was
initiated. The ERP introduced major macroeconomic changes with respect to the
exchange rate, credit controls, public expenditure, pricing, trade and
distribution of goods, taxes and tariffs, and a series of other measures
related to these. The state Central Plan, in force since 1978, has been
reduced in scope to more of a review function. As a result of the ERP



- 3-
measures, and major international financial support, including foreign debt
service renegotiation, real GDP is estimated to have risen by about 42 in
1987 and 1988.
2.05      The major source of growth has been the family and private
commercial farm sector, which responded to improved price incentives and
probably also to the increased availability of consumer (incentive) goods.
In addition industrial production rose by about 7? (see below) in 1987, after
six years of decline, and the rise seems to have continued in 1988. A
recovery in merchandise exports occurred from a low point of US$79.0 million
in 1986 to an estimated US$105 million in 1988. Inflation and fiscal deficit
targets have been met, and the exchange rate is now around 40 to 502 of the
parallel rate, implying a considerable realignment of internal and external
prices. The impact of the ERP has to be seen in context, however; production
still remains well below 1980 levels and the serious problems of security
remain, along with those of inadequate skilled manpower and rundown capital
stock.
Industrial Development 1,
2.06      Pre-independence. Apart from a few agroprocessing plants such as
sugar and sisal, industrial development began in Mozambique in the 1930's,
when Portugal turned its attention to its colony as a source of raw
materials. From about 1930, smaller scale manufacturing started partly to
supply the settler community. At the same time certain industries were
curtailed in the colony, in order to ensure that markets were open to
Portuguese exports, (as in the case of the Portuguese textile industry,
Which was based on Mozambican cotton exports). After 1946, the emerging
industrial sector diversified away from primary processing into consumer and
intermediate manufacturing. The first textile factory was permitted to start
production in 1952, and cement productiox expanded rapidly. The domestic
market was boosted by a sharp rise in the settler population to about 240,000
by 1970. The most rapidly growing industry was metals and enginecring, which
recorded an  increase  of 302 per annum from 1964  to 1970).    Import
substitution manufacture increased its share of total industrial output
steadily, from approximately 372 in 1955 to 612 in 1972, while the share of
export processing activities declined proportionately. Nevertheless the most
important subsector (in terms of employment and investment) remained primary
processing, i.e. cashews, tea, sugar, sisal fibre, cotton ginning, and edible
oil. There was extensive South African investment in cashew processing, which
by 1973 comprised about 252 of organized industrial employment, and was a
major world supplier.
2.07       Over the period 1957 to 1970 the rate of growth of industrial
output averaged between 6 and 72 per annum, with an acceleration to over 102
during the period 1965 to 1969, as Portugal opened up the economy to foreign
investment, particularly from South Africa. The 'open door' policy for
foreign investment included a series of incentives such as tax holidays, and
profit repatriation entitlement; previous regulataons requiring financial

Environment Study, IDA May 1989, Chapters 2 and 3.

participation by Portuguese firms were dropped. In one sense the legacy of
this period has been helpful to industrial viability, because the need to
face foreign competition probably resulted in the establishment of
economically efficient operations. However, the new enterprises also tended
to be highly dependent on imports, and were often equipped with second hand
machinery; their reliance on foreign managemhent and technicians was also a
potential weakness.    Summary  data  on  enterprises  and  employment  in
manufacturing and processing over the period prior to independence in 1974
are as follows.

2.08      The post independence decline. Following independence in 1974 the
exodus of 200,000 Portugiese settlers caused a serious disruption in
production since the settler community had all but monopolized managerial
and skilled jobs. This situation necessitated the 'intervention' by the
Government in numerous enterprises, many of which were by then in a state of
neglect, and in some cases with heavy debt arrears. The coal mines were taken
over after two serious accidents. Formal nationalization however only
occurred in the case of petroleum refining and a shipping company. A series
of closures and amalgamations of foreign owned banks took place to create the
state controlled central bank (the Bank of Mozambique) and the Banco Popular
De Desenvolvimento. The Banco Standard Totta remained private. The state also
took over commercial operations necessitated by closure of Portuguese firms.
In 1975 criteria were established for intervention, including a 60 day delay
following the publication of a statutory notice during which owners of
abandoned units or their representatives could oppose. A total of about 300
enterprises were intervened initially: including many small distribution
outlets which were after 1980 returned to the private sector. In 1987, a
total of 140 manufacturing and processing enterprises were  listed as
intervened. It appears that the Government has returned the majority of
enterprises to private ownership, largely in the small-scale distribution
sector, but increasingly in manufacturing.

2.10      The rapid decline in output immediately after independence was
partly reversed by 1981. In 1981 however sabotage of infrastructure by armed
bandits bugan.   1986 output fell to less than half its 1980 level in
manufacturing and agroindustry, and 302 of the pre-independence peak
production. Sabotage was responsible for the decline of electric power
generation from 11.3 GWH in 1980 to 0.4 GWH in 1986. Petroleum refining was
halted in 1985.  The centralized control of production, distribution and
pricing probably also reduced the ability of enterprises to adapt to adverse
conditions. Capacity utilization of industrial plant fell to 302 or less in
1986 in many industries. The most seriously affected industries were sugar
(6Z utilization), cashew, oils and soaps (10Z), because of their reliance on
domestic materials and transport subject to sabotage. In manufacturing the
most seriously affected were containers and paints (both estimated at 82),
while only batteries and radio assembly recorded higher than 50X. In 1987,
however, there was an increase in industrial output, the first for six years,
as a result mainly of increased material provision through donor import
support; it is expected that this increase would have been maintained in
1988.
The Structure of Industry
2.11      The  composition  of industrial output.  Annex  2.01  shows  the
structure of employment and output, for 1973 and 1987 over all manufacturing
and processing enterprises. Despite its externally dependent situation, in
1973 industry was relatively diversified, with a relatively high level of
internal linkages. In particular metals and engineering had a significant
share of output. The traditional colonial industries, represented mainly by
the food, beverages and tobacco sector, comprised 44Z. The largest single
industry in terms of value added contribution was sugar, and the largest in
terms of employment was cashew processing. The split between consumer, and
producer (intermediate and capital) goods production was approximately 67 t
33 in terms of value added. The direct export sector comprised about 202.
In 1987 the structure of industrial production shifted towards textile and
garments subsector, as a result of investments in the 1970's; there has been
a major decline in the case of nonmetallic mineral products partly due to the
security constraints on particularly the cement industry, which is producing

-6-
at less than 30X of its 1981 level. The preindependence engineering base is
still largely intact, but in great need of refurbishment.
2.12      Industrial location. In 1973, Maputo (Lourenco Marques) province
accounted for 44Z of employment, and 51S of industrial value added. Beira and
Maputo together accounted for 60Z of employment, and 71. of value added. The
most widely distributed industries were cereals milling, cotton ginning,
sisal, and timber which were located largely outside Lourenco Marques/Maputo
province. In general the food and fibre processing industries, as expected,
were widely distributed, while manufactured goods such as rubber, plastics,
chemicals, paints, and metals and engineering were heavily concentrated in
the two major towns.   By 1987 the recorded pattern was altered with a
considerable increase in the share of Maputo province. Maputo and Beira
continue to dominate the sector in terms of employment and output. There are
advantages in this in terms of economies of concentration and secAtrity
considerations for those enterprises not dependent on materials srom
upcountry. However, against this in the longer term is the issue of income
distribution and regional balance.
2.13      Ownership structure.  As  stated,  following  independence  the
ownership of industry changed radically as a result of the decision by the
state in 1975 to 'intervene' abandoned or commercially sabotaged enterprises.
After an initial intervention in about 300 enterprises the 1977 law 31
permitted various changes, including full state ownership or reversion to
private ownership, depending on the circumstances. In 1984 the structure of
ownership of 575 nationally registered enterprises was as follows: state 114;
intervened 140; private 294; mixed and cooperative 27 (see Annex 2.14).  The
extent of public ownership is a constraint on industrial rehabilitation and
mechanisms for expanding private sector involvement are being discussed 4/.
Post Independence Industrial Strategy and PlannIng
2.14      The rapidly developing economic difficulties of the country in the
early 1980's obliged the Government to set aside long term plans that had
been drawn up previously which had laid emphasis on large scale basic
industries such as iron and steel, aluminum, and chemicals. In 1983 the 4th
party congress adopted a new policy emphasizing the increase in utilization
of existing capacity, rehabilitation, and a new focus on small scale industry
and the private sector. The role of the central plan, which had set targets
for pricing, production and distribution since 1979 for about 575 nationally
registered enterprises, started to be reduced. By 1983 it was accepted by
Goverrment that a greater degree of flexibility had to be introducee into the
system. The current situation is that the plan is now based on 'tottom up'
submissions of production price and shipment figures rather than the 'top
down' instructions of the Planning Commission. Nevertheless, business
behavior in the industrial sector is still constrained by the effects of past
controls - e.g. there is little procurement or marketing experience, nor

cit.

experience of actively seeking opportunities for profit making. This applies
to both the public and the private sector enterprises.
The Role of Small and Medium EnterDrises
2.15      As stated the role of small and medium enterprises in the economy
has only become a focus of Government concern relatively recently. Available
statistics for the scale distribution of industry in 1973 and 1987 are at
Annex 2.02.   Bearing in mind omissions and under-reporting,  the scale
structure has shifted towards microenterprises (under 10 workers), which
comprised 11Z of 1987 employment compared with 2? of 1973 employment in
industry. The 1987 employment in microenterprises is shown to have doubled
over 1973. The total micro and small scale sector, defined as enterprises
with 1 to 100 workers, comprised 25Z of total employment in 1973 and 31? in
1987. The small tO medium scale category in 1987 (all enterprises of 1 to
200 workers) would include over 90Z of enterprises with 46Z of total
employment. At the other end of the scale, for large enterprises of over 500
employees, the 1973 share of 402 of employment has fallen to 29Z, largely
because of the semi-closure of industries such as cement, cashew processing
and sugar. By subsector the cmallest average scale is in the wood products
and textile (garment) industries (average 15 workers). The food sector also
has a relatively large number of micro and small enterprises but also
contains the largest (e.g. sugar).
2.16      The overall 1973 estimate of 252 of employment in all recorded
enterprises of under 100 workers appears comparatively low; this could be
accounted for by the known history of rural Mozambique before independence
where a combination of migrant labor and plantation agriculture may have
distorted downwards the contribution of rural industry. The 31? estimate for
1987 however also reflects the low capacity utilization of larger enterprises
as well as a switch towards the smallest scale of production.
2.17      In the case of Maputo province alone the employment figures show
an increase in employment between 1973 and 1987, from 43,000 to 46,400 (see
Annex 2.02).  The Maputo results confirm that the only sector to exhibit
significant growth, contrary to the overall trend, has been microenterprises
with under 10 employees. There is also an increase in employment in the
largest scale categories, which is principally explained by the establishment
of textiles in Maputo province during the early 1970's. The structure of
microenterprises in Maputo in 1987 was dominated by the garment industry,
(consisting of 210 separate enterprises with 42? of total microenterprise
employment). The next most important activities were engineering and metal
products (small repair shops), and wood products.
2.18      Enterprises in the range of 10 to 200 workers have not fared better
than the rest of industry; however, those employing less than 10 workers,
largely metalwork and small mechanical workshops, wood products, and garment
producers, seem to have countered the decline over the sector as a whole. The
evidence of relative dynamism in the smallest firms is not easy to interpret;
given the highly protected post independence environment and severe lack of
foreign exchange and skills, it is possible for the small enterprise sector
with lower dependence on imports and technical skills to earn profits even
with high pricellow quality products. Nevertheless, the apparent fact of



-8-
solid growth in this sector is consistent with international experience and
it is likely that small scale enterprises are potentially economic as a
result of their ability to utilize capacity more fully, and their more
appropriate pattern of factor utilization, including use of indigenous skills
and managerial know-how.
2.19      In terms of the reestablishment of longer term investment lending
in Mozambique, there is therefore an a priori justification for identifying
a target group of more managerially and technically progressive enterprises
within these subsectors which are looking to expand capacity from workshop
scale.
The Current Business Climate
2.20      Security. An inescapable issue is that of the security situation
which has effectively isolated the rural economy and population. This
constraint affects industry both in terms of procurement of raw materials and
the sale of finished products. There is however some optimism in the business
community that the situation will be alleviated as the economic reforms
assist in the reintegration of the rural economy through price incentives to
commercialized agricultural production.
2.21      The role of the Government, while still predominant, has shifted
towards policy setting and away from detailed decision making. Its main
function is now perceived by business to be its role in taxation and
allocation of foreign exchange, and therefore must be conceived in terms of
its ability to provide the right type of incentive framework. State
enterprises are in principle expected to rationalize their production and
costs based on their ability to sell at competitive prices in the market.
Government policy is now openly discussed with the business community. This
change is reflected in the creation of the Association of Mozambican Private
Entrepreneurs (AEPRITO) and the Industrial Association AEPRIHO in 1988.  Two
industrial conferences were held in 1987 and 1988, and Government statements
showed strong support for increasing the role of the private sector.
2.22      New investment and company formation.  Industrial investment since
independence has been limited, and concentrated in cereals processing, ship
repair, bus assembly, timber processing, farm implements, vegetable oil, and
textiles.  Industrial investment financed by the state reached a peak in
nominal and real terms of 251 of total public investment expenditure over the
period 1981-83, averaging about Mt 4.0 bn per annum. However, there was a
decline to a 1986 nominal level of Mt 1.30 bn. Indications of an upturn ir.
activity may be seen in renewed investor interest. Foreign investment
proposals increased significantly in 1988, with over 20 being approved,
compared to 15 over the period 1985 to 1987. As of January 1989 approximately
20 further proposals were under investigation, mainly tourism and trade
related; processing industry proposals included fish, cashew nuts, and
tobacco.
2.23      A number of company sales to private entrepreneurs at the national
level have occurred over the past few years. A total of 45 company sales are
reported over the period 1983 - 88 (Annex 2.03). These included principally
wood products manufacturers and electrical equipment agencies, as well as



-9-
food, beverages, oil and soap, garments, leather, plastic products, and
metalvorks. Sell offs have increased over the period, with a bunching in 1987
and 1988. At the local level (defined by the Government as the group of
enterprises with less than about 50 workers), 40 company privatizations were
recorded over 1985-88. Of these 26 were in Haputo, 4 in Nampula, and 12 in
Beira, largely in small wood-working and metal-working units. There have
been very few new company registrations at the national level in recent
years. At the 'local' level new company registrations in Haputo amounted to
about 150 over 1985 - 88 of which 50 were bunched over the period Tanuary to
October 1988. The products included largely food processing (including
milling), wood and metal work, and to a lesser extent garments and pottery.
2.24      Pricing and distribution. Prior to 1987 all costs and prices of
finished products of nationally registered enterprises were strictly
controlled. Companies generating losses due to price control were given
automatic access to credit from the banking system. Three categories of
prices now exist: (a) controlled, which apply to about 7 industrial products,
including milled grain, oil, and soap (see Annex 2.17); (b) conditional,
which permit enterprises to set prices on a cost plus markup basis, and to
submit for ex post approval which is generally given; and (c) free prices.
The conditional category is transitional between controlled and free prices.
Initially the new process for approving price increases was slow and
cumbersome, both within the fixed price and conditional price category, but
by the end of 1988 it had been reportedly speeded up. In those few cases
where industrial products are still price controlled, official prices are
also being regularly adjusted to reflect real costs. The number of products
subject to price control will be reduced progressively. 51
2.25      Prior to 1987, all industrial goods from nationally registered
enterprises were supposed to be sold to government designated buyers. For
producers with low quality products the system of designated buyers was a
major benefit as all production was guaranteed to be sold. This meant that
producers were not accountable for poor quality, which in turn led to a
breakdown in the quality control functions, and labor efficiency. The reforms
of January 1987 began to eliminate designated buyers, and firms have become
more conscious of normal marketing considerations such as price and quality.
Additionally, the concept of cost accounting has become more important,
particularly in the area of raw material costs.
Current Industrial Output and Emplo7ment
2.26      In 1987 industrial production expanded for the first time since
1981. The index of production (Table 2.2) was about 6-7Z above that of 1986;
this was mainly due to the effects of donor import support programmes,
including two IDA Rehabilitation Credits which allocated about US$60 million
to industry. The recovery was however spread unevenly between branches. In
1987 the major increases were in textiles (21Z), wood products (46Z),
chemicals and plastics (161), and basic metals (136X). However tobacco, and
leather registered declines. Provisional data for HIE enterprises (over 50
workers) in 1988 show an overall increase of about 20? in real terms (Annexes
5/  See Hozambique; Policy Framework Paper, 1988-90



- 10 -
2.04 and 2.05).  covering both  increases and declines.   The available
statistics show a continued recovery from the low point of 1986. although
production has not yet approached the level of 1980. It would be expected
that the poor state of plant and equipment in many enterprises would act as
a constraint on further significant increases, prior to more major
renovations of plant and equipment. There is also the problem of a possible
market constraint, discussed below.
2.27      Several estimates of current employment are available. A 1987 labor
survey shows employment of 66,500 in manufacturing, (with 17,700 in
construction, and 3,700 in public utilities), covering all enterprises. The
National Planning Commission estimates 87,800 in manufacturing for nationally
registered enterprises alone (22,100 in construction and 4,600 in public
utilities), which would give an adjusted estimate of total industrial
employment in manufacturing and processing enterprise of about 110,000. UNIDO 6/
estimated a total of 150,000 employees in the organized sector, plus 30,000
in locally registered units and a further 20,000 in microenterprises. Given
the difficulties that have faced industry since 1973, when industrial
employment was estimated at 99,500, combined with the relaxation of laws
related to security of employment in 1985, the current organized sector total
is likely to be in the range 80,000 to 100,000.
The Market for Industrial Products
2.28      There is no certainty that either the short or long-term level of
demand within the economy is sufficient to justify the retention of all
existing industrial capacity. Aggregate demand for industrial goods may be
considered to have been influenced by longer term demographic changes, and
the more immediate impact of devaluation on the pattern of urban/rural
demand. There have also been transitional problems resulting from
uncoordinated imports (e.g. garments), and donor aid goods such as blankets,
soap, cooking oil, and agricultural tools which have constrained the market
available to local producers.
2.29      Demand in the long run. The level and pattern of demard have been
influenced principally by the settler exodus in the 1970's, partly offset by
the arrival of the foreign aid community, and internal and external migration
caused by sabotage and dislocation. Consumption shows a 11Z reduction over
five years since 1982, and an estimated reduction of around 212 since 1973.
The Business Environment Study estimated that, without the effects of the
dislocation and refugee problem, aggregate consumption would have increased
by 15 to 202 since 1973 given zero growth in consumption per capita. However,
the market for higher value manufactures would not have risen as much, since
the  departure  of  the  settlers  would  have  affected  this  sector
disproportionately. Thus it is possible' that the market for manufactures
would have expanded little if at all over 1973 to 1987, even without the
dislkcation. Demand for some industrial products (particularly consumer
durables) could take several years to regain its 1973 level, even with
reestablishment of peace.

2.30      lmpact  of  devaluation  on  purchasing  power.  The  impact  of
devaluation on the market has more immediate implications for the industrial
sector. Relative costs have fallen, but urban real wages and purchasing power
!          would be expected to have fallen as well; at the same time the rural market,
which would have been expected to have gained from changes in domestic
relative prices, is partly inaccessible because of disruption of distribution
infrastructure.  The indications of the trend in urban real wages are
ambiguous; however, if there has been a significant reduction in urban real
income tnen discretionary purchases would be severely cut back, while
essentials such as food would be cut but to a lesser extent. The first types
of expenditure to be cut back would be for consumer durables such as
electrical goods (e.g. radios) and bicycles, as well as clothing, beverages
and cigarettes, and certain nonessential processed/packaged foods. Certain
industries have in fact noted a decline in production from 1986 levels due
primarily to a retraction in demand. These include oils and soaps, footwear,
mattresses, cardboard containers, car tires, bicycles. and PVC pipes.
2.31      Problems related to the security situation.  In terms of marketing
and distribution the security problem had made the delivery of goods to (and
from) rural areas difficult and in some cases impossible with a severe
reduction in the accessible market.   In addition farms unable to get
commercial crops to market because of disrupted transport would havc suffered
a significant reduction in ircome, and reduced purchasing power. Increased
producer prices would in this situation be unable to increase effective
purchasing power. It is notable that smaller scale production of manufactured
goods generally would be less vulnerable to security problems to the extent
that it draws supplies and delivers to markets within neighboring areas.
The Reform of Industrial Policy
2.32      The most important reforms related to industry that have taken
place or are in process under the Economic Rehabilitation Program are the
following.
2.33      Exchange rate and foreign exchange allocation. Currency devaluation
has tended to lower the real value of domestic factor payments, particularly
real wages, and has improved the medium/long term competitive position of
labor intensive and domestic resource based industry. A phased opening up of
the foreign exchange market is in process through the new system for
nonadministrative allocation of foreign exchange, under the IDA Third
Rehabilitation Credit, and through mechanisms such as special funds - the
'market fund' for trading companies, and the 'small medium e_terprise fund'
for producers. In 1988 a total of US$6.0 million was disbursed under both
funds (SME fund financing is at Annex 2.06). The fund allocatiun for 1989 is
expected to total US$25 million. In addition an export exchange retention
scheme was introduced in 1984 (see Annex 2.16).
2.34      Pricing and distribution.   Since January 1987 price policy has
aimed at reducing the number of products with fixed prices and allowing
prices to be more related to costs of production and market demand.
Distribution policy is expected to continue to change alongside pricing, with
a reduction in the number of final products subject to administrative



- 12 -
allocation to 15 in 1989. All enterprises are now permitt-ed to trade directly
rather than through a trading company; state trading companies are expected
to compete with the private sector. However, control on foreign procurement
is still partly exercised through foreign exchange allocation and import
licencing, with control of some internal trade through rationing.
Recommendations on reform in foreign exchange allocation and import licencing
have been made to the Government in the Businesa Environment Study, and
special arrangements have been made regarding import licenses for equipment
financed by the present project (see para. 5.19).
2.35      Investment incentives. Positive efforts to attract foreign and
domestic private investors are being made through the establishment of trade
essociations, and through privatization and joint ventures.  The 1984 and
1987 foreign and local investment laws relating to tax exemptions and
!'centives and foreign exchange retention included tax holidays, depreciation
and capital allowances, and exemptions from labor income tax, turnover tax,
and import and export duties. In 1988 a debt-equity swap law was passed
setting out conditions under which foreign investors could acquire local
assets. The export retention scheme, despite limitations, is a particularly
important inducement to foreign and local investors. However, the actual
impact of the system is difficult to judge in current conditions where
investment is constrained by numerous other factors (summarised in Annex
2.15). Proposals for refinement of the incentive framework in a number of
areas have been made in the Business Environment Study.
2.36      Tariff and tax reform.  From 1987 to 1989, partly as a result of
discussion with business, reforms have been instituted to rationalize and
simplify the system of company taxes, and trade tariffs, and to introduce the
concept of limited tariff protection as opposed to quantitative controls.
Among the main changes has been the abolition of dividend taxation. Under the
Business Environment Study simplification and increased transparency of the
system is recommended, in order to improve the incentive framework.  The IMF
has also proposed certain modifications to the system 71. The current
structure of tariff rates is shown in Annex 2.07.
2.37      Enterprise financial restructuring and financial services capacity.
Restructuring is required because of the   effects of devaluation and
accumulated debt on enterprise balance sheets. These effects distort tax
liabilities and discourage bank lending. By December 1988 the Government had
taken steps to transfer about Mts 8.0 billion of the debt of 10 state and
intervened companies to the Central Budget, where revised terms  and
conditions of repayment will be worked out. Transfers up to now have been
confined to public sector companies. Some individual debt reschedulings have
also been arranged through the Bank of Mozambique, on easier terms. A decree
has been issued requiring revaluation of assets of enterprises within 1988
balance sheets. The regularization of bank lending and the establishment of
an accountable private sector also require auditing capacity to be set up,
and some progress is being made in this regard. A system of standard accounts
was instituted in 1984; however, there is an acute shortage of accountants
and the Government is considering allowing foreign accountancy firms to open
7/ 'Memorandum on the tax system of Mozambique' IMP January 1988.



- 13 -
offices. Currently, capacity for external auditing of enterprise accounts is
not sufficient; internal auditing is carried out and auditing for tax
purposes is undertaken by the Ministry of Finance.
2.38      Campamy sales and ownirship. The overall question of company
formation and ownership has been addressed by the Government through
legislation relating to the intervened companies. Most recently (1989) there
has been a move to transfer some intervened companies to the state sector as
a possible precondition for eventual company sale. The Government has sold
off assets abandoned by previous owners under the original legislation, and
has come to specific agreements with new owners. Sales are dealt with on a
case by case basis, and no general clarification of the legal position of
intervened companies has been made. Proposals for mechanisms for sell off of
state assets are made in the Business Environment Study, and ownership and
other corporate legal issues are being examined by a Government working group
under the Minister of Industry.
2.39      Labor. In January 1987 decree law 5187 set 20 grade ranges in
industry, specifying new pay levels and allowing supplementary payments sucb
as performance linked and seniority bonuses. After the decree, a series of
interim increases were permitted to offset part of the effects of devaluation
induced price increases. The aim is to increase flexibility in employment,
in terms of rewards for efficiency and ability of enterprises to lay off
workers. It is intended that these measures  will allow wage costs to more
accurately reflect operating conditions. Industrial costs have fallen in real
terms due to devaluation; however, where overmanning still exists the longer
run competitive position of the industries may be adversely affected.
The Economic Efficiency of Industry
2.40      The economic efficiency of the industrial sector has been improved
by the series of devaluations that have taken place. The devaluation has
generally lowered wage costs as a proportion of total costs so that
enterprises are more competitive vis a via international prices. According
to the results of an industrial efficiency analysis carried out under the
Business Environment Study (Annex 2.08), in the short run, ignoring plant
replacement costs, most industries are able to operate efficiently in
economic terms. This means that they are earning or saving foreign exchange
efficiently enough to justify the commitment of domestic resources.
2.41      The results imply that, treating plant and equipment as a sunk
cost, it is economically justifiable to supply working capital and carry out
organizational improvements, repairs and minor replacements over a range of
consumer, intermediate and capital goods industries. There is some doubt
however about industries such as textiles, certain footwear products, glass,
and edible oil given the present state of their operations, and the sugar
industry which at the moment is unable to cover variable costs at world
prices. However, the efficiency study could only give approximate guidelines
and is no substitute for case-by-case feasibility studies which would be
carried out under the Project.
2.42      The long run viability of many enterprises (after taking account
of costs of equipment replacement) can only be determined after detailed



- 14 -
analysis at the enterprise level because the current situation is distorted
by excess capacity, low efficiency and possible market constraints. For many
industries complete refurbishment is required which would involve not only
plant -eplacement but reorganizationlreduction of the labor force and radical
improvements in productivity through for example reducing material wastage
if economic efficiency is to be restored.
2.43      The efficiency  study included a group of small enterprises;
however, the results did not suggest that this category showed a
systematically different level of efficiency than the total sample; again,
case-by-case analysis would be essential for determination of the specific
prospects for the smaller enterprises.
Industrial Strategy and Implications for Small and Medium Enterprise
Development
2.44      The stagnation of industrial investment and production over the
past few years, and the price distortions in the industrial sector resulting
from centralized control, do not permit a clear view of the impact of the
reforms on SHE. Unlike other countries there is no experience of systematic
disadvantages facing SME, vis-a-vis larger enterprises, in areas such as
foreign exchange allocation, fiscal incentives, access to credit, or public
investment planning since the reforms of 1983,   when a number of small
enterprise development units were set up.  In addition, foreign exchange
funds were created for small enterprises and a microenterprise credit
program. (see below and chapter 3). However, it would be expected that
administrative allocation would tend to favor large enterprises.
2.45      In general, the reform process should favor domestic resource
using, labor intensive production; these are characteristics of smaller
enterprise production; in addition the SMEs would benefit from greater
flexibility of production and ability to utilize capacity more fully in the
context of continuing uncertainty of input supply and markets. It is in this
sector that an earlier supply response may be expected while larger
enterprises attempt to rehabilitate their rundown plant and. equipment, and
disused marketing and distribution systems.
2.46      The strategy for rehabilitation of industry involves the creation
of an environment in which industrial ent.epreneurship can be fostered; this
requires a difficult transition frum a supply-oriented planned industrial
sector to a market-oriented environment in which production and investment
respond to market and price signals. It is likely that smaller enterprises
are in a better position to make the transition. The process of price (and
wage) adjustment must continue in order to allow costs and prices to vary
according to domestic market conditions, and secondly in order to permit
domestic prices to converge over time with international prices, so that an
efficient distribution of production between domestic and international
markets is attained. This requires continued action in main policy areas of
the ERP.

Institutional Structure for Small Interprise Promotion
2.47      The Govern.-nt decision to switch policy in favor of small-scale
enterprise resulted in the rapid creation of small industries units under
several Government Institutions - Ministries of Industry and Energy (MIE),
Agriculture,  Fisheries, Construction,  and Labor.   The Banco Popular de
Desenvolvimento (BPD) set up a department specializing in small enterprise
credit. n January 1988, Instituto Nacional da Desenvolvimento de Industria
Local (IDIL) was formed from the Department of Local Industry as an
independent agency under the Secretariat of State for Light Industries
(SEILA). In 1988 MIE and SEILA were merged, and IDIL became an agency of MIE.
2.48      In addition, in 1984 the Gabinete de Consultoria dos Projectos da
Pequena Industria (GAPI) was founded as a technical assistance unit for small
enterprise mainly in rural areas (supported by the F. Ebert Fcundation of the
German Federal Ripublic). GAPI has approved a total of about US$1.2 million
to about 90 projects over four years and also arranges technical assis_ance.
The disbursed loans (to about 50 projects) have averaged about US$18,000.
The modal range of loans has been US$6,000 to US$25,000, and they are largely
directed to small rural units, such as grain mills, vegetable oil, soap,
woodworking and pottery. The actual geographical dispersal has been
restricted largely to Cabo Delgado, Niassa, and Maputo provinces. Recently
a number of loans have been approved in Tete province (see Annex 2.09).
2.49      The coordination of SHE promotion is complicated by the fact that
the Provincial Directorates of Industry and Energy have responsibility for
registration, licencing and promotion of industry in their region, and have
a dual reporting function, to both the MIE and the Provincial Governor.
However, the situation is being clarified as the agency which has been
oificial.y designated the role of promoting small scale enterprise is IDIL,
and IDIL delegations are to be attached to existing provincial directorates.
Instituto Nacional da Desenvolvimento de Industria Local (IDIL)
2.50      IDIL is a technical advisory agency, legally established in 1988
under decree No 6188 (Arnex 2.10). The president of IDIL now reports directly
to the Minister of Industry and Energy. The decree states that IDIL would
have the following main areas of activity: (a) appropriate technology
development and transfer; (b) technical support and consultancy assistance;
(c) arranging of local and external financing, and mobilization of external
cooperation; (d) training; (e) provision of advice on industrial protection;
(f) registration and data collection; and (g) promotion of industrial
activity based on local resources and needs.
2.51      IDIL (and its predecessor DIL) collaborated with GAPI in the
processing of mos. of the projects financed by the Ebert foundation and a few
additional projects sponsored by other bilateral donors. Of 100 projects
proposed about 50 have been approved, of which 36 were under the GAPI program
(see para 2.48). The level of investment averaged about US$10,000. The main
types of activity financed were, as in the case of the GAPI program, wood
products, vegetable oil pressing and soap, and cereal milling, plus a small
number of other activities, including repair units, pottery, tanning,



- 16 -
vegetable and fish preservation. The actual role of IDIL in these projects
has been mainly one of checking proposals which may have been forwarded by
BPD, and in working with GAPI to arrange technical support and loans. On
occasions IDIL has also despatched its own technician or arranged one from
elsewhere (e.g. through the Sector Ministries) to assist in appraisal or
repair/installation of equipment. IDIL's in house technical staff currently
consists of technicians (chemicals and leather', supported on occasions by
teci.nicians from its technology development a  iliate, PRODIL. The latter
company has produced and installed a number of village oil presses, and some
prototypes of other equipment, along with its main commercial production of
metal furniture.
2.52      The provisional staffing target of IDIL is 28 in 1989, and in the
medium term 44. Of these latter about 19 may be categorized as professional
or semi professional staff, and 25 as administrative and support. These
exclude provincial delegation staff. Five departments would be set up, -
administration (including economics and accounts), technical, training,
management, and external relations (see Annex 2.11). IDIL delegations are
being set up in the provinces of Sofala, Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Inhambane,
Zambezia, Tete and Nampula.
2.53      The most recent 1989 IDIL budget requires expenditure of Hts 62.9
million against estimated receipts of Hts 21 3 million. (Annex 2.12),
excluding the proposed IDA Project.  All expatr-iate assistance costs are
assumed to be financed outside the budget. Sources of local finance for
operating expenditure are deficient by about Mts 41.6 million, or 601 of
administrative and personnel costs, but this deficit is expected to be met
out of the Government budget. The proposed 1989 equipment investment budget
of Mt 242.8 million is financed largely (861) by four foreign aid projects,
totalling approximately US$306,000 (Annex 2.13). The potential for making
IDIL self supporting will be improved by the proposed Small Business Advisory
Service (para 2.57).
2.54      From the point of view of the SME Project, there are limitations
to the extent that technical assistance is likely to be effective for IDIL
in the short run. This is (i) because IDIL's experience up to now has been
with mainly micro-enterprises in rural areas;   and (ii) because of its
currently very small size and reliance on Government budgetary resources
(which the mission were informed have now been committed). In addition, the
number of external donors interested in assisting IDIL inevitably creates
pressure  on  its  internal  administrative  capacity.    Nevertheless,  the
Government has made it clear that IDIL will be the principal vehicle for
promotion of the smaller enterprise sector in general. Proposals for other
external assistance received by IDIL, which are either ongoing or are under
serious consideration, have come from UNIDO, ILO, Swedish and US Governments
and non-government organizations from Holland, Italy and the Eduardo Mondlane
foundation. Assistance includes technical personnel, vehicles and office
equipment.
2.55      An alternative approach to assisting IDIL under the Project was
examined; this involved a skills exchange, to be set up with a local currency
budget to subcontract technicians from existing larger industrial enterprises
for provision of assistance to smaller enterprises, avoiding build up of IDIL



- 17 -
in-house technical staff, but at the same time allowing expansion of
technical capacity. However, the Government felt that any approach taken at
this stage should be more cautious, and should consist of advisory assistance
targeted at areas not covered by other resources, primarily in support of the
effective use of the proposed line of credit.
2.56      IDIL's future program also includes a proposal for setting up a
small industry development fund (Fundo de Fomento a Pequena Industria). It
is proposed that this would be a fund managed by the BPD, and would be a
development of the existing GAPI system.
2.57      The proposed IDA assistauce program under the Project would be
limited in scope because it is not considered that the IDIL organization is
sufficiently strong as yet to absorb larger external inputs.   It would,
therefore, be confined to provision of a pilot small business advisory
service designed to provide financial, management and marketing advice to
business in Maputo and Beira areas.   The limited size of the assistance
program is justified because it is not considered that the IDIL organisation
is not sufficiently strong as yet to effectively use a larger input. This
project component is elaborated in Chapter 6.
Ill. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND
THE -DEMAND FOR INDUSlRlAL CREDIT.
Financial System, Institutions and Background
3.01      Mozambique's financial sector currently consists principally of
three  banks,  and one  insurance  company.    In  addition,  there  is  an
Agricultural Credit Fund and two development funds - for agricultural and
irrigation projects - which are administered by, but not strictly part of,
the banking sector. The following analysis is restricted to the banking
system, which attained its current configuration after a restructuring in
1978, involving closures and the amalgamation of a number of foreign banks
under the control of the state sector.   Of the three banks currently
operating, one, the Bank of Mozambique (BM), acts both as Central Bank and
as the leading commercial bank. A second fully state owned bank is the Banco
Popular de Desenvolvimento (BPD). The third bank, Banco Standard Totta de
Mocambique (BSTM), is a foreign-owned private bank.
3.02      Over the period 1980 to 1986, the banking system acted as a conduit
for financing the production plans of the economy. A rapid expansion of
domestic credit occurred so that while GDP fell in real terms by 8Z per annum
over this period, domestic credit expanded rapidly, and serious arrears were
built up amounting to over 50Z of lending by 1986. Interest rates on lending
and borrowing were not used for rationing of credit and were controlled at
negative real rates. Bank deposits were very largely non-interest-bearing
demand deposits. The situation was not conducive to mobilization of real
savings and would normally have led to excess demand for investment funds,
even  in  the  highly  adverse  investment  environment.    However,  the
nonavailability of foreign exchange for import of investment goods
constrained investment, so that liquid reserves were accumulated. Lending
tended to be concentrated in BM, partly financed by deposits from the other



- 18 -
banks. Deposits in the commercial banking sector were predominantly short
term in character (including refinancea overdrafts). The dual role of the BM
was not conducive to the development of its regulatory and policy making
responsibility. Commercial banks were able to maintain financial stability
because of the high levels of liquidity, and lack of alternative outlets for
savings within the underdeveloped financial mLrket; book earnings were
apparently positive because of high yield margins over the average cost of
deposited funds (and also possibly because of the accrual of unpaid
interest). However, even with nonperforming loans accounted for at full
value, combined capitalization was not adequate.
3.03      As stated in chapter 2, public investment fell by about two thirds
in nominal terms between 1980 and 1986; data on private investment are not
available but it fell to a negative net level where enterprises were not
maintaining their capital. Thus the foreign exchange shortage, repression of
interest rates, and the other problems facing the banking system resulted in
a situation whereby over the period 1980-86 the banks virtually ceased
financing longer-term borrowing for investment, especially in industry.
(Finance of enterprise operating deficits was entered in bank balance sheets
as long term debt, but this was not related to investment). To address this
situation, the Government since 1987 has adopted a series of relatively
radical measures for the banking sector under its Economic Rehabilitation
Program (ERP),  with the objective of restoring capability for efficient
mobilization of savings and allocation of investment. The pace of chsage
implies a high level of commitment. The measures taken have been included
in agreements between the Government, IDA and the IMF.
The Strateay For Financial Sector Reform
3.04      Process of financial reform. The task which the Government has
embarked on since 1987 is complex and lengthy, requiring that the financial
sector undergo a transition from a system whose main purpose was the
administrative allocation of public funds according to the requirements of
the central plan, to one in which private savings can be effectively
mobilised and channelled to economic investment outlets via a market
determined price (interest rate) system, and which can be monitored and
regulated through monetary instruments by the central bank. Under the
previous system the main instrument of monetary control was the annual credit
plan, which complemented the annual production plans; the interest rate was
effectively redundant and monetary and regulatory control of the banks was
impracticable. In order to rehabilitate the financial sector, the reform
process has had to address the following basic areas: (a) interest rates; (b)
institutional development; (c) financial restructuring of the banks, ld)
establishment of performance guidelines. The combined effect of reforms ia
all these areas would be to raise domestic savings and ration credit via the
price system to more profitable outlets, allow necessary specialisation of
the functions of the central bank, and permit a fresh start to be made in the
commercial banking system.
3.05      The ERP, reflected in the Government's Policy Framework Paper, has
initially addressed (a) and (b) above. Under the program agreed with the IMF,
nominal interest rates have teen increased in successive steps toward
positive real levels as the rate of price inflation declines, with a target



- 19 -
of achieving positive real rates in 1990. The interaction between the fiscal
and monetary policy has been addressed by setting targets (ceilings) for the
fiscal deficit in combination with bank credit ceilings, whereby Government
financing by the banking system has been significantly reduced in real terms;
in addition, banking system financing of operating losses of enterprises has
been curtailed and a portion of doubtful loans transferred from the banking
system to the Ministry of Finance. These measures have in turn permitted
progress under (c) above, in terms of the restructuring of the balance sheets
of the commercial banks by the removal of a portion of nonperforming assets.
In the institutional area, the complex task of separating the Bank of
Mozambique (BM) into its central and commercial functions has been initiated.
This separation is a necessary step towards the restoration of the central
bank's regulatory and monetary control functions, and its role as financier
of central government. In addition, some initial progress has been made on
diversification  of  instrumeits  of  Government  Finance  and  prudential
regulatory controls.
3.06       The no-xt stages of the rehabilitation of the financial system
will require continued progress on interest rate reform and on institution
building and reorganization. The financial restructuring area is relatively
less advanced, and the reintroduction of an effective regulatory system for
the commercial banks will to some extent require inter alia the prior
achievement of progress in restructuring and the final clearance of lending
arrears, which, up to now, has been confined to those of BM (see paras. 3.15
and 3.16). The regulatory powers of the BM have not been utilised because,
for example, reserve requirements have not been effective due to excess
derosits in the commercial banks and, in consequence, the central bank
re iscount  facility has  been  redundant   8/.  In  addition,  regulations
concerning financial performance and prudent lending have not been effective
because of the financing of enterprise deficits during the period of central
planning. The pace at which improvements can be made in these areas depends
to a large extent on the progress of institutional reform, in terms both of
organization (of the BM), and in terms of capacity (skilled manpower) of all
the banks. In particular, manpower constraints in the commercial banks in the
area of accounting, financial management and credit analysis will take time
to resolve, as well as skill shortages in central banking functions. The
proposed project will provide technical assistance and conditionality related
to the next stages of the financial sector rehabilitation (para. 3.42).
3.07      Structure of interest rates.  The structure of lending rates of
interest in Mozambique is shown in Annex 3.01. Rates in effect from 1981 to
1986 were very low in nominal terms, ranging from 0 to 62 for deposits, and
3 to 102 for lending. and negative in real terms. The structure of interest
rates was revised with effect from January 1987 according to Mozambique's
agreements with the IMP for a Structural Adi1!<ment Facility (SAP), with
rates ranging from 31 on demand deposits and 121 to 201 on time deposits, and
54 different lending rates ranging from 12X to 35X. Provision was also made
for a rediscount rate of 101, applicable on amounts up to 61 of demand
deposits, and rising to 121 on amounts up to an additional 61 of demand
deposits. The most recent revision of rates came into effect in September
8/ These powers are codified under the Organic Law, decree 2/75.



- 20 -
1989, with the number of lending rates now reduced to 16, ranging from 152
to 35?. The number of term lending rates (over one year) has declined from
27 to 7, and the range contracted from 18-35Z to 22-35Z. Time deposit rates
are in the range 14? to 222 and the Central Bank rediscount rate is now
unified at 122. These interest rates remain negative in real terms.
Nevertheless, the higher interest rate structure will have a positive impact,
with credit demand shifting to firms that have better prospects in the
current business environment. Under the terms of Mozambique's agreement with
the IMF, they should continue under review and be revised progressively with
a view to achieving positive real interest rates by 1990. This is likely to
be achieved on the basis of current projected inflation rates. Under its
Policy Framework Paper Government has committed itself to reduce over time
the differential between subsidised and commercial rates of interest. Annual
reviews of progress on achieving positive (weighted average) real interest
rates would also take place under the proposed project (see para. 5.13).
3.08      Credit control and lending shares. Mozambique had no active formal
credit allocation policy until 1987, when a ceiling on domestic credit
expansion was introduced of Mt 40 billion. Of this amount, Mt 25 billion
were allocated to lending to the state, with the remaining Mt 15 billion
being allocated amongst the three banks for lending to the economy, according
to their share in lending. Additional credit expansion was allowed under
agreement with the IMF to the extent of the countervalue in meticais of
certain foreign exchange resources, such as World Bank loans. For 1988, the
ceiling was raised to Mt 74 billion, of which Mt 20 billion for lending to
the State, and Mt 54 billion for lending to the economy (including state
enterprises).  There was thus a very significant decline in 1988 in real
terms in the level of banking system financing to be made available to the
State. This shift partly reflects changes in the channelling of financial
resources to state enterprises, in the context of rationalization of their
operations, as well as increasingly tight controls on the Government's budget
and the desire to prevent 'crowding out' of the private sector.
3.09      Data for 1988 show a below-ceiling Mt 64.9 billion expansion in
domestic credit, and a distinct shift in the allocation of funds had become
apparent 9/. In 1986, BM accounted for 792 of total bank lending, BPD for
about 182, and BSTM for about 32; by end 1988 these figures were 69.5X, 23.62
and 4.3? respectively, with the remaining 2.62 lent by the newly established
Caixa de Credito Agrario de Desenvolvimento (CCADR). More significant are
the shares in incremental lending in 1988 (i.e. out of the additional Mt
64.9 billion): BM lent less than 482 of this amount, with BPD accounting for
almost 37?, BSTM for close to 7Z, and CCADR for almost 9?. Along with the
opening up of foreign exchange transactions (para. 3.11), competition between
the three banks is beginning to strengthen, although progress is constrained
by shortages of skilled staff. Once the banks have addressed their urgent
training needs, promotion of fuller competition will be critical to the
development of an efficient financial sector. Under the Project assurances
were received that the Government would formulate a program, by June 30,
9/ The relending of reimbursements from the Government to BM however
effectively increased new lending outside the ceiling by about 10? (see
para 3.15).

1992, for the continued extension of competition within the banking sector,
to be implemented promptly thereafter.
3.10      At present, there are no established guidelines for the sectoral
distribution of credit, although they are under consideration. In recent
ye&rs, agriculture has accounted for around half of total bank lending; of
the remainder, industry accounts for about 172 (39-422 if primary
transformation of agricultural products is tncluded). while construction
accounts for about 5-72, transport and communications around 12-14Z, domestic
trade some 7-9? and foreign trade 6Z. These shares have not changed
significantly over the period 1986-88, except for an increase in domestic
trade credit. Data for BM suggest that manufacturing industry receives some
11? of total lending. As of end 1988, BH accounted for 702 of total lending
to industry, down from 85Z in 1986, while BPD and BLZM accounted for 13.5Z
and 12.92 respectively, and the newly established CCADR accounted for 3.5Z
(see Annex 3.07).
3.11      Foreign  exchange  operations.    When  the  banking  system was
restructured in 1978, it was also decided that BM would have a monopoly on
foreign exchange operations (handled through the commercial department of
BM). The Government is now moving towards a loosening of this monopoly; in
particular, the private sector bank, BSTM, has recently been granted a
limited foreign exchange license.
3.12      Deposit regulations. A further constraint on competition in the
banking system has been the restriction of firms to holding an account at
only one bank. An exception has been made for firms that have their account
with either BPD or BSTM and subsequently require a foreign exchange account,
for example for export activities, which must be held at BM. The lifting of
.his restriction is under consideration by the Government, in order to
encourage greater competition between the banks. BM is also considering
introducing compulsory deposits with the Central Bank, which could
potentially facilitate monetary regulation. Provision might be made for
remunerating any deposits over and above the compulsory level.
3.13      Government fimnance. Treasury bonds were introduced in a very
limited way in 1988 (Mt 10 billion, on which interest is paid in US dollars
at an annual rate of $1.30 per Mt 10,000 bill), and a secondary bond market
has been initiated, under the responsibility of the recently established
Sociedade de  Investimentos  e Estudos Financeiros  (SOCIEF).   The more
widespread use of Treasury bonds is expected to provide an alternative
investment for both institutions and individuals, thus reducing the liquidity
of the banking system and pulling interest rates on bank deposits up to a
level reflecting the opportunity cost of Government resources. Extending the
use of Treasury bonds could have significant positive affects on the
allocation of funds in the economy.
Banking System Arrears
3.14      Despite the indications of positive progress, the banking system
still faces a serious arrears problem, which has arisen from several sources
(see Annexes 3.06 and 3.13). A significant portion of the arrears dates back
to independence, when many Portuguese firm owners left the country; a number



- 22 -
of these firms were subsequently intervened by the Government. The bulk of
the arrears of the private bank, BSTM, date from this period. The largest
share of arrears, however, has stemmed from lending, largely to state
enterprises and intervened firms, by the banks (mainly BM and BPD) at the
Government's request.   Much of this lending was to cover operating deficits
(up to 1986 inclusive) considered to be due to price controls and the
difficult economic environment facing the firms. Total figures for this type
of lending, and for arrears arising from it, are not currently available.
Since 1987, the Government has covered such deficits through direct fiscal
subsidy and has reduced their level substantially; in 1987, such subsidies
totalled Mt 9.1 billion, most of which went to the agricultural sector, with
the total declining to Mt 6.8 billion in 1988 (Annex 3.03).
3.15      The Government has decided to address this aspect of the arrears
problem by assuming much of this type of debt itself. Since 1988, BM tLas
been holding negotiations on these measures with the Government; it also held
a great part of these arrears, exceeding Mt 40 billion (see Annex 3.06). The
other two banks are now undertaking similar negotiations with the Government;
this will be especially significant for BPD which faces major arrears from
the state farm sector (see Annex 3.13). As yet, the total amount of debt
the state will assume is not clear, although a mechanism has been found to
provide the necessary resources: i.e. the metical countervalue of funds made
available under the first two IDA Rehabilitation Credits has been (at least
partially) earmarked for this purpose.
3.16      If the banks had to recognize the full extent of their current
arrears as a loss, they would all have highly negative net worth. Whether
or not write-offs are necessary, however, the current capital base of the
banking system is no longer adequate in view of the greatly increased asset
base. The capital to assets ratio was about 4? for BM in December 1987 after
an 82? capital increase 10/, 2.32 for BPD, and 1.12 for BSTM. Under the
technical assistance component of the proposed Project these aspects would
be reviewed and the need for capital reconstruction evaluated. In order to
reestablish a viable banking sector it is important that current negotiations
between the Government and BM for the clearing of lending arrears be also
extended to BPD and BSTM. Assurances were received that the Government
through BM would, on the basis of agreements with all commercial banks,
formulate an action program to settle lending arrears of the commercial
banking institutions (including BM (Commercial), by December 31, 1991, and
an action program for the rehabilitation of the banking system, by June 30,
1992, for prompt implementation, to include performance benchmarks in terms
of capitalization ratios and arrears ratios.
Organization and Operation of the Banks
Bank of Mozambique
3.17      BM is by far the largest of the three banks, and the one with the
broadest mandate. It was created in 1975 to take over the central banking
10/ Based on the ratio equity to gross assets applicable to BM's
commercial banking activities.



_ 23 -
role previously played by Portugal's Banco Nacional Ultramarino, and in 1978
absorbed the Mozambican operations of four Portuguese-owned banks.
3.18      Branch structure and lending responsibilities.   As Annex 3.04
indicates, DM has 10 filiais (provincial head offices), 17 agencias (district
branches) and 13 delegacoes (deposit offices). The limits attributed to each
branch for credit approval are currently under review.   Loans above the
approval limit of the manager of a filial are referred to headquarters for
approval.   The loan request will be reviewed by the relevant lending
directorate (industry, agro-industry, or trade, transport and others) for
submission to the Director, the department General Manager or, if necessary,
the Governor for approval. Each directorate has three or four credit analyst
staff, including on average one university graduate, with the rest either
high school or vocational training graduates.
3.19      BM is concerned to improve the quality of analysis in its branches,
in order to be able to delegate more approval authority to that level. This
would free the headquarters' analysts to put together new types of credit
operations and focus more on overall coordination. Among the constraints are
the number of qualified personnel; the problem is a national one, and BM as
a whole has only some 20 university graduates.  The lack of data processing
and transport equipment is a further constraint. These problems are being
addressed under this project through the training program and technical
assistance (Chapter 6), and are also the subject of bilateral donor aid.
3.20      Lending share. Annex 3.07 shows the distribution of credit by
sector and bank. BM lending between 1987 and 1988 rose strongly in trade and
Lransport sectors, while lending to agriculture, industry and construction
fell in relative terms.  This resulted in an overall lending decline in the
relative share of agriculture from about 42? to 39Z of total lending, while
industry's share declined slightly from 172 to 162. The overall share of
domestic trade increased from 8? to almost 14?, construction and foreign
trade each accounting for about 7-82, and transport and communications for
the remaining 17-18Z.
3.21      The separation of central and commercial banking functions. The two
functions of PM, as Central Bank and commercial bank, have been clearly
distinguished in the bank's Organic Law of 1975. However, in practice, AM
has not distinguished these functions for accounting or operations. A new
organizational structure was introduced in BM in 1987 in order to help define
the lines along which the central and commercial banking roles should be
separated (see Annex 3.16) 11/. Of the eight departments, two have purely
central banking functions (Planning and Economic Studies, and Banking
Inspection), two have purely commercial banking functions and the remaining
four serve both parts of the bank. The separation of activities within three
of the remaining four departments poses no major conceptual problem, since
11/ The Bank of Mozambique's Board of Directors is entirely internally
constituted, comprising the Governor and the eight department
Administradores (General Managers).



- 24 -
they are support departments 12/. The Department of International Relatioas
and  its  directorates  are  responsible  for  negotiating  all  foreign
loans/assistance to BM and to the Government. This involves issues of
institutional responsibility for foreign exchange risk. It is expected that
it may take some two to three years fully to resolve this and other control
issues and to reflect the results in BM's accounts. To this end a new
accoanting framework has been under implementation with IMf assistance in all
the banks since July 1989.
3.22       The separation of accounts of BM will permit all aspects of
operations to be clearly identified as pertaining to either the central
banking or the commercial banking function of BM.  A full separation of
accounts along these lines is not expected to be available before 1992,
however, for reasons explained above. The establishment of a new commercial
bank, and the transfer of BM's commercial activities to it, is also a
possible option for the Government. Under the project assurances were
received from the Government that a phased program for the separation of BM's
central and commercial banking functions would be provided to IDA by June 30,
1991, leading to its prompt implementation thereafter.
3.23      The Government's desire to introduce greater competition within
the financial sector is constrained in practice by the lack of development
of BH's central banking role (particularly its regulatory functions). While
the other banks also face constraints with respect to their operational
capabilities, these can be most effectively resolved by allowing, and indeed
encouraging, them to compete effectively. The etrengthening of BM's central
banking role will thus continue to be of considerable importance. The recent
shifts in new credit allocation show positive progress in decentralization
of the system, and under the Project an action program for extension of
competition would be formulated (see para 3.09).
3M's Financial Situation
3.24      Foreign exchange liabilities.  The financial situation of the
commercial banking area of BM is sensitive to the decision about whether it
should retain foreign exchange liabilities on its balance sheet. Foreign
medium-to long-term debt booked at Mt 37 billion at year-end 1986 rose by
end-1987 to Mt 413 billion, and Mt 612 billion by end-1988, due to
devaluation. The difference constitutes as yet unrealized foreign exchange
losses. If foreign borrowing were accounted for as a commercial liability,
then the separate commercial BM would clearly be insolvent (see Annex 3.10).
3.25      Because of the lack of an accounting division between central and
commercial functions, the allocation of overall responsibility for individual
borrowings, and for associated profits and losses, will have to be clarified
on a case-by-case basis. It will then be possible to reflect this status in
accounting terms using the new accounting framework.  Given that in many
cases foreign loans were contracted on the instructions of the authorities
in order to finance the deficits of primarily state-owned and intervened
12/ These are the Departments of Legal Affairs and Financial
Participations, Staff and Administration.



- 25 -
enterprises, it may be considered appropriate for most foreign exchange
liabilities to be placed on the Central Bank's balance sheet. These issues
are currently being addressed with the assistance of an IMF-financed advisor.
3.26      Deposits.   Annex 3.05 shows the evolution of banking system
deposits since 1980. BM's demand deposits were Mt 36.3 billion for a lending
portfolio of Mt 108.3 billion in December 1986: some of BM's lending was
financed by the other banks through their deposits with the Central Bank (Mt
16 billion in 1986), as well as through foreign borrowing. In order to make
BM's commercial banking activities more self-financing, BM started to accept
term deposits in 1987 and to stimulate sight deposits. BM's share in total
deposits rose from 46S in 1986 to 592 by December 1988, capturing 69Z of
incremental deposits over that period. As a result, deposits rose to 752 of
lending portfolio (excluding Government), as opposed to only 48Z in 1986
(Annex 3.10).
3.27      Lending arrears.  As stated in paragraph 3.15, the Government has
agreed to take over responsibility for about Mt 40 billion in BM loans to
state and intervened enterprises, which are in arrears and unlikely to be
collectible. This amount represents only the principal in arrears, since BM
does not accrue interest on doubtful loans. Annex 3.06 shows the evolution
of the different components of BM's loan portfolio. Of the Mt 40 billion
that the Government has agreed to assume, Mt 8.8 billion has been paid (out
of countervalue paymeuts from firms receiving foreign exchange under the
first two IDA rehabilitation operations), while another Mt 10 billion has
been rescheduled. As a result, the proportion of these arrears to BM's
overall portfolio is declining quite rapidly, dropping to 152 by December
1988 from 342 in December 1987 and 411 in December 1986.
3.28      Other arrears considered capable of rescheduling have declined from
422 of portfolio to 21Z over the same two years, while rescheduled amounts
now constitute 252 of portfolio, and doubtful debts remain fairly steady at
about 62. In the meantime, the satisfactory component of the portfolio has
increased from 132 to 332, or to 582 if rescheduled amounts are included, or
to 732 if the amounts the State has now agreed to assume are also included.
BM's equity and reserves also increased substantially in the last quarter of
1987, to Mt 25.9 billion; the adequacy of this is currently difficult to
judge, because of uncertainty as to the extent of the as yet unrealized
foreign exchange losses that may be allocated to the commer--ial banking area
of BM. However, BM is addressing the problem both from the point of view of
asset quality and capitalization, and its asset position has been
strengthened.
Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento (BPD)
3.29      Banco Popular  de Desenvolvimento  (BPD)  was  formed  in  1977,
integrating the Instituto de Credito de Mocambique and Montepio de
Mocambique.   It has traditionally been responsible for the financing of
agriculture (and, by extension, the rural sector), housing and construction,
and for domestic savings mobilization. However, it is also empowered under
its charter to invest in equity, new ventures, and take up commercial paper.
This latter role has not been fulfilled, but recently a share capital



- 26 -
participation department was set up for the purpose. It also holds equity in
a few enterprises, notably textiles, inherited from nationalized banks.
3.30      Bran4.h structure and capacity.  BPD is 10O2 state-owned, with 10
regional and 22 district branches, 46 deposit offices and 70 savings
collection posts.   It thus has by far the largest branch network in the
country, with 148 offices as opposed to BM's 40 (see Annex 3.04).  Banco
Popular de Desenvolvimento's current organizational structure is given in
Annex 3.08.
3.31      The credit approval limits for BPD branches are given in Annex
3.09; loans for amounts above the General Manager's limits are submitted to
BPD's President for approval.   At headquarters,  the lending operations
directorate is made up of four sections, three of which are responsible for
lending by area (northern, central, and southern zones of the country). The
numbers of staff and educational levels of credit analysts both in
headquarters and in the regions are very similar to those of BM. In 1987,
BPD held a training course for credit analysts and is also receiving
technical assistance from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, and an AfDB loan
is under preparation that would finance training and technical assistance.
BPD's Financial Situation
3.32      Liquidity.   BPD's balance sheet (Annexes 3.10 and 3.11) shows
considerable excess liquidity, largely because its savings mobilization role
has combined with the lack of lending opportunities, due to, inter alia,
shortage of foreign exchange. In December 1987, over 90Z of BPD's lending
portfolio consisted of nominally short term working capital loans, although
it is understood that the proportion was reduced during 1988. According to
BM figures, which exclude interbank deposits, in 1986 BPD had Mt 35 billion
in deposits, but only Mt 22 billion in its loan portfolio (excluding loans
to the State). By June 1988, deposits had increased to Mt 53.7 billion and
loan portfolio to Mt 35.3 billion. According to BPD's own figures, deposits
were Mt 61.8 billion in 1986,  and Mt 102.3 billion by November 1988, of
which Mt 39.5 billion were deposits by the State. Lending totalled Mt 29.8
billion in 1986, Mt 34.7 billion in June 1988 and Mt 53.4 billion in November
1988. Thus in November 1988 liquid assets were about 402 of total assets.
3.33      Arrears. BPD has severe arrears problems. Including lending to the
state and state farms, Mt 33.9 billion of BPD's Mt 35.3 billion portfolio
were in arrears by June 1988. BPD considers that, with some rescheduling,it
could collect about Mt 6.0 billion of its arrears, but that it may not be
possible to reschedule a further Mt 27.9 billion (see Annexes 3.11 to 3.13).
A large proporti^n of the arrears are old, with Mt 10 billion corresponding
to loans granted before independence, and recent arrears increases have been
largely due to interest accruals on old loans. Almost 93Z of BPD's lending
to the economy was to the state-owned sector, with about 1.6Z going to
cooperatives, and 5.7Z to the private sector.  Loans to the state sector
accounted for 97?Z of BPD's arrears in late 1987 (91.5Z of state portfolio in
arrears), while cooperatives accornt for 0.62 (35.72 in arrears), and the
private sector for 2.6? (39.62 in arrears).   A start has been made in
resolving state sector arrears and it is understood that in 1988 arrears were
reduced to about 502 of total portfolio, while the proportion of lending to



_ 27 -
the state sector was reduced to 67Z. BPD is negotiating with the Government
on a more comprehensive resolution of its arrears problem, based on detailed
analysis of individual loans (see para 3.16).
3.34      Earnings and capital base.  As noted above, the overhang on BPD's
deposits relative to lending has increased since 1986, as lending dropped
from 702 of deposits in 1986 to 572 in 1987. However, the increased interest
rates introduced in 1987 more than compensated for potential earnings loases
because of the increased average spread over borrowing rates. This effect
has been reduced however from 1988, when CCADR started borrowing from BPD at
a lower rate than BPD would lend directly to the agricultural sector. (See
para 3.36). Despite the higher expected net income, BPD's capital base, at
about 2.32 of total liabilities, needs to be strengthened.
3.35      Future role.  At present, BPD is trying to define its possible
future role in Mozambique's evolving financial sector. BPD would like to
offer a full range of development banking services, as allowed in its
charter, lending more to indistry and the service sectors, with a significant
role in financing long term investment, as well as possible equity financing.
BPD has also established a small but apparently successful microenterprise
credit program with the Ebert Foundation which has disbursed about US$1.2
million to 60 units, largely agro-processing in rural areas (see para 2.48).
Under the IDA Urban Rehabilitation Project BPD is also responsible for
managing credit to small and micro-enterprises in the building materials
industry.
3.36      Caixa de Credito Agrario e Desenvolvimento Rural (CCADR).
The agricultural credit fund, CCADR, was established in 1988 as a mechanism
to channel credit to the rural sector.   It is managed on behalf of the
Government by BPD.  It started operations in the second quarter of 1988,
lending Mt 5.6 billion in 1988, mainly to agriculture and industrial
processing activities. The CCADR provides subsidised credit (at a current
interest rate of 62). Significant growth of the fund would not be consistent
with rationalization of the financial sector. Its principal rationale is to
channel donor finance to contractually agreed uses, and it is a fund rather
than a bank insofar as it does not intermediate private or commercial
deposits. Provided that CCADR retains a small share of the market, and
involves a transparent form of subsidy financed by resources outside the
banking system, it should not in principle adversely affect the financial
reform program.
Banco Standard Totta de Mocambique (BSTM)
3.37      Branch structure. BSTM is the only private bank remaining in the
country. The number of branches has declined, however, from 44 before
independence to 7 today. The bank's ownership is made up as follows:
Standard Chartered UK, 302; Standard RSA, 52; Totta e Acores Portugal,
302; Fonsecas e Burney Portugal, 102; Anglo American RSA, 52, and others
201. BSTM lost its foreign exchange license after the restructuring of the
banking sector at independence, which contributed significantly to the
decline in the bank's operations.  However, in 1988 BM granted BSTM a lUn'ted
foreign exchange license, for personal transactions, and BSTH is planning to
open two new branches in 1989.   This is a positive development, which



- 28 -
complements the increased share of lending by BSTM. Assurances have been
received from the Government that an action program for the extension of
competition would be undertaken (see para 3.09). In addition capitalization
and arrears targets will be required (see par& 3.16). BSTM can be expected
to continue to rehabilitate traditional commercial banking activities in the
future, and has recently started discounting bills.
BSTH Financial Situation
3.38      Liquidity. Although it has operated on a much smaller scale than
the other two banks, BSTM has had the same type of deposit overhang as BPD,
with 1986 deposits totalling Mt 7.6 billion while its loan portfolio amounted
to Mt 3.8 billion (Annexes 3.10 and 3.13).   By August 1988, portfolio
totalled Mt 6.7 billion vhile deposits reached Mt 18 billion ( Mt 11.7
billion according to BM figures for Sept 1988). Almost all lending has been
short-term, to urban commercial enterprises. For a number of reasons,
including portfolio arrears, deposit overhang, and the fact that BSTM
deposits at the Central Bank are not remunerated, BSTM is not currently
paying interest on current accounts nor accepting time deposits.
3.39      Arrears.  BSTM also suffers from a serious arrears situation, with
close to Mt 1.8 billion (about 40X) of portfolio classified as doubtful in
1988, most of which stems from the period just after independence. Again,
however, this amount is dwindling quite rapidly as a proportion of total
portfolio. BSTM has constituted provisions against some of its bad loans,
and adds to them each year.   However, BSTM's capital base of 1.1  of
liabilities is inadequate and declining in relation to the increase in
nominal value of assets. Once BSTM has defined capital adequacy requirements,
BSTM's shareholders would be expected to inject new equity into the bank.
TV- Financial Sector: Summary and Conclusions
3.40      Mozambique's financial sector is underdeveloped and not on a sound
financial footing at present, with serious arreaL-s and toe small a capital
base. However, a good start has been made in the complex transition from a
centrally planned environment to a market economy. The separation of BEWs two
banking functions is inevitably quite a lengthy process, and could probably
not be speeded up significantly since the principal binding constraint is
management time.   Timely provision of the institutional support already
planned under other IDA projects in Mozambique will also be important.
Interest rate reform has maintained progress and positive real interest rates
should be achieved in 1990 given the current decline in inflatic.n and
increase in nominal rates. The arrears situation is being addressed
progressively by the Government. The banks' capital base is an area that
will perhaps take longer to address, in BM's case because a final evaluation
of the needs can only be made when the two functions are fully separate in
accounting terms; in addition, the shortage of Government resources may delay
equity increases for BM (Com.ercial) and BPD -- assuming that they are both
to remain fully state-owned.



- 29 -
3.41      In the meantime, the policy measures that DM has taken have
involved cautious but sustained steps towards revival of commercial banking.
In addition, the financial sector is reflecting the changes in the real
economy, with the recent shifts in the sectoral distribution of credit, as
well as an increasing share of lending being channelled through the other
financial institutions. These are all strong indicators both of BM's intent
to continue liberalizing the system and of the syst3m's basic capacity to
adapt to the changing environment.
The Role of the Small and Medium Enterprise Develoment Prolect in the
Financial Reform Stratea
3.42      The Project is designed to support the Government's strategy for
financial sector reform. The proposed apex line of credit would be a
multibank instrument which would assist in the extension of competition, and
reintroduction of longer term investment lending and appraisal skills. Under
the Project a series of formal action programs would be prepared and
implemented, for the separation of the commercial and central banking
functions of EM, the clearance of lending arrears and financial restructuring
of the commercial banks, the introduction of performance guidelines, the
continued extension of competition within the banking s ctor, and the
upgrading of the accounting capabilities of the commercial banks. The Project
therefore focuses particularly on the micro aspects of banking system reform,
while also addressing issues such as institutional change. Under an annual
project implementation review interest rates will also be monitored. Finally,
the Project addresses the real economy issues of improving the efficiency of
industry through lending to viable enterprises, and fills a supply gap in
medium-to long-term credit during the continuing financial reform process.
The Demand for Industrial Credit
3.43      The market for longer term indurtrial credit is difficult to assess
because of the disruption on both the supply and demand side over the past
few years.   Supply of longer term credit has, as discussed above, been
constrained by a series of interlinked problems, including interest rate
repression, contraction in banking capacity, shortage of foreign exchange,
and emphasis on short-term lending and financing of enterprise deficits on
Government instruction. More recently, domestic credit ceilings have also
been imposed, partly in order to reduce or eliminate bank financing of
enterprise deficits. Supply conditions have started to improve with interest
rate reform, institutional reorganization and reactivation of the private
sector.   On the demand side, credit requirement projections cannot be
meaningfully based on past trends because of the disruption of lending. In
order to gain an initial estimate of likely financing requirements, a credit
survey was carried out as part of the preparation of the project,
3.44      The industrial credit survey was designed to obtain some indicative
information about the appropriate size of the proposed lending program. A
total of 200 questionnaires were di.stributed by the Government to
enterprises, and 120 responses were received. A summary analysis of the
results is given in Annex 3.14. The survey has a number of limitations,
notably the fact that estimated financing requirements of a number of firms



- 30 -
were highly tentative, and also because it could not be ascertained a priori
whether the enterprises responding would qualify for loans on profitability
or economic efficiency grounds, especially given the uncertainty of demand.
Finally, it should 'Js noted that demand for foreign exchange does not
necessarily imply a need for credit as such. However, given the depreciated
value of metical savings balances, a requirement for long-term credit is
likely to account for the bulk of stated foreign exchange needs for equipment
and inventories. The results of the survey may be regarded as a starting
point.
3.45      The total estimated requirement for 119 enterprises was US$61
million, excluding a single proposal of US$10 million for one enterprise. 75
enterprises were at national level (roughly above 50 workers), and 44 at
local level (below 50 workers) of which all were in the Maputo area. Total
requirement at larger scale (excluding the largest proposal), was US$55
million, and at small scale was US$6.0 million. Average loan size for the
larger scale group was US$822,000, of which US$420,000 was for fixed and
US$402,000 for working capital. For the smaller scale group average loan size
was US$127,000, of which US$78,000 was for fixed and US$49,000 for working
capital.
3.46      Direct extrapolation of the sample of 75 national level enterprises
for the sector as a whole (580 enterprises) is inadvisable due to the degree
of uncertainty of the sample estimate. If it is assumed that 25Z of the
sample estimate of $55 million were economically viable enterprises, then
extrapolation would lead to a total requirement of about US$110 million for
fixed and working capital. Given the time period needed to implement major
replacements,or new investments, the phasing of such a requirement would
probably be realistically over a three year period. Extrapolating from the
44 local enterprises to the national estimate of about 600 enterprises in the
size range 10 to 50 workers is even more hazardous since the sample is
considerably less representative. A lower bound estimate of US$20 million is
probably a conservative starting point for smaller enterprises. The target
group for the present project (enterprises of up to about 200 workers)
consists of approximately 502 of the total requirement in the larger scale
group of enterprises surveyed and the whole requirement of the smaller scale
group, amounting to approximately US$75 million over about a three year
period, at an average investment of about US$ 250,000. At an average subloan
size of $250,000, the total number of subloans under the proposed IDA Credit
would be about 110.
3.47      The scale of the proposed IDA enterprise Financing Component
(US$28.5 million equivalent) may be regarded as conservative in relation to
the requirements estimated through the survey. There is clearly a pent up
demand for credit in the industrial sector, although it cannot be
ascertained, a priori, whether this is from viable and bankable applicants.
Under the SHE Project viability would be established prior to the granting
of any loans to enterprises.

IV. THE PROJECT.
Project Objectives
4.01      The aims of this project are as followst
l
X                     (a)  to promote the development of the industrial  sector by
providing medium to long-term foreign exchange financing
focussing on notentially efficient small to medium-scale
enterprises in the industrial, mining, agricultural-related,
transport, construction, and other commercial subsectors,
capable of efficient operation within the reformed business
environment.
(b) to promote institution rebuilding by restoring the capability
of the public and private sector financial institutions of the
country, and to facilitate the development or rehabilitation
of an effective medium to long-term finaucing capability for
enterprises.
(c) to assist in the formulation of Government policy for
industrial and financial development with emphasis on small
and medium enterprises.
The Role of IDA and The Rationale for Assistance
4.02      General IDA involvement In Mozambique. Eleven credits have been
made to Mozambique up to November 1989, including both general balance of
payments assistance and project related investment credits. The principal
macroeconomic support has been through three rehabilitation credits which
have been designed to support economic policy changes in particular relating
to  pricing  and  exchange  rates,  and  to  decontrol  of  production  and
distribution. The objective of sector investment credits has been to support
supply responses in directly productive activities, to take advantage of
improvements in the macroeconomic environment, and to support rehabilitation
of social and economic infrastructure. The present project would complement
the existing IDA assistance strategy, and the Government's Economic
Rehabilitation Program (ERP), by strengthening the industry and finance
sectors tiarough the finance of potentially efficient industrial enterprises
and by strengthening the financial institutions.
4.03      IDA's role in the Industry and finance sector. Since the start of
the ERP in January 1987 external assistance to the industrial sector has
concentrated on balance of payments support to finance recurrent imports of
materials and spares for a range of consumer and intermediate goods, notably
food products, textiles and tires, and also for technical assistance.  Under
the First Rehabilitation Credit (1610-MOZ) US$37 million went mainly to light
industries, and approximately  US$25 million has so far been allocated to
industry under the Second Rehabilitation Credit (1841-MOZ). The result of
these inputs has been to assist industrial production to increase by 6-72 in
1987, the first increase after six years of rapid decline in output. However,
this type of assistance does not address the longer term issues of the
viability and structure of the industrial sector as a whole, nor the creation



- 32 -
of an environment in which efficient industries are encouraged to expand. It
is this need which is addressed through the present project. In addition IDA
is considering a credit under the proposed Industrial Enterprise
Restructuring Project, which will focus on selected larger scale enterprises.
4.04      Restructuring the financial system is of particular importance for
industry. The banking sector has contracted significantly and is currently
unable to perform adequately the functions of mobilizing savings and
intermediating credit. The banks need strengthening in order to effectively
provide medium to long ter-m loans for industrial investment. Given the series
of measures for financial reform already taken by the Government, and
outlined in Chapter 3, and the clear resolve of the Government to revitalize
the sector as central planning is phased out, this is an opportune time to
assist in maintaining the momentum of revival, and at the same time
strengthen portfolios, ensuring that the banks develop the capability for
prudent investment lending. The project would fill a supply gap in medium-
to long-term financing within the ongoing reform process.
Proiect Concept
4.05      Efficient allocation of medium to long-term credit requires lending
based on assessments of profitability, both in financial and in economic
terms, as well as the reestablishment of conventional banking criteria.
Economic analysis is important given the changing but still protected
industrial environment, and continuing need to adjust relative prices.
4.06      The Project focuses on the small and medium enterprise sector; this
is defined approximately as including enterprises with less than 200 workers.
The importance of the sector is reflected in the fact that small and medium-
scale industrial enterprises, as defined, currently account for a significant
proportion (46Z) of industrial employment. The Credit is directed to a wide
range of subsectors, with a focus on manufacturing, but with the expectation
that subprojects will also materialize in subsectors such as mining,
agribusiness, construction (including building materials), transportation,
distribution and commercial services. A directed credit of this type is
justified by its relatively broad focus, and by the likelihood that sources
of indigenous entrepreneurship, skill formation and growth would originate
across the broad spectrum of efficient smaller enterprises. Moreover, given
the large number of enterprises within the sector, there is a need to create
an effective decentralized institutional framework to appraise and finance
project proposals. The microenterprise sector (under 10 workers) has
exhibited particular resilience to the economic difficulties of the country
and it is intended that the Credit would be available for enterprises at this
scale as well as those in the formal economy.
4.07      The proposed lending operation is a means of rehabilitating the
financial system by reintroducing the techniques and criteria for term
lending, so that investment funds reach enterprises which are likely to have
relatively favorable long-term prospects, and bank lending portfolios can
begin to be strengthened. In order to achieve its objectives the Project
focusses on the environment for efficient industrial investment and bank
lending.

Proiect Description
4.08      The Project is divided into two main components:  (i) an enterprise
financing component (EFC), and (ii) an institutional strengthening component.
The EFC consists of a line of credit to be onlent through the banking system.
The institutional strengthening component consists ofs   (a)  technical
assistance;  and  (b) training, the latter two components being designed to
upgrade the lending capability and financial management of the banks and the
industrial promotional infrastructure. The proposed IDA Credit would be made
available by the Government to BM through a Subsidiary Administration
Agreement. Formalization of the Subsidiary Administration Agreement, under
terms and conditions approved by IDA, would be a condition of Credit
effectiveness.
The Enterprise Financing Component
4.09      The EFC would involve a line of credit to finance fixed asset
investment, associated incremental permanent working capital and project
preparation services. The EFC would be managed by an apex unit (Unidade de
Gestao de Projecto -- UGP) within the central banking area of BM, established
with its own operating policies and procedures.   Funds would be onlent
through the participating financial intermediaries (PFIs), which are expected
to comprise all three commercial banks. 13/
4.10      Approximately US$28.5 million of the IDA funds would be made
available through the Subsidiary Administration Agreement to finance the EFC.
In addition, cofinancing of US$7.5 million has been proposed by other donors.
The PFIs and Government are expected to contribute about USS  million in
complementary financing in local currency, with a further minimum
US$5 million equivalent expected as equity participation from enterprises.
It is expected that the line of credit would be committed within a four to
five year period after Credit effectiveness.   There would be no pre-
established allocation of credit funds between the PFIs, although it is
likely that the commercial area of BM would account for the largest share due
to its predominance in the finan-ial system. The foreign exchange risk would
be borne by the Bank of Mozambique on behalf of the Government, while the
commercial risk would be borne by the PFIs.   The finance of eligible
enterprises would be on the basis of prior apprais&.L.
4.11      The UGP would be responsible for the management and supervision of
the EFC, and would review the aporaisals and would have to approve subloan
applications above the free limit granted to the PFIs. It would also morLitor
subproject eligibility, terms and conditions of onlending, approval limits,
select'ic. criteria and procurement, and be responsible for disbursements,
munitoring and reporting, and other issues.
13/ The role of the Central Bank in the channelling of funds is addressed
in paragraph 5.01.



- 34 -
Technical Assistance and Training
4.12      The technical assistance  will consist of:  (a) the provision of
expertise to assist in the implementation and operation of the line of
credit,    (b) assistance  in the strengthening of banking capacity and
industrial policy formulation; (c) strengthening of the Instituto Nacional
da Desenvolvimento de Industria Local (IDIL) and (d) subproject preparation.
Technical assistance for policy analysis has also been provided through the
Business Environment Study, funded by UNDP.
4.13      The proposed assistance to DM would take the form of the provision
of an adviser to the apex unit and a provision for consultancy assistance to
address problems connected with the upgrading of the accounts of the
participating banks, and the development of the financial sector. Assistance
to IDIL would be in the form of the provision of two advisers to establish
a small business advisory service in Maputo and Beira. A further provision
is for subproject preparation and appraisal services, and for required
studies of banking and industrial development issues.
4.14      The training program for credit and project analysts began in
February 1989 and is due to be completed prior to the effectiveness of the
Credit; it is financed by UNDP. It consists of a series of seminars and
workshops, designed to provide required analytical skills in project
appraisal for about 50 members of staff of the BM and PFIs, and some
additional participants from IDIL and the Ministry of Industry. The program
is designed to upgrade the skills required to operate the credit line as well
as more general bank lending skills. Additional IDA funding is proposed for
follow up training after the completion of the program.
The Demand for Credit
4.15      Projections of past bank lending as indicators of credit demand are
not meaningful because of the virtual halt in investment lending over the
past few years, and the abandonment of normal bank lending criteria. A credit
survey of 120 responding enterprises is reported on in paragraph 3.44 and
following. A preliminary indication of the scale of financing that might be
required for the sector as a whole, including both fixed and working capital,
on the basis of survey and other estimates, is at least US$130 million from
potentially economically viable enterprises. The proposed Credit would meet
part of this need.
4.16       The proposed total IDA Credit is expected to be onlent at an
average rate of about US$5 million per annum, which would amount to
approximately 1OZ of total 1988 domestic disbursements by the banking system
to the economy 14/.
14/ At the exchange rate of Mt 813 - US$1.00.



_ 35 -
Project Costs and Fimaucina Plan
4.17      Project costs and financing are presented in Table 4.1 and in
Annex 4.01.  Total project cost is estimated at about US$50.2 million
equivalent of which US$39.5 million would be in foreign exchange. The IDA
j          component of U$ 32 million would therefore finance about 641 of the total.
4.18      The Project cost breakdown has a number of implications. First of
all, the contribution of the participating banks is expected to be relatively
small; this reflects a relatively low share of the financial costs of
investments in local currency in the case of rehabilitation projects where
infrastructure and civil works are already in place. Secondly, a minimum
assumption is made that 10 of the subproject's financing requirements will
be met through local equity investment. The main contribution of the
Government is in terms of a share of operating costs of the apex unit,
support to the training program, administrative support to the IDIL advisers,
and some equity type participation, based on existing assets.

Given the apparent substantial unrealized demand for credit by industry.
discussions are taking place with other possible sources of cofinancing,
which may be included during project implementation.   The terms of the
onlending of external funds would be as detailed for the IDA Credit in
Chapter 5, according to prevailing interest rates for term lending, and
commercial bank spreads of a proportion of the onlending interest rate. The
review and development of cofinancing activity would be addressed in the
annual project implementation review (see para 10.03(e).

V. ANALYSIS OF THE ENTERPRISE FINANCING COMPONENT.
The EnterDrise Financing Component and its Rationale
5.01      The enterprise financing component (EFC) would be administered by
the Central Bank, under a Subsidiary Administration Agreement between the
Government and the Central Bank, through an apex unit (Unidade de Gestao de
Projecto - UGP). The apex unit has been formally established within the BM
(Zentral)  in order to permit it to operate independently of the other
functions of BM (Central), with a specific statement of operating policies
and procedures and a participation agreement with the commercial banks (see
Annexes 5.01 to 5.04).   It is expected that this would help to prevent
possible conflicts of interest in the approval of loans and the management
of the credit in general. In this respect it should be noted that the UGP
would be independent of the regulatory and control functions of the central
bank, and that all credit risk would be borne by the commercial banks.
Therefore the UGP would not interfere with the process of separation of the
central vis a vis commercial banking. The credit would be channelled through
participating fV'ancial intermediaries (PFIs) to the final beneficiary (FB)
enterprises. It is intended that all three commercial banks (viz: the
commercial banking area of BM, the BPD, and BSTM) would operate as PFIs. The
line of credit would finance medium to long-term lending for fixed asset
investment and associated incremurntal permanent working capital needs through
subloans made by the commercial banks and refinanced up to 90Z by the Central
Bank.
5.02      The need for the financing component derives from the aim of
rehabilitating the financial system. As stated in chapter 3, almost all non-
agricultural lending is short-term and principally for working capital
purposes, and a series of factors have constrained supply, related to the
institutional structure and interest rates. What long-term lending exists
is generally linked to assistance from foreign donors (recipient firms are
now expected to pay over a period of time the local currency cost of donor
inputs, including both technical assistance and equipment).  Provision is
made under the prevailing interest rate structure for longer term lending by
commercial banks but longer term lending has largely ceased, inter-alia
because the premium of long-term over short-term rates does not adequately
offset the perceived additional risk to the banks. The commercial banks are
also financed primarily, and increasingly, by sight deposits, further
discouraging longer term lending. The Project would fill a gap in the supply
of medium-to long-term financing during the period of financial reform.
5.03      The proposed apex line of credit for long-term investment lending
would be a new type of financial instrument for Mozambique. It would
introduce a structure (apex unit and channelling mechanivm) that can be used
as a general financing instrument for future IDA or other external lines of
credit through the central bank, in addition to its immediate role in the
revival of long term investment lending. The principal advantage of an apex
operation lies in its ability to involve the banking sector as a whole in the
proposed project, including the private bank which has been marginalised over
the past few years, with resulting broad-based improvement in appraisal
capability and portfolio quality.



_ 38 -
The Apez Unit CUGP) and Institutional arranmente
5.04      The enterprise financing component would be channelled through the
(UGP) in BM (Central) , vith funds being onlent through the PPIs. The UGP has
been set up as a unit within the International Relations Department under the
central banking function of BM.
5.05      In addition to its manager who has been appointed,  the staff of
the UGP would consist of two senior level project analysts, at least one of
whom would have an accounting background, two administrative officers, and
support staff. The Central Bank and UGP are receiving assistance from an
expatriate technical advisor in setting up the line of credit mechanism and
in the operations of the UGP for a total of 36 months, initially financed
under a PPF. The project analysts to staff the UGP may be selected in part
on the basis of achievement under the training programs (para. 6.09). The
UGP would be fully staffed, with an adviser, two project analysts, two
administrative officers and support staff, and operational, as a condition
of Credit effectiveness.
5.06       i project steering committee (Comissao Interdepartamental -CI) has
been set -.p to oversee the implementation of the project. The CI would be
chaired   B 3M (Central), and membership would comprise Ministries of Finance,
IndustrJ and Energy, Commerce and Trade, and the National Planning
Commission, plus, at BM's discretion representatives of other relevant
subsector Ministries, PFIs, and the private sector (e.g. the Chamber of
Commerce). Once the proposed project becomes effective, CI members would be
kept informed on a regular basis as to progress of operations under the line
of credit and the project as a whole, and would organize formal meetings as
required (see Annex 5.05).
5.07      The UGP would receive a spread of 0.5Z per annum on the outstanding
value of subloans to cover its administrative expenses.   While expenses
during the start-up period may exceed initial receipts, revenues when the
proposed project is underway should compensate for this (see Annex 5.06).
The principal functions of the UGP would be to:
(i)    ensure adherence of PFIs to established procedures in
selecting eligible subprojects and ensure application of
appropriate standards for subloan appraisals;
(ii)   review the eligibility and authorize financing under the
line of credit for subprojects submitted by PFIs, subject
to IDA approval where appropriate. For subloans of up to
US$100,000 equivalent, the UGP would only ensure that the
requests meet the eligibility criteria (paras 5.23 and 5.24)
and would give its clearance, confirming the rediscount
request, within ten working days of submission. For subloans
between US$100,000 and US$250,000 equivalent, the UGP would,
within ten working days, review the requests in more detail,
make any comments on the quality of the appraisal to the
PFI, and ensure that the eligibility criteria were met. For
subloans above US$250,000 equivalent, the UGP would



- 39 -
undertake the above steps prior to submitting the subproject
to IDA for approval;
(iii) through the CI, facilitate issuance of import licenses for
enterprises receiving subloans (see para 5.19).
(iv)   administer the Special Account (para. 7.02), ensuring proper
disbursement of funds, and supervise and centralize the
collection and forwarding of supporting documentation;
(v)    monitor the PFIs' compliance with their various obligations
under the Project (para. 5.08);
(vi)   supervise, on a sample basis, SME subprojects;
(vii) ensure liaison between IDA and the PFIs on matters relating
to SME subprojects, and maintain records required for
supervision and project completion reports by IDA (see
Annex 5.07).
(viii) act as Secretary to the CI (project steering committee).
A model form of agreement is at Annex 5.01.
Participating Financial Intermediaries
5.08      All three commercial banks operating in Mozambique will be eligible
to participate as financial intermediaries under the proposed project,
providing the commercial bank has entered into a participation agreement with
the Central Bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.   This
agreement would, inter alia, specify that the PFIs shouldt
(i)    designate qualified staff to manage the loans financed by
the proposed project;
(ii)   perform  satisfactory  subproject  appraisals  and  submit
required appraisal reports to the UGP;
(iii) ensure that resources are used by the final borrowers for
the purposes intended and that procurement procedures
acceptable to IDA are followed;
(iv)   supervise subprojects according to required schedules and
provide the UGP with periodic reports on the status of
subprojects;
(v)    adhere to terms of lending and repayment of loans; and
(vi) provide the UGP and IDA with such information as they may
reasonably request.

5.09      Receipt by IDA of satisfactory signed and authorized participation
agreements between the Central Bank and at least two commercial banks would
be a condition of Credit effectiveness. Receipt by IDA of a satisfactory
model subloan agreement between each participating bank and beneficiary
enterprises would be a condition of first disbursement by each particpating
bank.
5.10      BM will be acting in both its capacities, namely as the Central
Bank and as the leading commercial bank, with no legal separation of the two
functions.  While work is underway to achieve a clear separation between
these functions, BM does not expect that a full separation of accounts would
be available before 1992. However, the new accounting framework, which has
been introduced, will enable BM to distinguish between central and commercial
banking roles for any given operation (see para 3.22).
5.11      It is expected that all three commercial banks would participate
under the EFC of the proposed project, although it is likely that the
commercial bank'rig area of BR will account for the largest share of
operations, reflecting its general predominance.
Operating Mechanism and Credit Hanagement Process
5.12      The IDA Credit would be made to BM (Central), acting as the
Government's agent, which would onlend funds under the line of credit to the
PFIs in local currency, which in turn would onlend it to beneficiary SMEs.
The foreign exchange risk would be borne by EM (Central) on behalf of
Government. A residual spread, estimated to average around 'II at current
interest rates, would be retained by the Government through Bh .o cover the
costs of administering the line of credit through the apex unit and to offset
the foreign exchange risk.
5.13      The interest rate to beneficiary SMEs would be in line with the
currently prevailing interest rate structure in Mozambique, and would be
variable with changes in thi' structure (paras 3.07 and Annex 3.01 detail the
existing rate structure). 'he present interest rate structure has been
established by the Government according to a Despacho of September 1989.
This structure is in accordance with a program agreed between the Government
and the IMF in which the level of interest rates will evolve so that they
become positive in real terms by 1990. The revised interest rate structure
introduced in January 1989 raised lending rates for terms over one year to
between 22Z and 342 (and 22-352 in September 1989), and was also considerably
simplified.   To the extent that these areas may cease to be coveredc by
agreements with the DMF, assurances were received that an annual proiect
implementation review by the Government and IDA would take place, in order
to review onlending terms and cenditions, and progress on the achievement of
positive weighted average real onlending interest rates.
5.14      The PFIs would pay interest on funds onlent by the Central Bank
such that they would receive a spread of a percentage of the onlending
interest rate which would be higher for longer maturity subloans with
maturities over 7 years. The onlending interest rate would be based on the
rate determined jointly by the Ministry of Finance and BM.   The spread
formula has been determined as a result of consultations within the banking



- 41 -
system, and is based on current bank'ng conditions. It reflects the
relatively high administrative costs of such projects, and the need to ensure
that the spreads are realistic by comparison to those on other funds in
Mozambique at the present time.   The perceived risk on lending,  and
especially on medium to long-term lending for investment purposes, is
currently high.   Provisionally, BM (Central) has proposed that it would
retain a 73Z 3f the final onlending rate for subloans of up to a seven year
term, and 651 for subloans of more than a seven year term; this is
approximately equivalent at current rates to a spread range of 7 to 9? (see
Annex 5.01).
5.15      Funds under the line of credit would be onlent to the PFIs in local
currency, with tte same maturities as the individual subloans to final
beneficiaries. Subloan terms to beneficiaries wouid range from a minimum of
three to a maximum of twelve years, inclusive of grace periods of one to four
years. The Central Bank may subsequently relend repaid amounts to PFIs for
similar purposes in line with the objectives of the project, through its
rediscounting mechanism, for a period of up to 20 years from the date of
Credit effectiveness.
5.16      Subloans granted under the line of credit could finance up to 90Z
of the total project cost for rehabilitation/extension subprojects and up to
80Z for subprojects carried out by tLew enterprises to limit the debt to
equity ratio of new projects.   Thus, entrepreneurs would be required to
finance a minimum of 102 and 202 of subproject costs for existing and new
firms respectively. However, in exceptional cases, and only if the relevant
PFI agrees, the 20? minimum participation for new projects could be
temporarily reduced to 10 at the beginning of a project if all generated
profits are applied to reach 20X as quickly as possible.
5.17      Subloan processing under the line of credit would be coordinated
by the UGP, which would serve as the principal link between IDA, the PFIs and
the beneficiaries of the proposed project's enterprise financing component.
The UGP would send subprojects for approval to IDA, according to the laid
down approval criteria (see para 5.24).
5.18      Initial preparation of subprojects will be undertaken by potential
beneficia.y firms, which may seek assistance from IDIL or private consultants
if necessary, and presented to the PFI of the firms' choice. The PFIs would
review the subprojects in accordance with their own loan analysis procedures
and with operating requirements defined under the EFC (Annexes 5.01 to 5.03).
PFIs would then prepare for submission to the UGP an appraisal report
according to a standard format, which would vary in depth and detail
depending on the size and nature of subprojects.  The report would cover
relevant information about the enterprise and the proposed investment,
including its technical soundness, financial viability, economic efficiency
and managerial capacity.    The report would also set down loan security
requirements. Financial rate of return (FRR) calculatioDs would be required
for all subloans, on the basis of cash flow analysis, with balance sheet
analysis also required for subloans above US$100,000 equivalent. An economic
rate of return (ERR) calculation would also be required for subloans above
US$250,000 equivalent.



- 42 -
5.19      The UGP would review the appraisal reports to verify that all
eligibility conditions are adequately met. This review would be carried out
through a checklist of these conditions, which would be supplemented for
subprojects above the PFIs' free limit by a more thorough process to review
the viability of the firm and the subproject (Annex 5.03). If the subproject
is eligible for financing and viable, the UGP would authorize (subject to
prior IDA approval for the largest subprojects) the corresponding rediscount.
With a view to accelerating subproject implementation, it was agreed that,
through the CI, the issuance of import licences to enterprises receiving
subloans for imported goods would be facilitated y the Ministry of Commerce
and Trade, and a supplemental letter to that effect would be included.
5.20      Mozambique's foreign exchange position is expected to move towards
equilibrium and to permit phased liberalization, inter alia, through
extension of the system introduced under the IDA Third Rehabilitation
Credit 15/. However, there is a likelihood of foreign exchange bottlenecks
which could cause problems for enterprises which require replenishment of
imported supplies beyond the period allowed for working capital under the
credit (maximum one year). These bottlenecks may occur as a result of the
transitional excess demand for foreign exchange and the segmented nature of
the foreign exchange market. Consequently, it was agreed that a supplemental
letter would be included confirming that, for subprojects financed under the
line of credit, the Government would facilitate allocation of foreign
exchange for imported inventory replenishment.
5.21      Because this is the first project of its kind in Mozambique, the
first three subprojects from each PFI, as well as the first three subprojects
requiring UGP approval, would be subject to prior IDA review and approval.
Thereafter, with the exception of subprojects over US$250,000 equivalent,
which would require prior IDA approval, IDA would review a sample of
subprojects on an ex-post basis during supervision missions.
5.22      PFIs would be responsible for making supervision visits to SMEs
receiving Project funds, for maintaining adequate records to monitor the
evolution of subprojects, and for reporting to the UGP on the progress of
each subproject and the status of the corresponding subloan.   For this
purpose, trar -portation equipment is provided for under the technical
assistance subcomponent of the Credit. Supervision reports, ir. a standard
format prescribed by the UGP, would be required from the PFIs at least twice
a year until the loans are repaid. These supervision responsibilities of the
PFIs are specified in the Participating Agreement which the PFIs would sign
with the Central Bank (see Annex 5.01 for the draft agreement). In addition,
the UGP would conduct its own selective supervision of SME subprojects in
order to monitor the performance of intermediaries' supervision activities.
15/ This is the 'system for non-administered allocation of foreign
exchange' which currently covers about 5Z of imports but is expected to be
expanded.



- 43 -
Subproiect Eligibility and Selection Criteria
5.23      Beneficiary SMEs would be enterprises with up to 200 employees that
are legally constituted in Mozambique according to local regulations and
procedures.  However, subprojects with a high expected rate of return and
meeting the objectives of the proposed Project, in the case of enterprises
of over 200 employees, may be considered on a case-by-case basis. No more
than 25Z of overall funds available under the EFC are available to such 'high
merit' larger enterprises. Subsectors eligible for financing would include
agribusiness, mining and quarrying, all manufacturing and processing.
construction, transport and commercial services. Given the increasingly
important role of microenterprises (detailed in Chapter 2) there would be no
required lower limit to the scale of enterprises eligible for financing under
the Credit. The line of credit would finance fixed assets and associated
incremental  permanent  working  capital  and  consultants'  costs.  for
rehabilitations, extensioaw and new operations.
5.24      In order to receive financing under the line of credit,  the
following aspects of each subproject would ),ave to prove satisfactory:
(i)    subloans for any subproject for a nesi or existing enterprise
should not exceed US$1.0 million equivalent;
(ii)   for all subprojects, technical viability, including market
analysis, would be required as well as an opinion on the
managerial capacity of the firm, and an assessment of any
significant adverse environmental impact or hazard;
(iii)  for all subloans, cash flow analysis on an incremental basis
would be required, leading to a financial internal rate of
return (FRR) calculation with a 12 percent real rate of
return hurdle; in addition, summary cash flow analysis would
be required for the firm as a whole, to ensure its overall
viability and ability to service its debt;
(iv)   for  subloans  above US$100,000  equivalent,  current  and
projected balance sheets and income statements would also
be required, along with financial ratio analyses, including
liquidity, debt service coverage, leverage, and earnings
ratios.
(v)   for subloans above US$250,000 equivalent, economic analysis
would also be required including an economic internal rate
of return (ERR) analysis with a 12 percent hurdle.
(vi)   for all enterprises financed, an overall equity/asset ratio
of 25Z for the total company would normally be desirable.
But equity asset ratios of a minimum IOZ will be acceptable.
Where, in an otherwise viable enterprise applying for a sub
loan, financial ratios are unsatisfactory due to the effects
of debt accumulated as a result of price and distribution
controls prior to 1987, the UGP would require the PFI to



- 44 -
submit a satisfactory financial restructuring plan before
approving a subloan.
Accounting. Auditing and Reportu
5.25      The UGP would maintain separate accounts for each part of the
proposed project. These accounts, including the Special Account, would be
audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and the audit
reports would be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of
each fiscal year, including an opinion regarding the adequacy of supporting
documentation for disbursement of IDA Credit funds based on statements of
expenditure. Subproject supervision reports would be prepared by the PFIs
on a quarterly basis during implementation, and twice yearly thereafter until
the subloan has been fully paid off. These would be submitted to the UGP.
5.26      The UGP would submit to IDA quarterly reports on the status of the
portfolio, transactions relating to the Special Account, collections of PFI
subloans, and pipeline of PFI subloan applications. It would submit semi-
annual reports on its overall financial situation and operations. The UGP
is also responsible for coordinating the data required for supervision
reports and project completion report by IDA (see Annex 5.07).  Monthly
submissions for replenishment of the Special Account are discussed in
paragraph 7.02.
5.27      BM,  through  the UGP,  would be  responsible  for coordinating
provision of audited financial statements of the PF1's, submitted not later
than nine months after the end of the relevant fiscal year, to be considered
at the proposed annual project implementation reviews (see para. 5.13).
VI. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRWNING PROGRAM.
Technical Assistance
6.01      The objective of the technical assistance input iss  (a) to improve
the effectiveness of the credit operation; (b) to upgrade bank accounting
capability; and (c) to establish generalizable skills in investment lending
and industrial consultancy assietance. In order to achieve this, technical
assistance is proposed to BM and participating financial institutions, and
to the Instituto Nacional da Desenvolvimento de Industria Local (IDIL).
6.02      Technical assistance to the banking system would consist oft  (a)
the provision of an adviser and operating support for the apex unit; (b) the
provision of consultancy/advisory assistance for the participating banks in
order to upgrade financial statements to international auditing standards,
and to carry out studies of the banking system required by the Government;
and; (c) continued training of loan officers and credit analysts. Associated
office and transportation equipment would also be provided. The UGP advisory
post is proposed to be of up to 36 months duration, and its initial financing
has been covered through a Project Preparation Facility.   The adviser-
designate also participated in the appraisal mission for the Project, and the
Government has been closely involved in preparations.



- 45 -
6.03      The terms of reference for the proposed UGP adviser are at Annex
6.01. The main function of the adviser is to assist in the establishment and
initial operations of the apex unit. This vili involve advice on staffing,
setting up a work program, finaliting operating procedures, and preparing
documentation, including the implementation of memoranda of agreement betveen
BM and the participating banks. The initial work program of the unit will
include inter alia establishing the operational procedures for monitoring of
the credit operation, supervising appraisal standards, maintaining approval
limits and advising on approvals, referring to the IDA proposals above the
threshold for local approvals, and liaising with the interdepartmental
steering committee on lending policy.
6.04      The terms of reference for consultancy assistance for the upgrading
of the accounts of the PPIs are at Annex 6.02. The objective will be to
upgrade the financial statements of the PFIs so that they meet international
auditing standards, suitable for submission to IDA. Under the Project, a
supplemental letter would be included confirming that the BM (Central) would
carry out a review of the PFIs' accounting capabilities and would prepare an
action program, by March 31, 1991, for their strengthening, to be implemented
promptly thereafter.   In addition, draft terms of reference for possible
consultancy assistance for the restructuring and recapitalization of the
banking system are at Annex 6.02.
6.05      The terms of reference for advisory assistance to the IDIL are at
Annex 6.03. The objective of this input is to set up a capability within IDIL
for providing business advice to enterprises, especially in financial
management and project preparation for bank financing. A small business
advisory unit of two advisors would initially focus on assisting enterprises
to make proposals for financing under the line of credit, in order to
increase the effectiveness of the lending operation. Later the work program
would be broadened to include a wider range of business consultancy. The
advisory unit would need to emphasize training and skill transfer to local
professional staff of IDIL. Office and transportation equipment would also
be provided.
6.06      The small business advisory service woild be set up in Maputo and
Beira, at IDIL delegation offices. The location for this pilot scheme is
justified by the fact that these two towns account for well over 502 of
industrial employment and output (see Chapter 2). However, future expansion
of the scheme could incorporate other centers. Each adviser would have two
local counterparts, and the duration of the advisory post would be for 18
months. Charges would be made for advisory services which could be financed
through the eventual subloan, if granted. A revenue projection has been made
by IDIL based on fee income from preparation of loan applications and general
advice. From a market survey of the existing private consultancies in Maputo
IDIL considered that a fee of 1.52 of the value of successful loan
applications would be appropriate. For other work a range of other fees is
to be charged. An updated terms of reference and income/expenditure statement
for the proposed unit is set out at Annex 6.04, based on IDIL's own
estimates.
6.07      After the first year the service is expected to be able to cover
its local costs, including training, but not the costs of foreign advisers.



- 46 -
This assumes the ability to handle over 200 separate items of assistance, of
varying degrees of complexity, in year three, with eight consultants. (After
the departure of the advisers it is intended that a further four local
consultants would be recruited, making a total of eight in Maputo and Beira).
If revenue is only 502 of the assumed amount, it would cover about two thirds
of costs. If training is covered from other sources then the service would
cover its costs at 50? of projected revenue.   There is thus some safety
margin for the revenue projections.
6.08      The Business Environment Study, with funding by UNDP of US$0.12
million, which is a component of the overall technical assistance, has been
completed and sent to the Government. Its purpose is to provide initial
industrial policy recommendations on a broad range of areas, including the
foreign exchange regime, trade tariffs, the fiscal system, industrial
efficiency and methods of industrial finance and enterprise restructuring.
A follow up study is also under way which will make recommendations for the
development of the legal regulatory system for the enterprise sector. This
study will provids policy support to the IDA lending program for industry,
and an additional I-)A provision of US$0.24 million is included for followup-
studies relating to the industry and f4nance sectors.   The progress of
industrial policy reform will be a4.ressed in the annual proiject
implementation review, based on the recommendation of the Business
Environment Study.
The TraininR Program
6.09      The training program started in February lS39. It consists of a
series of two principal six week courses and a further three workshops
lasting for two weeks. These are phased to be comp'eted prior to the date of
effectiveness of the credit. The objective of the program is to develop
capability within the banks to carry out project appraisals and to process
subprojects under the credit. This is an essential component of an effective
lending operation in view of the lack of experience in medium to long-term
lending to enterprises.
6.10      A total of about 50 staff of the participating banks, and some
representatives from the Ministry of Industry, and IDIL attended the first
courses and evaluation comments were positive. The program is funded by UNDP
to the extent of US$0.38 million, which includes training, office equipment
(including computers) and a vehicle. The first part of the program was
pitched at:  (a) an elementary; and   (b) a more advanced level, and covered
financial, technical, market, and economic analysis, and bank lending
practice; computer based models for project appraisal at differing levels of
sophistication, conforming with the proposed approval mechanism of the line
of credit are being developed. The second phase of training started on June
19, 1989.
6.11      An additional IDA provision of US$0.1 million is included under the
Project for followup training assistance after the conclusion of the current
program. In addition, cofinancing of further training through the UNDP and
other sources will be discussed

VII. DISBURSEMEN. PRCREMENT AD IMPLEMENTATION
Disbursement
7.01      A Project Preparation Facility advance of US$250,000 was approved
by IDA on January 26, 1989. This provided financing for (a) hiring of an
adviser to the UGP (apex unit); (b) provision of consultancy services to the
banking system; and (c) equipment.
7.02      The  disbursement  schedule  for  the  IDA  Credit  is  given  in
Annex 7.01, and disbursement arrangements are shown in Annex 7.02.   The
Central Bank would serve as disbursement and collection agent for the
refinancing granted to the PFIs.   To expedite disbursements under the
proposed line of credit, a Special Account would be established in a
commercial bank satisfactory to IDA and managed by the UGP. IDA would make
an initial deposit of US$2.5 million, representing about four months of
disbursement requirements.  Applications for replenishment of the Special
Account, accompanied by appropriate supporting documents including reconciled
bank statements, would be submitted on a regular monthly basis.
7.03      Withdrawal applications would be submitted with full supporting
documentation, except for payments against contracts with a total value of
less than US$100,000 for which reimbursement could be claimed on the basis
of statements of expenditure (SOEs). Documents in support of SOEs would be
retained by the UGP, and would be available to IDA for inspection during
supervision missions.
7.04      Funds under the line of credit would finance 10O? of foreign
expenditures of directly imported goods and 70? of the local expenditures.
It would finance up to 100? of civil and engineering works undertaken as part
of an investment project, and 1002 of expenditures for consultants' services
and training costs. Other costs, including any taxes and tariffs imposed on
imports, would be financed either by the entrepreneur or the PFIs under their
domestic credit ceiling.
7.05      The final date for submission of subloan proposals for IDA's
approval would be December 31, 1995. The expected project completion date
would be June 30, 1996, and the closing date for disbursements would be
December 31, 1996, in accordance with the expected disbursement profile.
However, faster disbursement of the line of credit component seems quite
possible.   Subject to annual review, IDA would disburse for expenditures
incurred up to 90 days prior to the approval of the subproject by IDA, or
receipt by IDA of the information required in the case of a free-limit
subproject.



- 48 -
Procurement
7.06      Under a line of credit project intermediated through the banking
system regular commercial procurement by private enterprises is usually
regarded as efficient and economic. However, since this is the first such
project in Mozambique procedures for procurement of goods and services
purchased with credit funds under the Project would be specified in each
subproject proposal appraised by PFIs, according to IDA's procurement
guidelines. Aggregate amounts under each type of procurement are not known
a priori for subprojects. For items over US$100,000 and below US$500,000, at
least three quotations would be obtained, using the method of International
and Local Shopping (ILS) or Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). Any projects
involving a civil works component would require LCB with public bid opening
for contracts of between $100,000 and $500,000. International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) would be required on contracts of above $500,000. For items of
below $100,000, PFIs would assure themselves that sub-borrowers had canvassed
the main sources of supply and had chosen appropriately.   PFI appraisals
would, inter alia, cover the procurement procedures used, and PFIs would
maintain records of the procurement process during subproject implementation.
The UGP would be responsible for ensuring that the PFIs comply with these
guidelines. The procurement arrangements are shown in Annex 7.03.
VHIL SPECIAL ISSUES
The Role of Women in Industry
8.01      During the appraisal of the Project efforts were made to identify
special issues affecting women in Mozambique, in relation to such matters as
opportunity for industrial jobs and training, access to credit, and
property/enterprise ownership, Under the constitution of the People's
Republic of Mozambique, the rights of women are explicitly safeguarded in a
number of areas. Article 7 states "Work is the right and duty of every
citizen of either sex, and it is the criterion for the distribution of
national wealth.' Article 17 states 'The emancipation of women is one of the
state's essential tasks. In the People's Republic of Mozambique women and men
have equal rights and duties, this equality extending to the political,
economic, social and cultural spheres.' Article 26 states; many acts aimed
at jeopardizing social harmony, or creating divisions based on color, sex,
ethnic origin, place of birth, level of education, social position or
occupation are punishable by law.' Further safeguards of a similar nature
are in Articles 29 and 30. The Organization of Mozambican Women (OMW) is
relatively strong and well supported.
8.02      In a recent employment survey (1989) of Maputo Province it was
found that literacy (ability to read), although very low overall, was higher
for women than for men.   Nevertheless,  only 22Z of the active female
population was employed compared to 73Z of men, with a high concentration in
commerce, including distributive trades and in self-employment, while the
open unemployment rate (defined as those actively seeking work) was 21Z for
women compared to 7.6Z among men.



- 49 -
8.03      Credit under this project would be available for workshoplmicro
scale enterprises (as well as larger enterprises), such as cereal and oil
milling and other food processing, garment manufacture, pottery and ceramics,
in which women are likely to be active. Under the onlending appraisal
criteria the focus will be on financial and economic viability and managerial
competence, without any prior stipulation concerning gender or nitionality
(provided that an applicant firm is registered according to Mozambique law).
No legal barriers exist to the set up of enterprises by women.   Female
representation in governing assemblies is modest but not insignificant.
Environmental Considerations
8.04      This Project is designed to finance smaller enterprises across a
range  of  industries.   Within  the  industrial   sector  environmental
considerations are important; this applies to for example industries which
(a) extract natural resources (e.g. timber);  (b) cause particular pollution
problems (e.g. paper, chemical products, cement); (c) create special hazards
for workers (e.g. coal mining, chemical products, hot processing of metal);
or (d) create risks for consumers (e.g. processed foods). Mozambique is
fortunate in having natural resources which would continue to support without
difficulty significant increases in population, particularly in the North.
However, the South is more vulnerable due to higher population density and
more fragile drought prone soils. Similarly in the South deforestation has
reduced over 40Z of woodland to scrub. This is largely the result of demand
for fuelwood, which increased significantly as a result of the Government's
relaxation of controls in 1981 in an attempt to switch away from imported
kerosene and LPG. (The IDA Urban Household Energy Project is designed to
introduce  fuel  efficient  household  stoves  using  coal,  accelerate
electrification of urban households and introduce other fuels).
8.05      Data are not available, but in terms of international experience
the large majority of economy-wide timber usage would be for fuel, and a
small minority for furniture and other timber products. It is likely that the
timber demand from small scale furniture and wood products manufacturing
enterprises would not involve a significant impact on resources, given the
underdeveloped state of industry in general. For this reason type b) problems
may also not be very important. In the case of type c) and d) some protection
is given under current Mozambican law on safety at work and through public
health regulations regarding food processing. However, in order to address
possible environmental hazards, appraisals of subprojects, in industries
specified under the IDA Environmental Directive, would be checked for
environmental effects, in particular pollution and nonrenewable resource
consumption, and that supervision of subprojects financed under the Credit
would provide for the monitoring of these issues.
DL PROJECT BENEFfTS AD RISIS
9.01      Economic benefits under the proposed project would arise from the
startup and expansion of productive enterprises which are efficient earners
or savers of foreign exchange, capable of economic provision of substantive
employment and income benefits. In addition benefits would flow from
improvements in financial infrastructure. This would include in particular



- 50 -
the strengthening of bank portfolios, the upgrading of bank staff capability
in project appraisal and monitoring, and the reorganization of the bank
system as a whole.   It is expected that 100 to 120 enterprises would be
financed under the IDA Enterprise Financing Component. Rehabilitation of
these enterprises would be expected to provide or secure productive
employment for about 6,000 workers, and increase the supply of goods and
services.
9.02      All subprojects would go through an appraisal process (including
environmental assessment), and those requiring subloans of more than
US$250,000 would receive an economic appraisal.  The hurdle rate proposed
would be 122 economic rate of return, while all enterprises would be expected
to earn a financial rate of return in real terms of 122. Thus the financing
component of the Credit would earn a rate of return of over 122.
9.03      The main areas of risk include:  (a) implementation delays due to
delays  in reorganization of the banks,  the lack of long term lending
experience of the banks, (to be addressed through technical assistance and
training), and unresolved financial problems of enterprises; and (b) slowdown
of ELP reforms due to social or political pressures; however, the commitment
shown by Government suggests that the latter risks are manageable; thirdly,
(c) deterioration of the security situation, which could adversely effect
industry; this problem is however under control in the most likely urban
locations for subprojects, and small-scale producers tend to be less
vulnerable to disruption of sales and supplies.
K. RECOMMENDATIONS AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTADINGS
TO BE. REACHE.
Conditions of Credit Effectiveness
10.01     Before the Credit is declared effective the Government woulds
(a)    enter into a Subsidiary Administration Agreement with BM
(Central) under terms and conditions approved by IDA (para.
4.08);
(b)    finalize  the  staffing  of  the UGP  and make  it  fully
operational (para. 5.05); and
(c)    provide to IDA the signed and authorised participation
agreements between at least two PFIs and BM (Central) (para.
5.09).
Conditions for Disbursement
10.02     (a)    Before first disbursement by each PFI, provide to IDA a
satisfactory model sub-loan agreement between the PFI and
beneficiary enterprises (para. 5.09); and



- 51 -
(b)    Before disbursement under each sub-loan ensure that -he sub-
loan has been made in accordance with the procedures, terms
and conditions agreed with the Association.
Assurances Received from the Government
10.03     During the implementation of the Project the Government would:
(a)    through BM (Central), carry out no later than March 31,
1991,  an  action program to  strengthen  the  accounting
capabilities of the PFIs. to be implemented during project
execution; (para. 6.04 and supplemental letter);
(b)    make available to IDA for its approval a phased program, by
June 30, 1991, for the separation of the central and
commercial banking functions of BM, leading to its prompt
implementation thereafter (para 3.22);
(c)    based on agreements between BM (Central) and the commercial
banks, including BM (Commercial), (i) formulate an action
program, by December 31, 1991, to settle lending arrears of
the commercial banks; and (ii) by June 30, 1992, formulate
an action program for the rehabilitation of the banking
system, including a plan for its recapitalization and the
setting of performance benchmarks (para. 3.16) and a program
for the continued extension of competition in the banking
sector (para 3.09), for prompt implementation;
(d)    through the CI, facilitate the issuance of import licenses
to enterprises receiving subloans, and, through BM (Central)
facilitate  the  allocation  of  foreign  exchange  for
replenishment of imported inventories by subprojects; (paras
5.19 and 5.20, and supplemental letter);
(e)    through BM, carry out an annual project implementation
review with IDA starting not later than March 31, 1991 to:
(i) monitor progress made in achieving project objectives;
(ii) review progress on the implementation of the action
programs for settling lending arrears, restructuring, and
extension of competition within the banking sector (para
3.16); (iii) review progress on achieving positive (weighted
average) real onlending interest rates, their terms and
conditions (para 5.13); (iv) at the first annual review,
consider proposals for industrial policy reform, based on
the Business Environment Study (para 6.08); (v) review
audited financial statements of the PFIs, which would be
submitted not more than nine months after the end of the
relevant fiscal year (para 5.27), and; (vi) review and
develop the ongoing cofinancing of the Project (para. 4.19).
10.04     Subject to the above assurances and conditions the Project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$32.0 million to the Government of
Mozambique.

SMALL AID HIDIlDI RHTEPRISE D8VkLOPNENT PROJECT
PROPOSAL FOR TEE FINm NCiAL REUA ILITAflON OP  D'S L)A  PORTFOLIO
(Extracts from BPD Document)
General situation.
BPD is concerned, as always, with safeguarding present and future
returns on the financial resources it administers. Its starting point for
this purpose will be the introduction of changes in the treatment of doubtful
debts, and legal recognition, whenever necessary, of the liability borne by
government organizations and indebted enterprises.   These are important
stages in the necessary process of collection.
The negative growth that has occurred over recent years has been
combined with increased borrowing by enterprises from the financial system.
particularly BPD.   Debts as of December 31, 1987 totalled 36.3 million
contos, of which 33.3 million contos had fallen due. Of the 36.3 million
conto debt, 20.7Z had been incurred before the country achieved independence,
and this, including annual interest, currently amounts to 10.0 million
contos.
As regards debts arising -.er the country's independence, it
should be noted that certain enterprises were terminated and/or reorganized
on a different scale. gowever, their debts were not redistributed among
the new enterprises, and no agency was appointed or legally identified as
responsible for settling such debts. In this context, BPD's main concern is
not with the total volume of these debts (trends in which over recent years
have not paralleled changes in the levels of deposits received by the Bank),
but with the following issues:
-    identification of the organizations or agencies responsible for
making payments on existing debts, particularly those incurred by
the following types of enterprises
(a) those that have been terminated or divided up;
(b) those that are in deficit and/or are not economically viable;
(c) those that have been absorbed by other enterprises or
organizations;
-    negotiation and preparation of a plan for the  repayment  of
liabilities owed to the Bank.

1.1       Agriculture
As a result of government action, the agricultural properties
established under the colonial system were restructured and turned into
government-owned enterprises (and some into cooperatives), becoming larger
economic units. In order to ensure that the plan was executed in accordance
with the new forms of agricultural property, the Bank was called upon to
finance  the new  economic  units.   However, the  government  sector of
agriculture, which was to be viewed as the main producer of the food
surpluses that were absolutely necessary for strengthening industrialization,
met with serious setbacks, so that almost all its enterprises developed
deficits and/or became unviable.
These issues have been discussed in the various reports that have
been duly presented, and explain why the debt of the government sector of
agriculture stood at 23.8 million contos as of December 31, 1987, of which
23.1/million contos was outstanding.
It should be emphasized that the development strategy that has now
been prepared was never intended to bring about the enterprises' economic and
financial recovery; it was because the financing provided for government
enterprises by the Bank had been approved by their supervisory agencies, and
had been guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance, that the !:ank continued to
maintain these debts.
The survey of borrowers showed the following breakdown of debts
for this sector:
-    Enterprises with debts that                 19.6 million contos
cannot be restructured
(a)  terminated                              0.7 million contos
(b) divided up and/or
absorbed into others                    7.1 million contos
tc) other (including those that are
not viable and whose deficits
have been assumed by OGE)              11.8 million contos
-    Enterprises with debts that can
be restructured                              4.0 million contos
-    Other enterprises (not in need
of debt restructuring)                       0.2 million contos

hillE 3.12
Page 3 of S
It should be noted that the 28.8 million cc.tos in debts does not
include the amounts owed by private landowners whose assets were absorbed
into government-owned economic units, the total being 0.2 million contos
(which cannot be restructured).
1.2        ItadustrZ
The sector's debts as of 1987 totaled 1.8 million contos, of which
1.7/million were owed by textile enterprises (Texmanta, Riopele, Texmoque and
Textil do POngue. These enterprises faced (and still face) serious economic
and financial problems, with the following consequences:
-    Riopele T&xtil was paralyzed because of a lack of raw
materials, particularly thread and fiber for the manufacture
of textiles, having recommenced production only a few months
ago.
-    Texmolue continues to be semiparalyzed, because of the lack
of any power supply.
-    Texmanta has not yet started up.
The efforts made by a number of managers and workers to change
the unfavorable trends affecting their enterprises have made it possible to
consider restructuring this sector's debts.
Conclusions
The loan portfolio has been adversely affected by the countrys
economic circumstances. This situation is aggravated by unfavorable trends
affecting the Bank's financial inflows and by the lack of opportunities for
it to apply its excess liquidity to lending, so as to offset these losses.
It is thus clear that there is an overwhelming and urgent need to reverse
this trend.  The following essential measures must be adopted in order to
solve the problem:
-    Debts incurred in the following areas, and that cannot be
restructured, must be included in the annual government
budgets:
(a)  the government sector of agriculture
(plus the debts of private individuals
whose assets have been transferred to
the State)                              19.8 million contos
(b)  rental housing                           4.1 million contos

Ic)  public sector                            8.6 million contos
-    Inclusion of the following amounts in the
debts of individuals and enterprises
whose debts can be restructured:
(a)  enterprises and small-scale
entrepreneurs                            1.7 million contos
(b)  enterprises and small-scale
private farmers                          4.2 million contos
-    Inclusion in the Bank's annual budgets,
through the creation and application of
any revenue that the institution may
generate, as lending risk                0.4 million contos
As a result of the physical inventory of contractual interest
rates applicable to debtors (both enterprises and individuals), a weighted
average rate of 8.182 per year was obtained. Consequently, the interest rate
for restructuring the Bank's internal debts has been set at 8? per year, and
this is also applicable to the approval periods that are to be negotiated or
have already been agreed.
It should be mentioned, in passing and by way of conclusion, that
79.0? of the total debt cannot be rescheduled, while 4.2Z consists of 'good
credit."

(b) financing guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance;
(c) the nationalization of property belonging to the followings
- individuals who left the country after the proclamation of
national independence (i.e. laud and means of production);
- individuals and enterprises, whether Mozambican or not, whose
activities were incompatible with the principles established
by the Government (i.e. income-producing real estate);
- that a period of 15 years and an annual interest rate of 8Z
should be established as a maximum period for the State to
settle completely those amounts for which, according to this
report, it should assume responsibility.
Settlement of the remaining amounts of loans that can be
rescheduled has already been guaranteed by the debtor enterprises, in
accordance with agreements already signed and resulting from negotiations
carried out by BPD over the last few months.
