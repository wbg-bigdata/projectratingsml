MEMORANDUM AND RECOHMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CWEDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOXAMBIQUE
FOR A SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to Mozambique for SDP. 25.1 million (US$32 million.
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help to finance a Small
and Medium Enterprise Development Project. Parallel cofinancing for the
project has been provided by UNDP and provisionally confirmed by the European
Investment Bank. Discussions with other agencies are also ongoing. The
principal implementing agencies would be the Bank of Mozambique and the
Ministry of Industry and Energy, and beneficiary enterprises.
2.        Backaround.    After independence in 1975 Mozambique's industry
encountered serious problems through: (a) the departure of many enterprise
owners and almost all skilled manpower which obliged the new Govermnent to
take control of over 300 enterprises, many neglected and with debt arrears;
(b) the adverse security situation after 1980, which led to a severe drop in
export earnings and an acute scarcity of foreign exchange for imports of
industrial inputs;  and   (c) control of exchange rates, interest rates,
product prices, production and distribution under the central plan. These
factors resulted in currency overvaluation and major domestic market
distortions and the build up of the fiscal deficit and external debt. As a
result, 1986 industrial output fell to about 45? of that of 1980, with
widespread disinvestment and excess capacity. The banks faced parallel
problems: (a) interest rates were fixed at negative real levels; (b) term
lending ceased, with a loss in appraisal capability; (c) the sole private
bank's share of lending fell to 3? by 1986, while the state-controlled Bank
of Mozambique (BM) built up an 80? lending share, in addition to attempting
to fulfill its responsibilities as Central Bank; and (d) financing of
enterprise losses led to serious loan arrears, and solvency problems. Short-
term stability was possible due to high liquidity and high spreads over cost
of funds. Enterprises of below 10 workers were particularly successful in
adapting to adverse economic conditions, and the overall recorded share of
the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including micro-enterprises, rose
from 25Z to over 30? of industrial output between 1973 and 1587.
3.        Government's obiectives and strategy.  Since 1987 the Government
has been addressing the economic distortions ard structural constraints
through a comprehensive Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP). Government
objectives for industry under the ERP are: (a) to rehabilitate directly a
selected group of larger scale enterprises; ard (b) to create a supportive
environment for development and rehabilitation of SMEs, requiring restoration
of the banks' capacity to mobilize deposits and conduct appraisal based
lending. The SME project focusses on objective (b), while a parallel project,
the Industrial Enterprise Restructuring Project, addresses (a). The enhanced
role proposed for the SME sector is justified because of its resilience,
dynamism, and potential for development of e trepreneurship. Under the ERP,
Government strategy for industry has incl. led:  (a) currency devaluation
(which has reduced real wages), and opening up of foreign exchange
allocation; (b) price and distribution decontrol; (c) investment promotion
through foreign and domestic investment codes, an exchange retention scheme,



- 2 -
and corporate tax and tariff reforms; and   (d) increased private sector
participation, management autonomy and accountability. Out of approximately
300 enterprises initially intervened by the Government during 1975-77, about
140 have been returned to private interests, especially at the small-scale
level. A UNDP-financed, Bank-executed, Business Environment Study made a
series of recommendations for the design of fiscal and monetary incentives
for industry with special emphasis on SHEs, industrial efficiency, and the
development of industrial finance. The report endorsed the general direction
of policy reform in the sector as it is currently being implemented.
4.        In the banking sector a parallel reform process is under way to
rehabilitate the banks as vehicles for efficient mobilization of savings and
investment. Government strategy has includedt (a) increasing nominal interest
rates to positive real levels in 1990, with rationalization of the rate
structure; (b) curtailment of lending for enterprise deficits; (c) expanding
the role of the private sector bank and smaller state bank, with increase in
their lending share (from 25Z to 502 during 1988). The role of BM, as Central
Bank, will be clarified by the separation of the accounts and staffing of its
commercial and central banking functions. Portfolios are being strengthened
with the curtailment of enterprise deficit funding and Government assumption
of responsibility for certain noncollectible loans. A credit survey carried
out for IDA shows significant unrealized demand for term lending for fixed
investment by SMEs. Future banking reform will need to focus on: (a) further
clearance of lending arrears and recapitalization of the banking system;
and, (b) use of appraisal based lending to strengthen loan portfolios.
Despite the obvious weakness of both the industry and the financial sector
the recent indications are that a genuine policy turnaround has been
achieved. The strengthening of this process is now essential.
5.        Rationale for IDA involvement. The ERP has been supported by three
IDA Rehabilitation Credits which have supplied significant assistance to
industry, as well as by considerable bilateral and multilateral assistance.
Industrial sector support mainly through short-term commodity aid has been
provided by Sweden, UK, Italy and other bilateral agencies, and by the
African Development Bank. The rationale for the SME Development Project is
to build on these and IDA's sector advisory work, and to support the policy
developments already under way in industry and banking at a strategic stage
in the reform process. A multi-bank credit line will assist the banking
system as a whole to recover from its weak position, and will provide a lead
in addressing the longer term issue of increasing investment through bank
lending to viable enterprises. IDA support for SHE will also provide a
framework through which bilateral donor support could be coordinated.
6.        Project objectives . The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to promote the rehabilitation and development of the SME sector by
financing small and medium enterprises capable of efficient operation within
the reformed business environment; (b) to promote institution rebuilding by
restoring the capacity of the public and private sector banks to deliver and
manage term credit to SMEs; and (c) to assist in the formulation of
Government policy for SME development.



- 3 -
7.        Pro3ect description. The project has an SME financing and an
institutional strengthening component. Under the financing component a line
of credit would be made available through a subsidiary administration
agreement between the Government and BM (Central), for onlending to BM
(Commercial), the state controlled Banco Popular de Desenvolvimento, and the
private Banco Standard Totta. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by BM
(Central)  on behalf of Government,   with credit risk absorbed through
appropriate spreads by the commercial banks. The line of credit will be
supervised by an apex unit in BM (Central) overseen by a Government
interdepartmental committee. Subject to meeting eligibility and efficienc-
(including environmental) criteria, subproject loans will be available for
fixed investment and incremental permanent working capital. In order to
ensure satisfactory project implementation, an annual review of project
issues, including onlending interest roete and terms, would take place.
8.        Under the institutional strengthening component a training program
funded by UNDP is already under way and will be completed prior to the
implementation of the project.  This will  train about  50 banking and
promotional staff in loan appraisal and loan processing, with IDA funding for
follow up training. Technical assistance will also be provided through BM for
the start-up and operation of the apex unit and the credit mechanism, for
strengthening of accounting capabilities in the participating banks, and for
studies to assist the restructuring of the banking and industrial sectors.
The project would also support the Instituto Nacional da Desenvolvimento de
Industria Local to set up a small business advisory service, part of whose
role would be to help prepare loan applications under the line of credit.
9.        Total project costs are estimated at US$50.2 million equivalent,
of which US$39.5 million (792) is in foreign currency. The project cost and
financing plan is at Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement details are
at Schedule B. The timetable of key project processing events and status of
Bank Group operations in Mozambique are at Schedules C and D.  The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7987-MOZ is attached.
10.       Status of cofinancing.   Parallel cofinancing of ECU6.0 million
(about US$7.0 million equivalent) has been proposed by the European
Investment Bank, who attended negotiations as observers and will negotiate
separately with the Government. UNDP has provided training and consultant
funding of US$0.5 million. There is no financing gap; however, in view of the
level of unrealized demand for industrial credit, further financing may be
justified, and indications are that additional cofinancing may be available,
both for enterprise investment and technical assistance.
11.       Actions agreed.  The Government will be expected to carry out the
following actions: (a) before the Credit is declared effective, enter into
a Subsidiary Administration Agreement with BM; finalize the staffing of the
apex unit and make it fully operational; finalize and provide to IDA the
participation agreements between at least two commercial banks and BM
(Central); and (b) before first disbursement by each PFI, provide to IDA for
review the model subloan agreement between each PFI and beneficiary
enterprises.



- 4 -
12.       During the Implementation of the project the Government would,
through BM, prepare, not later than March 31, 1991, an action program to
strengthen the accounting capabilities of the PF1s, and a phased program for
the separation of the central and commercial banking functions of BM, by June
30, 1991, to be implemented promptly thereafter. With regard to the
rehabilitation of the banks, the Government would formulate action prograr-
as follows: (a) by December 3', 1991, to settle lending arrears of t.
commercial banks, including BK CCommercial); and, (b) by June 30, 1992, for
the financial restructuring of the banking system, and for extension of
competition in the banking sector. The Government has agreed to facilitate
provision of foreign exchange for replenishment of imported inputs and
provision of licences for imports by subprojects. The Government would also
hold annual project implementation reviews with IDA, inter alia. tot (a)
monitor progress made in achieving project objectives: (b) review progress
in the implementation of the above action programst (c) review onlendir.g
terms and conditions and progress on achieving positive real lending interest
rates (in accordance with Government's program to achieve positive rates by
1990); and, (d) review the audited financial statements of the PFIs. The
first implementation review would consider proposals for continuing
industrial policy reform, based on the Business Environment Study, and on the
action program for upgrading the accounting capabilities of the PFls.
13.      Benefits and risks.  Significant economic benefits are expected to
arise from the start-up and rehabilitation of SMEs that are efficient earners
or savers of foreign exchange, and capable of providing increased employment
and income. The small enterprise sector is expected to provide relatively
good  prospects   for  the  development  of  indigenous   resources  and
entrepreneurship. In addition benefits will flow from strengthening of the
banking system. All enterprises financed will be appraised; all subprojects
will require a minimum 12Z financial rate of return, and larger subprojects
will also require a 12Z economic rate of return. The main areas of risk
includes (a) implementation delays due to problems in bank reorganization,
the lack of credit experience of the banks themselves, and the need to
resolve enterprise financing problems, (to be mitigated through technical
assistance, and training in loan appraisal); (b) slowdown of price reforms
under the ERP due to social or political pressures; however the commitment
shown by Government suggests that these risks are not high; (c) possible
deterioration of the security situation; however because of their small
capacity and urban location, most SMEs are less vulnerable to security
related disruption of rural infrastructure, supplies and markets.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
