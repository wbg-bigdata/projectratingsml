                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would provide investment support and technical assistance for Albania. The objective of the investment is to extend the lifetime and improve the quality,
                         reliability, safety and efficiency of the bulk power transmission system by replacing ageing existing facilities with new ones. The technical assistance would serve to
                         facilitate project implementation, strengthen the Transmission System Operator, and improve both the tariff structure and the procurement procedures applicable to
                         electricity imports.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All 3 substations (Tirana, Fier and Elbasan 1) under the project's financing have been completed. Their successful operation significantly improves availability of these three critical
                         substations and increases thereliability and transmission transfer capacity of the Albanian power system.
