PANAMA
DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION LOAN
(Loan No. 39910-PAN)
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Debt and Debt
Service Reduction Loan to Panama, for which Loan No. 39910-PAN in the amount of
US$30 million was approved on March 28, 1996, and made effective on July 3, 1996.
The loan closing date was July 31, 1996. The single tranche was fully disbursed
on July 11, 1996.
The ICR was prepared by Richard L. Ground (LADCN), with the collaboration of
Jose Gonzalez and Ricardo Tejada (LACDN). The ICR was reviewed by Donna
Dowsett-Coirolo (Director, LADCN) and Ian Bannon (Lead Economist, LADCN).
The ICR is based on material in the Project File and on a report by Gary Kleiman
(Consultant), who visited Panama in January 1997 with Messrs. Ground and Gonzalez.
The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by furnishing data and reports to
Bank staff and consultants. The Borrower also contributed its own evaluation of the
project, which is included as Annex I of this document.






DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION LOAN
PANAMA
(Loan No. 39910-PAN)
Evaluation Summary
The Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) Loan to the Republic of Panama was
approved on March 28, 1996, and fully disbursed on July 11, 1996. The US$30 million loan
helped Panama finance the purchase of collateral required for the implementation of the DDSR
operation ("The 1995 Financing Plan") previously agreed with its commercial bank creditors, and
closed on July 17, 1996. The DDSR loan, together with funding from the IMF (US$29.7 million)
and IDB (US$30 million) financed about two-fifths of the closing costs of the DDSR operation.
The World Bank, the IMF and IDB also provided indirect financing support for the DDSR: the
World Bank and IDB, through the release of adjustment loan tranches, and the IMEF, through the
approval of SDR drawings under a Stand-by Arrangement.
Program Objectives and Design
Under the DDSR operation, almost all eligible commercial debt (US$4 billion), amounting
to 70% of Panama's total public and publicly guaranteed external debt, was restructured. Panama
exchanged about US$2 billion in principal debt for three new instruments, in accordance with the
terms of the 1995 Financing Plan. The discount bonds selected by creditors in exchange for their
existing claims reduced the debt stock, while the front-loaded interest reduction bonds (FLIRBs)
and the par bonds they selected reduced debt service. About 82% of the existing principal claims
were exchanged for FLIRBs; close to 14% for par bonds, and the remainder, for discount bonds.
The discount and par bonds are fully collateralized in respect of principal; interest on these
instruments is partially collateralized. Interest on the FLIRBs is partially collateralized; principal
is not collateralized. In addition, Panama regularized past due interest (PDI) of almost US$2
billion by making a down payment of about US$132 million, and issuing uncollateralized PDI
bonds to holders of eligible debt for about US$1,351 million at a market interest rate. The
remaining PDI was forgiven. One creditor, holding eligible debt of about US$29 million, and the
eligible interest thereon, did not participate in the 1995 Financing Plan.
The DDSR operation was expected to accelerate growth and reduce poverty, by: (i)
eliminating the debt overhang and the associated "tax" on future output, which acted as a
disincentive to reform efforts and private investment; (ii) sharply reducing market uncertainty over
Panama's ability and willingness to fully service its external debt, and the sizable distortions and
costs such uncertainty entails; and (iii) offsetting the adverse effect on the investment climate and
flows deriving from the disengagement of the U.S. from the Canal and former Canal Zone.
Substantially reduced market uncertainty was expected to translate into appreciable growth
benefits to Panama by lowering the sovereign risk premium and the spread between real domestic
and international interest rates, by restoring Panama's access to international capital markets on
competitive terms and maturities for both public and private sector borrowers, and by
encouraging direct foreign investment.



i.
Achievement of Objectives
Implementation of the DDSR operation achieved a debt reduction equivalent (DRE) of
30% of eligible commercial debt, compared to the average of 35% secured in previous DDSRs.
The total DRE (net of additional official financing) amounted to 18% of Panama's total public and
publicly guaranteed external debt, which is slightly higher than the average of previous DDSRs
(16%). Moreover, the total DRE amounted to 14% of Panama's GDP, or a proportion several
times the average in previous operations (5%), reflecting the heavy weight of commercial debt in
Panama's total debt, and the large debt overhang affecting the economy. This is why the operation
is so crucial to Panama's fiture growth prospects. In addition, the DDSR operation achieved
debt reduction at a substantially lower financial cost to Panama than an open market debt
operation with a like amount of debt reduction would have entailed. These savings were an
estimated US$778 million, or an amount equivalent to 9.1% of GDP. These savings were several
times greater than those garnered by other countries through DDSR operations (3% on average).
The Republic of Panama provided upfront enhancements of about US$220 million to
implement the DDSR operation. The operation generates financial savings of US$820 million in
net present value terms, or 9.5% of GDP, compared to a counterfactual involving a debt rollover
and full interest service. The internal rate of return over the stream of financial savings is 25%.
This is well above both the cost at which Panama could borrow the enhancement funds and the
critical level employed in the Bank's project lending. The costs to Panama of the operation may
turn out to be somewhat higher, depending on the outcome of the legal actions lodged against the
Republic of Panama in the United States by the creditor who did not participate in the 1995
Financing Plan.
In addition to these direct benefits, the operation is generating the expected large indirect
benefits. Indeed, in January 1997, the major international risk classification agencies assigned
Panama a sovereign credit rating of BB+, only slightly below investment grade (and only
surpassed by two other countries in Latin America), while Panamanian private corporate issuers
received an investment grade rating (putting them in the same category as their Chilean and
Colombian counterparts). One month later and merely seven months after closing the DDSR, the
Republic of Panama returned to the international capital market for the first time in a decade with
spectacular results: its 5-year bond issue was heavily oversubscribed (totaling US$500 million or
5.8% of GDP). Furthermore, the spread was merely 175 basis points over five-year U.S.
Treasury Bonds. By way of comparison, Colombia floated a ten-year US$750 million bond issue
one day after Panama's issue at 140 basis over the U.S. Treasury benchmark. The Government
utilized 80% of the proceeds from the bond issue to repurchase PDI bonds and FLIRBs, and
intends to use the rest for the same purpose. This operation secured an additional financial
savings to Panama on its debt service obligations of US$77 million in net present value terms
(equivalent to 0.9% of GDP).
As a result of the DDSR and the progress achieved by the Government in implementing its
economic reform program, the risk premium faced by Panama on long-term borrowings abroad
plunged some 950 basis points in the short space of fifteen months, from about 1200 basis points
when the 1995 Financing Plan was issued, to about 250 basis points in February 1997. Panama's



iii
risk premium is now only slightly higher than Colombia's, and the private sector recently has
borrowed funds on the international capital market at competitive rates. Such a turnaround in
such a short period of time is unprecedented. At the same time, both domestic bond and equity
markets enjoyed a watershed year in 1996 on bullish sentiment accompanying the debt agreement.
Volume on Panama's stock exchange almost doubled from end-1995 to end-1996, while the stock
price index climbed 25%, and the net asset value for the bellwether Panama Balanced Fund
subscribed by international investors was up 30%. On top of this, in a market that had been
entirely dominated by fixed income instruments, 1996 saw three initial public offerings that raised
the share of equity activity to over 5%. Moreover, during the first five months of 1997, the stock
price index climbed a further 21%.
Economic growth accelerated during the first quarter of 1997, reaching 3.6% with respect
to the first quarter of 1996, when growth was slightly negative. This upswing was spearheaded
by a rise of 38% in the value added in ports, the reactivation of construction, and renewed strong
growth in electricity generation following last year's drought. Growth for 1997 as a whole is
expected to surpass 4%, and accelerate further in subsequent years, in large part because private
investors are responding to the Government's reform program and enhanced credit standing with
large-scale investments in the restructuring of the Panamanian economy.
Risk and Sustainability
While the DDSR greatly improved Panama's capacity to service its debt, it could
potentially constrain Panama's latitude to adjust debt service to adverse external shocks in the
event such shocks were larger than the debt relief achieved, or to domestic policy shocks. More
particularly, it would raise the transactions costs of an eventual debt restructuring relative to one
in which loans were simply rescheduled, as in a Multi-year Resheduling Agreement (MYRA). In
effect, the DDSR agreement raised the relative share of debt held in bonds from about 8 to 62%.
The conversion of bank loans to bonds and additional lending by IFIs for DDSR raised the share
of relatively inflexible debt from about 19 to 85%. Nonetheless, the share of preferred creditors
in public debt service actually declined in 1996, to about 35% from 45% in 1995 (because Panama
was still accumulating arrears on commercial debt in 1995). On an accrual basis, the share of
preferred creditors is projected to remain below the Bank's guideline of 35% during the next
decade. Debt service to the Bank as a proportion of public debt service was about 11% in 1996,
and is projected to average about 10% during 1998-2000, and somewhat less thereafter. Debt
service to the Bank as a fraction of exports also is projected to be far below the Bank's guideline
over the course of the next decade (1.3% in 1996, and lower thereafter).
Reduced flexibility per se translates into greater risk in the event of adverse external
shocks or domestic policy shocks; however, DDSR also mitigated the vulnerability of the
economy to external shocks. First, it diminished the debt service burden and radically enhanced
creditworthiness. Second, it reduced the exposure of the economy to both interest rate risk--by
changing 53% of eligible debt into fixed-rate instruments, and to exchange rate risk--by
converting the 17% of eligible debt formerly denominated in non-U.S. currencies into US dollars.
Moreover, the DDSR operation provides Panama with options to adjust debt service to external
shocks. For instance, Panama could capitalize interest payments on PDI bonds exceeding an



iv
annual interest rate of 4% during the first six years after closing; or use interest collateral to pay
up to 12 months interest on the par and discount bonds, and up to 6 months interest on the
FLlRBs. In addition, current fiscal policies, coupled with the measures the Government is taking
to consolidate fiscal balance over the longer-term, are projected to generate nonfinancial public
sector surpluses greater than 1% of GDP by the year 2000. Such additional resources would
significantly increase the Government's capacity to absorb external shocks and to implement an
efficient debt management strategy.
The economy is more vulnerable to domestic policy shocks in a post-DDSR world, but the
risk of such shocks is considered slight. Panama's unique, nine decades-old dollar-based
monetary regime provides a stable anchor for the macroeconomic framework. Maintenance of
sound economic policies also would be encouraged by the up-front cost that Panama paid to
regain creditworthiness, and debt management strengthened as creditworthiness improves and the
cost of mismanagement increases. Indeed, DDSR serves as a powerful deterrent to policy
slippage. Moreover, the current Administration enjoys a solid majority in the Legislative
Assembly; has achieved major progress in implementing the lengthy reform agenda during its first
three years; and has launched a second round of policy reforms for implementation during its final
two years in office. Nonetheless, support for the reform program could erode in this dualistic
economy if investment in infrastructure and well-targeted social safety net programs were to lag,
and if the high unemployment rate does not begin to subside.
The Bank is working with the Government to minimize this risk though an investment
lending program focused on poverty reduction; by enhancing implementation of the recently
launched portfolio in the social sectors; and through ESW and policy dialogue. In addition, the
Bank has substantially advanced discussions with the Government on the preparation of a new
structural adjustment operation to back the implementation of a second generation of policy
reforms. The Bank would provide this support in concert with the IMF (which is preparing an
Extended Fund Facility) and the IDB (which recently approved a utilities' sector adjustment loan
and is preparing a financial sector adjustment operation).
Bank Performance
Panama's exceptionally successful DDSR operation could not have been concluded
without the support of the Bank, the IMF and IDB. The Bank's performance in coordinating
support, evaluating the project, and processing the DDSR Loan was highly satisfactory. The Bank
took six months, from the preparation of the Briefing Note for the Board, to Board approval of
the DDSR loan. The loan was disbursed three and one-half months after Board approval, and
closed one week later. The Bank spent a very modest amount (US$71,000 in direct costs) on the
preparation and supervision of a US$30 million loan which was indispensable for the restructuring
of almost US$4 billion of external debt, at a savings to Panama of 9% of its GDP and with
potential benefits of a similar magnitude.



v
Borrower Performance
The Government fielded a highly competent team to negotiate and carry out the DDSR
agreement. The Government team expertly handled all the complexities of the operation with
competence and diligence, and the 1995 Financing Plan achieved all its objectives. With
implementation of the accord and follow-up actions with the international credit-rating agencies
(also supported by the Bank) the Government successfully completed a well-designed strategy for
restoring the country's creditworthiness. This accomplishment, together with the substantial
progress simultaneously achieved in carrying out the other elements of its economic reform
program, is creating the conditions required to lift the growth of Panama's economy to its
potential.
Lessons Learned
The analysis of Panama's DDSR operation confirms lessons from previous DDSR
operations: (i) the success of the operation depends principally on the credibility of the country's
economic reform program; (ii) the concerted, menu-based approach to debt reduction provides
significant cost savings to the debtor country compared to market-based debt reduction; (iii)
creditor banks also improve their financial position; (iv) the inclusion of a new money option is
not essential for securing both full participation of creditors and substantial cost savings; and (v)
net benefits are higher when DDSR is backed financially by the International Financial
Institutions.






PART I: PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.    Distortions and Crisis. Over the past twenty-five years, the sharp segmentation of
Panama's economy by distortionary Government policies has kept output growth far below
potential. As state expenditure mounted relative to GDP and policy interventions proliferated,
domestic prices of importables and non-traded goods rose faster than international prices despite
the dollar-based monetary regime, most resources were channeled into rubrics in which the
economy possesses a comparative disadvantage; productive private investment was crowded out,
foreign investment flows dried up; and the competitiveness of international services was eroded.
Social services were expanded greatly, especially social security for public sector employees and
tertiary education, but unemployment soared and two-fifths of the population was pushed into
poverty despite Panama's relatively high per capita income, leaving the country with one of the
most unequal distributions of income in the hemisphere.
2.    The expansion of the state and inflated domestic absorption were financed by foreign
borrowing' in 1980, Panama had one of the largest per capita commercial bank debts in the world.
During the early 1980s, these distortions, together with the international debt crisis, plunged the
economy into recession. The economic downturn was exacerbated by the political crisis in the late
1980s and the imposition of external economic sanctions. The Government ceased to service its
commercial bank, bilateral and bonded debt in 1987, and fell into arrears with the IFIs in 1988. In
1988-89, the money supply plunged an estimated 30%, and economic activity contracted 16%.'
3.    Initiation of Adjustment and the Economic Recovery. During 1990-94, considerable
strides were made in reducing the large imbalances accumulated during 1987-89. Following
resolution of the political crisis, the removal of economic sanctions and implementation of an
adjustment program with the support of the IFIs (in the case of the Bank, through the 1992
Economic Recovery Loan, or ERL) rekindled confidence and resulted in repatriation of private
assets and large bilateral aid flows that remonetized the economy, and fueled private investment
and pent-up consumption demand. By 1994, per capita GDP surpassed the pre-1987 level and the
unemployment rate had been reduced by 6 percentage points from the 1990 peak; domestic
inflation was below international inflation; public finances were in balance; import coverage of
reserves had increased to almost 2 months; and the public and publicly-guaranteed external debt
had declined from 133% to 81% of GDP.
4.    Beginning in 1993, however, economic growth decelerated, falling to less than 3% by end-
1994; and unemployment was still very high (almost 14%). While the economic recovery
substantially strengthened public finances, the previous Administration did not implement the
policies required to consolidate fiscal balance over the longer term. Progress in carrying out other
key structural adjustment measures needed to achieve economic growth in line with Panama's
development potential and to adjust to sharply declining bilateral aid and gradual disengagement
of the U.S. from the former Canal Zone also was slight. In the absence of major structural

reforms, debt relief and restoration of creditworthiness, economic growth was expected to revert
to the 2.5% trend registered during the previous twenty years.
5.      External Debt.   Significant progress in normalizing relations with the international
financial community was achieved during this period (Table 1). In February 1992, the
Government cleared its arrears with the IFIs and the Paris Club. In May 1994, an agreement was
reached with external bondholders on arrears of about US$472 million. In April 1993, the
Government initiated negotiations with commercial banks on debt restructuring; however, the
parties were unable to reach a financially viable agreement prior to the May 1994 elections.

B. Program Objectives and Design
6.      Economic  Reform   Program. The  Administration  inaugurated  in  September  1994
launched a comprehensive economic reform program to accelerate economic growth and reduce
the high incidence of unemployment and poverty, with the support of Bank ESW, technical
assistance and adjustment lending.2 The program encompasses measures to: (i) consolidate long-
run fiscal sustainability; (ii) redress institutional imperfections and price distortions; and (iii)
normalize relations with external creditors.
7.      Over the past two years and nine months the Government has made considerable progress
in implementing its reform program. Long-term fiscal sustainablity and the scope for domestic
resource mobilization has been substantially enhanced, through elimination of the Complementary

2The Country Assistance Strategy was agreed with the new Government in December 1994, and discussed by the Board in
February 1995. The CAS proposed a high case lending program that could include a DDSR loan provided Panama
complied with the second tranche conditions of the ERL. (Country Assistance Strategy of the World Bank Group for the
Republic of Panama. Report No. 13846-PAN, December 28, 1994). Studies and technical assistance for the new
Govermnent's economic reforn program included Panama: A Dual Economy in Transition. op.cit.; La Universalizacion
de los Incentivos Impositivos, Panama, March 1995 (Mimeo.); Proteccion Efectiva de los Productos Agropecuarios v su

The Government's reform program also was supported through the ERL, the Closing Date of which was extended from

and water underway). Efficiency also has been fostered by trade, tax and labor market reforms,
and by price deregulation. These reforms have, in turn, mitigated the bias against employment
creation, reduced the high cost of the consumption basket, and stimulated agricultural production,
where most of the poor are employed. The elimination of the highly inequitable CPF, together
with the expansion of targeted interventions for low income groups, especially for those most
susceptible to malnutrition and vector-transmitted diseases, has significantly improved the
targeting of public expenditure to the poor.3
8.     External Debt Strategy. Integral to the Government's economic program is a strategy to
restore Panama's creditworthiness and foster foreign investment. To that end, the Administration
initiated informal conversations with the commercial banks upon taking office in September 1994,
and launched formal negotiations with the BAC in December 1994. The Government sought a
comprehensive debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) agreement that would significantly
reduce the debt stock; bring future debt service payments into line with the economy's projected
debt service capacity; and shield future commercial debt service payments from interest rate and
exchange rate risk.4 The Government also sought an agreement that would be cost effective as
well as financially viable. The need for official support for DDSR also played an important role in
the speed with which the Government moved on outstanding structural adjustment issues.5
9.     The DDSR  Agreement.  On May 5, 1995, Panama and the BAC achieved a DDSR
agreement in principle. 6 On October 4, 1995, the term sheet was issued, with closing expected
on April 30, 1996.7 The operation was designed to reduce debt and debt service through the
exchange of eligible debt for new instruments, and substantial past due interest (PDI) forgiveness.
Eligible debt encompassed all medium- and long-term commercial bank debt contracted by the
Government and state entities. It was estimated at US$3.936 billion (half of which was PDI), or
nearly 70% of Panama's public and publicly guaranteed extemal debt. It included all principal
arrears and PDI as of closing, as well as remaining scheduled principal (due during 1996-97)."
10.    The DDSR offered creditors four options for exchanging their principal claims (Table 2
below). Each was freely available to holders of debt titles on a voluntary basis; the options
selected were not subject to reallocation. No creditor, however, was permitted to participate in
the Agreement unless it did so with all of its eligible debt. The agreement also restructured PDI,
by means of: (i) PDI forgiveness; (ii) partial PDI payments prior to closing; (iii) a downpayment

PA) Release of the Third Tranche (Partial Waiver of One Condition. (R97-46), March 19, 1997.
4 World Bank staff, and IF and IDB representatives made presentations 'at the December 1994 meeting on their respective
programs for Panama, including the conditions under which they could support a debt reduction accord.
5The Government also began negotiating with non-Paris Club bilaterals (Mexico and Venezuela) to restructure about US$307
million in medium-term debt, including arrears of US$248 million. In addition, the Government obtained early
Legislative approval of Panama's accession to MIGA, and ratified the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes, strengthening guarantees to foreign investors.
6 A briefing note on the agreement in principle was distributed to the Board in September 1995. ("Panama - Commercial Bank
Debt and Debt Service Reduction Operation: Briefing Note," SecM95-1029, September 19, 1995)
7 Republic of Panama, 1995 Financing Plan. October 4, 1995. In October 1995, the Government and BAC undertook an
international "road show" to promote the Financing Plan. World Bank, IM and IDB staff participated in this effort.
8 Eligible debt also included US$19 million in contingent liabilities. In December 1995, Panama also reached an agreement to
restructure remaining commercial arrears (US$44 million in short-term credits): US$10 million in PDI was paid upfront,
another US$10 million PDI payment will be made in April 1996, and the principal was rescheduled over four years.

on PDI at closing; and (iv) a PDI bond. A major component of debt reduction would be obtained
through a recalculation of interest on principal at market rates and of interest on such interest at
the one-month LIBOR, and by waiving all contractual penalties. The PDI bond also was designed
as a back-loaded amortization instrument. The BAC and the Government estimated that this
favorable treatment would result in PDI forgiveness of US$590 million.

11.   The DDSR Loan and its Objectives. On March 28, 1996, the Board approved a free-
standing DDSR loan of US$30 million to the Republic of Panama, and the Republic's request for



5
a Limited Waiver of the Negative Pledge Clause, to support DDSR.9 The objectives of the loan
were to accelerate growth and reduce poverty by assisting the Government in: (i) implementing
debt and debt service reduction; (ii) consolidating fiscal balance and structural reforms; and (iii)
normalizing relations with commercial creditors and reestablishing creditworthiness. The DDSR
program was expected to substantially enhance the effectiveness of the Government's economic
reform program by: (i) sharply reducing market uncertainty over Panama's ability and willingness
to fully service its external debt, and the sizable distortions and costs such uncertainty entails; (ii)
offsetting the impact on the investment climate and flows deriving from the disengagement of the
U.S. from the Canal; and (iii) reducing the debt overhang and the associated "tax" on future
output, which was acting as a disincentive to reform efforts and private investment. Reduced
market uncertainty would translate into appreciable growth benefits by lowering the sovereign
risk premium and real domestic interest rates, and by restoring Panama's access to international
capital markets on competitive terms and maturities for public and private sector borrowers.
12.    Implementation of the DDSR Agreement. Creditors responded to the 1995 Financing
Plan with commitments for 98.5% of the debt eligible by the November 14, 1995 date requested
by Panama: 81.9% of these commitments was allocated to the FLIRBs; 13.7% to the par bonds,
and the remainder to the discount bonds (Table 3 below).'0 While this allocation resulted in less
debt and debt service reduction than a balanced one, it also resulted in considerably lower up-
front costs, ensuring the efficiency and viability of the operation.

13.    Total and Upfront Costs. Eligible debt was US$3,889 million, or only slightly less than
initially calculated. Total closing costs amounted to US$223.6 million, of which US$199.6 million
was paid on the July 17, 1996 Closing Date (Table 4 below).
14.    Financing and Sources of Official Support. The Bank worked in concert with the IMF
and IDB on the financing plan for the Government's reform program  and DDSR operation. On
November 29, 1995, the IMF approved a 15-month Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) for SDR 69.8

Directors on a Proposed Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan of US$30 Million to the Republic of Panama and on

5, 1996.
10 These figures on eligible debt exclude that portion for which commitments for new instruments were not received. One

million to support the program and DDSR, and on March 29, 1996, approved the Government's
request for SBA Augmentation and release of DDSR set asides. Direct IMF support totaled
US$29.7 million. On December 13, 1995, the IDB approved a DDSR Loan of US$30 million.
Disbursement was made contingent on disbursement by the Bank of its US$30 million DDSR
loan, which occurred on July 11, several days ahead of the Closing Date. The Government
financed the remaining upfront costs of US$134 million from its own resources. The Government
had substantially augmented its resources by meeting the second tranche release conditions of the
IDB Public Enterprise Reform Loan (US$35 million), and achieving compliance with the second
tranche release conditions of the World Bank ERL (US$25 million), which also triggered the
release of the second tranche (US$27 million) of a Japan OECF loan which cofinanced the ERL.

C. Achievement of Program Objectives
15.      The objectives of the DDSR operation and the supporting Bank DDSR loan are being met
or surpassed. The DDSR operation:'1
(i) restructured 70% of Panama's public and publicly guaranteed debt;
This analysis follows the approach proposed in "Analytical Aspects of Debt and Debt Service Reduction Operations,"
SecM92-296, March 9, 1992. See also World Bank (1995). Program Completion Report. Argentina: Debt and Debt
Service Reduction Loan (Loan 3555-AR!. Report No. 13885.



7
(ii) resulted in a debt reduction equivalent (DRE) of US$1,157 million, or 30% of
eligible debt and 18% of total public and publicly-guaranteed debt;
(iii) achieved this debt reduction at a savings amounting to 9.1% of Panama's GDP
compared to the cost of a market-based debt reduction;
(iv) yielded cash flow savings of US$820 million in 1996-2026 in net present value terms,
or 9.5% of GDP, compared to counter-factual debt service, resulting in an IRR of 25%;
(v) generated net benefits, potentially reaching 9.1% of GDP, and
(vi) reduced interest rate risk by changing 53% of eligible debt into fixed-rate instruments,
and reduced exchange rate risk by converting 17% of the debt denominated in non-US
currencies into US dollars.
16.   Achievement of these objectives did, however:
(i) curtail Panama's flexibility to adjust future debt service to shocks, inasmuch as 70% of
the external debt heretofore subject to rescheduling was transformed into bonds; and
(ii) augment the relative exposure of the IFIs, from 12 to 18%, of Panama's public debt.
17.   Extent of Debt Reduction. The DDSR resulted in a DRE of 30%, against the estimate
of 31% provided in the RRP, because the Government and the BAC overestimated PDI
forgiveness. The DRE is relatively low compared to that (35%) secured in previous DDSRs due
to several factors (Table 5 below). First, the relatively high market price of the debt prior to the
agreement placed a relatively low ceiling on Panama's potential DRE: the pre-deal price of
Panamanian debt (55 cents) was far above the average (34 cents) for other DDSR countries
(Table 6 below). The strength of the pre-deal price stemmed partly from the lengthy time period
that had elapsed since announcement of the Brady plan in 1989 (subsequent to that date
secondary market debt prices recovered) and partly from Panama's stronger fiscal/balance of
payments position relative to other Brady countries. Second, the drop in international interest
rates lowered the DRE. at the interest rates obtaining when the Agreement in Principle was
issued, the DRE would have been 1.7 percentage points higher. Third, the low share (32%) of
eligible debt still owned by the BAC limited its ability to negotiate debt reduction: in particular, it
precluded inclusion of a mandatory rebalancing clause in the accord. Fourth, the unexpectedly
high share of commitments to the FLIRBs reduced the DRE relative to a balanced allocation.12
18.   This result also reflects the relative confidence of investors in Panama's long-term
economic prospects and creditworthiness--82% of eligible debt was exchange for the
uncollateralized FLIRBs, as well as the growing preference of traders for high-yielding
instruments in emerging markets. Finally, Panama's poor track record in meeting commitments to
commercial creditors likely curtailed its negotiating capacity--Panama had not made any service
payment on this debt since 1987; was one of the two countries to have defaulted on an
international bond issue during the debt crisis; and almost all eligible countries had already
concluded DDSR agreements.
12 With a balanced commitment allocation, the DRE would have been 40%; however, upfront costs would have been US$366
million rather than US$224 mnillion. In this case, the buy-back equivalent pnce of the operation would have been higher
than the secondary market price prevailing prior to the DDSR Agreement in Pnnciple, potentially jeopardizing official
support for the operation

19.      Nonetheless, the DDSR  resulted  in a total DRE  (net of additional official financing) of
Panama's total public and publicly guaranteed debt of 18%, a reduction greater than that achieved
in previous agreements (16%). Moreover, total DRE amounted to 14% of Panama's GDP, or a
proportion several times the average in previous operations (5%), reflecting the heavy weight of
commercial debt in Panama's total debt, and the large debt overhang affecting the economy. This
is why the operation was so crucial to Panama's future growth prospects.

20.   Comprehensiveness and Savings of the DDSR Operation.  The DDSR operation
achieved debt relief at a substantially lower financial cost to Panama than a market-based debt
reduction would have entailed, because the comprehensiveness of the menu approach virtually
eliminated the free rider problem associated with a market-based debt reduction. In effect, the
DDSR occurred at an average market price of 57 cents on the dollar, or a price about 26% lower
than the post-deal price at which an open market operation with a like amount of debt reduction
could occur, which is somewhat higher than the average in previous DDSR operations (Table 6
above).13 The resulting savings compared to a market-based debt reduction reached US$778
million, or 9.1% of GDP. These savings are several times greater than those garnered by other
countries through DDSR (3% of GDP on average). At the same time, Panama obtained 91% of
13 The post-deal price is approximated by the pnce of the non-collateralized portion of the creditors' new portfolio. This
stripped price is calculated as the market value of new instruments less the pnncipal prepayment equivalent of collateral,
divided by the face value of the new instruments minus the DRE. World Debt Tables 1993-94, Vol. 1, Box 2.3.

the overall benefits generated by the operation, compared to an average of 59% for previous
DDSR operations. The DDSR also was cost effective, as measured by the IMF.
21.    Evaluating the material benefits--the direct cash flow  implications and the indirect
development impact--of the DDSR operation requires explicit assumptions about the course of
action the Government and its creditors would have otherwise pursued. Clearly, if it were
assumed that Panama would continue to accumulate arrears indefinitely in the absence of a DDSR
operation, the effect of DDSR on Panama's cash flow position would be negative. The indirect
benefits of DDSR as compared to such a scenario, however, would be strongly positive, resulting
in overall positive net benefits. In effect, the strong economic recovery achieved by Panama
during the past five years was in large part the result of the progressive restoration of domestic
and international investor confidence in the country--as evinced by the dramatic turnaround in
capital flows (including the return of flight capital). This was secured partly on the basis of the
normalization of relations with creditors commencing in 1991, and partly on the basis of market
expectations that Panama would fully restore these relations in the medium-term. Had this not
been the case, the economic recovery would have been a slow and painful process--without the
restoration of confidence, it is unclear how the money supply, which plunged an estimated 30%
during 1987-89, would have been replenished. Similarly, a decision to continue to accumulate
commercial arrears rather than regain creditworthiness through DDSR would have prevented the
economy from reaping significant benefits from fiscal and structural reforms because it would
have rapidly destroyed the confidence of domestic and foreign investors in the economy, possibly
resulting in demonetization and stagnation (and undermining support for reform).
22.    As a result of such considerations, re-establishment of creditworthiness was an integral
part of the Government's economic program from the outset. Consequently, a counterfactual
rooted in the extrapolation of commercial arrears accumulation lacks plausibility. Comparing the
direct effects of DDSR to scheduled debt service also is an implausible counterfactual because
that debt was scheduled to be amortized by end-1997. In light of these considerations, and
following the approach adopted in the Board documents for all DDSR operations supported by
the Bank since 1992, when this type of analysis was introduced, two counterfactuals could be
considered: a MYRA or a debt rollover with full interest service.14  The DDSR provides greater
debt service relief when compared to a MYRA, because the debt would be amortized much
quicker in a MYRA. Taking this as an upper bound, the counterfactual selected to assess the debt
service relief from DDSR is full interest service, with a debt rollover (i.e., exchange of existing
commercial debt for a 30-year bullet maturity instrument at LIBOR plus 13/16%).15
S see "Analytical Aspects of Debt and Debt Service Reduction Operations," op. cit.
5 Clearly, m a post-Brady world, it would make little sense for Panama (or any other Brady-eligible country) to agree to
anything less than a DDSR operation. Nonetheless, a debt rollover would be an alternative far superior to continued
arrears accumulation, owing to the strongly adverse development impact of the latter course of action. Finally, it also
should be noted that the selection of vanants of full debt service counterfactuals has been cntiqued on the grounds that
they are mconsistent with market expectations of partial default, as reflected m the discount in the secondary market
price of commercial debt prior to DDSR. (See Eduardo Fernandez-Arias, "Costs and Benefits of Debt and Debt Service
Reduction." The World Bank. International Economics Department. Working Paper No. 1169, August, 1993). This
argument has considerable merit, but in all cases post-DDSR market prices for exchanged debt have remained below par,
which suggests that the market continues to expect some degree of default. (In other words, market-consistent
counterfactuals would compare discounted DDSR debt service streams against discounted MYRA or rollover debt
service streams to measure debt service relief).

23.       Direct Benefits. In the  initial year, when the upfront costs were  incurred, the  liquidity
impact of DDSR as compared to the debt rollover counterfactual was highly negative (US$64
million). During 1997-2000, however, DDSR will provide annual average debt service relief of
about US$102 million compared to the counterfactual, due to lower interest payments. During
2001-2016, debt service relief will be negative (US$90 million per year), because the FLIRBs and
PDI bonds will be amortized. Subsequently, debt service relief will turn sharply positive (US$636
million annually) because only US$316 million of the par and discount bonds remain to be

of US$820 million in net present value terms, or about 9.5% of GDP.

25.   Indirect Benefits. The magnitude of the indirect benefits of DDSR depends heavily on
the extent to which economic reforms redress the institutional and structural causes of the debt
overhang. The Government's reform program is eliminating these causes. At the same time,
DDSR is substantially enhancing the effectiveness of the reform program in creating the
conditions for accelerating growth to potential and reducing poverty. In particular, in a very short
period of time the DDSR operation has drastically reduced market uncertainty over Panama's
capacity and willingness to service its debt by: (i) eliminating Panama's arrears and normalizing its
relations with commercial creditors; (ii) reducing the present value of debt service payments by
19%; (iii) shielding 53% of commercial interest obligations from interest rate risk and all
commercial obligations from exchange rate risk; and (iv) transforming commercial loans into
bonds, thereby allaying concerns about future reschedulings and rendering actual payments more
predictable. Official support for DDSR further curtailed market uncertainty, by ensuring a
credible financing plan, and by signaling that the Government is undertaking the reforms needed
to revive sustainable growth, and restore and maintain creditworthiness.  Finally, market
uncertainty also has subsided because the large cost of debt service default in a post-DDSR world
provides a strong incentive for Panama to meet the debt service obligations assumed under the
DDSR agreement.
26.   Reduced market uncertainly already has translated into appreciable benefits to Panama by
drastically lowering the sovereign risk premium and restoring Panama's access to international
capital markets on competitive terms and maturities for both public and private sector borrowers,
and by encouraging domestic and foreign investment. Indeed, in January 1997, the major
international risk classification agencies assigned Panama a sovereign credit rating of BB+, just
below investment grade (and only surpassed by two other countries in Latin America), while
Panamanian private corporate issuers received an investment grade rating (putting them in the
same category as their Chilean and Colombian counterparts). One month later and merely seven
months after closing the DDSR, the Republic of Panama returned to the international capital
market for the first time in a decade with spectacular results: its 5-year bond issue was heavily
oversubscribed (totaling US$500 million or 5.8% of GDP) only seven months after the closure of
the DDSR. Furthermore, the spread was merely 175 basis points over five-year U.S. Treasury
Bonds. By way of comparison, Colombia floated a ten-year US$750 million bond issue one day
after Panama's issue at 140 basis over the U.S. Treasury benchmark. The Government has
utilized 80% of the proceeds from the bond issue to repurchase PDI bonds and FLIRBs, and
intends to use to rest for the same purpose This operation secured an additional financial savings
to Panama on its debt service obligations of US$77 million in net present value terms (equivalent
to 0.9% of GDP).
27.   As a result of the DDSR and the progress achieved by the Government in implementing its
economic reform program, the risk premium faced by Panama on long-term bonds plunged more
than 850 basis points in the short space of fifteen months, from about 1200 basis points when the
1995 Financing Plan was issued, to 250 basis points in February 1997 (Figure 1).16 Panama's risk
premium is now only slightly higher than Colombia's, and the private sector recently has
borrowed funds on the international capital market at competitive rates. Such a turnaround in
such a short period of time is unprecedented. The reduction in the spread between interest rates in
16The FLIRB and PDI principal are not collateralized, providing the best measures of market perception of Panama's long-term
sovereign risk.



14
Panama and the U.S. was less dramatic but still significant: from 4.5 to 3.5 percentage points
between the achievement of the DDSR agreement and end-1996.
28.   At the same time, both domestic bond and equity markets enjoyed a watershed year in
1996 on bullish sentiment accompanying the debt agreement. Volume on Panama's stock
exchange almost doubled from end-1995 to end-1996, while the stock price index climbed 25%
(and only slightly less in real dollar terms), and the net asset value for the bellwether Panama
Balanced Fund subscribed by international investors was up 30%. On top of this, in a market that
had been entirely dominated by fixed income instruments, 1996 saw three initial public offerings
that raised the share of equity activity to over 5%. Moreover, during the first five months of
1997, the stock price index climbed a further 21% (Figure 1 above).
29.   In capital-constrained countries like Panama, renewed access to foreign savings on
competitive terms results in efficiency gains because additional financing can be used for high
return investments. This impact should be especially significant for Panama because the monetary
regime makes it more difficult to shift resources from  nontradeables to tradeables.  The
repurchase of Brady bonds is one striking example of this; another is the investment by a foreign
firm in May of 1997 of US$652 million (equivalent to 7.6% of GDP) for the purchase of 49% of
the shares of the state telecoms firm and management control--by far the largest direct foreign
investment made in Panama since the construction of the canal. The strategic foreign investor is
expected to invest an additional US$500 million over the next several years in the expansion and
upgrading of telecoms services in Panama. Additional large scale foreign investment projects are
underway (paras. 34-3 5 below).
30.   Renewed access of the Government to domestic capital markets and reduction in interest
rate spreads also should facilitate efficient management of government finances. This is especially
true in Panama, where, due to the monetary regime, transitory deficits cannot be sustained unless
the Government is able to borrow from the market at competitive ra.es. Thanks to the DDSR and
improved economic policies, in December 1996, the Government realized its first domestic bond
issue (for US$75 million) since the early 1980s. As such issues become a routine part of public
finance management, they also will accelerate the development of the capital market.
31.   Net Material Benefits. The net material benefits of DDSR that would accrue to Panama
may be estimated on the basis of changes in market valuations of eligible debt between the pre-
and post-deal periods, as compared to the average price at which the DDSR operation was
consummated. In an open market buy-back creditors could be expected to capture all benefits
resulting from the debt overhang.'7 The difference between the pre- and post-deal market prices
of the eligible debt provides an approximation of the overall benefits of the DDSR operation. The
difference between the break-even and the post-deal prices provides an indicator of the benefits
which accrued to the country, while the difference between the break-even and the pre-deal prices
provides an indicator of the benefits which accrued to commercial creditors. Panama obtained
91% of these benefits, amounting to about US$778 million, or 9.1% of GDP. 8

CVI, pp. 1219 September, 1991.
18 The costs to Panama of the operation may turn out to be somewhat higher, depending on the outcome of the legal actions
lodged against the Republic of Panama m the United States by the creditor who did not participate in the 1995 Financing
Plan.

32.   Macroeconomic Outlook. Both the short and longer-term economic outlook is positive.
In 1996, the overall balance of the nonfinancial public sector registered a surplus of 0.8% of
GDP. Inflation was 2.3%, marking the eighth consecutive year in which domestic inflation was
less than external inflation. The current account balance of payments deficit is estimated to have
declined to about 2.3% of GDP in 1996 from about 4.4% in 1995, due primarily to the debt relief
obtained through the DDSR, and despite a decline in service income generated by the activities of
the U.S. Defense Department. The overall balance of payments registered a surplus equivalent to
about 1% of GDP. At end-1996, the public and publicly-guaranteed external debt amounted to an
estimated US$6.3 billion, or an estimated 74% of GDP (against 87% in 1995). Despite the
favorable evolution of these indicators, real GDP growth remained sluggish, at 2.5%.
Nonetheless, following the 1988-89 crisis, 1996 was the first year since 1992, when the rate of
economic recovery peaked, in which output growth was higher than in the previous year.
33.   Moreover, growth accelerated considerably during the first quarter of 1997, reaching
3.6% with respect to the first quarter of 1996, when growth was slightly negative. This upswing
was spearheaded by a rise of 38% in the value added in ports, the reactivation of construction,
and renewed strong growth in electricity generation following last year's drought. Growth for
1997 as a whole is expected to surpass 4%, and accelerate further in subsequent years, in large
part because private investors are responding to the Government's reform program and enhanced
credit standing with large-scale investments in the restructuring of the Panamanian economy.
34.  In addition to the investments in telecoms (para. 28 above), a new US$100 million private
trans-shipment port will commence operations in 1997, and the strategic private investor who
acquired the National Port Authority's major ports in early 1997 will spend US$150 million to
modernize them over the next three years. This transformation of Panama' port sector constitutes
a remarkable success story, and will play a pivotal role in the future development of the country.
The Northern Expressway, which will provide a sorely-needed high-speed thoroughfare between
Tocumen International Airport and downtown Panama City, will be concluded in late 1997.
Construction of the Panama City-Colon Expressway, which also will remove a major
transportation bottleneck, will commence in 1997, as will that of the Southern Expressway.
These highways are being built and financed by strategic private foreign investors who are
licensed to levy tolls and maintain the expressways for 30 years. Their total cost is US$560
million.
35.   Also, a new export processing zone is under construction on the site of a former U.S.
military base, at a cost of US$115 million; in 1997, a privately-owned and operated electricity
generating plant of 50mw will be constructed at a cost of US$50 million (with a 100mw plant
expected to follow in 1999); during 1997-98, a privately-owned drinking water plant will be built
at a cost of US$40 million; during 1997-99, US$25 million is to be invested annually in the
development and expansion of cellular telephone service; in 1997-99, a tourism development at
Costa Blanca on the Pacific Coast will be constructed, with total investment amounting to
US$150 million; during 1997-2000, two copper mines will be developed with total investments of
US$800 million (or about 9% of 1996 GDP); and during 1997-2001, the Fort Amador Tourism
Project will be developed at an estimated cost of US$495 million.
36.   The long-term  benefits of the DDSR operation can be illustrated by modeling
macroeconomic performance and comparing it to the projected result under the counterfactual
(Table 8 below). Economic growth under the DDSR is projected to rise 1 percentage point of



16
GDP during 1996-2000 to 4.5% per annum, and to 5.3% during 2001-04. This would occur on
the strength of projected increases in the rates of national savings and domestic investment, as
well as through greater efficiency of investment, in response to the elimination of policy
distortions  and  improved  creditworthiness.    Such  growth  would  represent  a  substantial
improvement over the 1981-95 trend (less than 3%) as well as projected growth under the
counterfactual. Higher growth would be financed mainly by a stepped-up domestic savings effort
(public as well as private) under this scenario, as reflected in the projected decline of the current
account deficit to an average of 3.8% of GDP during 1996-2000 and 2.6% during 2001-04. At
the same time, the quality of net external resource transfers would improve dramatically, as
arrears accumulation is replaced by growing foreign direct investment and, eventually, private
commercial capital inflows. Official net disbursements are projected to continue to play an
important role during 1997-98, before declining to an amount equivalent to less than 15%, on
average, of total net external financing during 1999-2004.

37.     While  the DDSR  greatly  improved  Panama's  capacity  to  service  its debt, it could
potentially constrain Panama's latitude to adjust debt service to adverse extemal shocks in the
event such shocks were larger than the debt relief achieved, or to adjust to domestic policy
shocks. More particularly, it would raise the transactions costs of an eventual debt restructuring



17
relative to one in which loans were simply rescheduled, as in a Multi-year Rescheduling
Agreement (MYRA). In effect, the DDSR agreement raised the relative share of debt held in
bonds from about 8 to 62% (Table 9 below). The conversion of bank loans to bonds and
additional lending by IFIs for DDSR raised the share of relatively inflexible debt from 19 to 85%.
Nonetheless, the share of preferred creditors in public debt service actually declined in 1996, to
about 31% from 45% (because Panama was still accumulating arrears on commercial debt in
1995). On an accrual basis, the share of preferred creditors is projected to remain below the
Bank's guideline of 35% during the next decade. Debt service to the Bank as a proportion of
public debt service was about 11% in 1996, and is projected to decline to about 10% during
1998-2000, and to somewhat less thereafter. Similarly, debt service to the Bank as a fraction of
exports is projected to be far below the Bank's guideline over the course of the next decade
(1.3% in 1996, and lower thereafter).

38.      Reduced  flexibility per se translates into  greater risk in the event of adverse  external
shocks or domestic policy shocks; however, DDSR also mitigates the vulnerability of the
economy to external shocks. First, it diminished the debt service burden and radically enhanced
creditworthiness. Second, it reduced the exposure of the economy to both interest rate risk--by
changing 53% of eligible debt into fixed-rate instruments, and to exchange rate risk--by
converting the 17% of eligible debt formerly denominated in non-U.S. currencies into US dollars.
Moreover, the DDSR operation provides Panama with options to adjust debt service to external



18
shocks. For instance, Panama could capitalize interest payments on PDI bonds exceeding an
annual interest rate of 4% during the first six years after closing; or use interest collateral to pay
up to 12 months interest on the par and discount bonds, and up to 6 months interest on the
FLIRBs. In addition, current fiscal policies, coupled with the measures the Government is taking
to consolidate fiscal balance over the longer-term, are projected to generate nonfinancial public
sector surpluses greater than 1% of GDP by the year 2000. Such additional resources would
significantly increase the Government's capacity to absorb external shocks and to implement an
efficient debt management strategy.
39.   While the economy is more vulnerable to domestic policy shocks in a post-DDSR world,
the risk of such shocks, especially fiscal shocks, is considered to be slight. Panama's unique, nine
decades-old monetary regime provides a stable anchor for the macroeconomic framework.
Maintenance of sound economic policies also would be encouraged by the up-front cost that
Panama has paid to regain creditworthiness, and debt management strengthened as
creditworthiness improves and the cost of mismanagement increases. Indeed, DDSR would serve
as a powerful deterrent to policy slippage. Moreover, the current Administration enjoys a solid
majority in the Legislative Assembly; has achieved major progress in implementing the lengthy
reform agenda during its first three years; and has launched a second round of policy reforms for
implementation during its final two years in office. Nonetheless, support for the reform program
could erode in this relatively wealthy but dualistic society--in which 40% of the population lives in
poverty and narrow-interest groups traditionally have thwarted reform--if investment in
infrastructure and social safety net programs continues to lag, and if growth does not begin to
accelerate and the high unemployment rate to subside in the medium-term.
40.   The Bank is working with the Government to minimize this risk though our investment
lending program focused on poverty reduction; by enhancing implementation of our recently
launched portfolio in the social sectors; and through our ESW and policy dialogue. In addition,
the Bank has initiated discussions with the Government on the preparation of a new structural
adjustment operation to back the implementation of its second generation of policy reforms. The
Bank would provide this support in concert with the IMF and the IDB (para. 44 below).
E. Bank Performance
41.   Panama's exceptionally successful DDSR operation could not have been concluded
without the support of the Bank, the IMF and IDB. The Bank's performance in coordinating
support, evaluating the project, and processing the DDSR Loan was highly satisfactory. On a
technical level, Bank staff provided the Authorities with regular evaluations of the DDSR as it
evolved through it various stages, and supported the Government in its conversations with the
BAC, and in promoting the 1995 Financing Plan to international financial community. In
addition, the IDB Board documentation for its loan was based largely on the draft RRP; and the
Authorities made ample use of the RRP analysis of the DDSR to publicize the Financing Plan in
its public pronouncements and official documents.
42.   Bank staff took 6 months, from the preparation of the Briefing Note for the Board, to
Board approval of the DDSR loan. The loan was disbursed 3.5 months after Board approval, and
closed one week later. The Bank spent US$71,000 in direct costs on the preparation and
supervision of a US$30 million loan which was indispensable for the restructuring of almost US$4
billion of external debt, at a savings to Panama of 9% of its GDP and with potential benefits of a



19
sirnilar magnitude. The average time period for the preparation of previous Bank DDSR loans
was 13.5 months, with 21 months elapsing between the Briefing Note and disbursement. The
average direct cost for preparation and supervision of previous DDSR loans was US$113,000.
F. Borrower Performance
43.   The Government fielded a highly competent and experienced teamn to negotiate and carry
out the DDSR agreement. The Government team expertly handled all the complexities of the
operation with competence and diligence, and the 1995 Financing Plan achieved all of its
objectives. With implementation of the accord and follow-up actions with the international credit-
rating agencies (also supported by the Bank) the Government successfully completed a well-
designed strategy for restoring the country's creditworthiness. This accomplishment, together
with the tremendous progress the Government simultaneously achieved in carrying out the other
elements of its economic reform program, is creating the conditions required to lift the growth of
Panama's economy to its potential. In addition, as a result of this experience, the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Policy greatly improved its capacity to manage its external debt.
G. Future Operations
44.   The Central America Department has held discussions with the Authorities on a possible
follow-on structural adjustment operation to support the Government in the consolidation of
ongoing reforms and the implementation of a second generation of institutional and structural
reforms. Such an operation would be designed and implemented in concert with the IMF and
IDB. The IMF and the Government currently are preparing a program that would be backed by
the Fund's Extended Fund Facility, over the course of the 1997-2000 period. IDB recently
approved a Public Enterprise Reform Loan, and is preparing a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan.
H. Assessment of Outcome and Key Lessons Learned
45.   The outcome of the DDSR operation was highly satisfactory. It was a model for a well-
executed concerted effort to achieve results on the ground. In just over six months a virtuous
cycle was completed of smooth DDSR exchange, receipt of near investment grade ratings, and
highly successful return to sovereign borrowing. The surge in Panama's Brady prices, practically
doubling from January 1996 to January 1997, to lead that asset class, is a clear-cut indicator of
the success of this DDSR operation. Bank participation was critical to DDSR credibility and
viability, particularly as the Republic could not provide sufficient collateral on its own, nor show,
in 1994-95, a solid reform track record.
46.   Analysis of Panama's DDSR operation--perhaps the next-to-last such operation--confirms
lessons from previous DDSR operations. (i) success of the operation hinges principally on the
credibility of the country's economic reform program; (ii) the concerted, menu-based approach to
debt reduction provides significant cost savings to the debtor country compared to market-based
debt reduction; (iii) creditor banks also improve their financial position; (iv) the inclusion of a new
money option is not essential for securing both full participation of creditors and substantial cost
savings; and (v) net benefits are higher when DDSR is backed financially by the International



20
Financial Institutions.'9 These lessons have been well described in previous ICRs and other Bank
documents.20
9 Fifteen of the 17 highly indebted countries orgmally envisaged as candidates for debt restructuring at the inception of the
IBRD Program to Support Debt and Debt Restructuring have restructured their commercial bank debt. Of these, 10 have
received Bank financial support for DDSR. Peru (November 1996) was the most recent beneficiary of the BR)D
program. In addition, 4 other countries, including Panama, have borrowed from the Barnk for DDSR.

Program To Support Debt and Debt Service Reduction," April 4, 1995.

Project Implementation Review from Borrower's Perspective
re: Loan No. 3991-PA for US$ 30 million
Introduction
On March 28th, 1996 Loan No. 3991-PA for US$ 30 million (the "Loan") was
approved by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the "Bank") to
the Republic of Panama ("Panama"). The loan has been successfully disbursed and
implemented and this is the first implementation report submitted by Panama pursuant to
its terms and conditions.
I. Overall Assessment of the Project
1.   Project Objectives. The objectives of the Loan were:
a).  Implementing debt and debt service reduction ("DDSR").
b).   Consolidating fiscal balance and structural reformn.
c).   Normalizing relations with commercial creditors, reestablishing
creditworthiness and accelerating growth and development.
Comments: From Panama's perspective, all three of the above objectives have been
achieved to varying degrees. Panama's DDSR realized a relief of US$1.2 billion or 31%
of the US$3.8 billion eligible debt.

This was realized through retroactive contractual interest rate recalculation,
reduction in debt interest rates for the new debt vis a vis existing market rates and actual
principal forgiveness. When compared with other Panamanian debt restructuring, the
Plan was a cost-effective transaction.

Although Panama has one lone rouge creditor who did not participate in the 1995
Financing Plan, overall the objectives of the Loan were met to Panama's great
satisfaction.
The DDSR has had a beneficial impact on fiscal and structural reforms by
lowering and fixing the contractual debt service. This should assist Panama in adjusting to
the changes anticipated with the exit of U.S. Armed Forces from the Panama Canal area
and with the reversion of the Canal to Panama. Sovereign risk spreads have been
lowered so that capital is lower now to both private and public borrowers than it was
before the DDSR. In addition, Panama has normalized its relations with the major
commercial creditors and gained access to capital markets for both the government and
private borrowers. Panama's credit rating as a sovereign risk has improved as reported
by Moody's and Standard & Poor. Moody's rated Panama as Bal and Standard & Poor
gave it a BB+, reflecting a "just" below investment grade rating. Panama's Brady Bonds
have moved up in value in the secondary market, reflecting a growing confidence in
Panama as a credit risk.

In February of 1997 Panama placed US$ 500 million in its oversubscribed
inaugural bond issue. Entry into capital markets and fiscal stability is a centerpiece of
Panama's economic policy as it enters the global economy and moves to modernize its
productive sectors. Accession to the World Trade Organization has been approved by
Panama's National Assembly and should be effective shortly.
2.   Panama's performance during the evolution of the Loan. The Loan was just one
part of a complex financial operation that comprised the 1995 Financing Plan for
Panama. A team from the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy successfully
negotiated with the Bank the terms and conditions of the Loan while structuring the loans
needed to fully finance, through loans from other IFIs, the 1995 Financing Plan (the
"Plan"). Panama was able to dovetail all the various financial and legal requirements to
complete the Plan both with debt holders and the cofinancing IFIs. Panama assembled
and worked with a diverse group of professionals to complete this transaction. The
integration of this diverse multidisciplinary group was a valuable experience which is
important for future financial transactions.
Recent exchanges with the Bank have identified the need to complete an
independent audit of the Loan. Panama has also revised the figures used by the Bank in
March of 1996 during the approval process to evaluate the amount of debt forgiveness of
the transaction.

3.   Bank's performance during the evolution of the Loan. The Loan was the result of
a long and thoughtful process to structure the DDSR for Panama. During negotiations,
Bank staff were very helpful in explaining the Bank's guidelines, policies and procedures
while being sensitive to Panama's concerns, needs and limitations. The Bank waived
various conditions imposed on other existing loan agreements to permit the pledge of zero
coupon bonds and other collateral as part of the Plan.
II. Operational Phase of Project.
The Loan was one component of the Plan. The IADB and the IMF also supported
this DDSR operation. The successful closure of this transaction is an ample indicator that
the Loan met its operational goals. Panama requested disbursal shortly before the July
17th, 1996, closing and this was accommodated under the Loan. Operationally, the
transaction and the objective have been met.  Panama has now moved to debt
management in order to reduce the stock of debt using various strategies available in the
financial market. Over the coming year Panama hopes to go to market again on different
terms and tenors to establish an "all Panama yield curve" to serve as a benchmark.
MI. Assistance in ICR preparation.
Panama has provided the Bank with the necessary information on the economic,
financial, social, institutional and other conditions related to the DDSR operation. For
example, Panama has achieved significant per capital debt reduction.

A Bank mission visited Panama in January to meet with government officials and
update the evaluation of the DDSR and prepare the ICR. There is regular and systematic
exchange of information between Panama and the Bank in order to assure the efficient
implementation and follow-up of this project.
Conclusion
The Loan together with the aid of other IFIs permitted Panama to normalize and
resolve commercial debt defaults that had existed since 1987. The Directorate of Public
Credit has gained important experience in negotiating and implementing various loans,
including the Loan, and is in the process of complying with the audit required by the
Loan. A close working relationship has developed between Bank staff and government
officials which permitted the successful completion of the DDSR. Panama has been
pleased with the response of the international financial markets to both the DDSR and the
structural reform packages implemented to globalize and modernize Panama's economy.
Panama now has access to cheaper capital to finance its various needs, be these by public
or private sector borrowers. This strategy should have important social benefits in
reducing poverty and creating a stable fiscal base as the economy expands.
