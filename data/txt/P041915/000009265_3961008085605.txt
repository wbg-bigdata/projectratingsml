PANAMA
DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION LOAN
Loan and Program Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Panama
Amount:            US$30 million
Terms:             Standard amortization term, grace period, and interest rate for fixed-rate
US dollar single currency loans with an expected disbursement period of 0-
1 years.
Objectives:        The objectives of the operation are to assist the Government in: (i)
implementing debt and debt service reduction; (ii) consolidating fiscal
balance and structural reforms; and (iii) normalizing relations with
commercial creditors, reestablishing creditworthiness, and accelerating
growth and development.
Benefits and Risks: The proposed loan would: (i) restructure almost 70% of Panama's public
and publicly guaranteed debt; (ii) result in a debt reduction equivalent
(DRE) of 31% of the eligible commercial debt and 19% of total public
and publicly-guaranteed debt at a savings amounting to about 10.7% of
Panama's GDP compared to the cost of a market-based debt reduction; (iii)
yield cash flow savings of US$917 million in 1996-2026 in net present
value terms, or 12.4% of GDP, compared to counter-factual debt service;
(iv) generate net benefits potentially reaching 10.7% of GDP; and
(v) reduce interest rate risk, by changing 53% of eligible debt into fixed-
rate instruments and reduce exchange rate risk by converting 17% of the
debt denominated in non-US currencies into US dollars. DDSR is expected
to substantially enhance the effectiveness of the reform program in
accelerating growth to potential by: (i) substantially reducing market
uncertainty over Panama's ability and willingness to fully service its
external debt, and the sizable distortions and costs this uncertainty entails;
(ii) offsetting the adverse effect on the investment climate and flows
deriving from the disengagement of the U.S. from the Canal and former
Canal Zone; and (iii) reducing the debt overhang and the associated "tax"
on future output.
While DDSR would greatly improve Panama's capacity to service debt,
it would raise the share of relatively inflexible debt from 21.9 to 90.2%.
Nonetheless, the share of preferred creditors in public debt service would
actually decline in 1996, to about 31% from 45% in 1995. On an accrual
basis, the share of preferred creditors is projected to remain below the
Bank's guideline of 35% during the next decade. Both debt service to the
Bank as proportion of public debt service and as a fraction of exports are
projected to remain considerably below Bank guidelines during the next
decade. Moreover, Panama has several options in the context of the DDSR



- ii -
operation to adjust debt service to external shocks, such as capitalizing
interest payments on PDI bonds exceeding an annual interest rate of 4%
during the first six years after closing, and/or using the interest collateral to
pay up to 12 months interest on the par and discount bonds, and up to 6
months interest on the FLIRBs. In addition, current fiscal policies, coupled
with the measures the Government is taking to consolidate fiscal balance
over the longer-term, would significantly increase the Government's
capacity to absorb external shocks and implement an efficient debt
management strategy. The risk of domestic policy shocks in a post-DDSR
world is considered to be slight.
Disbursements:     The proposed loan would be disbursed in one tranche upon loan
effectiveness to help finance the costs of acquiring principal and/or interest
collateral of the par and/or discount bonds, and/or interest collateral of the
FLIRBs, and/or to reimburse Panama for such costs if these were already
incurred after November 14, 1995.
Poverty Category:  Not applicable.
Rate of Return:    The internal rate of return (IRR) on the financial resources allocated to
DDSR, based on the savings in payments to commercial banks, would be
18%. This IR.R is above both the cost at which Panama could borrow the
enhancement funds and the critical level employed in the Bank's project
lending.
Appraisal Report:  Not applicable.



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE
REDUCTION LOAN
OF US$30 MILLION TO THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
AND ON RELATED MEASURES
TO SUPPORT THE DEBT REDUCTION PROGRAM
OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation for proposed measures to support the
Republic of Panama in the implementation of its Debt and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR)
Agreement with its commercial creditors.' The DDSR agreement is comprehensive: it covers all
medium- and long-term commercial bank debt contracted by the Republic of Panama. Eligible
debt approaches US$4 billion, or nearly 70% of Panama's public and publicly guaranteed external
debt. Eligible debt encompasses all principal and principal arrears (about US$2 billion), all past
due interest (also close to US$2 billion), and some short-term debt (US$19 million). Remaining
short-term commercial debt in arrears (US$44 million) was restructured under a separate
agreement.
2.    The DDSR operation involves: (i) an exchange of original principal for par bonds,
discount bonds, front-loaded interest reduction bonds (FLIRB) or debt conversion bonds; and (ii)
normalization of past due interest (PDI) through partial forgiveness, PDI payments prior to
closing, a down payment on PDI at closing, and a PDI bond. The expected closing date of the
DDSR operation is April 30, 1996.
3.    Proposed World Bank measures to support the DDSR operation would encompass:
*     A DDSR Loan to the Republic of Panama for US$30 million, consisting of US$20 million
in set asides from the three-year lending program and US$10 million in additional funds,
to help finance principal and interest collateral of the instruments exchanged for eligible
principal; and
*     A limited waiver of the negative pledge clauses in loan and guarantee agreements
between the Republic of Panama and the Bank to permit a pledge of collateral of up to
US$115 million for the DDSR instruments.
' A note on the DDSR agreement entitled "Panama - Commercial Bank Debt and Debt Service Reduction Operation: Briefing
Note," (SecM95-1029), was distributed to the Executive Directors on September 19, 1995. The World Bank also
provided a letter to the international banking community outlining possible support for the DDSR agreement. This letter
was included in the Republic of Panama's 1995 Financing Plan (October 4, 1995) which describes the detailed terms of
the DDSR agreement.

4.    This report analyzes the effects of the proposed DDSR operation on Panama's medium-
term growth prospects and creditworthiness, and provides a justification for the deployment of
World Bank resources to support DDSR. Section I outlines the domestic origins of Panama's
debt crisis and initiation of adjustment efforts. Section II discusses the Government's economic
program. Section III presents the costs, financing plan and debt service implications of the DDSR
agreement. Section IV evaluates the DDSR operation in terms of its debt and debt service
reduction, material benefits, and projected effects on Panama's growth prospects and
creditworthiness. Section V discusses the Bank's assistance strategy and the proposed DDSR
loan. Section VI presents the recommendations.
I. EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY AND EXTERNAL DEBT
5.    Background: Distortions and Crisis. Over the past twenty-five years, the sharp
segmentation of the economy by distortionary Government policies has kept output growth far
below potential. As state expenditure mounted relative to GDP and policy interventions
proliferated, domestic prices of importables and non-traded goods rose faster than international
prices despite the dollar-based monetary regime, most resources were channeled into rubrics in
which the economy possesses a comparative disadvantage, productive private investment was
crowded out, foreign investment flows dried up, and the competitiveness of international services
was eroded. Social services were expanded greatly, especially social security for public sector
employees and tertiary education, but unemployment soared and two-fifths of the population was
pushed into poverty despite Panama's relatively high per capita income, leaving the country with
one of the most unequal distributions of income in the hemisphere. The expansion of the state and
inflated levels of domestic absorption were financed by foreign borrowing; in 1980, Panama had
one of the largest per capita commercial bank debts in the world. During the early 1980s, these
distortions, together with the international debt crisis, plunged the economy into recession. The
economic downturn was exacerbated by the political crisis in the late 1980s and the imposition of
external economic sanctions. The Government ceased to service its commercial bank, bilateral and
bonded debt in 1987, and fell into arrears with the IFIs in 1988. In 1988-89, the money supply
plunged an estimated 30%, and economic activity contracted 16%.2
6.    Initiation of Adjustment and the Economic Recovery. During 1990-95, considerable
strides were made in reducing the large imbalances accumulated during 1987-89. Following
resolution of the political crisis, the removal of economic sanctions and implementation of an
adjustment program with the support of the IFIs (in the case of the Bank, through the 1992
Economic Recovery Loan, or ERL) rekindled confidence and resulted in repatriation of private
assets and large bilateral aid flows that remonetized the economy, and fueled private investment
and pent-up consumption demand. By 1994, per capita GDP surpassed the pre-1987 peak and the
unemployment rate had been reduced by 6 percentage points from the 1990 peak; domestic
inflation was below international inflation; public finances were in balance; import coverage of
reserves had increased to almost 2 months; and the public and publicly-guaranteed external debt
had declined from 133% to 81% of GDP.
7.    Growth, however, is decelerating, to an estimated 3.5% in 1995, and unemployment is still
very high (almost 14%). While the economic recovery substantially strengthened public finances,

the previous Administration was unable to implement the reforms required to consolidate long-
term fiscal balance. Progress in carrying out key structural adjustment measures needed to achieve
economic growth in line with Panama's development potential also was modest. Although the
overall balance of payments position improved considerably, a current account deficit of the
magnitude recorded in recent years (about 6.5% of GDP) cannot be sustained in light of the still
large debt overhang, sharply declining bilateral aid, and gradual disengagement of the U.S. from
the former Canal Zone. In the absence of major structural reforms, debt relief and restoration of
creditworthiness, growth will revert to the less than 3% trend registered during the past fifteen
years now that the economic recovery has run its course.
8.     External Debt.  Significant progress in normalizing relations with the international
financial community also was achieved during this period (Table 1). In the first quarter of 1992,
the Government cleared its arrears with the IFIs and the Paris Club. In April 1994, an agreement
was reached with external bondholders on arrears of about US$472 million. In April 1993, the
Government initiated negotiations with commercial banks on debt restructuring; however, the
parties were unable to reach a financially viable agreement prior to the May 1994 elections.

IFI's                640            February, 1992    Arrears accumulated up to 1990 were fully paid in 1992.
In 1991, debt service was resumed.
Paris Club           453            March, 1992    Arrears of US$38 million were paid upfront, and US$415 million
equivalent were rescheduled over 10 years, with 5 years grace.
Commercial Bonds      472           April, 1994    Up-front payment on PDI of US$44 million, with US$428 million
Interest Arrears     188                          exchanged for eight-year bonds, of which US$418 million were
Principal Arrears    253                          denominated in US dollars, with an interest rate of LIBOR+ 1 %, and
Scheduled Principal   30                          US$10 million in yen with an annual interest rate of 3.75%.
II. PANAMA'S ECONOMIC PROGRAM AND EXTERNAL DEBT STRATEGY
9.     The Administration  inaugurated  in  September 1994  has made great headway  in
implementing the reforms needed to consolidate fiscal and external balance, and to redress the
pervasive price distortions that are preventing the economy from realizing its development
potential, and causing high unemployment and widespread poverty. Moreover, the scope and
depth of the public enterprise, tax, labor market, and trade reforms which the Government is
carrying out go beyond the actions agreed in these areas in the ERL. Full normalization of
relations with external creditors forms an integral part of the Government's economic program.
10.    Macroeconomic Framework and Performance. In 1995, the nonfinancial public sector
(NFPS) registered a deficit (accrual basis) of an estimated 0.6% of GDP. Inflation was less than
1%, which marked the seventh consecutive year in which domestic was less than external
inflation. This, coupled with the further depreciation of the US dollar against reserve currencies,
led to a depreciation of Panama's real effective exchange rate of about 4%, following a
cumulative depreciation of 18% during 1989-94. The current account deficit (commitment basis)
is estimated to have declined to about 6.5% of GDP in 1995 from about 7% in 1994, due
primarily to a recovery of exports from the downturn registered in 1994, and despite a decline in
service income from U.S. Defense Department activities. The overall balance of payments
(excluding arrears accumulation) recorded a deficit of an estimated 2% of GDP; but net external



- 4 -
financing, including accumulation of arrears, reached about 5% of GDP, enabling the NFPS to
augment its net deposits at the National Bank of Panama (BNP) by 3 percentage points of GDP.
At end-1995, the public and publicly-guaranteed extemal debt was an estimated US$5.8 billion, or
78% of GDP (against 81% in 1994); about US$3.8 billion was owed to commercial banks,
US$0.7 billion to IFIs, US$0.7 billion to bilaterals, and the remainder to bondholders (US$0.4
billion) and suppliers (US$0.2 billion).3
11.   Despite the favorable evolution of these indicators, real GDP growth decelerated to an
estimated 3.5% in 1995 from 4.7% in 1994, while the unemployment rate edged-up to 14%.
Growth continued to decelerate sharply across all the sectors which led the economic recovery,
especially construction (in which growth declined to an estimated 3% in 1995 from 32% in 1993),
the Colon Free Zone (to 5% from 14.5%), manufacturing (to 3% from 7%) and the International
Banking Center (to 5% from 11%). In some sectors the slowdown appears to have been
accentuated by uncertainty over the outcome of major changes to tax, labor, trade and state
enterprise legislation initiated in 1994. The underlying causes of this slow growth, however, are
pronounced price distortions and deficient basic services which have kept trend growth well under
3% for the past two decades, and which the Government's reform program is now redressing.
12.   Fiscal Policies and Public Sector Finances. The 1996 budget approved by the
Legislative Assembly targets a shift in NFPS operations to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP (exclusive
of expected privatization proceeds of 3.2% of GDP), with NFPS savings targeted to rise to 5.1%
from 3.4% of GDP in 1995. This result would be achieved through a reduction in external
interest obligations by an estimated 2.3% of GDP as a result of the DDSR operation, and
containment of the wage bill through a continuation of the hiring freeze (excluding the health,
education and security sectors, which are subject to constitutional provisions) and the wage freeze
(other than the automatic wage adjustments mandated by the special labor laws). This program is
being supported by the IMF SBA as well as by the ERL. Consolidation of long-term fiscal
balance hinges on bringing public sector wage bill growth and social security spending under
effective Government control. To this end, the Government is preparing, with the support of the
ERL technical assistance component, a General Public Sector Wage bill that would replace the
special public sector labor laws and introduce a merit-based civil service. The Authorities plan to
submit the bill to the Assembly in June 1996, and implement the new employment and wage
policies in the 1997 budget. A bill to liquidate the insolvent Complementary Pension Fund (CPF)
for state employees, also being prepared with the support of the ERL, would be submitted to the
Assembly in June, 1996, together with the General Public Sector Wage bill and associated reforms
to the special labor laws. The new pension policies also are expected to be implemented in the
1997 budget. This solution would gradually eliminate CPF-related Government transfers (about
0.4% of GDP in 1995) and significantly improve equity of social expenditures. In addition, by
September 1996, the Government intends to prepare a proposal for the reform of the Social
Security System.
13.   Tax Reform. In July 1995, the Legislative Assembly approved the Fiscal Incentives
Harmonization Law, which significantly reduces distortions and allocative inefficiencies caused by
the tax system, while enhancing fiscal sustainability. This Law, also prepared with support of the

preferential import tariff of 3%; increases the tax rate on traders in the Colon Free Zone from a
range of 2.5-8.5% to 15%; phases-out the generous tax credit for nontraditional exports, and
reduces home mortgage subsidies through more narrow targeting.
14.   Basic Services and Infrastructure. The Government reform program in basic services,
which is being supported by the IDB and the Bank, is focusing on regulatory reform,
contestability and privatization by: (i) separating policy formulation, regulatory and service
delivery functions within each subsector and restructuring operating entities along commercial
lines in accordance with private corporate law; and (ii) unbundling the operations of utilities and
public works entities to enable competition in those aspects of service delivery which do not
possess natural monopoly characteristics, and opening each subsector to private participation.
15.   To this end, in telecommunications, in February 1995, the Legislative Assembly approved
a law which provides for the incorporation and partial privatization of the telecommunications
firm, and in July 1995, approved a law which effectively opens the cellular telephone market to
the private sector. In January 1996, the Assembly approved the General Telecommunications Law
and in February 1996, the Basic Services Regulatory Entity Law (telecoms, electricity, water and
sanitation). In electricity, in February 1995, the Assembly approved an amendment to the
electricity company charter law that opens the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity to the private sector, and the Government has initiated a BOO structure for private
developers for a 100MW thermal power plant. The General Electricity bill, being prepared with
World Bank support, is expected to be submitted to the Assembly in the second quarter of 1996.
In water and sanitation, with the support of the IDB, the Government is preparing a General
Water and Sanitation bill that would permit private participation in the sector, for submission to
the Assembly in the second quarter of 1996. In the port sector, all of the state port authority's
(APN) service delivery functions will be transferred to private operators, and APN will be
transformed into a regulatory entity through. legislation to be submitted to the Legislative
Assembly in the second quarter of 1996. The transfer to private operators of all the installations in
the main state ports still managed and operated by APN is also to be completed by during that
period. In addition, contracts for ownership, construction and operation of four new ports have
been signed with private operators. Manzanillo, a US$100 million state-of-the-art private
container port and trans-shipment facility, developed with the support of IFC, commenced
operations in 1995, is Panama's main port facility, and is enabling the country to begin to realize
its potential as an international maritime transport center. The Government also is focusing on
rehabilitation, deregulation and private participation in transport infrastructure. Concessions have
been awarded to foreign firms to construct and operate tollroads between Panama City and
Colon, and between the international airport and Panama City. Finally, in December 1995, the
Legislative Assembly approved a new Public Procurement Law, which brings public sector
procurement procedures more in line with international standards.
16.   Labor Market Reform. In August 1995, the Legislative Assembly overhauled the highly
restrictive Labor Code, curbing the intervention of Government in employer-employee relations
and giving employers more flexibility to determine wages, to tailor employment to market
conditions, and to reassign employees within the firm.
17.   Trade Reform. In addition to the improvements introduced by the Fiscal Incentives
Harmonization Law, the Government has completed almost all the bilateral negotiations required
for the accession of Panama to the World Trade Organization (WTO); upon entry into the WTO,
which is expected in mid-1996, nominal tariffs will be reduced from the current range of 0-90% to



-6 -
0-40% (with the exception of tariffs on certain agricultural commodities), and to a range of 0-
30% within five years, while nontariff barriers will be consolidated in the new tariff structure. In
December 1995, the Cabinet issued a decree which significantly reduces tariffs on the main
agricultural commodities and eliminates nontariff barriers to the import of these products.
18.   Price Deregulation. In December 1994, the Government issued a decree which relaxes
rent controls, and in December 1995, issued a series of resolutions which remove remaining
price controls on the main agricultural commodities. In January 1996, the Legislative Assembly
approved a law that would further curb barriers to competition by abolishing the Price Control
Office, institute anti-trust norms, and introduce anti-dumping provisions in line with WTO
standards. At the sector level, the monopoly affecting the transport of goods to and from the CFZ
has been declared illegal by the Supreme Court; entry into the trucking industry is being
liberalized, and the Government plans to reform the highly regulated domestic petroleum market.
19.   Poverty Reduction. The Government's strategy for mitigating poverty and inequality
rests on the introduction of conditions that will revive sustainable growth and retargeting social
spending to the poor. In this context, the economic program emphasizes reform policies that will
mitigate the bias against employment creation and reduce the high cost of the consumption
basket. In addition, the incentive framework will be altered so as to encourage increased
agricultural production and employment opportunities in the countryside, where most of the poor
are located. The Government also is instituting new mechanisms to protect those most susceptible
to malnutrition and vector-transmitted diseases, through the Social Emergency Fund (SEF), and
improving efficiency and equity in social expenditures through sector reforms, especially in
education and health; instituting cost recovery, and targeting subsidies to the most vulnerable
groups. The Bank is supporting these efforts through the ERL; the Rural Health Project; the
proposed Basic Education Project; the proposed SEF Project; the proposed Land Management
and Rural Poverty project; and a Poverty Assessment.
20.   External Debt Strategy. Integral to the Government's economic program is a strategy to
fully normalize relations with creditors, restore Panama's creditworthiness and create a climate
conducive to foreign investment. To this end, the Administration initiated informal conversations
with the commercial banks upon taking office in September 1994, resumed formal negotiations
with the BAC in December 1994, and moved rapidly to achieve a comprehensive agreement that
would significantly reduce the debt stock; bring future debt service payments into line with the
economy's projected debt service capacity; and shield future commercial debt service payments
from interest rate and exchange rate risk. From the outset the Government was also cognizant of
the need to achieve an agreement that would be cost effective as well as financially viable given
prevailing resource constraints. Indeed, the need for official support for DDSR played an
important role in the speed with which the Government has moved on outstanding structural
adjustment issues.  In line with its strategy, the Government also is negotiating with non-Paris
Club bilaterals (Mexico and Venezuela) to restructure about US$280 million in medium-term
debt, including arrears of about US$248 million. Additionally, on December 27, 1995, the
Legislative Assembly approved Panama's accession to MIGA, and ratified the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes, further strengthening guarantees to foreign investors.

m. THE DDSR AGREEMENT
21.    On May 5, 1995, the Republic of  Panama and the BAC  achieved an agreement in
principle on a DDSR operation. On October 4, 1995, the term sheet was issued; the expected
closing date is April 30, 1996. The DDSR operation is comprehensive, and reduces debt and debt
service through a menu of options for exchanging eligible debt for new instruments, and
substantial PDI forgiveness. This section details the main provisions of and creditor response to
the DDSR agreement; closing costs and financing sources; and its debt service implications.
22.    Eligible Debt. The DDSR operation encompasses all medium- and long-term  commercial
bank debt contracted by the Government and state entities. Eligible debt is about US$3.9 billion
(including about US$2 billion of PDI), or nearly 70%  of Panarna's public and publicly guaranteed
external debt (Table 2 below). Eligible debt includes all principal arrears and PDI as of the closing
date, as well as remaining scheduled principal on medium- and long-term commercial bank loans,
which falls due during the rest of 1996 and in 1997.4 The eligible debt almost doubled between
1987, when Panama ceased to service this debt, and the expected closing date.

23.    Menu of Options. The DDSR  menu offers creditors four options for exchanging their
principal claims (Table 3 below). The operation treats PDI separately. Each of the options is
freely available to holders of debt titles on a voluntary basis, and the options selected are not
subject to reallocation. No creditor, however, will be permitted to participate in the Agreement
unless it does so with all of its eligible debt. These options are:
(i) Par Bonds (registered) at below-market interest rates, commencing at 3% in year one
and rising to 5.5% in years eleven through thirty, with a bullet payment upon maturity (30 years);
(ii) Discount Bonds (registered) with a discount of 45%, at an interest rate of LIBOR plus
13/16%, with a bullet payment upon maturity (30 years);
(iii) Front-Loaded Interest Reduction Bonds (registered) at below-market interest rates
during years one through seven, commencing at 3.5% in year one and gradually rising to 5% in
year seven, and at the six-month LIBOR plus 13/16% thereafter, with a maturity of 18 years and a
grace period of 5 years; and
4 Eligible debt also includes US$19 mnillion in contingent liabilities. In December 1995, Panama also reached an agreement to
restructure remaining commercial arrears (US$44 million in short-term credits): US$10 million in PDI was paid upfront,
another US$10 million PDI payment will be made in April 1996, and the principal was rescheduled over four years.

(iv) New Money Option: Creditors who select the new money option will purchase Debt
Conversion Bonds equal to the full face amount of principal tendered in the exchange and also
will commit to purchase an amount of New Money Bonds equal to 10% of the eligible debt
exchanged for Debt Conversion Bonds by such creditor, on the terms indicated in Table 3.

Source: Republic of Panama, 1995 Financing Plan (October 4,1995), and Panama. MIPPE.
24.    The principal of the discount and par bonds will be collateralized in full by the pledge of
30 year U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds delivered on the closing date. Payment of nine months
of interest would be secured on a rolling basis by the pledge of cash or permitted investments
delivered on the closing date. Panama will pledge additional cash or permitted investments so
that, on the third anniversary of the issuance of these bonds, the payment of twelve months of
interest would be so secured. The principal of the FLIRBs is not collateralized. Until the seventh



-9 -
anniversary after closing, payment of 6 months of interest on the FLIRBs would be collateralized
on a rolling basis by the pledge of cash or permitted investments delivered on the closing date.
Earnings on the collateral accounts would accrue to Panama once the collateral requirements are
satisfied. Applications will be made to list all bonds on the Luxembourg stock exchange.
25.   The agreement restructures PDI by means of: (i) PDI forgiveness; (ii) partial PDI
payments prior to closing; (iii) a downpayment on PDI at closing; and (iv) a PDI bond for
remaining PDI. A major component of debt reduction would be obtained through a recalculation
of interest on principal at market rates (six-month LIBOR plus 13/16%) and of interest on such
interest at the one-month LIBOR instead of contractual rates, and by waiving all contractual
penalties. This favorable treatment results in PDI forgiveness of US$590 million. During June-
December 1995, Panama made partial payments on PDI totaling US$24 million, and will make a
further payment of US$6 million at the end of March, 1996. At closing, Panama will make a
US$100 million downpayment on PDI. Remaining PDI (US$1248 million) would be exchanged
for PDI Bonds. These bonds would carry a maturity of twenty years, a grace period of ten years,
and an interest rate of the six month LIBOR plus 13/16% per annum. During the first six years
following the closing date, Panama will have the option to capitalize a portion of accrued interest
in an amount up to the difference (if positive) between LIBOR plus 13/16% per annum and 4%
per annum. The PDI bond is a back-loaded amortization instrument: For installments 1 to 8, each
semi-annual principal payment will be equal to 2% of the outstanding principal; for installments 9
to 11, to 3%; and for installments 12-21, 7.5%. The PDI bond is not collateralized.
26.   Creditor Response and Allocation of Debt. Creditors responded to the 1995 Financing
Plan with commitments for 98.5% of the debt eligible by the November 14, 1995 date requested
by Panama: 81.9% of these commitments was allocated to the FLIRBs; 13.6% to the par bonds,
and 4.5% to the discount bonds (Table 4 below). While this allocation results in less debt and
debt service reduction than a balanced one, it also results in considerably lower up-front costs.

27.   Total and Upfront Costs. The total costs of closing the DDSR agreement would amount
to an estimated US$226 million, of which US$193 million would be paid to creditors on the
closing date (Table 5 below). Of the total cost, US$130 million corresponds to payments on PDI,
consisting of a US$100 million PDI downpayment that Panama would effect on the closing date,
and US$30 million in partial PDI payments made during June, 1995-March, 1996. The remainder
is composed of the cost of the collateral for the discount bonds (US$12 million), the par bonds
(US$56 million), and the FLIRBs (US$29 million). The principal collateral (US$55.3 million) has
already been purchased. The cost of the interest collateral is predetermined at 5.25% of the
discount exchange, 2.3% of the par exchange, and 1.77% of the FLIRB exchange.

28.    Financing and Sources of Official Support. The Government has requested support
from the World Bank, the IMF and the IDB to help finance the costs of DDSR. On November
29, 1995, the IMF approved a 15-month Stand-by Arrangement (SBA), for SDR 69.8 million to
support the Government's economic program and DDSR. The SBA includes set asides (25% of
each purchase), and would accommodate an augmentation of the SBA, to support the DDSR. It
is expected that the request for Augmentation of the SBA (by SDR 14 million) and release of the
accumulated set asides (SDR 5.8 million) would be presented to the IMF Board on March 20,
1996. On December 13, 1995, the IDB approved a DDSR Loan of US$30 million to Panama.
Disbursement is contingent, inter alia, on the approval by the IMF of the DDSR Augmentation
and release of the accumulated set-asides, and the approval by the World Bank of a DDSR loan.
The proposed World Bank loan of US$30 million to support the DDSR operation would be
structured as a free-standing instrument. The Government would finance the remaining upfront
costs of the DDSR agreement, estimated at US$103 million, as well as the additional costs of
about US$30 million, from its own resources (Table 5 above). The Government recently has
strengthened its net deposits at the BNP by meeting the second tranche release conditions of the
IDB Public Enterprise Reform Loan (US$35 million), and achieving compliance with the second
tranche release conditions of the World Bank ERL (US$25 million), which also would trigger the
release of the second tranche (US$27 million) of a Japan OECF loan which cofinances the ERL.
29.    Debt Service Implications. The DDSR operation results in three phases of debt service:
(i) the first five years, when only interest payments are due on the DDSR instruments; (ii) years 6
to 20, when amortization payments on both the PDI bonds and the FLIRBs are made; and (iii)
years 21 to 30, when, following the retirement of the PDI bonds, the FLIRBs and amortization of
official loans, interest payments are due only on the discount and par bonds (Table 6 below).

IV. EVALUATION OF THE DDSR OPERATION
30.    This section analyzes the DDSR operation in respect of its: (i) debt reduction equivalent;
(ii) financial savings as compared to a market buyback; (iii) material benefits; and (iv) impact on
debt management and creditworthiness.5 Implementation of the DDSR operation would:
(i) restructure almost 70% of Panama's public and publicly guaranteed debt;
(ii) result in a debt reduction equivalent (DRE) of US$1209 million, or 31% of the
eligible commercial debt and 19% of total public and publicly-guaranteed debt;
(iii) achieve this debt reduction at a savings amounting to about 10.7% of Panama's GDP
compared to the cost of a market-based debt reduction;
(iv) yield cash flow savings of US$917 million in 1996-2026 in net present value terms,
or 12.4% of GDP, compared to counter-factual debt service, resulting in an IRR of 18%;
(v) generate net benefits, potentially reaching 10.7% of GDP;
(vi) reduce interest rate risk, by changing 53% of eligible debt into fixed-rate instruments
and reduce exchange rate risk by converting 17% of the debt denominated in non-US
currencies into US dollars;
(vii) within a reduced overall debt burden, curtail Panama's flexibility to adjust future debt
service obligations to shocks, inasmuch as 70% of Panama's external debt heretofore
subject to rescheduling would be transformed into bonds; and
(vii) augment the relative exposure of the IFIs, from 12 to 18% of Panama's public debt.

SecM92-296, March 9, 1992. See also World Bank (1995). Prograrn Completion Report. Argentina: Debt and Debt
Service Reduction Loan (Loan 3555-AR). Report No. 13885.

A. Financial Analysis
31.   Extent of Debt Reduction. The DDSR results in a DRE of US$1209 million or 31% of
eligible debt (see Table 7 below).6 This DRE is composed of: (i) a decrease in the face value of
commercial debt of about US$730 million, as a result of: (a) the downpayment at closing of PDI
(US$100 million), (b) partial PDI forgiveness (US$590 million), and (c) an exchange of 4.5% of
principal at a discount of 45% (US$40 million); (ii) the principal prepayment equivalent of
collateral placed beyond Panama's reach (US$96 million); and (iii) the net present value of
interest service reduction through the par bond and FLIRB exchanges (US$383 million).
32.   This DRE of eligible commercial bank debt is relatively low compared to the average
(35%) secured in previous DDSRs. First, the relatively high market price of the debt prior to the
agreement placed a relatively low ceiling on potential DRE. In fact, the pre-deal price of
Panamanian debt (55 cents) was far above the average for other DDSR countries (34 cents). (See
Table 8 below.) The strength of the pre-deal price stemmed in part from the lengthy period of
time that has elapsed since announcement of the Brady plan (subsequent to that date secondary
market debt prices generally have recovered) and in part from the stronger fiscal/balance of
payments position of Panama relative to other Brady countries. Second, the recent drop in
international interest rates vis-a-vis the DDSR interest rate caps lowered the DRE. At the interest
rates obtaining when the Agreement in Principle was issued (May 5, 1995), the DRE would have
been 32.7% (with actual commitment allocations). Third, the low share (32%) of eligible debt still
owned by the BAC limited its ability to negotiate debt reduction: in particular, it precluded the
inclusion of a mandatory rebalancing clause in the DDSR agreement. Fourth, the unexpectedly
high share of commitments to the FLIRBs reduced the DRE relative to a balanced allocation.7
This result also reflects the relative confidence of investors in Panama's long-term  economic
prospects and creditworthiness (FLIRB principal is not collateralized), as well as the growing
preference of traders for high-yielding instruments in emerging markets. Finally, Panama's poor
track record in meeting commitments to commercial creditors likely curtailed its negotiating
capacity--Panama had not made any service payment on this debt since 1987; was one of the two
countries to have defaulted on an international bond issue during the debt crisis; and almost all
eligible countries had already concluded DDSR agreements.
33.   Nonetheless, the DDSR results in a total DRE (net of additional official financing) of
Panama's total public and publicly guaranteed debt of 19%, a reduction greater than that achieved
in previous agreements (16%). Moreover, total DRE amounts to 15% of Panama's GDP, or a
proportion several times the average in previous operations (5%). Although Panama obtained a
DRE of eligible debt below the average for previous countries, the DDSR operation is crucial to
Panama's future growth prospects due to the heavy weight of commercial debt in Panama's total
debt, and to the large debt overhang affecting the economy.
6 This DRE reflects the actual allocation of eligible debt (see Table 4 above) and interest rates prevailing on February 1, 1996.
By convention, the DRE excludes the DDSR agreement PDI payments (US$30 million) made prior to closing.
7 With a balanced commitment allocation, and using February 1, 1996 interest rates, the DRE would have been 40.2%;
however, upfront costs would have been US$366 million rather than the actual figure of US$226 million. Furthermore,
in this case the buy-back equivalent price of the operation would have been higher than the secondary market price
prevailing prior to the DDSR Agreement in Principle.

34.   Comprehensiveness of the DDSR Operation. The DDSR operation achieved debt relief
at a substantially lower financial cost to Panama than a market-based debt reduction would have
entailed, as the comprehensiveness of the menu approach virtually eliminated the free rider
problem associated with a market-based debt reduction. In effect, the DDSR occurred at an
average market price of 60 cents on the dollar, or a price about 25% lower than the post-deal
price at which an open market operation with a like amount of debt reduction could occur, which
is similar to the average in previous DDSR operations (Table 8 above).8 The resulting savings
compared to a market-based debt reduction are about US$792 million, or 10.7% of GDP. These
savings are several times greater than those garnered by other countries through DDSR (3% of
GDP on average). At the same time, Panama obtained 81% of the overall benefits generated by
the operation, compared to an average of 59% for previous DDSR operations. The DDSR also is
cost effective, as measured by the IMF.
8 The post-deal price is approximated by the price of the non-collateralized portion of the creditors' new portfolio. This
stripped price is calculated as the market value of the new instniments minus the principal prepayment equivalent of the
collateral, divided by the face value of the new instruments minus the DRE. World Debt Tables 1993-94, Vol. 1, Box 2.3.

B. Material Benefits
35.      Evaluating  the  material benefits--the  direct cash  flow   implications  and  the  indirect
development impact--of the DDSR operation requires explicit assumptions about the course of
action that the Government and its creditors would have otherwise pursued. Clearly, if it were
assumed that Panama would continue to accumulate arrears indefinitely in the absence of a DDSR
operation, the effect of DDSR on Panama's cash flow position would be negative. The indirect
benefits of DDSR as compared to such a scenario, however, would be strongly positive, resulting
in overall positive net benefits. In effect, the strong economic recovery achieved by Panama
during the past five years was in large part the result of the progressive restoration of domestic
and international investor confidence in the country--as evinced by the dramatic turnaround in
capital flows (including the return of flight capital). This was secured partly on the basis of the
normalization of relationships with creditors commencing in 1991, and partly on the basis of
market expectations that Panama would fully restore these relationships in the medium-term. Had
this not been the case, the economic recovery would have been a slow and painful process--
without the restoration of confidence, it is unclear how the money supply, which plunged an
estimated 30% during 1987-89, would have been replenished. Similarly, a decision to continue to
accumulate commercial arrears rather than regain creditworthiness through DDSR would prevent



- 16 -
the economy from reaping significant benefits from fiscal and structural reforms because it would
rapidly destroy the confidence of domestic and foreign investors in the economy, possibly
resulting in demonetization and stagnation (and undermining support for reform).
36.    As a result of such considerations, re-establishment of creditworthiness has been an
integral part of the economic program from the outset, and the current Administration has moved
rapidly to achieve this goal. Consequently, a counterfactual rooted in the extrapolation of the past
history of commercial arrears accumulation lacks plausibility and must be rejected. Comparing the
direct effects of DDSR to scheduled debt service also is an implausible counterfactual because
this debt is scheduled to be amortized by 1997. In light of these considerations, and following the
approach adopted in the Board documents for all DDSR operations supported by the Bank since
1992, when this type of analysis was introduced, two counterfactuals could be considered: a
MYRA or a debt rollover with full interest service. The DDSR provides greater debt service
relief when compared to a MYRA, because the debt would be amortized much quicker in a
MYRA. Taking this as an upper bound, the counterfactual selected to assess the debt service
relief from DDSR is full interest service, with a debt rollover (i.e., exchange of existing
commercial debt for a 30-year bullet maturity instrument at LIBOR plus 13/16%).9
37.    Direct Benefits. In the initial year, when the upfront costs of DDSR are incurred, the
liquidity impact of DDSR as compared to the debt rollover counterfactual is highly negative
(US$103 million). (See Table 9 above.) During 1997-2000, however, DDSR would provide
annual debt service relief of about US$76 million compared to the counterfactual, due to lower
interest payments. During 2001-2016, debt service relief would be negative (US$72 million per
year), because the FLlRBs and PDI bonds would be amortized. Subsequently, debt service relief
would turn sharply positive (US$621 million annually) because only US$316 million of the par
and discount bonds remain to be amortized. During the entire 1996-2026 period, DDSR would
provide debt service relief of US$917 million in net present value ternis, or about 12.4% of GDP.
38.    Efficiency of Debt Enhancement Funds. The IRR of the operation is about 18%  as
against the counterfactual, which is above the cost at which Panama could borrow the
enhancement funds and the critical level employed in the Bank's project lending. 10 Gross benefits
consist of the: (i) flow of debt service relief under the counterfactual; (ii) interest earnings on
interest collateral accounts; and (iii) funds to be released from the FLIRB collateral account in
2003, and the par and discount bond accounts in 2026. Gross costs include the: (i) US$96 million
collateral cost and US$100 million PDI payment; and (ii) debt service on the new instruments.
39.    Indirect Benefits. The magnitude of the indirect benefits of DDSR depends on the extent
to which economic reforms redress domestic causes of the debt overhang. The Government's
reform program is eliminating these causes. At the same time, DDSR is expected to substantially
9 Clearly, in a post-Brady world, it would make little sense for Panama (or any other Brady-eligible country) to agree to
anything less than a DDSR operation. Nonetheless, a debt rollover would be an alternative far superior to continued
arrears accumulation, owing to the strongly adverse development impact of the latter course of action. Finally, it also
should be noted that the selection of variants of full debt service counterfactuals has been critiqued on the grounds that
they are inconsistent with market expectations of partial default, as reflected in the discount in the secondary market price
of commercial debt prior to DDSR. This argument has considerable merit, but in all cases post-DDSR market prices for
exchanged debt have remained below par, which suggests that the market continues to expect some degree of default. (In
other words, market-consistent counterfactuals would compare discounted DDSR debt service streams against discounted
MYRA or rollover debt service streams to measure debt service relief).
Against a MYRA counterfactual, the IRR of the DDSR operation would be 32%. With the balanced allocation discussed in
foonote 6 above, and against a rollover counterfactual, the IRR would have been 20%.

enhance the effectiveness of the reform program in accelerating growth to potential and reducing
poverty. Indeed, without DDSR the reform program would not significantly improve Panama's
long-run development prospects. The DDSR operation would achieve this result by: (i)
substantially reducing market uncertainty over Panama's ability and willingness to fully service its
external debt, and the sizable distortions and costs this uncertainty entails; (ii) offsetting the
adverse effect on the investment climate and flows deriving from the disengagement of the U.S.
from the Canal and former Canal Zone; and (iii) reducing the debt overhang and the associated
"tax" on future output, which also acts as a disincentive to reform efforts and private investment.
40.   The DDSR operation would alleviate market uncertainty over Panama's capacity and
willingness to service its debt by: (i) eliminating Panama's arrears and normalizing its relations
with commercial creditors; (ii) reducing the present value of debt service payments by 19%; (iii)
shielding 53% of commercial interest obligations from interest rate risk and all commercial
obligations from exchange rate risk; and (iv) transforming commercial loans into bonds, thereby
allaying concerns about future reschedulings and rendering actual payments more predictable.
Official support for DDSR should further curtail market uncertainty, by ensuring a credible
financing plan, both for the upfront costs of the operation and future financing requirements, and
by signaling that the Government is undertaking the reforms needed to revive sustainable growth,
and restore and maintain creditworthiness. Finally, market uncertainty should subside because the
cost of debt service default in a post-DDSR world would rise dramatically, providing a strong
incentive for Panama to meet the debt service obligations assumed under the DDSR operation.
41.   Substantially reduced market uncertainty would translate into appreciable benefits to
Panama by reducing the sovereign risk premium and real domestic interest rates, and by restoring
Panama's access to international capital markets on competitive terms and maturities for both
public and private sector borrowers, providing an environment conducive to the recovery of
Panama's International Banking Center, increasing net resource transfers from abroad, investment
and growth. Following the pattern of other Brady countries, Panama plans to seek a rating from
the major international credit rating agencies to establish relative creditworthiness after the
conclusion of the DDSR operation. Assignment of the rating and improved grading which should
result, would expand external funding access for corporate issuers for whom the sovereign rating
acts as a benchmark. While direct commercial bank lending to Panama may not resume for some
time, renewed commercial lending for project finance and growing direct foreign investment could
be expected to play a key role in upgrading Panama's dilapidated infrastructure and developing
the reverted areas thanks to DDSR. In capital-constrained countries like Panama, improved
access to foreign savings also results in efficiency gains because additional financing can be used
for high return investments. This impact would be especially significant for Panama because the
monetary regime makes it more difficult to shift resources from nontradeables to tradeables.
42.   Another key consideration in evaluating the potential indirect effects of the DDSR
operation on Panama is the positive impact it would exercise on the investment climate in light of
the disengagement of the U.S. from the administration of the Canal and of the U.S. Defense
Department from the former Canal Zone.
43.   Increasing output of a highly indebted country like Panama enables creditors to extract
proportionally higher actual debt repayments. This debt overhang "tax" directly reduces income
relative to output, and acts as a disincentive to private investment and growth-enhancing policies.
The DDSR operation would increase welfare by reducing the debt overhang tax, provided it
reduces the net present value of expected service on risky debt. Valued at the pre-deal price of 55



- 18 -
cents, eligible debt under the Panama DDSR amounted to about US$2.1 billion, or 29.1% of
GDP. In December 1995, the market value of risky commercial debt--the noncollateralized
portion of the creditors' new portfolio--was about US$2 billion, or 27% of GDP. This implies a
reduction in the average debt overhang tax of about 2.1% of GDP and a declining marginal tax as
output rises, and a higher return to growth-enhancing policies. This benefit, in turn, reinforces the
incentives for the adoption of such policies. This positive incentive is larger than the above
figures suggest because the DDSR bonds establish a much lower debt service profile as compared
to the situation in which ongoing amortization payments would immediately capture an upside
shock favoring the country.
44.   A number of countries (e.g., especially Mexico) which have concluded DDSR operations
have realized significant indirect fiscal savings through the effect of DDSR in lowering real
domestic interest rates and fiscal outlays on domestic debt service. This specific indirect fiscal
effect is not relevant in the case of Panama due to the absence of exchange rate risk and debt
dominated in domestic currency; however, real lending rates are high in Panama (about 10%), and
DDSR should reduce these toward real international rates by reducing sovereign risk premium,
and fostering increasing flows of debt and equity financing to Panama, as argued above. At the
same time, the discipline imposed on public debt management authorities from market-determined
prices of debt instruments should facilitate transition to market-based internal debt management
practices.  Moreover, the previous and the present Administration have been undertaking
substantial fiscal adjustments, in anticipation of the material benefits of DDSR.
45.   The recent evolution of forward looking market-based indicators is suggestive of the
indirect benefits of DDSR, inasmuch as these financial variables tend to adjust quickly to new
information regarding the future (Figure 1 below). Especially relevant are secondary market debt
prices, stock market prices, and country credit ratings because they tend to adjust immediately to
new information. Remarkably, the price of Panamanian debt on the secondary market has climbed
49% since the announcement of the DDSR Agreement in Principle in May 1995, from 49 cents to
73 cents, in December 1995. This is a clear-cut indication that the market expects DDSR to
generate substantial indirect benefits for Panama (even discounting external factors that resulted in
a general, albeit considerably lower, increase in Brady bond prices during this period). Also, since
November 1, 1995, when the when-and-if issued Panama Brady instruments began to trade, the
spread of the FLIRB over the equivalent maturity U.S. Treasury stripped bond has systematically
declined, from more than 1100 to less than 700 basis points (in early February 1996). This further
indicates that the market's perception of Panama's sovereign risk has improved as a result of
DDSR. 1 In addition, the country's creditworthiness, as measured by the semi-annual rating of the
Institutional Investor, has been trending upward relative to the global average. Domestically, the
stock exchange also has registered gains (about 6% in dollar terms since May 1995), but this
market is very thin. In line with improved creditworthiness, net external transfers to Panama rose
from 3% to an estimated 4.7% of GDP during 1994-95.
46.   Net Material Benefits. The net material benefits of DDSR that would accrue to Panama
may be estimated on the basis of changes in market valuations of eligible debt between the pre-
and post-deal periods, as compared to the average price at which the DDSR operation was
consummated. In an open market buy-back creditors could be expected to capture all benefits
resulting from the debt overhang. The difference between the pre- and post-deal market prices of

difference between the break-even and the post-deal prices provides an indicator of the benefits
which accrued to the country, while the difference between the break-even and the pre-deal prices
provides an indicator of the benefits which accrued to commercial creditors. Panama obtained
80% of these benefits, amounting to about US$792 million, or 10.7% of GDP.

C. Macroeconomic Outlook
47.      Short-term  Prospects. The policy measures which the Government is carrying out with
the support of the IFIs should further strengthen the macroeconomic framework in 1996, and
begin to boost economic growth toward the potential rate of expansion. The 1996 Budget targets
a shift in NFPS balance to a surplus of 0.4% of GDP (excluding expected proceeds of 3% of
GDP from the privatization of the telecoms entity), with an increase in both savings and
investment, especially in infrastructure and the social sectors. Central Government current
expenditure is projected to decline by 2.3 percentage points of GDP in 1996, through a reduction
in external interest obligations and containment of the wage bill. Inflation is projected to remain
about 1%, while the current account balance of payments deficit is projected to decline to about
4% of GDP thanks to the relief obtained through the DDSR operation. Net external financing of
the NFPS is projected to be positive for the first time in a decade, as a result of the expected
progress in implementing policy-based loans, including those to finance the upfront costs of the
DDSR, and an acceleration in the implementation of WFI-financed investment projects which
recently have come on stream. Net private capital inflows are projected to grow sharply in 1996,
thanks to privatization receipts, the reduction in the sovereign risk premium, and as the
development of the areas reverting to Panama under the Canal treaties gets underway. As a
result, the overall balance of payments is projected to register a surplus equivalent to 3% of GDP.

48.   The appreciable decline in interest rates that has taken place during the last part of 1995
should increase the demand for money. This should accelerate the expansion of domestic credit
to the private sector, and foster higher growth in imports and interest rate-sensitive sectors in
1996. The budgeted increase in externally-supported public investment in infrastructure, and the
initiation of a number of important private projects (in ports, mining, telecommunications and
tourism) also should impart more dynamism to the economy. Finally, as economic agents begin to
adjust to the new incentive framework, both investment in and output of tradeables should rise.
49.   Medium- and Long-Term Outlook. The long-term benefits of the DDSR operation can
be illustrated by modeling macroeconomic performance under this scenario and comparing them
to the projected results under the counterfactual (Table 10 above). Economic growth under the
DDSR is projected to rise 1 percentage point of GDP during 1996-2000 to 4.5% per annum, and
to 5.3% during 2001-04. This would occur on the strength of projected increases in the rates of
national savings and domestic investment, as well as through greater efficiency of investment, in
response to the elimination of policy distortions and improved creditworthiness. Such growth
would represent a substantial improvement over the 1981-95 trend (less than 3%) as well as
projected growth under the counterfactual. While higher growth would be financed mainly by a
stepped-up domestic savings effort (public as well as private) under this scenario, as reflected in
the projected decline of the current account deficit to an average of 3.8% of GDP during 1996-
2000 and 2.6% during 2001-04, the quality of net external resource transfers would improve
dramatically, as arrears accumulation is replaced by growing foreign direct investment and,
eventually, private commercial capital inflows. Official net disbursements are projected to
continue to play an important role during 1997-98, before declining to an amount equivalent to
less than 15%, on average, of total net external financing during 1999-2004. (See Annex I.)
D. Creditworthiness and Debt Management
50.   Reduced Debt Burden. DDSR would facilitate debt management and substantially
enhance Panama's creditworthiness by increasing its capacity and willingness to service its debt,
both directly (through debt reduction) and indirectly (through enhanced economic performance).
In 1996, the DDSR operation would lower total public and publicly-guaranteed debt by 11.4
percentage points of GDP, to about 67%; and diminish debt service payments by 10.6 percentage
points of exports of goods and nonfactor services, to 17.6%, and by almost 13 percentage points
of nonfinancial sector public revenues, to 22.2% (Table 11 below). Over the longer run, total
public and publicly-guaranteed debt is projected to decline to about 53% of GDP by the year
2000, and to an average of about 43% during 2001-04. Similarly, the debt service ratio would
decrease to 14.4% by the year 2000; and debt service as a share of NFPS revenues would decline
to 20.2%. Furthermore, the maintenance of sound economic policies would be encouraged by the
up-front cost that Panama has paid in order to regain creditworthiness, and debt management
strengthened as creditworthiness improves and the cost of mismanagement increases. A debt
rollover counterfactual would also improve creditworthiness indicators, but by considerably less
than DDSR. Also, under that counterfactual, Panama would have less incentive to honor debt
service obligations because the cost of default would be lower.

51.   Burdensharing. The reduction of commercial bank debt, coupled with additional lending
by IFIs to help finance DDSR (and disbursements under ongoing operations), would augment the
share of official creditors in the present value of Panama's remaining obligations, from 23 to 32%;
in particular, it would raise the relative burden of the IFIs, from 12 to 18%. By the same token,
the burden of private creditors would decline, from 77% to 68% (Figure 2).

52.   Reduced Flexibility. While DDSR would greatly improve Panama's capacity to service
its debt, it would potentially constrain Panama's latitude to adjust debt service to adverse external
shocks in the event such shocks were larger than the debt relief achieved, or to domestic policy
shocks. More particularly, it would raise the transactions costs of an eventual debt restructuring
relative to one in which loans were simply rescheduled, as in a MYRA. In effect, DDSR raises the
relative share of debt held in bonds from about 8 to 68%. The conversion of bank loans to bonds
and additional lending by IFIs for DDSR would raise the share of relatively inflexible debt from
21.9 to 90.2%. While this result is an inevitable outcome of the mechanics of the Brady solution,
the extent of this increase is high relative to that resulting from previous DDSR operations
because of the heavy weight of commercial bank debt in Panama's total debt. Nonetheless, the
share of preferred creditors in public debt service would actually decline in 1996, to about 31%
from 45% in 1995 (because Panama was still accumulating arrears on commercial debt in 1995).
On an accrual basis, the share of preferred creditors is projected to remain below the Bank's
guideline of 35% during the next decade. Debt service to the Bank as proportion of public debt
service is projected to be about 8% in 1996 and to remain on the order of 7 to 8% throughout the
projection period. Similarly, debt service to the Bank as a fraction of exports is projected to be
far below the Bank's guideline over the course of the next decade (1.6% in 1996, and lower
thereafter). (See Table 11 above.)
53.   Exposure Risk. Reduced flexibility per se translates into greater risk to the Bank in the
event of adverse external shocks or domestic policy shocks; however, DDSR also mitigates the
vulnerability of the economy to external shocks. First, it diminishes the debt service burden and
enhances creditworthiness. Second, it reduces the exposure of the economy to both interest rate
risk--by changing 53% of eligible debt into fixed-rate instruments, and to exchange rate risk--by
converting the 17% of eligible debt formerly denominated in non-U. S. currencies into US dollars.
Moreover, Panama has several options in the context of the DDSR operation to adjust debt
service to external shocks: it could (i) capitalize interest payments on PDI bonds exceeding an
annual interest rate of 4% during the first six years after closing; and (ii) use the interest collateral
to pay up to 12 months interest on the par and discount bonds, and up to 6 months interest on the
FLIRBs. In addition, current fiscal policies, coupled with the measures the Government is taking
to consolidate fiscal balance over the longer-term, are projected to generate NFPS surpluses
approaching 1% of GDP by 1997, and rising to 1.4% by the year 2000 (Annex I, Table 5). Such
additional resources would enable the Government to implement an efficient debt management
strategy and significantly increase its capacity to absorb external shocks.
54.   A sensitivity analysis reveals that a permanent increase of 100 basis points above projected
LIBOR would augment the current account deficit by only 0.3 percentage points of GDP on
average during 1996-2000 relative to the baseline projections--an increase which could be
absorbed by a somewhat slower rate of accumulation of NFPS net deposits at the BNP than
projected.12 Similarly, a secular merchandise terms of trade shock of 5% would augment the
current account deficit by only 0.3 percentage points of GDP on average during 1996-2000
relative to the baseline, due to the small weight of merchandise exports in total current account
receipts. Finally, a sizable capital account shock (e.g. a reduction of annual capital inflows by
10% during 1996-2000, or about 1% of annual GDP, relative to projected flows) also could be
absorbed without significantly affecting projected growth or Panama's ability to service its
12 The illustrative macroeconomic projections presented in Table 10 above incorporate the impact of two external shocks: the
sharp reduction in bilateral aid (which comrnmenced in 1994) and the depressive impact of the U.S. disengagement from the
former Canal Zone on service receipts.

external debt (by lowering the accumulation of NFPS net deposits from 3.7 to 2.2 months of
imports), provided Panama continues to pursue sound macroeconomic policies, and implement
needed structural and institutional reforms.
55.   While the economy would become more vulnerable to domestic policy shocks in a post-
DDSR world, the risk of such shocks, especially fiscal ones, is considered to be slight. Panama's
unique, nine decades-old monetary regime provides a stable anchor for the macroeconomic
framework. Maintenance of sound economic policies also would be encouraged by the up-front
cost that Panama has paid to regain creditworthiness, and debt management strengthened as
creditworthiness improves and the cost of mismanagement increases. Indeed, DDSR would serve
as a powerful deterrent to policy slippage. Moreover, the current Administration enjoys a solid
majority in the Legislative Assembly; has achieved major progress in implementing the lengthy
reform agenda during its first fifteen months; and has an additional three and one-half years in
office. Nonetheless, support for the reform program could erode in this relatively wealthy but
dualistic society--in which 40% of the population lives in poverty and narrow-interest groups
traditionally have thwarted reform--if investment in infrastructure and social safety net programs
continues to lag, and if growth does not begin to accelerate and the high unemployment rate to
ease in the medium-term. The Bank is working to minimize this risk through the ongoing
adjustment operation; a renewal of investment lending, focusing on poverty reduction; by
enhancing project implementation; and through our ESW and policy dialogue. As the Bank's
lending portfolio moves from adjustment to investment lending, non-formal and non-lending
instruments will play a growing role in risk management and ensuring continuity in the reform
process, as will closer coordination with our sister organizations. (See also para. 61 below.)
V. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND PROPOSED DDSR LOAN
56.   The Government of Panama has requested support for the DDSR agreement from the
World Bank, the IMF and the IDB. The Government also has indicated that it intends to request
a limited waiver of the negative pledge clauses in its loan and guarantee agreements with the
Bank. This section discusses the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy; Panama's eligibility for
Bank support of DDSR; the proposed Bank measures to support the DDSR operation; the
request for the waiver of the negative pledge clause; and burdensharing among donors.
A. Country Assistance Strategy
57.   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Panama was discussed by the Board on
February 7, 1995. The CAS adopted a selective, two-pronged approach focusing on reviving
sustainable growth and poverty alleviation. The ongoing ERL adjustment operation is promoting
consolidation of a sustainable fiscal/macroeconomic framework, the restructuring and
privatization of state enterprises, and elimination of policy-induced price distortions required to
accelerate economic growth to potential and mount an efficacious poverty alleviation strategy,
both through the quick-disbursing policy-based component and the technical assistance
component, which is supporting the Government unit in charge of implementing the Authorities'
economic program and has financed the preparation of key reform legislation. The base lending
program is devoted entirely to direct interventions in support of poverty alleviation, and includes
operations designed to mitigate the more immediate causes of poverty and operations to enhance
human resource development, especially in rural areas where the majority of the poor live. This
program is composed of the Rural Health Project, which recently became effective, and the



- 25 -
following proposed projects: Basic Education, Social Emergency Fund, and Land Management
and Rural Poverty Project. The ESW is designed to support this two-pronged approach,
providing a parallel track for enriching the policy dialogue.13 The CAS presented a high case
lending program that would include support for DDSR. The CAS indicated that the triggers for
moving to a high case lending program would be solid progress in implementing the
Govemment's economic program; compliance with ERL second tranche conditions; and
conclusion of a DDSR agreement consistent with the revival of sustainable growth.
B. The Proposed Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan
58.   Eligibility for DDSR Support. Panama meets the eligibility criteria for Bank DDSR
support. First, the Government has met the conditions delineated in the CAS for moving to the
high case lending program: it has made great progress in implementing a comprehensive
adjustment program; has successfully complied with the second tranche conditions of the
Economic Recovery Loan,14 and has achieved a DDSR agreement which satisfies Bank criteria for
DDSR support. Second, the Government has demonstrated a need for DDSR to achieve its
medium-term development objectives. In effect, the Government has been unable to accommodate
contractual interest and amortization on its external commercial debt. An attempt to do so would
have thwarted the remonetization of the economy and led to a depression of economic activity.
Third, the Government lacks sufficient resources to close the DDSR operation without official
support, of which the proposed Bank DDSR loan is an integral part. Fourth, the DDSR operation
achieves an appropriate balance between debt and debt service reduction. In effect, it: (i) induced
a high degree of participation by commercial creditors and is likely to result in continued
commercial bank involvement with Panama; (ii) would bring debt service payments in line with
the Government's debt service capacity and the financing requirements of accelerated economic
growth; and (iii) is cost effective, as the Government's investment in DDSR achieves a
satisfactory rate of return with respect to alternative means of regularizing arrears. Finally, the
resources devoted to DDSR would make a material contribution to the country's development.
59.   The Proposed DDSR Loan. Bank DDSR guidelines stipulate that the Bank can provide
support to eligible Borrowers for DDSR in accordance with the following criteria: (i) through
set-asides, in an amount of up to 25% of the three-year adjustment lending program, or of up to
10% of the overall three-year lending program; and (ii) through additional funds, in an amount of
up to 15% of the three-year lending program. The guidelines also stipulate that priority is to be
given to set asides, and that additional funds would be provided only if there is a clear need for
further support for DDSR, and the country is implementing a strong adjustment program and has
a solid track record of adjustment. Finally, the guidelines also allow for the use of a high case
lending program to determine the DDSR loan amount.
60.   The base case three-year lending program proposed in the CAS is US$180 million, and
consists exclusively of investment operations; the high case is US$225 million. As explained
above, Panama has met the triggers for moving to the high case program. The proposed DDSR
loan of US$30 million would be composed of US$20 million in set asides and US$10 million in
additional funds. The additional resources are fully justified: (i) Panama's fiscal constraint would
13 See, in particular, Panama: A Dual Economy in Transition, op.cit.
14 A detailed discussion of Panama's performance under the adjustment loan is presented in the President's Memorandum
entitled "Panama - Economic Recovery Loan (Loan 3438-PA) - Release of the Second Tranche (Waiver of One Condition
and Partial Waiver of One Condition)", R-96-21, February 14, 1996.



- 26 -
prevent it from completing the DDSR operation without the additional funds; and (ii) during the
past fifteen months, the country has compiled a solid track in implementing a strong adjustment
program. The set asides would be offset by a reduction in the high case amount for the proposed
FY98 Rural Poverty and Natural Resources Management Project, from US$75 million to US$55
million. The proposed loan would be a free-standing operation, inasmuch as the future lending
program does not contain any adjustment operations. The proposed DDSR loan of US$30 million
would help finance principal and/or interest collateral of the DDSR instruments exchanged for
eligible principal.
61.   When the Bank provides DDSR support on a free-standing basis, the operation should
carry appropriate policy conditionality if the Bank does not have a substantial adjustment lending
program in the country. The Bank will continue to support and monitor the Government's
implementation of the economic program, of which the DDSR operation is an integral part,
through the third tranche of the ERL, and would continue to be heavily involved in the design and
implementation of the economic program through the technical assistance component of the ERL;
hence, no further policy conditionality is required for the proposed DDSR loan. At the same time,
the Bank will increasingly rely on non-lending instruments to foster policy reform. The recent
economic report constituted the first step in this direction, and the Bank currently is preparing a
Poverty Assessment which the Government expects to use to substantially improve social sector
policies. The Government's fiscal policy performance also will be monitored by the IMF through
the SBA which extends to March, 1997. In addition, the IDB is preparing two sector adjustment
loans for 1996, one in the area of public enterprise reform, and another to strengthen prudential
norms and financial system supervision.
62.   Conditions of Effectiveness. Conditions of effectiveness would include: (i) consistency of
the macroeconomic policy framework with the objectives of the proposed loan; (ii) a requirement
that the DDSR operation offer documents be satisfactory to the Bank, and (iii) a legal opinion
from the Borrower satisfactory to the Bank that the Loan Agreement is valid and legally binding
on the Republic of Panama. In view of the fact that the Republic of Panama already has received
commitments from creditors for the exchange of 98.5% of the debt eligible under the DDSR
agreement, or a participation above the threshold (95%) required for effectiveness in previous
DDSR loans, no such condition is needed.
63.   Disbursement Arrangements. It is proposed that, upon effectiveness, the full amount of
the DDSR Loan be made available to the Borrower to help finance the costs of the principal
and/or interest collateral of the par bonds and discount bonds, and/or interest collateral of the
FLIRBs; however, no withdrawals would be made from the approved DDSR loan unless the
Bank shall have approved the procedures for withdrawal, and is satisfied with the arrangement for
the maintenance of collateral. The Bank would disburse (on account of the Borrower) either
directly to the collateral agent to provide funds for the acquisition of collateral or to the Borrower
to reimburse it for the cost of collateral already acquired. The Bank would provide under the
proposed DDSR loan up to 100% retroactive financing if needed, on the basis of eligible
expenditures incurred after November 14, 1995 (i.e., the cut-off date for the receipt of
commitment allocations from creditors under the DDSR agreement).
64.   The Government would be required to have the records and accounts of the payments
financed out of the proceeds of the loan audited by independent private auditors acceptable to the
Bank, and to furnish to the Bank the audit reports and other information regarding those records
and accounts and the audit thereof The Closing Date of the Loan would be June 30, 1996.



- 27 -
65.   Prepayment Provisions. Under the Loan Agreement, the Government would be entitled
to repurchase any of the DDSR instruments at any time and price, provided it is not on default on
any of the new instruments. The DDSR Loan Agreement would include provisions entitling the
Bank to request prepayment of funds to the extent that the collateral they finance is released to
Panama, unless the funds in question are used for eligible imports (in the case of set asides) or
further debt and debt service reduction (in the case of additional funds or set asides). 15 The Bank
would attempt to reach a consensus with Panama, the IMvF and the IDB regarding the use of loan
proceeds from all three institutions to achieve a proportional allocation of funds to collateral in
order to trigger proportional prepayment obligations in the event of release of collateral.
66.   Waiver of Negative Pledge Clauses. The Government has requested, pursuant to the
terms of the negative pledge clauses in the loan and guarantee agreements between the World
Bank and the Republic of Panama, that the World Bank consent to the pledge of collateral in the
amounts required for the par bonds, discount bonds and FLIRBs to be issued by Panama. It is
estimated that a waiver of up to US$115 million would be required for this purpose. The pledge
of collateral will be for up to the 30-year life of the par and discount bonds. The Bank has
received a letter from the Government formally requesting the waiver of the negative pledge
clause (Annex V). In this letter, the Government has reaffirmed its obligation to continue to make
timely payments on its loans from the Bank and has affirmed that such loans would not be subject
to rescheduling. The Government has also stated its understanding that the consent by the World
Bank to a waiver of the negative pledge clause would be limited to the transactions included in the
DDSR operation as described in this report and would be without prejudice to the Bank's position
on the negative pledge clause under its loan and guarantee agreements in general.
67.   Burdensharing. The IDB, the IMF and the Bank would each provide about US$30
million equivalent to help finance the costs of DDSR, amounting to 40% of the total costs of the
operation. The Government of Panama would finance the remainder from its own resources.
C. Risks and Benefits
68.   The expected benefits of the DDSR operation are detailed in section V above. Potential
risks to the materialization of these benefits and to the ability and willingness of Panama to fully
service its external debt in a timely fashion could arise from both domestic and external sources.
Domestically, political opposition could erode the Government's majority in the Legislative
Assembly and/or result in intolerable disruptions of civic affairs, to the detriment of the future
implementation of the Government's economic program. To date, however, there is little
evidence that opponents of reform have the strength to mount a serious challenge to the
Government. Indeed, the Government has achieved a significant majority in the Assembly in all
the votes to date on reform legislation, including highly contentious legislation such as
privatization and labor code reform, thanks to the consistently solid backing of the governing
party and its allies. Moreover, elections are not scheduled until 1999. Efforts of domestic interest
groups to block reform through strikes and protests likewise have consistently failed. The
Government also has substantially enhanced the public sector's institutional capacity to implement
the reform program, with the support of the Bank, through the ERL. Nonetheless, the sharp
income disparities and high incidence of poverty, in conjunction with the plethora of special
15 If the Executive Directors approve the proposed simplification of disbursements under structural and sectoral adjustment
loans and credits, these provisions would be revisited to reflect the liberalization in the documentation required for
structural adjustment operations.



- 28 -
interest groups who benefit from the status quo, will continue to pose a risk to economic reform
until growth begins to accelerate and unemployment subsides. In the Government's view the best
way to minimize this risk is by continuing to rapidly implement needed reforms, while stepping-up
investments in basic services and social safety net programs.
69.   Externally, the Government's reform program will be supported by the recently approved
IMF SBA, as well as by the Bank's ERL (through June 30, 1996 in the case of the quick-
disbursing component, with a possible extension to end-1996 for the technical assistance
component) and ESW. In addition, the IDB is preparing two adjustment operations, a second
public enterprise reform loan and an investment sector loan, both of which are scheduled for
board presentation in CY96. More generally, the external environment is projected to be
favorable over the medium-term, with no significant external price shocks foreseen. In this
context, however, Panama needs to adjust to: (i) the impact of the progressive disengagement of
the U.S. Defense Department from the former canal zone during the remainder of the century and
of the withdrawal of the U.S. from administration of the Canal itself, and (ii) a sharp decline in
bilateral aid flows.
70.   The transfer of the Canal Zone looms large in the future development of the country.
Panama must cope with the withdrawal during 1995-99 of some US$300 million annually (or
about 4% of GDP) that U.S. entities a'ld personnel pump into the economy, and the attendant loss
of 6,000 high-paying jobs. At the same time, bilateral aid from the U.S, which amounted to
US$500 million during 1990-93 and played an important role in the rapid recovery of the
economy, declined sharply beginning in 1994. Transferal of the Canal per se to Panama would
offset only a fraction (about US$50 million annually) of the income loss from the disengagement
of the U.S. Defense Department. Development of the surrounding territory that also is reverting
to Panama should offset the impact of the U.S. departure, but may do so fully only over the
longer term. Enhancing investor confidence will be crucial to this process. While the ability of
Panama to maintain and operate the Canal is not an issue, securing investor confidence and
sufficient external financing on competitive terms will be critical, especially in light of the U.S.
withdrawal. It is precisely in this respect that the successful conclusion of the DDSR operation
probably would make its biggest contribution to the future development of the country.
VI. RECOMMENDATION
71.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and would be consistent with the approved guidelines for Bank support of DDSR Programs.
I therefore recommend that the Executive Directors approve the Debt and Debt Service
Reduction Loan on the terms and conditions proposed. I also recommend that the Executive
Directors consent to the request of the Panamanian Government for a waiver of the negative
pledge restrictions in the Bank's loan and guarantee agreements with the Republic of Panama, to
the extent and based on the conditions proposed, such consent to become effective upon receipt
by the Government of all similar consents required from other creditors.

United States of America
Attention: Mr. Edilberto L. Segura
Director
Country Department II
Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office
Re:    Republic of Panama 1995 Financing Plan
Waiver of Negative Pledae Clauses
Dear Mr. Segura:
We make reference to the 1995 Financing Plan for
the Republic of Panama (the "Republic") dated October
4th, 1995, which has been distributed to commercial bank
creditors of the public sector of Panama (the "Financing
Plan"). Copies of the Financing Plan have previously
been furnished to the staff of'the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (the "Bank").
The Financing Plan represents the culmination of
discussions with the Republic's Bank Advisory Committee
on the readjustment and reduction of the external public
sector debt of Panama owed to commercial banks. The
Financing Plan contains a number of voluntary,
market-oriented options to be offered to commercial bank
creditors of the Republic and certain other public
sector obligors, options which are innovative and
flexible and which will provide significant cash flow
relief to the Republic during the short and medium term
while the Republic pursues a structural adjustment
program aimed at correcting existing external and
internal imbalances in the Panamanian economy and
introducing market reforms in order to achieve sustained
economic growth.



Annex V
Page 2 of 8
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development
March 5, 1996
Page 2
The Financing Plan contemplates that holders of
eligible commercial bank debt will exchange outstanding
principal amounts due under certain medium- and
long-term loan agreements ("Eligible Principal") and a
portion of interest claims ("Eligible Interest" and
together with Eligible Principal, "Eligible Debt") for
bonds issued by the Republic. Panama's commercial bank
creditors may choose among (1) Discount Bonds ("Discount
Bonds"), (2) Par Bonds ("Par Bonds") or (3) Interest
Reduction Bonds ("IRBs" and together with the Discount
Bonds and the Par Bonds, "Principal Bonds"). Each of
these options will involve an exchange of existing debt
instruments for newly issued bonds. Eligible Interest
Claims will be exchanged for newly issued Past Due
Interest Bonds ("PDI Bonds" and together with the
Principal Bonds, "Bonds").
To date, Panama's commercial bank creditors have
responded favorably to the Financing Plan -- creditors
holding in excess of 98% of the Eligible Principal have
elected to exchange their Eligible Principal for one or
more of the options listed above. They are expected to
execute the requisite bond exchange agreements beginning
in April, 1996, copies of which will be furnished to the
staff of the Bank. It is currently contemplated that
the Financing Plan will be consummated in late May, 1996
(the "Closing Date").
The purpose of this letter is to request formally
that the Bank, pursuant to the terms of the negative
pledge clauses contained in the Bank's loan and
guarantee agreements with the Republic and its agencies
and other public sector entities, consent to the pledge
by the Republic of collateral to secure the Principal
Bonds in order to permit the consummation of the
exchange of Eligible Principal for such Bonds.
Each of the Principal Bonds will be issued by the
Republic. Bank creditors wishing to exchange their
Eligible Debt for Par Bonds or IRBs will do so at par,
and bank creditors wishing to exchange their Eligible
Debt for Discount Bonds will do so at a discount of 45%
from par. Eligible Interest claims will be exchanged
for PDI Bonds issued by the Republic in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate amount of
interest claims, as recalculated under the Financing
Plan. All the Bonds will be issued in registered form

only. The Bonds will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange.
The Discount Bonds will have a tenor of 30 years
with a bullet repayment at final maturity and will bear
interest, payable semiannually in arrears, at a floating
rate equal to 13/16% per annum over the six-month London
interbank offered rate for Eurodollar deposits
("LIBOR"). The entire face amount of the Discount Bonds
at maturity will be secured by a pledge of U.S. Treasury
obligations and twelve months of interest thereon will
be collateralized by cash or certain other permitted
investments. The Republic will pledge cash or permitted
investments, in U.S. dollars, in an initial amount, to
be delivered on the Closing Date, equal to nine months
of interest payments on the Discount Bonds at the
assumed rate of 7.00% per annum. The Republic will
pledge additional cash or permitted investments in two
equal annual installments of .85% of the principal
amount of the Discount Bonds then outstanding commencing
on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, which
amounts, together with all interest collateral amount
previously delivered, and earnings thereon, as a result
of retention and reinvestment of interest paid on such
interest collateral, will increase to an amount equal to
12 months of interest payments on the Discount Bonds at
the assumed rate of 7.5%. Bank creditors holding
U.S. $86.5 million of Eligible Debt have so far
committed to exchange their Eligible Debt for Discount
Bonds. Accordingly, an aggregate of approximately
U.S. $47.5 million face amount of Discount Bonds will be
issued on the Closing Date. This amount represents
approximately 4.5% of the total Eligible Debt.
The Par Bonds will have a tenor of 30 years with
a single bullet repayment at final maturity and will
bear interest, payable semiannually in arrears, at fixed
interest rates -- 3.00% per annum from the Closing Date
to the first anniversary of the Closing Date; 3.25% per
annum from the first anniversary of the Closing Date to
the second anniversary of the Closing Date; 3.50% per
annum from the second anniversary of the Closing Date to
the third anniversary of the Closing Date; 3.75% per
annum from the third anniversary of the Closing Date to
the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date; 4.25% per
annum from the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date to
the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date; 4.75% per
annum from the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date to



Annex V

the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date; 5.25% per
annum from the eighth anniversary of the Closing Date to
the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date; and 5.50% per
annum thereafter. The entire face amount of the Par
Bonds at maturity will be secured by a pledge of U.S.
Treasury obligations and twelve months of interest
thereon will be collateralized by cash or certain other
permitted investments. The Republic will pledge cash or
permitted investments, in U.S. dollars, in an initial
amount, to be delivered on the Closing Date, equal to
nine months of interest payments on the Par Bonds at the
assumed rate of 3.07% per annum. The Republic will
pledge additional cash or permitted investments in three
equal installments of .40% of the principal amount of
the Par Bonds then outstanding commencing on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, which amounts, together
with all interest collateral amounts previously
delivered, and earnings thereon, as a result of
retention and reinvestment of interest paid on such
interest collateral, will increase to an amount equal to
12 months of interest payments on the Par Bonds at the
interest rate payable on the Par Bonds for the
subsequent year. Bank creditors holding
U.S. $264.0 million of Eligible Debt have so far
committed to exchange their Eligible Debt for Par Bonds.
Accordingly, an aggregate of approximately
U.S. $264.0 million face amount of Par Bonds will be
issued on the Closing Date. This amount represents
approximately 13.6% of the total Eligible Debt.
The principal of the IRBs will be payable in
27 equal semiannual installments commencing on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date through the eighteenth
anniversary of the Closing Date. The IRBs will bear
interest, payable semiannually in arrears, at a fixed
rate equal to 3.50% per annum from the Closing Date to
the first anniversary of the Closing Date; 3.75% per
annum from the first anniversary of the Closing Date to
the second anniversary of the Closing Date; 4.00% per
annum from the second anniversary of the Closing Date to
the third anniversary of the Closing Date; 4.25% per
annum from the third anniversary of the Closing Date to
the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date; 4.50 per
annum from the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date to
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; 4.75% per
annum from the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date to
the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date; 5.00% per
annum from the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date to



Annex V

the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date; and
thereafter at a floating rate equal to 13/16% per annum
over LIBOR. During the first seven years of their
tenor, the IRBs will have the benefit of a rolling
guaranty of six months of interest in the form of a
pledge of cash and certain other permitted investments.
The Republic will pledge cash or permitted investments,
in U.S. dollars, in an amount, to be delivered on the
Closing Date, equal to six months of interest payments
on the IRBs at the assumed rate of 3.55% per annum.
Such interest collateral, as a result of retention and
reinvestment of interest paid on such interest
collateral, will increase to an amount equal to six
months of interest payments on the IRBs at the annual
interest rate of 5.0% per annum. Bank creditors holding
U.S. $1,588.0 million of Eligible Debt have so far
committed to exchange their Eligible Debt for IRBs.
Accordingly, approximately U.S. $1,588.0 million face
amount of IRBs will be issued on the Closing Date. This
amount represents approximately 81.9% of the total
Eligible Debt.
The PDI Bonds will be payable in 21 semiannual
installments commencing on the tenth anniversary of the
Closing Date through the 20th anniversary of the Closing
Date -- Installments 1 through 8, each for an amount
equal to 2.00% of the face amount of outstanding
principal; installments 9 through 11, each for an amount
equal to 3.00% of the face amount of outstanding
principal; and installments 12 through 21, each for an
amount equal to 7.50% of the face amount of outstanding
principal. The Past Due Interest Bonds will bear
interest, payable semiannually, at a floating rate equal
to 13/16% per annum over six-month LIBOR. PDI Bonds
will not be collateralized.
In order to permit the consummation of the
issuances and exchanges of the Bonds, appropriate
waivers of the negative pledge and pari passu clauses in
loan and credit agreements obligating the Republic or
certain other public sector obligors will be required.
In connection with the execution of the requisite bond
exchange agreements noted above, the Republic has
received all consents and waivers necessary under the
loan agreements pertaining to the Eligible Debt for the
implementation of the Financing Plan.



Annex V

In addition, the Republic is requesting, and
anticipates receiving shortly, a waiver of the negative
pledge and pari passu clauses in its loan and guaranty
agreements with the Inter-American Development Bank and
with other official creditors listed in Annex A. No
other consents or waivers from any other creditors are
required for the implementation of the Financing Plan.
The Republic hereby requests that the Bank
consent to the provision by the Republic of collateral
acquired by it at a net cost of no more than
U.S. $113.4 million to the extent necessary to secure
the Bonds to be issued in connection with the Financing
Plan as described above. of this amount, the Republic
estimates that it will be required to deliver collateral
of U.S. $92.3 million on the Closing Date and that the
total cost of funding the various categories of
collateral will be as follows: U.S. $8.5 million for
collateral for the principal of the Discount Bonds;
U.S. $2.5 million for interest on the Discount Bonds;
U.S. $47.1 million for collateral for the principal of
the Par Bonds; U.S. $6.1 million for collateral for
interest on the Par Bonds; and U.S. $28.1 million for
collateral for interest on the IRBs. The Republic
requests that the Bank's consent extend not only to
existing loan and guarantee agreements with the Bank,
but also to loan and guarantee agreements which are
signed during the three-year period for the delivery of
the collateral.
The Republic hereby affirms its obligations to
continue to make timely payments on its loans from the
Bank and affirms that such loans will not be subject to
rescheduling requests. The Republic states its express
understanding that the consent by the Bank to this
request would be limited to the transactions described
above and would be without prejudice to the Bank's
position on the negative pledge clause under its loan
and guarantee agreements in general.
Should you have any questions concerning the
waiver request, please contact Mr. Raul Gasteazoro at
the Ministry.
