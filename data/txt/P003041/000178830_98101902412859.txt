REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
GECAMINES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Government of the Republic of Zaire
Beneficiary:         La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines (GECAMINES)
Amount:              SDR  6.5 million (US$7 million equivalent)
Terms:               Standard
Relending terms:    The Credit would be on-lent to GECAMINES at 10.97
percent for 10 years, including a 3 year grace period.
GECAMINES would be charged the IDA commitment fee on the
undisbursed amount and bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project              The credit would support GECAMINES' efforts to
Description:         restructure its organization and improve its management.
It would also help finance preparation of the Company's
long-term rehabilitation and expansion. The project
would include the following:
(A) Studies
(a)   a revaluation of GECAMINES' fixed assets and
assessment of the Company's net worth;
(b)   a study of GECAMINES' overhead costs and
recommendations for major overhead cost
reductions; and
(c)   a study of GECAMINES' metallurgical operations
to identify areas where technical efficiency
can. be improved.
(B)  Consultants' Services
(a)   technical assistance to GECAMINES' open pit
mining and maintenance operations for the
Western Group to increase productivity and
provide on-the-job training.
(b)   establishment of a Marketing Department within
GECAMINES to increase its role in the
commercialization of its products;
(c)   review of the Finance Department current
procedures and establishment of a long-term
financing strategy;

(d)   organization and training assistance to
strengthen GECAMINES' management and implement
its restructuring and training efforts; and
(e)   legal assistance to review GECAMINES' con-
tractual obligations, especially in marketing,
and assist with the preparation of new con-
tracts.
The main benefit of the Project will be to strength-
en GECAMINES' management and cost effectiveness.
The major risk relates to the adequate implementa-
tion of the agreement between GECAMINES and SOZACOM,
the public company in charge of marketing GECAMINES'
products. Several components of the Project, most
notably the financing of marketing, financial and
legal experts aim at providing GECAMINES with
adequate expertise to supervise efficiently the
implementation of the agreement in these crucial
fields. The risk of delay in project execution is
almost non existent given its advanced state.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A GECAMINES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Zaire for the equivalent of SDR 6.5
million (US$7.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms, to help finance the
GECAMINES Technical Assistance Project. The proceeds of the Credit would be
relent to GECAMINES at the IBRD interest rate for ten years, including three
years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMYI/
2.        An economic mission visited Zaire in March 1982; its report has been
distributed in January 1983 (Report No. 4077-ZR). Its major findings are sum-
marized below.
Background
3.        Zaire is the third largest country in Africa in terms of area and the
fifth largest in terms-of population, but its GNP per capita, estimated at about
US$220 in 1980, ranks among the lowest in the continent. Approximately one-
third of its population of about 28 million live in urban areas, and the popula-
tion density is 12 persons per sq. km. Urbanization has been proceeding at a
rate of about 7 percent per annum, or more than two and a half times the rate of
population growth. Although agriculture (commercialized and subsistence) norm-
ally accounts for 30 percent of GDP, it provides employment and income for more
than three-quarters of the population. The mining and mineral-processing
industry normally accounts for about 18 percent of GDP; it has traditionally
been the largest source of public revenue and provides more than two-thirds of
the country's export earnings. (The shares cited are 1979-81 averages).
4.        When Zaire gained independence in 1960, it was ill-prepared for the
change, both technically and institutionally. The first six to seven years
following independence were marked by violent political strife and a severe dis-
ruption of the economy; but after the restoration of political order and stab-
ility in 1967, GDP grew by about 7 percent in real terms annually until 1974.
Since then, however, Zaire has been experiencing serious economic difficulties
which have brought about a continuous decline in per capita income.
1/   This part is substantially the same as Part I of the President's Report
for the Northeast Rural Development Project (P-3447-ZR of 1983).



-2-
Beginning of Current Difficulties
5.         Although the downswing of the Zairian economy started in 1975, the
current difficulties of Zaire are in many respects the result of developments
which took place in earlier years. Among these are: the progressive
accentuation of the country's dependence on the mining sector, accompanied by
the relative neglect of agricultural production; heavy external borrowing during
1973-74, mostly from private banks, at average terms inconsistent with Zaire's
level of development and for projects with long gestation periods and uncertain
economic benefits; and the attempts to change drastically the ownership
structure of the economy through the zairianization and nationalization measures
of 1973-74. Though since rescinded, the zairianization and nationalization
measures had particularly adverse and lasting effects on the economy: they
seriously damaged private sector confidence both at home and abroad, severely
disrupted the transport and marketing links between urban centers and the
interior, and resulted in the neglect of the country's productive capacity and
infrastructure. The deterioration of Zaire's terms of trade in 1975, owing
largely to the fall in the international price of copper, was a major
contributor to both the severity and the duration of the crisis.
6.         Zaire's attempts to cope with the crisis were uneven and
uncoordinated. As a result, by 1978, commercialized GDP contracted to about 10
percent below the pre-crisis (1972-74) level; the overall budgetary deficit
attained a record level equivalent to about 12 percent of commercialized GDP;
and deficit financing, together with the worsening shortages of basic consumer
goods, fuel and intermediate products, pushed the annual inflation rate to about
50 percent. Although the decline of GDP was arrested in 1979, the economy
continued to face serious difficulties that year. The budgetary deficit, though
reduced, was financed entirely by recourse to the domestic banking system. This
plus the acceleration of credit to the rest of the economy continued to exert
pressure on prices, which rose by more than 100 percent in the capital city
during the year. The balance of payments also remained under strong pressure,
as evidenced by a further accumulation of external payment arrears -- a trend
which had started in 1975, On December 31, 1979, arrears (including those on
short-term commercial debt and invisibles) amounted to about US$1.8 billion.
Although two stabilizati-on programs, supported by the IMff, were adopted and
three debt rescheduling agreements under the Paris Club were concluded during
the 1975-79 period, these could not be implemented and, therefore, brought
limited relief.
Developments since 1980
7.         Despite the mixed per-formance, the year 1979 saw the beginning of more
systematic ef forts by Zaire and the major donors to deal with the crisis.
First, in August 1979, Zaire adopted a new stabilization program designed to
contain the overall balance of payments deficit, curb the rate of inflation and
thereby create the conditions for a resumption of econZomic growth.  Second,Zaire
negotiated debt rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club (December 1979) and
the syndicated private banks (Apri;l 1980)o Third, Zailre started a process of
institutional reforms, including the gradual establishment of a more systematic
process of approvals programming and monitoring of public investments (see next
section).



- 3 -
8.        These efforts produced considerable improvements in 1980:  GDP expand-
ed by 2.4 percent in real terms, aided by a strong recovery in copper produc-
tion; exports rose in nominal terms as did imports; and the external current
account balance showed a small surplus for the second straight year, in sharp
contrast to the average annual deficit of nearly US$600 million registered
during 1976-78. Government finances also improved during the year. The budget-
ary deficit was reduced by about two fifths in nominal terms and amounted to 1.9
percent of GDP. The easing of the supply situation, together with the restraint
in government borrowing, contributed to lowering the annual rate of inflation by
more than half -- to about 44 percent -- despite the devaluation of the zaire by
about 30 percent vis-a-vis the SDR early in the year. At the same time, Zaire
observed all the performance criteria under the IMF-supported stabilization pro-
gram for 1980 and was able to purchase the full amount (SDR 118 million) allowed
under the stand-ly arrangement. In addition, it largely complied with the debt
rescheduling agreements with the Paris Club and the syndicated private banks by
nearly doubling its external public debt service payments.
9.        Largely on the strength of the improved performance of the preceding
year, in mid-1981, Zaire adopted a three-year program of economic and financial
adjustment supported by an "extended facility" from the IMF in an amount equi-
valent to SDR 912 million. The program had three basic objectives: (i) to
achieve an average annual growth rate of real GDP of 3 percent; (ii) to reduce
the rate of domestic inflation to 25 percent by 1983; and (iii) to contain the
external current account deficit in 1983 to 5 percent of nominal GDP. Zaire
also concluded (in July 1981) a new debt rescheduling agreement with the Paris
Club under which the creditors agreed to the rescheduling of some of the pre-
viously rescheduled maturities as well as the new (not previously rescheduled)
debt falling due in 1981 and 1982. However, economic performance during the
year fell below expectations because of external and internal factors. The
weakening of the copper and cobalt markets caused Zaire's merchandise exports to
fall by about US$460 million (or 24 percent) in nominal terms. Although the de-
cline in nominal imports was kept to 10 percent, real imports were lower than at
any year during the crisis and, indeed, 40-50 percent below the pre-crisis
level. As a result of these developments as well as a weakening of fiscal
discipline, the budgetary deficit expanded five-fold in nominal terms -- to the
equivalent of 8 percent of commercialized GDP. Net government borrowing from
the domestic banking system exceeded the target under the medium-term program by
a large margin. Zaire could not comply with either the criteria under the
Extended Fund Facility or the July 1981 debt rescheduling agreement; it began
accumulating external debt arrears in the third quarter of 1981, and the EFF was
formally cancelled effective June 21, 1982.
10.       Zaire's economic difficulties were accentuated in 1982.  In March of
that year, Zaire was able to purchase SDR 107 million under the IMF Compensatory
Financing Facility, but this provided limited relief, as copper and cobalt
prices continued to weaken. Merchandise exports are estimated to total at least
US$200 million (15 percent) less than in 1981 and US$650-700 million (33-36 per-
cent) less than in 1980. Furthermore, efforts to curtail expenditures --in the
face of a sharply reduced resource base-- have proven insufficient. As a



result, the budgetary deficit is expected to double in 1982; the inflation rate,
which fell to 30 percent in thet first three quarters ofl the year, seems to be
accelerating; and the exchange rate, which has not been chanLged since mid-1981,
has come under strong pressure.  Zaire has also encountered serious difficulties
in meeting its external debt service obligations.  External public debt arrears
may total US$800 million at the end of the year.
Government Measures
11.       During the years 1979-8O, Zaire took a number of important steps under
the Mobutu Plan, which the Government vaewed as a broad-based and multipronged
effort to achieve recover,y in dialogue with and with assistance from. the major
donors.  These steps included the installation of an epDatriate deputy governor
as well as technica± advisers, all proposed by the IMI',. at the Bank of Zaire.
Zaire also appointed an expa,riate coutrroller general, proposed by the UNDP, to
the Ministry of Finance.  In addition9 as part of anr effort to reform its
customs operations, Zaire transilormed the Custous Di vision of the Ministry of
Finance into a pulblic or-ganization known as the Office of Customs and Duties
(OFIDA).  This ne. undertaking has received substantial technical and adminis-
trative support from Selglum. Also noteworthy; is th.e creation of a Central Pay
Directorate which is futnctioning with the assistance of French experts.  More-
over, the Government reaffirmed thro-agh various actions i5.ts commtitment to ex-
panding the role of and its reliac ce on. the private sector.  Seven inefficient
"commodity offices' were dissolved; some agricultural producer prices were
raised; under a scheme of 'development agreemen.ts", an effort was initiated to
involve private industry in the rehabilitation of agriculture and related infra-
structure; a new investment code was promulgated; and a number of reforms were
undertaken in the management of state enterprises.
12.        In 1979, national and international attention concerning Zaire was
directed to the preparation of a medium-term Pu'blic investment Program (PIP),
and the World Bank was asked to assist the Zairian authorities in this
endeavor. In August 19795 the Government completed such a program for the
period 1979-81, focusing largely on rehabilitation needs in priority sectors
such as agriculture, mining and transportation. The execution of the PIP during
1979-80 was constrained primarily by the shortage of resources and the execu-
tion of certain on--going proj9ects which had not been included in the PIP: only
40 percent of the iPIP .ould be executed, compared to 60 percent foreseen under
the program.
13.        In aid-19)81  in,n conjunction with the medium-tern program supported
with the EFF, the Zairian authorities took a numpvber of interrelated steps toward
stimulating supply,, keepi-nig the growth of demand within appropriate limits, and
improving foreig-n exocha-enge management*  On June 19, 1981, the zaire was devalued
by a further 40 p"rcent vis-a-vis the SDR; interest rates -were adjusted upward;
and the existing orice controls on most goods were removed in order to stimulate
the private sector,  In addJ'_tiona to complet-ing a revised PIP for 1981-83, Zaire
began preparing an Agricultural Action Plan in order to bring adbout improvements
in the following areas: (i  strengthening of i-nstitlutionisq (ii) policies for



- 5 -
pricing, marketing, credit, and foreign exchange allocation; (iii) implementa-
tion of on-going projects; (iv) investment programming for the sector; and (v)
research, extension and training. The Action Plan was discussed at a meeting of
the Consultative Group for Zaire held from June 22 to 24, 1982. At the same
time, the Zairian authorities cooperated with the IMF and the Bank in the prepa-
ration of a fiscal study which comprised the budgetary process, with emphasis on
the control over expenditures, tax reform and the tax regime of GECAMINES (the
state-owned company producing most of Zaire's copper and all of its cobalt).
The study was completed in April/May 1982.
14.       In 1982, Zaire made additional attempts to improve economic management
and institutional performance. The Ministry of Agriculture was significantly
reorganized as part of a broad program of institutional reforms for the sector.
The Government appointed new, more broadly-based Execitive Boards for GECAMINES
and SOZACOM (the state-owned company marketing the bulk of GECAMINES' output);
made important changes in the top management of GECAMINES; and approved a new
marketing arrangement between the two firms. Furthermore, it announced the
decision to "privatize" the ownership and/or management of 37 public enter-
prises, and it relaxed the remaining price controls further. The Government
proceeded at the same time to implement a policy of "decentralization" whose
apparent objective is to give the regions more autonomy.
Prerequisites for Recovery
15.       The difficulties experienced by Zaire since 1975 have had a heavy eco-
nomic and social cost. Much of the country's productive capacity and infra-
structure has deteriorated, and real wages and salaries have declined by more
than half. The cost has been accentuated by the depressed level of world com-
modity prices and the weaknesses of institutions, the inadequacy of administra-
tive controls and the deficiencies of economic decision-making. These, together
with an inappropriate fiscal regime, have resulted in the growing decapitaliza-
tion of the main mining firms, especially GECAMINES. In the last two years,
with the cooperation of the international community, significant progress has
been made in defining the policies and actions necessary for recovery, and a
number of important decisions have already been announced by Zaire. The imple-
mentation of these policies has not been sufficiently vigorous or consistent,
particularly in the areas of prices, the exchange rate, tax reform, investment
planning, and expenditure control. While the growth of expenditures appears to
have decelerated in the last few months, greater efforts are required to com-
press them further and to improve their allocation.
16.       Although Zaire's exports are expected to improve in the next three
years (largely because of the anticipated recovery of copper prices), Zaire's
resource constraints will remain severe. This is partly due to the external
public debt burden: the contractual debt service due in the next three years is
equivalent to about 45 percent of projected exports of goods and non factor ser-
vices -- a ratio which would seem incompatible with even a modest economic re-
covery. Moreover, as a result of the sharp drop in commitments over the last
few years,



-6-
the undisbursed project pipeline --the source of future disbursements-- has been
reduced to US$670 million, compared to US$1.2 billion in 1975. The medium-term
outlook for bilateral and multilateral assistance is uncertain.
17.       The Zairian authorities are aware that in these circumstances they
will need to take stronger actions to: (a) bring the foreign exchange rate to a
more appropriate level, kb) generalize the applicat:Lon of the price liberaliza-
tion measures, (c) reduce the budgetary deficit by implementing the recommenda-
tions of the recently completed IMF/Bank fiscal study, (d) create the conditions
for improving the prospects of financing GECAMINES' rehabilitation program, (e)
implement the Agricultural Action Plan, bearing in lind that a number of poli-
cies remain to be formulated, and (f) revitalize the public investment programm-
ing and monitoring process.  The mst urgent priority is to reach a new agree-
ment with the IMF, as this will relieve the resource pressure and open the way
for a new external debt rescheduling agreement which is urgently needed. An IMF
mission visited Zaire in December 1982 in order to assess recent economic devel-
opments and prospects and to carry out preliminary discussions on an adjustment
program that could be supported by the use of Fund resources.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ZAIRE
18.       From 1969 to date, IDA has approved 30 credits totalling about US$452
million for agriculture, transport, development finance company operations,
water supply, power and education projects (including a recently approved
US$13.0 million North East Rural Development Project.). The Bank has also ex-
tended grants totaling US$400,000 as contributions toward the cost of two plann-
ing assistance projects in Zaire. In 1975, the Bank made a loan of US$100
million for the GECAMINES Mining Expansion Project, which was cofinanced by the
European Investment Bank and by the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank, and which provided
for special repayment arrangements linked to the project's export earnings. The
IFC, which has a US$760,000 equity participation in the Societe Financiere de
Developpement Economique (SOFIDE), approved a US$4.1 million loan in 1978 for an
offshore oil production project and US$230,000 loan in 1982 for studies related
to the development of an aluminum complex.  Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30, 1982 and
notes on the status of ongoing projects.
19.       A main objective of Bank Group operations in Zaire has been institu-
tion building. The development finance company (SOF'IDE) was established in 1970
with assistance from IFG and IDA. The major transport agencies, Office National
des Transports (ONATRA), Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Zairois (SNCZ),
Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF), Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM) and Office des
Routes (OR), received technical and financial assistance from the Association,
which also helped establish the National Livestock Development Authority
(ONDE).  In the case of GECAMINES, the Bank loan originated a dialogue, still
ongoing, intended to define ways and means to strengthen the management, finan-
cial position and planning capability of the company.



-7-
20.       In general, project implementation has been difficult due to the
country's inadequate manpower and management capability and, in recent years,
because of the economic crisis.  In the last two or three years, release of the
required budgetary funds has been difficult periodically because of budgetary
constraints. Lack of foreign exchange to finance spare parts and fuel, and the
deterioration of the transport network and marketing system have resulted in
severe supply problems for most projects. Recruiting and retaining adequate
staff has also been difficult. In January 1980 the Bank undertook with Zairian
officials an overall review of Bank Group projects which, for the first time,
provided an integrated view of implementation problems. This has resulted in an
acceleration and improvement in the utilization of Bank Group assistance, par-
ticularly in the agricultural sector.
21.       Ten credits and one loan have been totally disbursed:  Credits 152,
292, and 536-ZR (First, Second and Third Highway Projects); Credit 255-CK (River
Transport Project); Credit 272-CK (Education Project); Credit 398-ZR (Livestock
Project); Credits 190, 271, and 463-ZR (First, Second and Third SOFIDE Pro-
jects); Credit 625-ZR (Water Supply) and Loan 1090-ZR (GECAMINES). Completion
reports have been issued for all projects except Water Supply and GECAMINES,
and Performance Audit Reports have been issued for the First SOFIDE and the
first Highway Projects. The conclusion of the audit and completion
reports was that the Bank Group's impact on institution building had been
mixed. SOFIDE was evolving as an effective and competent institution, and the
Office des Routes, the highway agency, had been able to establish an effective
administrative set-up. On the other hand, ONATRA's performance had not improved
as a result of the first River Transport Project but did improve under a follow-
up project; implementation by RVF and RVM had disappointing results, but financ-
ial results of operations had improved. All entities had encountered operating
difficulties beyond their control as the economy deteriorated, financial resour-
ces grew scarcer and the problems besetting the investment environment were exa-
cerbated by Government's zairianization/radicalization measures. Bank Group
support to SOFIDE and the OR is continuing under the Fourth and Fifth SOFIDE
projects (Crs. 710 and 998-ZR) and a Fourth Highway Project (Cr. 916-ZR). RVF
and RVM received assistance through a second River Transport Project (Cr. 571-
ZR); and ONATRA will benefit from a recently approved Modernization Project.
22.       The rate of disbursement to Zaire is average for the Eastern Africa
Region. For fiscal years 1979-81, the average annual disbursement rate (ratio
of change in disbursements to undisbursed balance) was 24 percent; this compares
favorably with an average rate of about 20 percent for other countries of the
region.  While disbursement performance in general is satisfactory, difficulties
have arisen in several projects.  In the case of early credits for transport,
education and livestock (Credits 255-ZR, 272-ZR and 398-ZR), the lack of a
strong project entity caused implementation delays. Economic conditions were
also a factor in slowing project progress in instances where government counter-
part funds were not available (Third Highway, Credit 660-ZR; Second Education,
Credit 624-ZR) and where the investment environment experienced slow recovery
from the aftermath of abrupt nationalization (Fourth SOFIDE, Credit 71-ZR).
Future project implementation should be less affected by the above influence



-8-
given the strengthening of institutions under subsequent projects and efforts by
the Government to improve budgetary support of IDA-financed projects. At the
end of 1981, the Bank Group's share of Zaire's total debt disbursed and out-
standing was less than 10 percent.
23.       In the past three years, the Bank Group's main efforts have been dir-
ected towards assisting in the rehabilitation and development of the agriculture
and transport sectors, in part through the design and implementation of appro-
priate new policies.  Investments in industry were also emphasized through                   4
assistance to SOFIDE. Our lending will continue to support the transport sec-
tor, (in particular the Voie Nationale);  to assist the development of the agri-
culture sector within the framework of the new Agricultural Action Plan (para.
13) and to promote the development of the industrial and mining sectors. In
addition, further support will be considered for the energy sector.
PART III - THE MINING SECTOR AND GECAMINES
A.        The Mining Sector
24.       Zaire's mineral industry is the most important sector of its modern
economy, accounting for about 18 percent of GDP and providing about 25 percent
of public revenues and about 70 percent of the country's foreign exchange earn-
ings (para. 3). The sector employs some 40,000 people, has a significant impact
on power and transportation demands, and provides numerous educational and so-
cial services throughout the country. The country's most important mining and
industrial concern, La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines (GECAMINES) is the
world's leading producer of cobalt as well as one of the major producers of cop-
per, zinc and cadmium. Zaire is also the world leader in industrial diamond
production and in addition produces manganese, gold, tin and industrial min-
erals, the latter mostly for internal consumption.
Resource Base
25.       Zaire is richly endowed in mineral resources.  Although a complete as-
sessment of its mineral wealth is difficult because of the relative low level of
exploration carried out so far, the country's known reserves of base and pre-
cious metals are very large but spread unevenly among different regions. It is
estimated that the Shaba province alone, in the southeastern corner of the
country has reserves of more than 30 million of tons of copper metal and 1.2
million of tons of cobalt metal i.e., about 6 percent and 50 percent of the
world's reserves of copper and cobalt, respectively. Shaba has also concentra-
tions of zinc, cadmium, manganese and coal,. as well as tin, gold and silver and
the possibility of finding new large high-grade ore deposits remains serious.
Other important mining regions are Kivu (tin, tungsten and rare earths); Haut-
Zaire (gold); and Kasai (industrial and gem quality diamonds). Zaire possesses
a variety of other minerals, like iron ore, bauxite, lead and phosphate, many of



- 9 -
which have yet to be fully evaluated. Exploration efforts aimed at diver-
sifying both the product mix arid the location of the country's mining activ-
ities have been intensified during the last decade with the help of mostly
the UNDP and BRGM, of France.  A country-wide geological survey is expected
to be completed in the mid-1980s.
Production Performance
26.          All the activity in the mineral sector is organized around a few
companies with the largest and dominant one being the state-owned GECAMINES,
accounting for 93 percent and 100 percent of the copper and cobalt produced
in the country9 respectively.  In 1981, GECAMINES produced 468,000 tons of
copper and 11,000 tons of cobalt. The Company is also a major zinc producer
with a 1981 production of 58,000 tons, The other copper producer is the
Societe de Developpement Industriel et Minier du Zaire (SODIMIZA) a joint-
venture between Japanese interests (80 percent) and the Zairian Government
(20 percent) which accounts for the remaining 7 percent of copper output.
SODIMIZA has no smelting facilities in Zaire and copper concentrates are
shipped to Japan. SODIMIZA's average production in copper content amounted
to 32,000 tons per year during the past five years. The rest of the indus-
try comprises the diamond producer Societe Miniere de Bakwanga (MIBA), (80
percent owned by the Government) which, with an output of 6 million carats
in 1981, accounted for about 32 percent of the world's natural industrial
diamond production; the state-owned Office des Mines d'Or de Kilo--Moto, the
country's most important gold producer with a 1980 production of 612 kg of
gold, representing 50 percent of Zaire's total gold output for that year;
and Societe Zairetain and Societe Miniere et Industrielle du Kivu (SOMINKI)
producing tin, tungsten, gold (507 kg in 1980), as well as some other
minerals. The Government of Zaire has also, through GECAMINES, a 20 percent
interest in the Societe Miniere de Tenke Fungurume (SMTF) in the Shaba, a
non operating entity which has a concession containing reserves of more than
50 million tons of high grade copper and cobalt ores. In addition to the
mining companies, there is a state-owned minerals marketing company, Societe
Zairoise de Commercialisation des Minerais (SOZACOM) which markets the out-
put of GECAMINES, and MIBA.
Irnstitutional Framework
27.          The Ministry of Mines and Energy oversees the sector, but exclu-
sively Lor technical matters. Prior to January 1983, both GECAMINES and
SOZACOM were under the direct supervisior. of the President through "Comites
de tutelle", the members of which, i.e. the Ministers of Transport and Coi-
munications, Finance, and Portfolio, the Governor of the Central Bank, and
the Director of the Bureau of the Presidency were appointed by him. In Jan-
uary 1983, the Comit6s de Tutelle were abolished and GECAMINES and SOZACOM
were placed under the authority of the Ministry of Finance and of the
Ministry of industry and Commerce respectively. The other state-owned firms
are under the aegis of the Ministry of Portfolio, which in addition acts as
the Government representative to the Boards of the various joint-venture
companies.



-1 -
28.          The mining sector Is heavily deDendent on the transport and
power sectors particularly the major mining operations in the Shaba area,
some 270 km from the port of Matadi close to the Atlantic Ocean. Two para-
statal agencies have particular importance for the mining industry: (i) the
Office National des Transports (ONATRA), operating river transport, the
ports of Matadi and Kinshasa and rail service between them; and (ii) the
Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer ZairOis (SNCZ ), the national railway
company, which also operates the port of Ilebo, an important transshipment
point on the KasaI river. In the power sector, the Societe Nationale
d'Electricite (SNEL) is responsible for the generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity throughout Zaire. The SNEL system is almost
entirely based on hydroelectric production. About two-thirds of SNEL's out-
put is consumed by the large industry/mining complexes. IDA is actively in-
volved in the transport and power sectors through several projects concern-
ing ONATRA, SNCZ and SNEL; these projects aim, in particular, at alleviating
present or potentialbottlenecks affecting GECAMINES' operations, the market-
i.ng of its products and transport between its various facilities.
Constraints to Sector Growth and Development
29.          The mining sector has been adversely affected in the past five
years by serious constraints which have stifled its growth and development
(para. 15). Major constraints have been (i) depressed world prices for
metals and minerals which have had a negative impact on revenues and hence
foreign exchange generation both for the Government and the mining firms;
(ii) inappropriate Government policies and interferences particularly in
regards to taxation, foreign exchange allocation and diversion of sales pro-
ceeds. The deficiencies of the tax system, in particular its heavy reliance
on export duties, have constituted a heavy burden for the sector2/. The
general scarcity of foreign exchange has reduced the sector capacity to fin-
ance necessary spare parts and other inputs. Further, the Government diver-
sion of part of GECAMINES sales proceeds has contributed to aggravate its
cash flow problems; (iii) increasing infrastructure bottlenecks, especially
in the railways have reduced the transport capability of the national rail-
ways company; ard (iv) scarcity of skilled manpower and of imported mater-
ials. As a result, most of the mining firms have seen their output and pro-
ductivity decline. Generally, the constant erosion of the currency and the
particularities of Zaire's fiscal regime have led these firms into a rapid
decapitalization.
Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
30.          In 1975, the Ban'K extended a loan of US$100 million equi-
valent3/ to help finance the expansion of Gecamines copper mining and refin
ina facilities (para. 33).  The project was co-financed with Libya (US$100

million) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) (US$25 million).   The ori-
ginal project was only partially completed and had to be amended in 1979 to
permit implementation of high priority rehabilitation (para. 33).
B.          La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines (GECAMINES)
31.         GECAMINES4/ was created irn 1967, following the nationalization
of the Belgian owned Union Miniere du Haut Katanga (UMHK). GECAMINES oper-
ates a 20,000 km2 mining concession in the Shaba province containing some of
the richest stratiform copper deposits in the world with grades of 4-5 per-
cent. All of Zaire's cobalt and zinc and most of its copper are produced by
GECAMINES. It has at present mining and concentrating capacities of about
570,000 tons per year (tpy) of copper, and smelting capacities of 470,000 tpy
of copper, 15,000 tpy of cobalt and 70,000 tpy of zinc. Refining capacities,
however, are limited to 250,000 tpy of copper and 6,000 tpy of cobalt. The
remainder of the output is refined under tolling arrangements in Belgium. In
addition to its main metals, GECAMINES produces cadmium, gold and silver, as
by-products.
32.         Description of Facilities.  GECAMINES' production system is comp-
lex with mines, concentrators and metallurgical plants spread over the lower
part of the Shaba province (Map IBRD 11155R)5/. The mining and metallurgi-
cal installations are distributed among three production centers . The West-
ern Group, with headquarters at Kolwezi, accounts for approximately 75 per-
cent of the Company's ore output. It has large open pit mines (Kamoto,
Mashamba, Dikuluwe), a large underground mine at Kamoto, three concentrators
at Dima, Kamoto and Kolwezi and two hydrometallurgical plants at Kolwezi and
Luilu. In 1981, the Western Group accounted for 36 percent of GECAMINES'
total copper production, more than half of cobalt production and the totality
of zinc production. The Company's two other production centers are head-
quartered at Likasi for the Central Group and Lubumbashi for the Southern
Group. All of GECAMINES blister copper is produced at the Lubumbashi pyro-
metallurgical plant, the center for hydrometallurgical extraction is located
at Likasi, and production of electrowon cathodes and wirebars at its Shituru
plant. In addition, the Company operates a lime kiln at Kakontwe with an
annual production in excess of 100,000 tons of lime.
33.         Investment Program.  In 1974 GECAMINES undertook a major expans-
ion plan designed to increase its copper smelting capacity from 470,000 tpy
to 570,000 tpy6/ and its cobalt smelting capacity from 16,000 tpy to 29,000
tpy by 1979. The project consisted of: (i) the development of two new open-

6/ The expansion plan would have brought refined copper production capacity

pit mines;  (ii) construction of primary crushing facilities and of a new
concentrator at Dima;  (iii) construction of a flash smelter and electro
refinery together with the required ancillary facilities; (iv) modification
of the existing hydrometallurgical plants; (v) expansion of existing indus-
trial infrastructure; and (vi) construction of some 2,000 additional houses
for GECAMINES employees. As mentioned (para. 30), the Bank, the Libyan Arab
Foreign Bank and the EIB, participated in the financing of the Company's ex-
pansion program. The project started late but progressed satisfactorily
until 1978, when it was halted as a result of the hostilities in the Shaba
region. In 1979, prompted by the deterioration of production performance,
the Company launched two new programs: the first combined elements of the
original expansion program with urgent maintenance and rehabilitation needs
and was designed to return annual copper metal production to 470,000 tons by
1982, while the second program aimed at expanding the annual copper metal
production capacity to 570,000 tons by 1984, along with the completion of the
rest of the original expansion program. and the rehabilitation of certain aux-
iliary units. The modification of the original project scope was agreed by
the Bank and the colenders and an Amending Agreement reflecting these changes
in scope was signed in 19797/. As a result of the combined effect of con-
tinued depressed copper and cobalt prices, serious managerial weaknesses,
financial problems, inappropriate Government intervention, and reduced
external capital availability, GECAMINES had to reduce drastically its
1981-85 investment plan by discontinuing work on component (iii) mentioned
above, and completion of yet unfinished part of the expansion program was
postponed indefinitely. A scaled-down program, considered as an absolute
minimum, was prepared instead, consisting mostly of rehabilitation or repla-
cement of mining and metallurgical equipment.  A Completion Report is now
being prepared by the Bank Industry Department on the GECAMINES Mining
Expansion project. It is estimated that for the period 1983-88 the Company
would need about US$500 million in new investments, including mining equip-
ment, spare parts and inventory replacements, to sustain its present operat-
ing capacity (para. 31).
34.        Organization and Management.  GECAMINES is managed by a ninemember
Board of Directors, including its Managing Director, all appointed by
Presidential Decree. Although in theory decisions affecting the Company are
collective, in practice most decisions are taken by the Managing Director
after consultation with the Company's supervisory authority. In May 1982,
the Government appointed an expatriate, the former deputy Managing Director,
as the Managing Director of GECAMINES, Until 1982, the Company's organiza-
tional structure, inherited from UMHK, was very centralized with functional
management in Lubumbashi (operations, finance and accounting, engineering)
controlling the three production centers at Lubumbashi, Likasi and Kolwezi.
7/ Amending Agreement No. R79230 of November 16, 1979.



- 13 -
Under the 1979 Amendment to the IBRD loan, GECAMINES agreed to use the ser-
vices of a consulting firm to review the adequacy of such an organizational
structure, recommend the appropriate structure for the Company and establish
a framework for improved personnel practices. The recommendations of the
consulting firm Currie, Coopers and Lybrand (CCL) were accepted by GECAMINES'
Board of Directors in December 1981 and their implementation began in January
1982. A full decentralization on a cost center basis is now underway toge-
ther with the installation of a comprehensive control system for top manage-
ment. The reorganization is expected to be completed by end 1984.
35.        GECAMINES is the largest concern and employer in the Shaba, with
some 35,000 workers, of which approximately 900 expatriates primarily in man-
agerial positions, mainly from Belgium. Since its creation in 1967, it has
pursued a program of Zairanisation with Zairians at the management level num-
bering now 2,400, compared to 900 in 1973. GECAMINES operates a large school
system, for locals and expatriates and also has training facilities in all
technical areas that are relevant to the Company's operations. Until 1982,
it was involved in several non-mining activities including farming and agro-
industries, an hotel and the management of the hospital in Lubumbashi in add-
ition to its own medical facilities. This situation posed some serious
strains on the Company's finances and staff resources and as a first step,
the Government decided in 1982 to take over the hotel.
36.        Production Performance.  The following table shows GECAMINES'
major metals production from 1975 to 1982.

a/  Preliminary estimates
Source: GECAMINES' annual reports.
During most of that period GECAMINES was not able to sustain its pre-1975
operating capacity of 470,000 tpy of copper. The increase in 1981 was pri-
marily due to the use of the Dima concentrator and the new open pit mines at
Mashamba and Dikuluwe. As noted earlier (para. 33), these new mines and



- 14 -
the concentrator were originally destined to increase mining and concentrat-
ing capacity to an estimated 570,000 tpy of copper metal content, with smelt-
ing capacity still at 470,000 tpy as the flash smelter and electrorefinery
were not completed. Effective capacity in mining and concentration is, how-
ever, much below that level primarily because of increasing down time in
mining equipment use due to lack of spare parts and skilled maintenance per-
sonnel, and of lower metal recovery rates in the concentrators due to varia-
tions in quality of ore feed and technical inefficiencies of some concentra-
tors of the Western group, particularly Kamoto and Kolwezi, as well as mana-
gerial shortcomings.
37.       Improvements  are necessary to restore GECAMINES's effective mining
and concentrating capacity. While lack of spare parts and skilled or exper-
ienced staff in sufficient numbers are the major bottlenecks, improvements
could be achieved by upgrading and ensuring the continuity of technical mana-
gement. In particular, better mine planning to ensure an efficient alloca-
tion of available mining equipment and higher selectivity in open pit mining
would lead to more homogeneous ore feed delivered to the concentrators.
Also, more efficient grinding methods, as well as efficient use of reagents
in the flotation cells to account for the lower grade ore fed now into the
concentrators is needed to improve the metal recovery rates in the concentra-
tors.
38.       GECAMINES' cost structure has worsened during the period 1974-
1980. Direct production costs which in 1974 represented 67 percent of total
cost decreased to 52 percent in 1980, while indirect costs' share of total
cost rose from 33 percent in 1974 to 48 percent in 1980. Further, while dir-
ect production costs decreased by 48 percent in real terms, indirect costs
increased in real terms by more than 65 percent, primarily because of in-
creased administrative and financial cost. The main reasons behind this
situation have been the inadequacy of GECAMINES' cost control and monitoring
systems as well as the non-responsiveness of the former management to a
serious cost reduction effort.
39.       With the willingness of the new management to tackle these problems
and the on-going implementation of the new organizational structure, GECA-
MINES is expected to show improvements in the area of cost control in the
coming years. The Company will need, however, to review the details of its
overhead costs and take strong actions to keep them in line.
40.      Financial Performance.  The following table shows some selected in-
dicators of GECAMINES financial performance during the period 1975-1981.

GECAMINES' metal sales totalled US$1,207 million in 1981 down from US$1,378
million in 1980 largely because of depressed copper prices and the slump of
the cobalt market (para. 50).  In 1981, copper sales amounted to 55 percent
of sales revenues, cobalt to 33 percent, and zinc, cadmium and precious
metals accounted for the remainder. Net income for the year 1981 was US$149
million after total taxes of US$103 million, depreciation allowances of US$47
million and interest expense of US$82 million. Out of the US$103 million in
taxes, US$64 million consisted of import duties and US$10 million of taxes on
expatriates' wages. Some US$62 million of the interest expense is imputable
to prefinancing charges (para. 43).
41.       GECAMINES' level of net income after tax is to an extent overstated
from a financial point of view, since: (i) it does not represent actual cash
availability to the Company as sales receipts are often delayed and sometimes
diverted (para. 50); and (ii) the low level of depreciation does not take
into account the depreciation of the local currency. Since 1976, date of the
last authorized asset revaluation, the Zaire was devalued by 84 percent (from
1Z = 1SDR in 1976 to 1Z = 0.16SDR in 1981); had assets been revalued accord-
ingly (4 times), GECAMINES would have shown in 1981 only a modest profit of
US$9 million instead of US$149 million. The result would have been a much
higher internal cash generation enabling the Company to cover a larger por-
tion of its investment program. The Government and GECAMINES need to have a



- 16 -
true value for the Company's assets to fully assess its income generation
capacity. An additional problem is the continued overvaluation of the Zaire
currency, despite the exchange rate adjustments mentioned above, since almost
all GECAMINES' output is exported, while, on average, only about 45 percent
of its cash expenditures are in foreign exchange. The revaluation of GECA-
MINES' assets is one of the problem areas which the proposed project would
address (para. 58).
42.       Though GECAM4INES' liquidity and cash flow problems can be explained
in part by the severe and persistent slump in metal prices, the main reasons
behind the Company's cash problems are rooted in the inefficiency of
SOZACOM's marketing and sales receipts management. At the time of appraisal
of Loan 1090-ZR in 1974 the typical lag between copper shipments F.O.B.
African ports and sales receipts was 3 months and for cobalt 9 months. At
present average lags stand at 9 months for copper and 30 months for cobalt.
This is illustrated in the table of para. 40 which shows a trebling of
accounts receivable in 1978-1980. While some of the delays particularly in
the case of cobalt are due to market conditions, they seem attributable to a
large extent to: (i) SOZACOM's inefficient handling and follow-up of sales;
(ii) slow inter-bank cash transactions; and (iii) non-Company demands on the
foreign exchange due to GECAMINES.
43.       During the interval between the time of metal shipments and trans-
fers by SOZACOM of final sales proceeds to GECAMINES, the Company's funds
needs are provided by Societe Generale des Minerais (SGM) through a pre-
financing arrangement at commercial rates (17 percent p.a. on average during
1981). During 1981, copper shipments were prefinanced at 70 percent of their
value estimated on the basis of the average monthly price prior to the ship-
ment and cobalt shipments were prefinanced at 35 percent. At the time of
final sales, SGM reimburses itself the equivalent of principal and interest,
and SOZACOM deducts its marketing commission. Because of these marketing
practices, GECAMINES' has had to pay increased financial charges for the pre-
financing of its products (para. 50).
44.       The liquidity problem of GECAMINES is illustrated by the fact that
for 1981 gross sales receipts were US$784 million or only 65 percent of
actual sales for that year mostly due to the delays in the final payments to
GECAMINES referred in para. 42.  Net sales receipts, after deduction of
SOZACOM's marketing expenses and repayments to SGM amounted to US$736
million, of which after apportionment by the Central Bank only US$296 million
were made available to GECAMINES, the remainder (US$440 million equivalent)
being paid in local currency. With minimum expenditures for replacement in-
vestments necessary for uninterrupted operations amounting to US$293 million
in foreign exchange and US$436 million in local currency, GECAMINES' cash
balances increased by only US$8 million at year end.
45.       Following an agreement with the EEC in 1982, and as a condition for
a SYSMIN loan to the Company, the Government agreed to allocate a monthly
amount of US$24 million (or US$288 million p.a.) equivalent to GECAMINES in
foreign exchange to cover its foreign exchange needs. As a result, GECA-



- 17 -
MINES' foreign exchange cash position improved somewhat during the year, but
because of lower sales revenues and the overvaluation of the official exchan-
ge rate the balance in local currency was not sufficient to cover all the
Company's local currency expenditures. Consequently, for 1982, GECAMINES
forecasted approximately US$2 million cash surplus in foreign exchange at
year end but a US$27 million cash deficit in local currency.
46.       For 1983 with a sales program of 440,000 tpy of copper and 5,000
tpy of cobalt, cash flow problems are expected to continue to affect GECA-
MINES, because of the depressed cobalt market and because some of the long-
term financing sought by the Company is unlikely to be available in time.
Total new financing sought during 1982-1983 was US$110 million equivalent
from the EEC, the CCCE, and the Belgian and Italian Governments. However, as
of December 1982, only US$20 million equivalent from the EEC and US$15
million equivalent from CCCE had been committed, reflecting the difficult en-
vironment in which GECAMINES has to operate.
47.       At the end of 1981, GECAMINES' total assets at book value amounted
to US$1,871 million with US$287 million in net fixed assets and US$1,584
million in current assets. Inventories of products and spare parts amounted
to US$379 million and the remaining current assets to US$1,205 million in-
cluding US$102 million in cash and bank deposits, and some US$54 million of
sales proceeds diverted by the Government during 1980 and 1981. Receivables
from SOZACOM and SGM were at US$933 million, including US$482 million repre-
senting cobalt sales that have still not taken place (para. 50). Current
liabilities stood at US$919 million, including US$426 million of prefinancing
and to which the current portion of the long-term debt of US$17 million
should be added. GECAMINES' long-term debt (including pension funds, provi-
sions and the current portion of the long-term debt) was US$269 million and
the Company maintained a satisfactory debt/capitalization ratio at 0.28.
GECAMINES experienced however serious liquidity problems during 1981. The
standard basis of determination of the quick ratio shows a value of 1.3 using
GECAMINES' relevant balance sheet items. A more realistic measure of this
ratio excludes from the quick assets the receivables from cobalt and the un-
compensated sales by the Government, and includes in the current liabilities
the current portion of the long-term debt; this calculation would result in
a quick ratio of 0.9. Moreover, even using the standard definition, during
three of the past five years the Company was not able to meet the quick ratio
covenant of 1.3 required by the IBRD loan.
48.       While GECAMINES' present financial difficulties are largely attri-
butable to external factors, the Company also bears some responsibility for
them. On the revenue side, it proved unable to improve its control over the
marketing of its products and on sales receipts although it had for several
years alerted the authorities to this problem; only in September 1982 did the
Government approve a new marketing agreement between GECAMINES and SOZACOM
(para. 52) which constitutes a substantial step towards such control. On the
expenditure side, GECAMINES was unable to contain costs, to establish a



- 18 -
strong Finance Department and strengthen its personnel and procurement man-
agement.  Specific cost studies wouLd be Carried out under the Project to
identify areas for cost reductions and measures to attain them, and GECAMINES
will be required to adequately staff its Finance, Procurement and Personnel
Departments (Section 3.01 (b. of draft Project Agreement).
Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation des linerais (SOZACOM)
49.       All GECAMAINES' production is marketed through SOZACOM (established
in 1976 as the state mineral marketing agency) with the help of the SGM, the
marketing arm of the old UNTK, former owner of GECAMINES. SOZACOM is managed
by a nine-member Board which includes the Managing Director and his deputy,
all appointed by Presidential Decree.  The Company employs some 400 personnel
including approximately 130 professionals and is organized around several
departments with responsibilities over copper, cobalt, other metals, finance,
control and marketing.   It has offices in Belgium and France.  Until 1981,
SOZACOM's mandate was limited to the marketing of GECAMINES' and Soci6t6
Miniere de Kisenge's (S1MK) productions. In April 1981, this mandate was ex-
tended by the Government to include MIBA's diamond production.
50.       Since 1976, and the signature of the original marketing agreement
between GECAMI4NES and SOZACOM, relat-ions between the two have been dif-
ficult. First, GECAMINES perceives SOZACOM as an additional layer to SGM,
between itself and its final clients; except for some direct zinc sales,
SOZACOM still relies on a network of agents to markelt most of GECAMINES' cop-
per and cobalt output.  As a result, GECAMINES is paying a double commission
on all its final sales.  An analysis of GECAMINES' sales revenues shows that
since 1976, the ratio of the realized copper price by GECAMINES to the pre-
vailing world market price went down from about 90 p(ercent during 1972-1976
to about 81 percent during 1976-1980. WZhile this situation has its origin in
GECAMINESt changing product mix, it has also been the result of higher mar-
keting costs paid by the Company. Second, this marketing system has been one
of the major sources of GECAI4INES' financial problems (para. 42): with SOZA-
COM assuming ownership of the metals at the time they are shipped from
African ports, GECAMINES has been kept in total ignorance of all matters re-
garding these sales until the final transfer of sales receipts to its ac-
counts. Furthermore, some metal sales were not credited by SOZACOM to GECA-
MINES but to Governiment's accounts in some cases to permit barter transac-
tions, thus reducing the total sales proceeds remitted to the Company.  The
amount involved is estimated at US$54 million during the period 1980-81, and
to about US$32 milliion since then, and the Government has agreed to repay
GECAMINES according to an agreed schedule (para. 63). Third, SOZACOM's
cobalt marketing strategy which aimed at maintaining the high prices it had
obtained in 1978-79 backfired by decreasing Zaire's share of the world cobalt
marKet. With cobalt a by-product of its copper operations and very low pro-
duction cost, GECAMINES had always enjoyed a substantial comparative advan-
tage over its competitors and was the world's dominant producer and price
setter until 1977.  SOZACOM after some previous i ncreases raised its pro-
ducer's price to US$25 per pound in, February 1979 whiich resulted in: (i) the
entry in the market of new producers leading to over capacity:  and (ii) com-
pression of the deraand for coba'lt and increased substitution.  These factors,



- 19 -
together with the world recession, led to a serious depression of the market
with spot prices now around US$3.5-4.0 per pound and world cobalt demand at
18,000 tons in 1981, compared to 24,000 tons in 1977 and 26,000 tons in
1974. The depression of the cobalt market has further aggravated GECAMINES'
already precarious financial situation, since the pre-financing arrangements
worked out between SGM, SOZACOM and GECAMINES in the days of relative market
and price stability have now become a heavy burden on GECAMINES' finances.
With market prices for cobalt of about US$3.5-4.0 per pound at present, and
the totality of the GECAMINES' stock estimated at 20,000 tons (over one year
of western world consumption) having been prefinanced at a weighted average
of US$5.7 per pound, both GECAMINES and SGM face a serious situation, which
is now the subject of discussions between SGM and SOZACOM/GECAMINES.
Major Problems and Prospects
51.       In 1981, GECAMINES' management approached IDA for the financing of
a rehabilitation program whose main objective was to help stabilize the
Company's smelting capacity at 470,000 tpy of copper annually. Following the
appointment of the new Managing Director in May 1982,the Company again re-
quested IDA support for a comprehensive recovery program to include in afirst
stage assistance to management in the financial, marketing and legal areas.
During this period, the Association continued the dialogue with both GECA-
MINES and the Government, on the need to: (i) arrive at new contractual
arrangements between GECAMINES and SOZACOM; (ii) enact new tax legislation
to alleviate GECAMINES' fiscal burden; (iii) stop undue Government inter-
ferences in GECAMINES' affairs and inter alia reimburse the Company for un-
compensated sales; (iv) pursue GECAMINES' restructuring and management
strengthening effort; and (v) define a long-term strategy for the rehabili-
tation and possible expansion of the Company.
52.       As a result of the determination of GECAMINES' new Managing Dir-
ector to assume better control of the marketing of its products, as well as
the continuous dialogue between the Government and the Association, the
Government approved in September 1982 a new Marketing Agreement between GECA-
MINES and SOZACOM. The new agreement was reviewed and found satisfactory by
the Association; the implementation of the Agreement will be the object of
regular exchanges of views with the Association and any amendment that may
prove necessary will be subject to the approval of the Association (Section
3.05 of draft Project Agreement). Under this new agreement, GECAMINES will
retain ownership of all the metals it produces until the final sale. SOZACOM
will now act purely as an agent with all sales accounts in GECAMINES' name.
Complete implementation of the Marketing Agreement, now underway, requires
the transfer of all SOZACOM's sales accounts to GECAMINES, the establishment
of a GECAMINES' representation in SOZACOM'S offices, agreement by both
parties on a marketing strategy defined in common and the participation of
GECAMINES in new contract negotiations starting in 1983. Controlling and
maintaining some important aspects of this agreement, such as GECAMINES' new



- 20 -
legal obligations aynd the definition of a marketing strategy, would require
considaerable efforts by GECAMINES, particularly in terms of qualified person-
nel.  Orne of the purposes of the proposed Project would be to provide such
help.  GECAMINES will be required to maintain an adequately staffed unit at
SOZACOM's offices (para. 62)).
53.        On the taxation issue, in September 1981, the Government suspended
all export taxes untoLi  December 1983, and asked the liF to undertake a study
of the problem. The study, prepared with Bank participation was submitted to
the Government in May 1982. The recommended tax regime involves, ir. addi tion
to the corporate profts tax, the introduction of two levies:  a basic royal-
ty at a proportionate ad-valorem rate on the-total of GECAMMINES' exported
productlion, and a progressive export duty on sales of copper based on an
indexed threshold price, fixed so as to permit a reasonable profitability for
the Company withoum: overtaxIng it in periods of low prices. The new system
thus would be more f lexible and more conducive to the long-term growth of the
industry as it wou:Ld i, ply a lighter fiscal burden on the industry in times
of low metal prices, increasing costs and overvaluation of the currency.
54.       The Government agreed in 1982, to provide GECA§INES with the
foreign exchange necessary for its operations and investments and to repay
the Company the amounts for all uncompensated sales that have occurred
(para. 63),  The Government has now come to realize that a continuation of
past practices in these areas would hurt the maintenance and rehabilitation
efforts of GECAMINES and in the long run hamper its ability to generate suf-
ficient foreign exchange for the country. Also, GECAMINES is now implementing
the recommendations of the CCL study (para. 34) and the new Managing Director
has shown his willingness to strengthen areas of major weaknesses and imple-
ment tighter cost control procedures.
55.       The question remains, however, of GECAMINES' longer term rehabili-
tation and expansion strategy. Given GECAMINES' investment needs and the
limited prospect for a strong recovery of the copper and cobalt market in the
next few years, GECAMINES is not likely to be in a position to generate large
amounts of funds or to raise them through conventional debt financing, i.e.
commercial banks and international financial institutions, and it is there-
fore essential that a coherent long-term program be developed by the Company,
in consultation with the Government, encompassing all aspects of GECAMINES'
operations to optimnize the use of all available sources of financing (both
debt and equity capital). Such a program would put into proper perspective
the various short-term measures including the proposed Project that are being
undertaken to strengthen GECAMINES' management and improve its institutional
framework, and focus on the elements required to assure the Company a viable
future. The Association has initiated discussions with the Government and
GECAMINES on various options to ensure a long-term strengthening of the Comp-
any through external assistance.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
56.       The proposed project was identified during an IDA mission to Zaire
in June 1982. The Government of Zaire and GECAMINES had expressed their
interest in a Technical Assistance project to help strengthen GECAMINES
management and its ability to play the new role assigned to it in the new
Marketing Agreement, and help initiate its rehabilitation program. The pro-
ject was appraised in September 1982. Negotiations were held in Washington
from February 9 to February 11, 1983. The Zairian delegation was headed by
Mr. Djamboleka, Secretary of State for Finance. There is no separate
appraisal report for this project. Supplemental data are contained in Annex
III.
Project Objectives
57.       The long-term objective of the project is to lay the foundations of
GECAMINES' enduring rehabilitation. In the short term, the project would aim
at: (i) undertaking financial and engineering studies to improve the
Company's cost control and prepare a rehabilitation project; (ii)
strengthening GECAMINES' management in areas of major weaknesses, especially
in the production, financial, marketing and legal fields; and (iii) helping
consolidate the reorganization effort now under way.
Project Description
58.       The project comprises the following components:
A. Studies
(a) revaluation of GECAMINES' fixed assets and determination of
the Company's net worth (para. 41). The study will consist
of: (i) a technical and economic evaluation of all of GECA-
MINES fixed plant assets; (ii) the determination of new
depreciation allowances for GECAMINES' assets, in line with
the results obtained in (i); (iii) the development of a com-
prehensive methodology for periodic revaluation of fixed
assets and depreciation procedures; (iv) the development of
specific recommendations to GECAMINES with regards to future
fixed assets management; and (v) the economic evaluation of
GECAMINES' ore reserves. The study will require an estimated
60 man-months.
(b) a detailed study of administrative and overhead costs includ-
ing proposed measures for major costs reduction (para 38).
Three main areas will be covered by the study: (i) an analy-
sis of the contractual agreements between GECAMINES and its
sub-contractors. The study will review existing procedures
for contract award and management and develop new procedures
that would lead to greater cost efficiency in this area; (ii)



- 22 -
an analysis of GECAMINES' labor costs and recommendations in
the areas of payroll procedures and management, of labor costs
and personnel administration; and (iii) an analysis of over-
head costs with special regard to social, medical and fringe
activities. This study will also require an estimated 60 man-
-months; and
(c)  a technical study aimed primarily at improving the efficiency
of metallurgical operations through increased metal recovery
in the metallurgical units (para. 37). This study will review
the adequacy of existing concentration methods in the Western
Group with respect to ore quality, and make specific recom-
mendations for improvements. It will require an estimated 100
man-months.
B.   Expert Assistance
(a)  technical assistance to the Production Department in open pit
mining and maintenance operation to help increase productivity
and provide on-the-job training to GECAMINES' personnel. A
team of mining and mechanical engineers as well as experienced
foremen will be provided to GECAMINES for a total of 288
man-months and will assist in production and workshop
operations at Kolwezi in the Western Group. An experienced
project manager in charge of the team will be placed under the
direct supervision of the Director of Production;
(b)  assistance to the Finance Department to help improve current
policies and procedures and the Department's performance
(para. 48). Financial specialists will be provided to GECA-
MINES for a total of 24 man-months. These specialists will
work with the Finance Department and maintain close contact
with the Managing Director. In addition to reviewing the
Department's current procedures, they will provide assistance
in the areas of financial planning and forecasting, liquid
assets management and investment programming and budgeting;
(c)  strengthening GECAMINES' organizational structure and training
capacity to help improve efficiency. Two specialists attached
to the Managing Director's office will assist GECAMINES in the
area of general organization for a period of 12 months each
(para. 34):
(i) an organization expert will monitor the implementation
of the CCL recommendations, propose possible adjustments
to it, as requested, and ensure its acceptance by the
staff; and



- 23 -
(ii)  a human resources specialist will help define staff
development programs as well as personnel management and
administration policies within the framework recommended
by CCL, and will assist in the operation of the newly
opened GECAMINES training center, in the assessment of
its suitability to the company's needs and in developing
changes in its activities as needed.
(d)  assistance to review current marketing practices and develop
new strategies and control systems in line with the new
Marketing Agreement (para. 52).  Marketing specialists will be
provided to GECAMINES for a total of 12 man-months. These
specialists will work in cooperation with the Director of
Planning, Research and Development in the Managing Director's
office and will advise him on all marketing-related problems
facing GECAMINES. In particular,they will review all account-
ing and marketing control procedures to be established by
GECAMINES under the new Marketing Agreement; recommend new
control procedures, if appropriate; provide GECAMINES with in-
depth knowledge of commercial practices and procedures in the
non-ferrous metals trade; prepare recommendations for the con-
version of the existing commercial department into a marketing
unit; and help formulate a long-term marketing strategy for
GECAMINES; and
(e)  legal counsel to review GECAMINES' financial and commercial
obligations contracted directly and indirectly (through
SOZACOM and the Government) and provide advice on new con-
tracts (prefinancing, marketing agreements) (para. 52). An
estimated 18 man-months of legal assistance will be provided
to GECA1INES.  This assistance will be carried out by a law
firm with extensive experience in commodity contracting and
international financial transactions. In addition to its
advisory role, this firm will help GECAMINES reorganize its
own legal Department and develop and implement a training pro-
gram for the Company's lawyers.
Project Cost and Financing
59.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and duties from which
the project would be exempt, is estimated at about US$9.3 million, of which
US$7.0 million in foreign exchange.

60        An estimated 530 man/months of consultants' services excluding
GECAMINES' staff input of 48 man/months, will be required. No local con-
sultants are expected to be used. The average cost of the foreign consult-
ants to be used in the project (including salaries, subsistence and air
transportation) has been estimated at: (i) US$15,000 per man-month for the
audit and financial consultants; (ii) US$13,200 per man-month for engineer-
ing and production consultants; (iii) US$16,700 per man-month for marketing
consultants; (iv) US$8,000 per man-month for organization and training con-
sultants; and (v) US$25,000 per man-month for legal advisors. These rates
are justified by the highly specialized nature of the tasks involved and the
need to obtain professionals of very high caliber. The cost estimates are
based on October 1982 prices, and include physical contingencies of 10 per-
cent on consultants' fees and local costs. Price contingencies are based on
escalation for foreign rates, in US dollar terms, of 8 and 7.5 percent in
1983 and 1984 respectively, and 7 percent in 1985, and for local costs of 18
percent in 1983, 1984 and 1985.
61.       The proposed Credit of US$7.0 million would finance 100 percent of
the estimated foreign exchange costs, or 75 percent of the total project
cost, with GECAMINES providing the remainder. The Credit would be on-lent to
GECAMINES for 10 years including a 3 year grace period at the IBRD interest
rate in effect at the time the documents are circulated to the Executive
Directors and including the customary commitment fee. The terms and condi-
tions of the on-lending agreement between the Government and GECAMINES would



- 25 -
require IDA approval (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment). Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be a condition of
effectiveness (Section 6.01 (a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
The Association reserves the right to refinance the Credit under any future
credit for a GECAMINES project.
62.       GECAMINES would bear the foreign exchange risk.  To ensure  ade-
quate implementation of the new Marketing Agreement, GECAMINES will consult
with the Association on the qualifications and experience of its personnel to
be attached to SOZACOM's offices (Section 3.02 of the draft Project Agree-
ment). GECAMINES will also be required to hold yearly consultations with the
Association on its investment program (Section 3.06 of the draft Project
Agreement).
63.       As mentioned above (para. 53), the Government of Zaire has under-
taken a revision of the current tax regime applicable to GECAMINES. The
draft tax legislation was reviewed during negotiations and adoption of a
revised tax system acceptable to the Association, would be a condition of
effectiveness (Section 6.01 (b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
The Government would be required to provide GECAMINES with access to foreign
exchange necessary to conduct its operations and investments (Section 4.06 of
the draft Development Credit Agreement). The Government would also be re-
quired to provide the Association with GECAMINES' audited accounts for 1982
and other evidence satisfactory to the Association on the amounts due to
GECAMINES for uncompensated sales and to repay GECAMINES for all uncom-
pensated sales following the schedule agreed upon during negotiations (Sec-
tion 4.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Receipt by the Asso-
ciation of the 1982 audited accounts and other information, and of the
Government's agreement on the repayment schedule would be conditions of
effectiveness (Sections 6.01 (c) and (d) of the Draft Development Credit
Agreement).
Project Implementation and Reporting Requirements
64.       The project would be carried out under the general supervision of
GECAMINES' Managing Director and administered by the Department of Planning,
Research and Development. The selection of consultants under part A, sec-
tions (a) and (b) (para. 58), have been conducted following Bank guidelines
and procedures, and approved by the Association. Work has started for the
overhead costs and asset revaluation studies. Price Waterhouse, of Canada,
in association with Roche Ltd., also of Canada, and Price Waterhouse, Africa,
have been awarded the contract for studies under part A, sections (a) and (b)
respectively.
65.       The metallurgical study (part A, section (c)) would be entrusted to
an experienced foreign consulting firm under terms of reference acceptable to
IDA.   The qualification and experience of all consultants for the project
would be satisfactory to the Association, and their selection and terms and
conditions of employment would be in accordance with the World Bank Guide-
lines for the Employment of Consultants (Section 2.02 (a) of the draft Pro-
ject Agreement).



- 26 -
66.       GECAMINES would submit a progress report to IDA within one month of
the completion of each quarter, and a Project Completion Report no later than
6 months after the closing date (Sections 2,04 (d) and (f) of the draft Pro-
ject Agreement). GECAMINES would maintain separate accounts for the project
(Section 4.01 of the draft Project Agreement). GECAMINES would also adhere
to all conditions previously agreed upon in the last Bank Loan Agreement
(Loan 1090-ZR), in particular concerning auditing and financial covenants
(Section 5.01 (b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). GECAMINES'
accounts are satisfactory and will continue to be audited annually by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Association. The Project is expected to
be completed by December 1985.
Disbursements
67.       The estimated disbursements schedule is given in the Credit and
Project Summary. Because of the advanced stage of the Project, advance con-
tracting is expected to amount to US$1.7 million and retroactive financing to
US$0.9 million (Schedule 1 of the draft Credit Agreement). IDA would disbur-
se against 100 percent of the consultants' foreign expenditures;  all dis-
bursements would be fully documented.
Benefits and Risks
68.       The major benefit of the Project will be to strengthen GECAMINES'
management and cost effectiveness, thereby laying the foundation for its
rehabilitation. The Project will provide the Company's management and the
Government with objective analyses and data indispensable to adequate deci-
sion making in key areas which include: (i) marketing to ensure a better co-
ordination between production and sales programs; (ii) assets position and
other financial indicators to lay the basis for a sounder financial policy
and better cost effectiveness; and (iii) organizational structure and per-
sonnel management. The Project is only one facet of the current reorganiza-
tion effort of GECAMINES. It is, however, an essential one in that it would
ensure the necessary expertise and insight of GECAMINES' problems, and provi-
de it with the external support it needs to decide and implement reforms
which are sensitive given the importance of the Company in Zaire's economy.
69.       The major risk associated with the Project relates to the
cooperation between GECAMINES and SOZACOM. The attainment of several object-
ives of the Project is predicated upon the adequate implementation of the new
Marketing Agreement between GECAMINES and SOZACOM (para. 52). This includes
most notably, the control by GECAMINES of the products and financial flows
handled by SOZACOM, the conditions included in SOZACOM's sales contracts, and
finally the review of the legal obligations it has taken over from SOZACOM.
The consultation clause (para. 62, Section 3.02 of draft Project Agreement)
would enable the Association to comment on the necessary qualifications and
terms of reference of the GECAMINES staff posted at SOZACOM to control the
proper accounting of shipments and receipts, and to supervise the adequate
implementation of the Marketing Agreement. The services of the legal and
marketing experts provided under the Project would enable GECAMINES to build



- 27 -
up the necessary expertise for the analysis of sales contracts. Finally,
GECAMINES' obligations inherited from SOZACOM would be reviewed by the legal
experts and checked against the covenants concerning the negative pledge
clause and the set-aside arrangement (Sections 21.03, 17.03 and 17.04 of Loan
Agreement No. 1090-ZR of March 8, 1975), and the utilization of normal
marketing channels (Section 7 of the Amending Agreement to Loan 1090-ZR of
November 16, 1979). The risk of delay in project implementation is almost
non-existent given its advanced stage.
PART V- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
70.       The draft Development Credit Agreemenit between the Republic of
Zaire and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and GECAMINES and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
71.       Special conditions for the Project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Special conditions of effectiveness would be: (i) adoption by
the Government of Zaire of agreed tax legislation applicable to GECAMINES
(para. 63); (ii) signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and GECAMINES (para. 61); (iii) providing the Association with GECAMINES'
audited accounts for 1982 and other evidence satisfactory to the Association
giving up-to-date information on the amounts due to GECAMINES for uncom-
pensated sales (para. 63); and (iv) providing the Association with the
agreed timetable for the repayment of uncompensated sales (para. 63).
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
72.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

Credit 571-ZR          Railway and River Transport Project; US$26 Million
Credit of July 11, 1975; Effective Date: November 18,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project included: (a) technical assistance to ONATRA including a
comprehensive training program; (b) financing of a major part of ONATRA's
1975-77 investment requirements for river transport equipment, railway
improvements and track renewal; (c) additional river markings on the
Kinshasa-Ilebo waterway; (d) port studies; and (e) a preliminary engineering
study for the Ilebo-Kinshasa rail link. Project implementation was initially
slow due to a combination of management shortcomings and financial constraints
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weakness in
project execution.

which improved during execution.   All procurement is now completed or underway;
and credit funds are fully committed.  ONATRA's financial performance has
improved significantly as a result of tight controls. Operations have improved
in the ports, in river transport, in the shipyards and in the railway. WThile
overall project execution is proceeding satisfactorily, extension of the closing
date is being considered to allow for some additional procurement of spare
parts.
Credit 624-ZR          Second Education Project; US$21 million Credit
of December 28, 1976; Effective Date: June 29, 1977;
Closing Date: September 30, 1982
The project consisted of construction and equipment for five new
rural primary teacher training schools, the rehabilitation and re-equipment of
six agricultural technician training schools and one higher agricultural
institute, technical assistance and fellowships for these institutions, and
evaluation of the new programs promoted in the project and the carrying out of
preinvestment studies in preparation for further education projects. Because of
implementation delays a-nd exceedingly high inflation, the total cost of the
project substantially exceeded available funds. Fellowships training of teachers
and several preinvestment studies have been successfully carried out.
Consideration was given to revising the project to eliminat civil works and in
their place supply equipment to agriculture technical schools. After a review
of this possibility, it was determined that the Government would be unable to
satisfactorily implement a revised project. The project was therefore closed on
September 30, 1982 and undisbursed credit funds of about US$19.0 million were
cancelled.
Credit 660-ZR          Cotton Rehabilitation Project - US$8 million Credit of
December 28, 1976; Effective Date: May 31, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982, Cofinanced by Belgium
Project implementation has been slow from the beginning due to
various administrative obstacles and the dissolution of ONAFITEX, the National
Cotton and Project Implementing Agency, in May 1978. Coton-Zaire, a public
enterprise, was created in December 1979 to replace the former ONAFITEX regional
Office. An Amendment Agreement reflecting these changes was signed on October
10, 1980; Government counterpart funds for investments were transferred to
Coton-Zaire and the technical assistance team was integrated in the company with
clear responsibilities. The cotton campaigns since 1979 have been carried out
on a regular schedule and production, although still very low, is increasing.
Producer prices have been increased since 1981 in nominal terms. Efforts now
focus on cQnverting Coton-Zaire from a public to a mixed-capital company, like
those that handle cotton promotion elsewhere in Zaire and which are to be
supported by IDA's Second Cotton Project (Cr. 1264-ZR). Continuity of effort
and support for area cotton farmers are at stake in view of the credit's
end-1982 closing date. Government is now negotiating with possible private
sector partners. The Government has requested a postponement in the closing
date and the matter is under review.

Credit 697-ZR          Ituri Livestock Development; US$8 Million Credit of
August 2, 1977: Effective Date: December 30, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982; Cofinanced by the
French Ministry of Cooperation, the Federal Republic
of Germany and Canadian International Development Agency
The project aims at improving livestock production in the Ituri
subregion through the provision of improved animal health and production
services, the training of staff and pastoralists, development of three ranches
to finish range cattle and rehabilitation of marketing and slaughter facilities
including two abattoirs.   Despite slow project start-up and continuing
constraints related to high rates of inflation, low prices for beef in some
areas, late receipt of government counterpart funds impressive results have been
achieved. They include: (i) the establishment and operation of a veterinary and
livestock extension service; (ii) the implementationl of a training program for
extension officers and livestock producers; (iii) the establishment of a
livestock producer cooperative which arranges the supply of veterinary products;
(iv) vaccination and drenching of about 200,000 cattLle annually (two thirds of
the project's objective); (v) initiation of pasture development; and (vi)
establishment of regular livestock markets. Future emphasis in the subsector
should be placed on support to rural institutions such as cooperatives, and on
rehabilitation and maintenance of marketing infrastructure and activities.
Credit 710-ZR         Fourth DFC; US$10 Million Credit of August 2, 1977;
Effective Date: December 3, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
SOFIDE was established in January 1970 and the Bank Group provided a
substantial share of its initial resources through an IFC equity investment of
US$750,000 and a First IDA Credit of US$5 million. Three other credits of US$10
million each were granted in 1971, 1973 and 1977.  SOFIDE started operating on
July 1st, 1970, with a General Manager seconded by the Bank.  In May 1973, a
Zairian General Manager, assisted by an expatriate Senior Advisor, replaced the
Bank-seconded General Manager. The institution has developed into a well run
and capable development bank, despite the policies of zairianization
retrocession which have disrupted the industrial and financial sectors. SOFIDE
has recently diversified its activities by increasing its' operations in key
economic sectors, especially agriculture and transportation. SOFIDE has also
decentralized its operation and has recently opened three regional offices. In
1976, the Bank's Operation Evaluation Department conducted a project performance
audit of the First Credit to SOFIDE and found that SOFIDE had been generally
successful in fulfilling its objectives and had developed into a competent
organization. The original closing date (December 31, 1981) was extended by one
year to permit disbursement of the remaining credit funds which were fully
committed to subprojects. The credit will close at end 1982 as scheduled.

Credit 796-ZR          Oil Palm Project - US$9 Million Credit of June 8, 1978:
Effective Date: January 30, 1981; Closing Date: December
31, 1985; Cofinanced by African Development Fund (ADF)
Banque Arabe pour le Developpement Economique en Afrique
(BADEA) and Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE)
The project consists of a five-year program to support the
rehabilitation of existing oil palm plantations through investments for
replanting and new plantings, renewal of oil mills and transport equipment,
improvement and expansion of social infrastructure; the employment of additional
staff, and training of staff. Effectiveness was delayed by the difficulties
which arose between the companies and the Government over the role of the
companies in the Project; by administrative bottlenecks, particularly in the
Ministry of Agriculture; and by the complex cofinancing arrangements. One of the
three companies which was to participate in the project has withdrawn and the
investment and financing plans were revised. Of the remaining companies, one
has begun a planting program out of its own resources but has delayed a major
decision on rehabilitation of its oil mills until 1982. The second company has
placed equipment orders for vehicles and oil mill parts to start its planting
and oil mill rehabilitation program. Cancellation of BADEA's $4.4 million credit
on August 10, 1982 will force a revision of cost estimates and the financing
plan. It may be possible to accomodate these without major disruptions as a
result of savings in oil-mill rehabilitation.
Credit 902-ZR          Railway Project: US$20.0 million Credit of June 14, 1979;
Effective Date: January 27, 1981; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983; Cofinanced by the Saudi Fund for
Development; Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau; the
OPEC Special Fund; and the African Development Bank
The Project supports the 1979-1982 investment program of the Societe
Nationale des Chemins de fer Zairois (SNCZ) and includes track rehabilitation,
equipment and operational investments to increase SNCZ's effective capacity.
The project finances: (a) renewing and upgrading 210 km of track and ballasting
another 285 km; (b) 100 ore wagons, 9 shunting locomotives and 12 passenger
coaches; (c) spare parts for locomotives and wagons; (e) extension of Ilebo port
facilities; (f) social infrastructure; and (g) middle/senior technical and
management staff training and consultant services. Effectiveness of this credit
was delayed in particular 'oy slow progress in completing cofinancing
arrangements. Disbursements have also been slow owing to the weakness of
purchase and storage controls which prevented placing purchase orders in a
timely manner. The Project scope is likely to require revision as a result of
the recent decision of the Saudi/OPEC Fund to suspend disbursements following
Zaire's reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Israel.

Credit 916-ZR          Fourth Highway Project: US$26 million Credit of
June 14, 1979; Effective Date: July 16, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982 and postponed to
December 31, 1983; Cofinanced by the EEC Special
Action Fund and the Saudi Fund for Development.
The project was designed to help finance the 1979-81 road
maintenance and rehabilitation program of the Office des Routes (OR). It
comprises the maintenance and rehabilitation of about 40,000 km of roads,
including 800 km of paved road; strengthening and replacement of bridges;
construction of workshops and warehouses; procuremenit of motor and cable ferries
and replacement motors, and of highway maintenance equipment, spare parts and
fuel; improvement of the National Public Works Laboratory, and technical
assistance and training. Implementation of the project had to be postponed
owing to a one year delay in credit effectiveness. Procurement of equipment and
spare parts is now substantially completed, and the maintenance/rehabilitation
program which has been extended to include 1982, has; become fully operational.
However fuel shortages have in the past months endangered seriously the
execution of the program and, maintenance objectives for 1982 will not be
achieved. Solutions are being studied to overcome the problems created by the
Saudi Fund's decision to suspend disbursements on its remaining balance.
Credit 998-ZR:         Fifth DFC; US$18.5 Million Credit of June 16, 1980
Effective Date: January 22, 1981; Closing Date:
June 30, 1984
As of September 30,1982 US$15.5 million of this Credit had been
committed under the investment component and US$1.6 million for the working
capital component . Disbursement of credit funds is expected to accelerate
rapidly in the latter half of 1982 following the normal IDA and SOFIDE approval
of sub-projects and the placement of orders. Comments on SOFIDE are reflected
under Credit 710-ZR.
Credit 1040-ZR         Smallholder Maize Project: US$11 million Credit of
October 9, 1980; Effective Date: May 11, 1981; Closing
Date: December 31, 1987; Cofinanced by the International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and African
Development Bank (ADB)
The project aims to improve existing farming systems in an area
covering about 26,000 km2 around Mbuji Mayi, increase maize production from
about 80,000 tons to about 120,000 tons per annum and increase the incomes of
about 53,000 farmers. The Project includes (a) provision of inputs including
fertilizer and improved maize seeds, transport, distribution and sales services
and storage facilities for inputs; (b) development of the private marketing
sector; (c) development of improved extension, training and research facilities;
(d) development of road and drinking water infrastructure; and (e) technical
assistance in support of the above activities. Project implementation is
proceeding well after initial financial and personnel recruitment problems.

Maize output increased by about 30,000 tons in the first agricultural year - far
in excess of projections; fertilizer and seed demand are very strong and credit
repayments are good. The principal problem is weak Government budgetary
support, notably failure to provide PMKO, the implementing agency, with
fertilizer as agreed.  PMKO also has had personnel and procurement problems.
Credit 1089-ZR         Kwilu-Ngongo Sugar Project: US$26.4 million Credit of
January 7, 1981; Effective Date May28, 1981; Closin_g
Date: December 31, 1986; Cofinanced by the French
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Econmqe(CE
The Project aims at increasing sugar production through the
rehabilitation and expansion of factory, field and transportation capacity and
also at promoting foodcrop production. Project implementation is progressing
satisfactorily; procurement and disbursement are well advanced. It is expected
that factory rehabilitation and expansion will be completed one year ahead of
schedule and field rehabilitation according to schedule; construction of housing
and offices is nearly completed. Foreign exchange allocations have been below
agreed levels and the Project entity has had to purchase foreign exchange on the
parallel market. Supervision missions have discussed the matter with Government
but have met with no success. However, Project implementation will not be
delayed by this problem.
