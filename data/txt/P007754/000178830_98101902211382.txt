PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CENTRAL BANK OF NITCARA`YUA
WIThi THE GUARANTEE OF THF,
REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
FOR AN AGRICULTUPAL CREDIT PROJEFCT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Central Bank of Nicaragua for the equivalent of US$8.5 mil-
lion to help finance a three-year orogram of credits for livestock and
agricultural development in Nicaragua.  The Republic of Nicaragua will
guarantee the loan and assume the exchnnge risk. The loan would have a
term of 16 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest Pt 7-1/h
percent per annum.   The proceeds of tte loar would be relent through
the state-owned Banco Nacional de Nicaragua (BN) and six private
participating banks to ranchers and farmers for terms of up to 12 years,
including not more than 4 years grace. Smaller beneficiaries would pay
interest of 10.25 percent per annum; larger sub-borrowers would nay
interest of 11 percent per annum plus an appraisal and supervision fee
at an annual rate of one percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Effects of the December 23, 1972, Earth-
ayake upon the Economic Position and Prospects of Nicaragua't (139-NI) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on April 26, 1973 (R73-82) in con-
nection with the Credit for the Earthquake Reconstruction Project. A
further economic report, which reviews the economic growth of Nicaraguan
since 1950 and analyzes the medium-term growth and balance of payments
prospects in the light of the country's reconstruction needs, is scheduled
to be distributed to the Executive Directors in the next few weeks. The
following paragraphs summarize the conclusions of Report No. 139-NI and
the preliminary conclusions of the forthcoming report on medium-term pros-
pects. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        After several decades of virtual stagnation, the Nicaraguan
economy after World War II began a period of strong growth. Real gross
domestic product increased at an annual average rate of about 6.1 percent
during the period 19h6-71, so that, even with a population growth rate of
2.9 percent per annum, real per capita incomes increased significantly,
reaching about US$44o in 1971. The main determinant of growth has been
production of agricultural conmodities. mainly cotton and coffee, for export.
This in turn has meant that the upward trend has been markedly uneven.
as the vagaries of weather and changes in world market conditions for
the principal primary commodities have caused periodic sharp variations
from the long-term trend. Nicaraguals heavy dependence on cotton and
coffee, however, has been gradually lessening. Manufacturing industry,
which has since become the most dy-namic sector of the economy, now accounts



for around one-fifth of value added, as increasing agricultural incomes, in
turn, expanded the demand for domestic manufactured goods.   However, a
good part of the stimulus resulted from Nicaragua's successful promotion
of beef and sugar exports to trie U.S. and of competitive industries in
the Central American Common Market (CAGM).   The growth of manufacturing
production has been on the basis of relatively simple activities such as
the mixirg of chemicals and processing of agricultural products.   The latter
is by far the most important branch of industry, and has contributed
significantly to the develoDment of internal linkages in the economy and to
raising the value of exports, especially beef.
4.        The growth of recent years has not, however, contributed to mitigating
the traditional inequalities in the distribution of wealth and income.    The
major gains in agricultural output and income have been made by a small number
of large farmers who occupy about 4Q0percent of total farm land.   In recent
years, however, the Government has started some programs aimed at thFe lower income
groups in the rural areas.    Foremost amongst thiese are an AID-financed
rurel electrification program through cooperatives assisted by the National
Power Company, various land titling and settlement schemes of the Agrarian
Institute of Nicaragua (IANT), credit for handicraft industries, a special
small ferm credit program (credito rural) operated by BN, and the construction
of rural primary schools and health centers with assistance from AID. So far,
the impact of the individual Drojects has bee-n. small, but, taken as a whole,
they represent a promising step in the direction of raisirng rural living stan-
dards.
5.        Nicaragua's economic fortunes suffered a major set-back with the
earthquake which struck Managua lastDecember, killing some 6,000 to 8,000
persons and injuring some 20,000 others. it destroyed or rendered unusuable
practically all of the central zone of Managua, including most Government
offices, the important financial and commercial sections and about 2,500
shops engaged in small-scale manufacturing. About 32,000 housing units
(almost 45 percent of the housing in the Managua area) were destroyed.   The
cost of replac ng the physical assets destroyed by the earthquake is
estimated at some US$300 million.    This is equivalent to about one-third of
1972 GNP and about 10 percent of the nation's capital stock.   Given the
magnitude of the damages in relation to the size of the Nicaraguan economy,
the tas'k of re2onstruction is likely to take many years.
G.        PuPbl:ic sector finances have been seriously affected by the earth-
qualce.  For 1'73 and 1974 together, the loss in receipts is estimated
at US$61 million, or about 10 nerce-nt of total projected revenues.  AdditiomAl
expenditures in the two-year period are estimated at US$29 million, raisinig
the net budgetary impact to about US$90 million. However, emergency tax
measures introduced by the Government (taxes on traditional exPorts and
on civil servaAt salaries) will provide about US$46 million and disbursement
oierrthquake recornstruction loans ehould provide another US$2L million.  It
should be nossible to finance the remaining US$20 million from domestic
sources withnout unduly inflating domestic demand and creating  balance-of-
peyments problems.



7.        As a result of a number of favorable factors, Ticaraguals overall
balance-of-payments position remains satisfactory in spite of the earthquake.
International reserves are high, the prices of traditional exports are
favorable, and substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance are being
mobilized. Emergency import requirements - foodstuffs, medicines, tents -
were met by grant assistance. Fxport earnings will hardlv be nffected by the
earthquake; while this year's cotton crop is belowT normal because of a
severe drought, total export earnings should be slightly above the 1972 level
in 1973 and well above it in 1974. Demand pressures, arising from the
earthquake reconstruction effort, and increasing import prices, are pushing
internal prices up at a higher rate in 1973 than the historical 2 - 2.5 percent rate
of inflation. However, the Government can be expected to follow the same
prudent monetary policies  as in the past, thus reducing inflation to modest
levels and protecting   the long-standing exchange rate with the U.S. dollar.
8.        An important issue over the next several years will be the natuire
and scope of reconstruction and the ability of the economy to incur these
additional expenditures while maintaining a satisfactory level of invest-
ment in other activities and avoiding a build-up of external debt on terms
which would be difficult to manage in the future.   Between 1965 a7d 1971
Nicaragua's external public debt, outstanding and disbursed and repayable
in foreign exchange, rose from US$68 million to TJS$225 million; debt service
payments rose from US$7 million to US$31 million, and the debt service ratio
rose from 4.2 to 13.7 percentof export earnings.    Service payments fell
slightly in 1972, and the debt service ratio dropped to 10.3 percent. In
order to obtain the estimated external capital required over the next few
years (gross disbursements of around US$77 million per year in 1973-80)
on satisfactory terms, Nicaragua will have to borrow increasingly from the
bilateral and multilateral agencies, and correspondingly, de-emphasize
borrowing from commercial sources. There are good prospects that some 80
percent of external debt commitments can be obtained on the favorable
terms of bilateral and multilateral institutions in tne next few
years. On this basis, the debt service ratio is projected to remain below
18 percent during this decade. Nicaragua thus will remain creditworthy for
subst-nntial amounts of external borrowing, always provided that policies are
pursued that address the country's fundamental social and economic problems.
Strengtlhening the development policy and planning mechanism and preparing
its investment program in a form suitable for long-term external financing
will be one step in this direction; of more lasting importance, of course,
will be the degree to which the program will be successful in reconciling
equity, growth and stability objectives.    The share of IBRD and IDA in
Nicaragua's total debt service payable in foreign currency, which was
less than 12 percent in 1972, is expected to fall in 1973-75 and remain
at around 11 percent during the late seventies, while the Bank/IDA share
in total debt outstanding and repayable in foreign currency should remlain
at less than 25 percent throughout the decade.
External Financing
9.        Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided principally by
USAID, the Inter-American Develolment Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank
for Economic Integration (CABEFI). USAID has made loans for highways, industry



-4 -
ru.al electrification, housing, education and health.   In agriculture, AID
has made loans for technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture and
IAN, and a loan for grain production.    IDB is financing water supply and
sewerage, higher education, transoort and agriculture.   IDB has made loans
for poultry and swgine production, a loan for dairy development in the
Matagalpa department, and a l'oan to EN for beef cattle development which
is expected to be fully committed by the end of 1973.   CABEI is financing
projects with regional impact, principally in transport, industry and power
inter-connection.  The lending of these agencies through 1972 is summarized below.
Future IDB lending is expected to em-phasize transport, education, power,
telecommunications, agro-industry, colonization and forestry.   AID is likely
to focus primarily on technlical assistance in health, education and agri-
culture.  CABEI's financing is expected to follow closely the patter-n of thp
Dast, with lending  concentrated in the transport and induistrial sectors.

'i I      The Bank Group's current lending program is designed to
respond to Nicaragua's development requirements in several different
ways. One of the main objectives is to support the Government's export
diversification efforts. The proposed agricultural credit project supports
this objective through a large component for the production of beef, the
commodity which appears to have the largest potential for export growth
through the remainder of the decade. The Bank is also exploring possibili-
ties of lending for manufacturing irndustry and tourism through the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). A second major objective
is to assist in the strengthening of institutions important for developments in
this group are the principal power company, the port authority, the water
supply company, the Banco Nacional (through the proposed loan) and
the telecommunications company.    A third major objective is to continue
assistance in the earthquake reconstruction effort, with the shape and
timing of possible further lending in this area to be determined as the
Government's reconstruction program develops and in accordance with progress
under the recent Earthquake Reconstruction Credit. Finally, wherever
possible, the Bank seeks to associate its financing in Nicaragua with
projects which contribute to a wider distribution of the benefHts of
economic growth. Proposed lending for reconstruction, agricultural credit
and education would be designed to cont;ribute to this objective.
12.        UFCts activities in Nicaragua consist of a loan (fully disbursed)
and equity participation made in 1967 and totalling US$2.1 million equivalent
in a new cotton and synthetic fiber textile company (FABRITEX). Marketing
problems, partly associated with the difficulties in the operation of the
Central American Common Market, resulted in low sales, large inventories
and a shortage of working capital. The earthquake has further aggravated
FABRiTEX's financial situation.  In December 1972, IFC agreed to reschedule
principal payments, and other long-term lenders have also agreed to take
similar action.
PART III - THE AGRIC-ULTURAL SECTOR
13.       Agriculture in recent years accounted for about 25 percent of
Nicaraeuats GDP, 70 percent of merchandise exports, and from 50 to 60 percent
of employmert. There are three distinct agricultural zones which are clearly
differentiated on the basis of rainfall and predominant soil type. The Pacific
zone has volcanic soils and is one of the richest agricultural areas in
Central America.   There is a marked dual structure in this zone of small farms
growing basic grains (corn, beans, sorghum and rice) and larger farms
specializing largely in export-oriented crops and livestock. The mountainous
Central zone has lower rainfall than the Pacific and generally poorer soils;



-6-
it is mainly devoted to coffee and livestock. The extensive, largely
urndeveloped Atlantic plain has heavy rainfell  and relatively poor
soils. A begirnning has been made in recent years to exploit this zone's
potential for livestock and forestry. While Nicaragua has brought
considerable new land into production over the last two decades, mainly
in tne Central and Atlantic zones, the existence of much underutilized
land on existing farms, as well as a still largely untouched reserve
in the Atlantic zone, evidence the substantial long-term growth potential
of Nicaraguan agriculture.
14.       Landholdings are highly concentrated.- About one-half of all
farms, ranging in size from about one to seven hectares, cover only 3.5
percent of farm area, while the largest 1,500, or 1.5 percent of the total,
occupy 41 percent of farm area. Insecurity of tenure is a major problem,
especially in the Pacific zone, Despite the efforts of the Agrarian
Institute of Nicaragua (IAN) since 1964, roughly one-fifth of the farm
area is still occupied by families which have no title to the land they
occupy.
15.       The "traditional" sector of farmers holding less than 7 ha. includes
over 50,0oo units which orovide the main but inadequate means of support
for about one-third of the rural population. The main crops are corn,
beans, rainfed rice and sorghum. Supplementary cash income is derived
from small livestock operations,coffee growing and wage labor at harvest
time. Small farmers use few, if any, modern inputs and remain basically
untouched by support services. Per capita income, including wages from
harvest labor on coffee, cotton and sugarcane plantations. is believed
to be about half as much as urban incomes in marginal occupations.
16.       A relatively efficient export-oriented sector of larger farmers
holds much of the best land, uses modern inputs and achieves yields and
production costs generally enabling it to compete in world markets.    Exports
absorb from 30 to 40 percent of gross agricultural production at the
troughs and peaks of cycles, respectively. The major products of this
sector are cotton, coffee, sugarcane and beef cattle, while tobacco,
sesame, cotton-seed and bananas are also exported. Nicaragua is gradually
developing export-oriented agro-industries, i.e., boneless beef, processed
wood and cottonseed products, but most agricultural exports are still
unprocessed commodities, e.g. cotton fiber and green coffee. By the end
of the 1960s, agriculture supplied about one-third of industry's raw
materials compared to roughly one-fifth ten years earlier.



- 7 -
1,       The livestock sub-sector, currently contributing about 9 percent
of GDP, has grown  rapidly over the last decade.  ThLe absolute value
of livestock production rose from US$28 million in 1960 to US$100 million
in 1971. According to preliminary data, there are nowT about 2.6 million
hesd  of cattle in Nicaragua.   Most of the commercial cattle are an
adnixture of Criollo (native cattle) and introduced breeds, mainly
Brahman and Bronm Swiss.   Many herds are dual-purpose (beef and milk),
but specialization is gradually taking rlace, as is stratification of
beef production into breeding, growing a,id fattening zones. Ranchers are
becoming receptive to advice, but the proportion of the Lndustry that has
adopted new technology remains limited and over-all livestock productivity
remains low. Under the influence of rising world market prices, beef
production has come to occupy a dominant position in the sub-sector, and
beef exports rose from US$3 million in 1960 to roughly US$29 million
in 1971, with only a very small part of the increase coming from substitu-
tion of previous live cattle excorts. The substantial increase in the
quantity exported was achieved without sacrificing per capita domestic
consumption (about 11 kg. annually) because older animals, which were
previously unexploited, were slaughtered for domestic consumptio.i. Beef
marketing is dominated by the operations of four exporting slaughterhouses,
which currently handle 60 percent of total cattle slaughterings.  Most
of the remainder is slaughtered by licensed butchers in ill-equipped
municipal slaughterhouses.  Sales to export abattoirs are generally made
on a liveweigpht basis and there is need to introduce r.uality differential
payments.   For this purpose a marketirg study would  be financed by the 'Loan.
There is also a need to improve facilities for the marketing of live animals,
and the project contains provisions for this purpose.
19.       The Government's efforts in the agricultural sector have been
largely in support of export crops and larger farmers. The main instrument
of public policy in this connection has been agricultural credit, mainly
through FN arid, to a lesser extent, the National Development Institute
(INi'ONAC). a-Wi, whose agricultural loan portfolio increased from  '52 million
in 1952 to 0462 million in 1971, accounts for about two-thirds of the total
agricultural portfolio of the banking system. The only credit program
directed at smLall farmers has been itls rural credit prmgram.  It is
estimated that about 20,000 small and mediim-sized farmers, about one-half
of them farming 10 ha. or less, have received loans under this program.
These farmers have clearly benefitted in the sense that this credit is much cheaorr
than funds from alternative sources (mainly private money lendere), and the proqnm:
has enabled thenr to raise production,expecially of corn.However,the developmenrt imepact



of; th-le -orogrL-n so far has ;oeen limiteld because of a lack of complementary serv-
ices,  particiularlj exte..sion and marketing.  INFGIN'AC's agricultural
port-o io consists mainly oJf long-term  investmec^,ts for tobacco and banana
ur¢ductiorn.  in recen  eas, private commercial banks began leniding for
agr-.,culture, but _'hey co not yet have a network of branches and technical
personnel such as -cnr E  nas built un over t1e yea-rs.  Loans for livestock
increased at a re,rar.-acbl  -a-pi  pace durinJg tnhe 1960's and were primarily
for exnort-related  aiu-c- ning operations rather than long-term investments
for raising tine herd capacit.
19.       The institution responsible for deal ing withl land tenure problems
is the Agrarian institute of Nicaragua (IAN). Its policy has been tc)
emphasize settlement and titling of public lands, mainly in the Atlantic
zone, rather th-!n accelerated land redistribution in the Pacific region.
At the end of 1972 titles had been issued to abouit 15,000 farmers, and
about 20 agricultural settGlements had been organized.  However, AWN's
budget in recent years has been too small to pen ut a r-eal impact on
land tern.ure problems.  TA I's benefi.ciaries in the Atlantic region have
been lef-ct wiuh inadeqcuate suoporting services, and ILM\ has allocated
only a s-imall Portion of i.ts resources to the Pacific zone, where the
;i:a,or prcleres of landlessness, insecurity of tenure and sub-economic
holdings are to be found. Also, IAN's field service capacity is severely
limiited, only- about 20 percert of its sinall staff are stationed outside
MIanaggua. Over the next few years IA_\will have to concentrate the
major shsare  f its resoureces and staff trine on the Ricyoberc Caabezas
colonization uroject , whinch is being financed with IDB assistance, and the
first stage ox7 which -s designed to settle l,Li,4O families on farms of
30 ha. each, axd t', nchiieve ainnual ;xanflly incomes of about US$1,450 equiva-

summ2arized in Annex I1I.  The .Dro2ect is based on findings of an FAO/BRID
Cooperative                 whro"ramchissio. wich visited NTJicaragua in early 1972 and a Bank
pre-apDraisal i,Jissinn of Jiiy 1972. The project was appraised in Jariuary/

21.       The main objective of the project is to expand and diversify
Nicaraguars livestock and agricultural production and exports by (a)
increasing the flow of medium and long-term credit into ngriculture,
particularly to smaller and medium-sized producers; (b) encouraging
private banks to make mediun-term loans for agriculture; and (c) provid-
ing technical and supporting services to producers.  The Dro ect would
be the responsibility of the Central Bank (CE) which manages the aovern-
ment's Special Development Fund (FONDO).
22.       Of the estimated total project cost of US$15.8 million equivalent,
US$14.8 million equivalent would be required for on-farm development credits
in five types of production and would be allocated as follows:
(i)  US$L.1 million for some 150 multipurpose rainfed dairy farms
mainly in the Central zone.
(ii) US$1.9 million for some 50 small, irrigated dairy farms mainly
in the Leon Department of the Pacific zone where pasture
production is limited by a sharply defined dry season, running
from December to May.
(iii) US$4.1 million for the development of some 150 rainfed beef
breeding and fattening ranches mainly in the Central and
Atlantic zones.
(iv) US$2.9 million for the establishment of some 100 beef
fattening farms mainly in the Pacific zone; developnent
would be based on the purchase of steers and the development
of irrigated pastures,supported by access to local supplies
of surface or ground water.
(v)  US$1.8 million for investment on some 100 irrigated crop farms; it
would cover the production of such crops as sugar cane; import
substitutes such a;plantain and onion; grains, particularly
sorghum, to meet expanding demand for animal feedstuffs; and
oilseeds, fruits and vegetables where processing and marketirg
outlets can be assured.
23.       The sub-loans would serve to finance items such as land preparotion
.and planting, structures and buildings, machinery and equipment, irrigation
facilities and water supply, breeding stock and fencing.    Four sub-
loans would alsobeincluded totalling US$410,000 for supportirg services.    Two
of the sub-loans would be made to cattlemen's associations or cooperatives
to enable them to provide joint services to ranchers and farmers such as



transuorting and distributing fErtilizers ard anlmnal feeds, transporting
milk and other rec-uiremerts of the livestock, sub-borrowers, on condition
that all ra.nchers in the area of oDeratfon of such associations be free to
,.oin  its mnembership'  The other two sub-loans for  supporting services would
be made available to contractors for the purchnse of medium-heavy earth-
moving and ancillary equipmert to be used to assist ranchers and farmsers
to carry out farm development: plans under the project. Finally, the loan
would include about US$550,000 for technical services such as extension
serviceE. a beef marketing study. and the establishment of: (a) two simple
marketing centers for buying and selling cattle; (b) a nasture seed Tnulti-
plicntion scheme; and (c) an arti.2icial inseminatiocn center.
Project Beneficiaries
2L.          it has been agreed that a set of financial incentives would
be provided to encourage the participation of producers smaller than those
typically served by the banking system.  The project, as structured. however
would    not reacn the very small agricultural producers in Nicaragua.
Smaller bene-ficiaries would be defined for the purDOce oI the project
as those whose major source of income is farming, and th.e value of whose
total assets at present in farmJng (including farm machinery and livestock,
but excluding land) does not exceed US$20,000, and further, in the case
of sub-borrovers involved in irrigated farming, those whose irrigated
holdings do not exceed 20 hr. (including any land to be irrigated under
the pro,ject).  Smaller beneficiaries, so defined, would need to contribute
onr.ly 10 percent of medium- and long-term investments for farm or ranch
development while larger sub-norrowers would contribute ?O prrcent.
interest would be charged at 10.25 percent per annum or loans to smaller
benoficiaries; larger sub-borrowers would pay interest of 11 percent
plus an appraisal and supervision fee at an annual rate of one percent.
PFrticipatirn banks would receive a spread of 3 percent on loans to smaller
ber.eficiaries as opposed to 2.5 percent or. other loans.  The anrnual total
v?lure Df loars to smaller beneficia ries would be at least 15 percent of
the amount of approved lonns ir, the first year, 20 percent in the second
year and 25 percent ir, the third year of the pro.ect.  Further. at least
US$1.5, millicn equivalent of the total loan proceeds would be reserved for
smaller beneficiaries.
25.       At t,he other end of the scale, it has been agreed that sub-
loans zy any participating bark  to any sub-borrower shall not, together
with any other sub-loans to the same sub-borrower, exceed US$10O,0G00.
For th-i s purpcse, sub-loans c partnerships or firms in which a sub-bor-
rower's equityr exceeds 50 nercent would also be counted towards the
US$100,000 ceiling.  This ceil ing has been introduced to insure a wide
distributioni of Bank funds and because ranchers with borrowing requirements
in excess of these limits are exDected to have adequate alternative sources
-f financing.  Banco Nacional (EN) has recently received substantial funds
fron the procceds oL a loan made tc the Republic of Nicaragua by a consor-
tiumr of Britin-k banks.  The Government and BN have advised the Bank that
BN w-t  use tnese funds for m.aking loans of US$10C,000 or more for the ac-
quos-.ccn &cl dev<Lowent of ranches of 500 ha. or more.



Project Cost
26.       The estimated total cost of the project is US$15.8 million.   The
proposed loan of US$8.5 million represents 54 percent of total project costs
which is almost equal to the estimated foreign exchange costs. The FONDO
would contribute (largely from funds it receives from the Government) US$1.6
million equivalent, or about 10 percent of total costs, while the balance
of about 36 percent would be contributed in equal shares by the participating
banks and the sub-borrowers. A detailed break-down of the costs is given in
Annex III.
Relending Terms
27.       The Central Bank would relend through the FONDO the proceeds of
the loan and the FONDOTs own contribution to the participating banks at 7.25
percent interest for loans to smaller beneficiaries and at 9.5 percent
interest for other loans. The period of sub-loans to farmers would vary
from five years for irrigated beef fattening to 12 years for rainfed beef.
Interest on loans to smaller beneficiaries (as defined in paragraph 24 above)
would be 10.25 percent; larger beneficiaries would pay interest of 11
percent plus an appraisal and supervision fee at an annual rate of one percent.
While the FONDO would earn a spread only on loans to the larger sub-borrowers,
participating banks would retain 3 percent on loans to smaller sub-borrowers
and 2.5 percent on loans to others. These margins are considered adequate to
assure that FONDO does not suffer losses on its operations and that the parti-
cipating banks have adequate incentives to participate in the Project.
Project Administration
28.       The project would be carried out and conducted by the Central Bank,
which will guide and supplement the operations of the technical staff of the
participating banks. A Project Unit would be established within the FONDO
and a Bank-approved specialist in agriculture and livestock credit and farm
management would be internationally recruited and appointed to serve as the
Technical Director of the Project Unit prior to the effectiveness of the
proposed loan.  In order to strengthen the technical and financial aspects of
project evaluation and assessment of investment effectiveness, the Director
would be responsible for training and supervising the technicilans of the
participating banks and the FONDO, formulating procedures for appraisal and
supervision, and coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture on supporting
services. He would be supported by a Bank-approved Nicaraguan Co-director,
also appointed prior to effectiveness of the loan, who would be expectc-d
after about three years to assume the position of Technical Director. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that, within three months of loan effective-
ness, a crop specialist, a project analyst and two field technicians would be
appointed by the CB. It was also agreed that at least six project technicians
would be appointed by the participating banks within three months of loan
effectiveness. As a further condition of effectiveness, Central Bank would
make arrangements with the Ministry of Agriculture for obtaining its assis-
tance in establishing the cattle marketing and artificial insemina-tion centers
and the pasture seed multiplication scheme.



- 12 -
29.       The participating banks under the uro-ect are expected to include
MT and the six private commerciql banks in the country. The Central Bank
would enter into subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the BEnk with such
banks and the conclusion of at least one such agreement would be a condition
of effectiveness.  To ensure the timely availability of necessary local
funds. the Government agreed during negotiations to make available a sum
of at least TJS$0.5 million ecuivalent to the FONTDO as a corditior. o.f 102n
effectiveness, and another amount of US$0o5 million ecuivalent at the end
of 12 months after effectiveness.
30.       EN is expected to play an important role ir project lending.
especially in financing the small beneficiaries.    Poor performance in
loan recovery has been a wea.kneEs of RX's credit operations.  Arrears arose
partly from crop failure during droughts which periodically affect the
country's predominantly rainfed. agriculture and partly from the  NI's failure
to observe sound principles of lending and supervision. Despite the
difficulties, it is desirable to secure 3I's participation in the oroject
in view of its wide network of branches, its sizable complement of technic2l
staff and its exnerience in financing small farmers.   At the same time, BR!
will continue its on-going efforts to improve its financial position.
Assurances have been obtained. that CB would require BN to (a) complete, within
12 months of the date of the Loan Agreement, an analysis of its agricultural
loans overdue for more than three years on that date and arrange for writing
off irrecoverable amounts within two years following the completion of such
analysis; (b) contribute annually to a bad debt reserve so as to build it up
to at least 2 percent of its loan portfolio within two years after the date of
the Loan Agreement, and to maintain it at such level thereafter; and (c) under-
take a study of its costs and expenses and adopt, within 12 months of the date
of the Loan Agreement, appropriate policies to increase its profits, which are
at present negligible, to satisfactory levels. On its part, the Government
would provide BN with such amounts (1) as will be necessary to enable BN to
write off irrecoverable amounts without impairing its ability to maintain its
operations at a satisfactory level, and (2) as the Government, BN and the Bank
agree each year to be the expenses incurred by BN in non-banking activities
(principally grants and technical assistance on behalf of the Government in
a variety of development activities) undertaken after the date of the Loan
Agreement.
31.       Sub-loan applicants would be required to meet the creditworthiness
criteria and collateral requirements of the participating banks for medium-
and long-term agricultural loans. Security would normally include real
estate mortgages on titled land. Even among those who may have earlier
lacked titles, many should have benefitted from IAN's on-going land titling
program. However, as titling is a slow process and could hamper small farmers,
assurance has been received from the Government that JAN would expedite
requests from borrowers who have filed an application with IAN to obtain full
title. Chattel mortgages on livestock and equipment would also be accepted.



- 13 -
Procurement
32.       Procurement for farm or ranch development items through inter-
national competitive bidding would riot be appropriate because of the di-
versity of items, small size of individual purchases and need for free choice
by the individual sub-borrowers. Various international firms are repre-
sented in the country and competition is adequate. After-sale services
are also satisfactory. Accordingly, local commercial channels would be u3ed
for this part of the project. Items for extension and technical services
(such as vehicles, pasture seeds, processing equipment, semen ampules, etc.)
will be grouped, to the extent practicable, into contracts involving US$20,000
or more, and will be procured through normal commercial channels on the
basis of quotations to be invited through local advertising, with notification
to embassies to permit international suppliers to participate. For pro-
curemernt of these goods, in accordance with the Central American Agreement
on Fiscal incentives for Industrial Development, suppliers from Central
American Common Market (CACM) countries would receive a margin of preference
in bid evaluation of 50 percent of the tariff payable by non-CACM manufac-
tuirurs or i5 percent of the c.i.f. price, whichever is the lower.
Disbursements
33.       The Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of about h½ years.
Disbursements would be made for (1) 67 percent of sub-loans disbursed by
participating banks to small beneficiaries; (2) 63 percent of all other
farm or ranch development sub-loans; (3) 90 percent of the amounts lent
for supporting services; (4) 100 percent of the foreiF exchange expenditures
incurred in respect of exDert services and equipment, and-the beef marketing
study! and (5) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures or 90 percent of
total expenditures for other technical services.
Project Penef4ite
3)4.      Through provision of technical assistance for on-farm inveetjment,
the project would contribute to raising the efficiency of the country's
livestock industry, which has been handicapped by the lack of extension
services. It would demonstrate the benefits of improved animal husbandry
practices and pasture management. By promoting replacement of the present
practice of mixing beef and dairy with specialization and introducing better
manegement, the project would also help raise technical coefficients such as
the calving and lactation rates in beef and milk production.  Mechanmlat1on
is envisaged only where it is essential, and nanual labor would be employed
for most operations such as land clearing and development. Ancillary services
such as transport and processing would further augment employment opportunities.



35.       By increasing the production of beef, milk, and some irrigated
crops, the project would help feed a growing population and improve
Nicaragua's balance-of-oayments, both by sustaining nnd increasing exports
(beef, milk products, and sugar) and by promotingf import substitution
(plantains and vegetables).  Tne incremental exports of beef, milk end
sugar are estimated at full development to earn US$9 million, US$2 million
and US$0.8 million, respectively.   The impact of the project in terms of other irri-
gated crops is more difficult to quantify, since the financing of several crops
is permitted and the actual results would depend on the demand. It is
reasonable to expect, however, that Nicaragua, which is a net importer
of onions, plantains, and vegetables, would be able to meet its estimated
requirements of these crops for domestic consumption increasingly from
local production.   The estimated rate of return of the project to the
economy is about 25 percent, and the return on producers' incremental
investments ranges from 17 percent (for irrigated dairy farms) to 40
percent (for irrigated pastures and beef fattening farms).
PART V - LEGAL INSMUT NTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banco Central
de Nicaragua, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of
loans for agricultural credit projects.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMME.NDATION
38.       I recorffend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECITION
Loan No.
532   Education Project:  US$4 million Loan of April 19, 1968.
Closing Date: December 31 , 1974.
This project is being implemented in three phases. The five schools of
the first phase have been completed and all but one are in use. Of the
six schools included in the second phase, two have been completed and four
have been contracted. Construction of eight schools included in the third
phase has begun. The project is expected to be completed by December 197h,
about two years behind the original schedule. The delays are mainly due to
lack of expertise in the project unit, and insufficiency of local funds.
Adequate budget allocations have now been made and the project unit is
being strengthened. No cost overruns are foreseen.
808   Second Water Supply Project:  US$6.9 million Loan of March 7, 1972.
Closing Date: September 30, 1975.
This loan became effective in April 1972 and was amended on April 20, 1973,
in order to meet changed conditions in the service area resulting from the
earthquake of December 23, 1972 (Memorandum from the President, R73-67).
The execution of the project is satisfactory.
84o   Eighth Pcwer Project:  US$2)4 million Loan of June 28, 1972.
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
The two principal works to be financed under the project, the Puerto Somoza
steam power plant with associated transmission works and the interconnection
line with Honduras, have been delayed by a year. Issuance of bidding docu-
ments for the Puerto Somoza steam plant was delayed by request of co-lenders
to review, and of local contractors to revise, bidding specifications. Delays
in signing the interconnection contract have postponed the expected completion
date of the international interconnection line.   The project is expected to
progress now that those problems have been resolved, but its estimated cost
is at least 27% higher than originally anticipated.
879   Second Port Project:  US$11 million Loan of February 2, 1973.
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This loan becarme effective on March 23, 1973. In spite of some diversion of
efforts due to the Managua earthquake, project execution remains essentially
on schedule and the Borrower and Guarantor are proceeding satisfactorily with
other actions required by the Loan Documents.  With Bank approval, stone for
the coastal defense works will be provided by force-account since efforts to
interest contractors in operating the quarry were unsuccessful.
/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are being
encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.   They should be read in
this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to present a
balanced evaluation Cf the strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
