MEMORANDUM AND RECOM9 ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THIE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR AN EDUCATION DEVELQPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea
for US$35 million equivalent to help finance a project for education
development. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.       Background. Although substantial progress has been made in
expanding education in PNG since independence in 1975, the development of
modern education in the country is little more than a generation oldY  This
is reflected in the low educational status of the population in general and of
the workforce in particular. In addition to the general lack of education in
the community, a number of problems beset the education system such as poor
quality and low student achievement, high dropout rates and marked disparities
in enrollment rates between provinces and by gender. Inadequate access
remains a problem - gross enrollments for the primary age group are a
relatively modest 731, in lower secondary only 16X of the age group is
enrolled and at the upper secondary level and in higher education, the
enrollment rates are a mere 2X. The lack of expansion in the upper secondary
schools over the last decade has restricted the supply of qualified grade 12
graduates and this in turn has greatly retarded the growth of higher
education.
3.       The Government's policies and Rlans, which are outlined in the
recently-prepared Education Sector Review (ESR), are directed towards
addressing many of these problems, and are generally sound, although the
timetables for achieving some of the targets appear to be overly optimistic.
Primary enrollments are planned to expand at 5% p.a. to achieve universal
primary education (UPE) by 2000. However, given the high dropout rate (45X
over the primary cycle) and the difficulty of reducing it in the foreseeable
future, UPE is unlikely to be achieved by 2000. The causes of dropout are
complex and the Government has asked provincial education authorities to
prepare plans, relevant to local circumstances, to reduce dropout rates over
the long term. Continued emphasis will be given to raising quality through
improving teacher training and giving special attention to expanding the
supply of textbooks.  The transition rate from grade 6 to grade 7 has remained
static at around 35% in recent years and it is planned to raise the rate to
501 by 2000. This would require an additional 144 lower secondary schools and
nearly 2,000 new teachers. These requirements could be reduced by appropriate
measures such as expanding the physical capacity of existing schools,
introducing double shifts and raising the student teacher ratio from the
v    The school sytem in iNG comprises a six-year primarY cycle (grades 1-6), followed by a lower
secondary cycle of four years (tgrades 7-10) and two years of upper secondary education (grades 11-
12). In 190, enrollmants at these levels were 413,900; 53,100; and 1,970 respectively. 8igher
education and training (post-grade 10) is carried out in 55 institutions with a total full-time
equivalent enrollment of about 9,800. In 1991, education accounted for 16.1S of total budgetary
expenditures and 6.2S of GDP.



-2-
present relatively generous 26:1.  The plan to raise the throughput from g. le
10 to grade 11 from 10 to 25X by 2000 is feasible provided careful attention
is given to the recruitment of teachers, the majority of whom are likely to be
expatriate.  This expansion would more than double the output of grade 12
graduates thus permitting the planned 501 increase in university enrollments
to be achieved.
4.        In order to focus investments more closely on education policy
objectives and to provite guidance for the donor community, the National
Department of Education (NDOE) has prepared, as part of a national education
review exercise and at the Bank's request, the Program in Education for
Overseas Funding (PEOF).  The PEOF includes 10 major projects aimed at
increasing access to primary, secondary, vocational and nonformal education
and improving their quality and relevance. Specific investments will support
expansion of school facilities, improved maintenance of buildings, the
upgrading of teacher support services and school libraries, curriculum
development and the increased supply of textbooks and teaching materials. The
total cost of the PEOF is estimated at US$261 million during 1992-99.
5.        Lessons from Previous Bank Experience.  Previous implementation
experience offers several major lessons of relevance to the design of the
proposed project. First, textbook production must be accompanied by efficient
procedures for the timely distribution of the books. The proposed project
recognizes that although arrangements for the physical distribution of
textbooks are adequate, past experience has shown that inadequate funling has
delayed distribution. The project therefore allocates to distribution
activities about 121 of the funds for textbook provision. Second, textbooks
tend to disappear from classrooms. To address this issue, the project would
include a pilot program aimed at providing solutions to book retention and
security problems. Third, planning activities are greatly weakened wban
trained planning staff are not retained in key planning positions. Project
design therefore specifies that the planning advisors, to be trained under the
project, would be retained in their positions for an appropriate period of
service. Fourth, effective implementation depends upon strong project
management arrangements. Project design would replicate the arrangements used
for the successful implementation of previous Bank projects and would consist
of a high-level PCC and a well-staffed PIU assisted by evaluation officers to
monitor ongoing implementation activities.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The low level of educational
achievement in PNG continues to act as a major constraint to the country's
development. In response, the present Government is giving high priority to
expanding and improving the quality of education. In the face of increasingly
difficult macroeconomic conditions, resource constraints have tightened and
the Government has been barely able, in recent years, to maintain a constant
real level of recurrent budget allocations to the sector. It is important to
maintain momentum in support for education in the face of the critical need
for human resource development. Project design has also provided an
opportunity for the Bank to play a leadership role in encouraging NDOE to
prepare a coherent statement of educational policies and strategies (the ESR)
and in the preparation of an education investment program (the PEOF). These
activities will provide guidance to donors and should result in a more



-3-
rational approach to supporting the development of education. The proposed
project supports the highest priorities in the PEOF, as defined by NDOE, and
represents the first donor effort to support implementation of the PEOF.
7.        ProjgCt Qbjectives.  The overall objective of the project is to help
the Government implement its education sector policies and investment plans
through assistance for increasing access, improving quality and strengthening
institutional management. More specifically, the project aims to increase
enrollment in upper secondary education, improve the quality of primary and
lower secondary education, strengthen school maintenance and reinforce
education planning and management. The project would also assist in
developing policies and strategies to address three key problems - female
education, cost effectiveness and teacher education.
8.        Project Descrigtion.  The project would comprise seven componants
which NDOE has defined as the highest priorities in the PEOF, together with a
policy studies component, namely: textbook provision for primary and
secondary schools (baseline cost, US$16.2 million); upper secondary enrollment
expansion (US$10.8 million); development maintenance (US$8.0 million); teacher
support services (inspection and guidance) (US$2.7 million); library grants
(US$2.6 million); regional planning advisors (US$0.6 million); certificate of
business studies (US$0.3); and policy studies (US$0.3 million). The project
would also finance specialist personnel for project management and evaluation
(US$0.9 million). The proposed loan of US$35 million equivalent would finance
about 701 of total project costs, net of taxes, including 100l of the foreign
exchange cost and 161 of the local cost of the project. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Zchedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Papua New Guinea are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10640-
PNG dated October 6, 1992, is being distributed separately.
9.        Project Implementation.  Overall coordination of project
implementation would be the responsibility of a high-level Project
Coordinating Committee (PCC) under the chairmanship of the Secretary for
Education and including representation from the Departments of Finance and
Works.  Education components would be implemented by the national and
provincial education auth,orities. Civil works would be the responsibility of
the Department of Works with the exception of development maintenance for
lower secondary schools, vocational centers and distance education centers
which would be handled by provincial education authorities. Management of
project implementation would be undertaken by a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) which would include a project coordinator, civil works manager and
experts in procurement, maintenance and accounting. Ongoing evaluation of
project outcomes would be the responsibility of NDOE's Research and Evaluation
Unit. The PIU would be expanded over time to handle all donor-assisted
projects within NDOE.
10.       Project. SustainabilitM.  The impact of the proposed project is
likely to be sustained in the long term because its components represent the
highest priorities of NDOE, which were identified through an exhaustive



-4-
planning exercise. The process of designing the project ensured that NDOE
took a coherent view of education issues, the policy responses required and
the investments necessary to effect improvements. Thus, there is a strong
commitment by NDOE to the project's objectives. This is expected to be
particularly beneficial to enhancing female education. Furthermore, since the
major part of the project aims to support quality improvement rather than
capacity expansion, the incremental recurrent cost burden will be well within
local budgetary cap icity.
11.       Agred Actions.  The Government has agreed to:  (a) create and fill
the additional positions required by the project according to schedules agreed
with the Bank; and (b) carry out the policy studies and implement their
recommendations according to the action plan.
12.       BAnefits.  The project would lead to an increase in grade 12
graduates thereby easing the shortage of qualified entrants to higher
education, especially with regard to females. The project would also assist
in improving the quality of education through the provision of teacher
support, improved planning, textbooks and other relevant inputs. Policy and
planning would also be strengthened in relation to female participation in
education, the cost effectiveness of the education system and the development
of teacher education. In addition to dhe benefits to be derived from Bank
financing, the project design process ercouraged the preparation of detailed
statements of education policies, strategies and investment needs which are
available to guide future education investment decisions of the donor
community.
13.       Risks.  In view of the involvement of the provincial education
divisions in implementing parts of the project, there is some risk regarding
local capacity to implement the project satisfactorily. This potential risk
would be reduced through the operation of the PCC and the establishment of a
well-staffed PIU which would include an experienced project coordinator.
14.       Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
