3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project objective was to assist the Government in increasing agricultural production and farmers'
income. This was to be achieved by strengthening the institutions that provided support services to farmers.
The project aimed at increasing the efficiency of their operations and the effectiveness of their research,
extension and other support programmes. It was expected that the indirect result of this improvement in
institutions and programmes would be an increase in productivity and intensity of crop and livestock
productions.
The above project objectives were clear and well understood by the participating provinces and
municipalities. The project's objective was fully in line with central and provincial policies and strategies
as well as the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. However, project design was ambitious with seven
components including agro-technical extension, livestock services, seed production, quality control and
regulatory services and animal and plant quarantine services spread out over some 10 provinces and the
Beijing and Shanghai municipalities. Project organisation and management arrangements were not well
developed. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was to have overall responsibility for the project, but the
Ministry of Finance was made responsible for financial management. A Special Account was provided
which was to be administered by a Central Project Management Office (CPMO) under MOA. This degree
of complexity and wide area coverage was highly demanding of project management. In view of the
project's size and complexity the project design envisaged that the central and provincial PMOs would play
a major role in supervision of the project's progress. The project was prepared with assistance of the
FAO/CP over the period 1990-1991, appraised in 1992, approved in February 1993 with credit
effectiveness in July 1993. Total project costs were estimated at US$ 238.3 million, including an IDA
credit of US$ 115 million (SDR 83.7 million).
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project's objectives remained unchanged throughout the extended implementation period.
3.3 Original Components:
The project had the following seven components:
a)    Agricultural Management and Information. Restructuring the extension services of the agricultural
departments at the national, provincial and local levels, improving their management capability and
establishing information, networking, monitoring and evaluation systems.
b)    Agricultural Extension Services. This included five activities: (i) reorganising the Agro-technical
Extension Centre (ATEC) system by integrating subject matter specialisation at each level and creating
new extension, training and communications units at all levels; (ii) provision of laboratories, training and
office facilities, vehicles and equipment to the ATECS; (iii) in-service education and training for ATEC
staff; (iv) farming systems and adaptive research as part of a demand-driven research programme to field
test new technologies; and (v) support expansion of farmers' associations as a means of strengthening
feedback linkages between extension and farmers, and extension linkages with research institutes,
agricultural universities and colleges.
c)    Seed Supply Services. The project provided finance for civil works, equipment, training and
technical assistance mainly for county seed companies but also for some provincial and municipal
-2 -



companies. The project also supported reorganisation to allow seed testing and certification to be separated
from seed production, providing laboratories and equipment for this purpose.
d)     Livestock Services. This consisted of two sub-components, Livestock Field Services were
improved through investment in facilities, equipment and training for the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Service Centres (AHVSC); and Livestock Support Activities which included investments to establish: (i) a
National Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Service Centre (NAHVSC); (ii) a specific pathogen-free (SPF)
vaccine egg production unit in Nanjing; (iii) a National Plant and Livestock Genetic Resource Centre under
the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science (CAAS); and (iv) a national Veterinary Diagnostic Reference
Laboratory with Epidemiology and Library Units under the Beijing Agricultural University (BAU).
e)    National Animal and Plant Quarantine Services. This included upgrading laboratory and
quarantine facilities, provision of local and overseas training and technical assistance to allow for the
modemisation and streamlining of quarantine practices.
f)    Quality Control and Regulatory Services. The component supported: (i) development of effective
regulatory and monitoring services for fertilisers and pesticides, including the Institute for Control of
Agrochemicals (ICAMA) at the national level and its counterpart agencies at the provincial level; (ii)
establishment of provincial seed testing laboratories and improvement of provincial and prefectural
inspection facilities; (iii) upgrading the human and physical resources of the National Control Institute for
Veterinary Bioproducts and Pharmaceuticals and nine provincial centres; (iv) upgrading of human and
physical resources of the China National Centre for Quality Supervision and Testing of Feed (CNCQSTF)
in Beijing, and nine provincial centres; (v) the establishment of a new National Centre for Quality Control
of Veterinary Equipment under the NAHVSC; and (vi) the establishment of a new National Centre for
Quality Control of Veterinary Products, also under the NAHIVSC.
g)     Project management. This included strengthening national and provincial project coordination
offices by providing equipment, facilities, training, technical assistance and study tours.
The components were generally well related to achieving the project's objectives. However the high degree
of complexity both in component and area coverage proved a heavy task to implement. Also, the provision
in the project design for the CPMO to administer the Special Account does not appear realistic in a
situation where the design also assigned responsibility for financial management to the Ministry of Finance
(MOF). The inability of the project management the CPMO to use the Special Account to provide
flexibility in financing initial expenditures prevented any assistance being given to the more poverty
affected prefectures and counties who had difficulty in raising the necessary counterpart finance required.
Adjustments following the mid-term review in 1996 were relatively minor. They consisted of some
reallocation of funds to allow for higher than expected expenditure on goods and services. As a result,
credit allocation for goods was increased and that for civil works reduced. In addition, due to entrance
exam requirements most provincial, prefecture and county level ATEC staff had difficulty entering
master's courses and long-term training was accordingly converted into 1-year Extension Diploma courses,
and B.Sc. degree and 3-year agricultural college diploma courses. In addition, short-term in-service
training was substantially expanded. With the rapid development of technology, it was decided to spend
more on computer procurement, with corresponding reduction in other items such as on-fann research
equipment.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
This project was not rated for quality at entry. The rating at completion is satisfactory, since the project
was fully in line with Government policies and strategy and a timely investment initiative. Project design
could have been improved avoiding any ambiguity over project fmacial management responsibilities -
particularly in regard to operation of the Special Account.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project has successfully achieved its objectives. Performance in project implementation is generally
uniformly successful, but shows some variation from highly successful performance in strengthening
ATECs and AHVSCs at the township and county levels to a lesser impact on municipal and provincial
services. The project objectives and achievements were completely in line with the Government's Ninth
Five Year Plan (1996-2000) and with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS of February 25, 1997).
4.2 Outputs by components:
Agricultural Management and Information. As proposed, MOA successfully established a new data
base and information retrieval system which was commissioned in 1995. The China Agricultural
information web site established (www.agri.gov.cn) was one of the earliest in the country. The system
provides the means for conveying information on policies, technology and mnarkets to farmers as well as for
collecting local agricultural production information.
Agricultural Extension Services. The project successfully strengthened the National Agro-Technology
Extension and Service Centre (NATESC) and the ATECs in 9 provinces, 13 prefectures (or
municipalities), 55 counties and some 705 townships. This included construction or rehabilitation of over
215,000 mr of offices, laboratories, training and sales rooms and supply of 780 vehicles and almost 13,000
items of laboratory and training equipment. In many cases, civil works targets have been significantly
exceeded since land scarcity and building regulations encouraged taller buildings than those foreseen at
appraisal. The irnprovement in infrastructure and facilities has had a particularly beneficial impact at the
township level where ATEC staff were normally housed in local government offices which were inadequate
and very poorly equipped.
Reorganization of the ATEC system, in particular to combine the four elements of extension; soil and
fertiliser technology; plant protection; and seed technolgy aspects was developed in module form with the
help of foreign technical assistance in 1993. The following year, each project entity formulated its
reorganisation based on this module and modified it as necessary to fit with their own requirements.
Following the lead of the NATEC, starting in 1995, some project units started trial operation of a
reorganised structure. However, in most cases, reorganisation was effectively frozen as a result of
government's overall national government services reforms. As a result, to date only the NATEC, a couple
- 4 -



of provincial ATECs (PATECs), most county ATECs (CATECs) and all township ATECS (TATECs)
have completed the reorganisation.
As a result of the project, a large and important programme of training has been completed. A total of 190
staff took overseas training and study tours, almost 12,000 staff took long-term domestic training - of
which 261 were for Masters and Post-Graduate Degrees and 3,112 completed 1-year Extension Diploma
courses; more than 30,000 staff took short term technical training courses. In addition overseas and
domestic training was provided by the Intemational Rice Research Institute (IRRI), including foreign
technical assistance by the IRRI staff to institutionalize adaptive research training capacity within each
province (PATECs).
Pilot development of Farmers'Associations (FAs) has proven successful. Following studies by the Central
Station for the Administration of Rural Cooperative Economy, technical assistance in 1993 and 1994 and a
programme of overseas study tours by 28 FA specialists from MOA, five pilot counties have been selected.
In these counties, in-depth studies have been made to review the organisation and operation of FAs.
Information from these studies has been presented at a 51 person seminar, including intemational
participants and representatives from the five pilot counties, with a view to applying the experience more
generally in encouraging development of FAs. As a result of the project, 13,362 new FAs and 2,244 new
livestock associations (LAs) have been established.
In a similar manner, six counties have been selected to pilot Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technology
and methods, focusing on rice, cotton and vegetables. Over the period 1993 to 1995, a total of 60 farmer
field schools were conducted, over 4,000 people received training of trainers instruction and more than
42,000 farmers were trained. Since MOA was not in a position to recover costs of the IPM pilot activities
and repay credit funds, after 1995 the programme has been continued using regular budget appropriations
Sichuan Province alone currently spends over US$2 million annually from its own resources on IPM.
Investment in equipment for the China Agricultural Television and Broadcasting School (CATBS) in 1995
and staff training programmes have had a very satisfactory impact. Some 26 teaching-by-video courses
have been produced with a total running time of 258. Fourteen programmes on practical agro-technology
and teaching materials with a running time of 35 hours were also produced. These programmes have been
broadcast on CCTV and by the China National Education TV station, as well as being released as
videocassettes or VCDs for use by the CATBS at all levels, thereby supporting higher education and
technical training of farmers.
Seed Supply Services. The project financed the construction of over 96,000 m of offices, seed testing
laboratories, seed processing sheds, warehouses and drying floors at 60 locations and provided 188 vehicles
and over 1,500 items of laboratory, processing and office equipment. Training included overseas training
and study tours for 53 staff; domestic postgraduate, college and professional education for 283 technicians;
and short-term training for over 10,500 staff.
The separation of seed production and regulatory functions was satisfactorily introduced during the project,
so that by the end of 2000 the division of these functions was complete at all project sites. All the seed
companies are commercially operating and financially autonomous entities, many of which have already
taken some steps to becoming private companies. Regulatory aspects continue to be under DOA and
include seed testing, certification, popularisation of new varieties and market management.

Livestock Services. The project established the National Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services
Center (NAHVSC) and strengthened the AHVSC system in 9 provinces, 18 prefectures, 56 counties and
308 townships. This included the construction or rehabilitation of over 201,000 m of offices, laboratories,
training and sales rooms, provision of 549 vehicles and about 12,000 item of laboratory and training
equipment. A large training programme was also financed, which provided overseas training and study
tours for 387 staff and domestic training, both long and short-term, to more than 92,000 staff. As with the
ATEC component the targets set for building sizes at appraisal were generally exceeded and the impact has
been most pronounced at the township level where the improved facilities - both in buildings and
equipment, together with the staff training programme, have enabled a dramatic increase in the volume and
quality of the services delivered. The Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) egg production unit has also been
developed as envisaged at Nanjing.
With foreign technical assistance, an AHVSC reorganisation module was developed in 1993 and
subsequently used by the provinces to draw up reorganisation plans. Starting in 1995 some provinces and
municipalities have undertaken their reorganisation, despite being delayed or halted by the government's
more general reform programme. At credit closing the reorganised plan had been adopted by the NAHVSC
and the AHVSCs in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Hebei and Henan and the Guangxi Autonomous Region
and the municipality of Beijing.
National Animal and Plant Quarantine Services (NAPQS). The full programme of building construction
foreseen at appraisal was not carried through, only 1,670 m' being built, compared with the SAR estimate
of 4,470 mn. This was partly accounted for by the decision to reduce the number of quarantine facilities to
be developed and also the fact that in 1998 the NAPQS was split off from MOA and combined with the
former Sanitation and Quarantine Bureau of the Ministry of Health and the former China Commodities
Inspection Bureau. These three entities were combined to form the State Administration for Quality
Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ). This changed institutional arrangement meant that
component implementation was prematurely completed in 1998. Despite this, equipment procurement was
in line with appraisal estimates - 370 sets of laboratory equipment, as well as computers, office and
training equipment. The training programnmes have been carried out more or less as planned with some
reductions in overseas training due to the shorter implementation period. Thus about 260 months of
overseas training were completed and 74 months of study tours, in both cases about three quarters of the
SAR targets. Domestic training delivery at 1,350 months was in line with SAR expectations. Use of foreign
technical assistance was broadly in line with SAR estimates and was considered particularly valuable by
AQSIQ.
Quality Control and Regulatory Services. With the project's support, eight provinces and the Beijing
municipality have upgraded their fertiliser and pesticide testing laboratories. With the exception of the
latter, all have obtained certification from the national or provincial Bureau of Technical Supervision,
which gives them authority to supervise quality and also arbitrate disputes. Beijing's application remains to
be processed.
As mentioned above the arrangements for seed testing, inspection and certification have been developed as
foreseen at appraisal.
The project strengthened national laboratories for the testing and quality control of veterinary bioproducts,
pharmaceuticals, feed, and veterinary instruments; as well as to establish a national laboratory for animal
products quality testing and control. At the provincial level, the project has improved laboratories for
testing and quality control of animal pharmaceuticals and feed, and strengthened laboratories for veterinary
- 6 -



diagnosis. As a result, all national and provincial quality control laboratories have obtained authorisation
from the national or provincial level Bureau of Technical Supervision to conduct quality supervision and
arbitration for these veterinary bioproducts, pharmaceuticals, feed, and instruments, exceeding the target
set at appraisal. At prefecture (municipality) and county levels, the AHVSC laboratories have been
upgraded and some have been certified by the local technical supervision bureaus.
Project Management. The project provided buildings, equipment, technical assistance and training to the
MOA Central Project Management Office (CPMO) and for the provincial PMOs. This support materially
assisted successful project implementation.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The ERR was recalculated for the crop and livestock component separately and for the project as a whole.
For the project as a whole the ERR was re-estimated at 48%, (NPV at a 12% discount rate is estimated at
Y3.4 million) compared to 49% at SAR for Scenario II, considered then the most probable outcome.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Yield Growth. Crop yield in the project areas has increased over the pre-project level and costs
have decreased. According to a farm household sample survey carried out in June 2001 yields of

The financial analysis is based on the June 2001 survey in areas covered by the project (the with-project
situation) as well as areas outside the project (without-project situation). The farm models derived from the
survey show no significant difference in farning systems. The main impact of the project appears to have
been rather in improving productivity and hence incomes in the project areas. Annual farm incomes with
project as set out in the SAR and those calculated at ICR are summarised in the table below:

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Project impact on institutional development has been positive and substantial. The institutional
restructuring of ATEC and AHVSC systems has not been completed, largely due to the government's more
general institutional reforms mid-way through implementation. However, although in several provinces and
prefectures (municipalities) the institutional structure remains unchanged, at the county and township level
(where close integration of services is really essential) the restructuring has been generally adopted.
Moreover, many of those provinces and prefectures that have not yet changed are contemplating
restructuring according to the pattern demonstrated by the project. In addition, the staff at all levels in the
concerned agencies have acquired valuable experience in project planning and implementation.
It is of particular interest that whereas at preparation and the early stages of implementation greatest
priority was given to building construction and using project funds for creation of fixed assets, at ICR, the
majority of project staff stated that the most valuable aspect of the project was in its training programmes.
The large training programmes financed by the project have had a profound impact in improving
institutional competence.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency.
Agricultural development and project implementation suffered from the severe floods in both 1994 and
1998. Rapidly developing technology in computers, scientific and training equipment intensified the
difficulties associated with bulking of procurement for ICB.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Government's overall programme for the reform of government institutions had a major impact on the
project, slowing or stopping the institutional restructuring promoted by the project. Also, the Special
Account set up for the project was intended to be administered by the CPMO of MOA, but in fact was
maintained and managed by MOF. As a result, the Special Account never operated to provide the flexibility
and fund availability for initial expenditures which was its original purpose and objective. Apart from these
two aspects, Government support to the project was generally good and compliance with covenants was
satisfactory. Raising and allocation of counterpart funds was sometimes difficult for the poorer prefectures
and counties.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Implementation agency performance was generally satisfactory and contributed strongly to successful
implementation of the project. The main difficulties were caused by the practice of bulking of procurement,
mainly for ICB tendering. The problems in procurement were compounded by the rapid advances in
technology and specifications of the items procured and the extended procurement period. The worst aspect
of these difficulties was that the individual provinces had little control over the final procurement of the
items. In some instances they found that the cost of the equipment supplied, and for which they had to
repay, was higher than what they could have procured through local shopping.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Total project cost at completion is estimated at US$214.4 million or about 90% of the appraisal estimate of
US$238.3 million. Lower than expected costs are largely accounted for by economies in management and
-8 -



operating expenditures and the early termination of the quarantine component. A total of SDR
81,789,055.91 (US$ 118,265,739.53 equivalent) was disbursed. This amount represents 97.7% of the
total SDR 83.7 million (US$ 115 million equivalent).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is highly likely. Government commitment to the project continues to be high and
policies for rural development aimed at increasing farm incomes and living standards have priority. The
transition to a market economy has resulted in major reductions in public sector employment and the
requirement that most public service institutions, such as crop and livestock extension, cover some or all of
their operating costs. In anticipation of these changes, the project design incorporated commercialized
agricultural services. Agro-technical extension centres sell seed, balanced fertilizer, and quality
agrochemicals, while many counties have established fertilizer-blending plants. In the case of livestock
extension stations, in addition to full cost recovery for artificial insemination (Al) services, vaccinations
and the treatment of animals, township offices also sell livestock feed, antibiotics, and drugs.
Extension centres use the profits from these commercial services to fund and expand extension services. As
a result, most county and township level extension offices have become financially self-sufficient. In
addition to funding extension programmes, ATECs (county and township) currently employ over 4,000
farmer technicians (contract employees) to provide one-on-one consultations to farmers, while the regular
extension staff handles demonstrations and farmer training. This approach, which is now being widely
adopted throughout China, has partially privatized crop and livestock extension and is expected to be
maintained. The components' sustainability is therefore rated highly likely.
All the seed companies included for support by the project are reported to be operating profitably. In some
cases these have already developed from being merely financially autonomous to becoming companies with
varying degrees of private ownership, including publicly quoted shares. The quarantine facilities charge for
their services and are given very high priority by Government in view of China's entry to the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). Sustainability of both the seeds and plant and animal quarantine components is also
therefore highly likely.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
All the project facilities and infrastructure are owned and operated by the line departments, government
agencies and seed companies involved in project implementation. Each of these have already operated the
facilities for several years and have adequate allocations for operation and maintenance of the facilities.
Some provinces plan to replicate the model established by the project to other counties. In 1998 Guangxi
allocated Y30 million over five years to extend the basic project design to all counties and townships in the
province, with some economies in equipment provided. Beijing is also extending the basic project design to
all counties and townships in the municipality.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Through identification, preparation and appraisal, Bank performance was generally satisfactory. However,
with the benefit of hindsight the experience of implementation shows that the project design was
over-ambitious, both in the range of components and the area coverage that could be attempted within a
-9-



single project. It also now appears that project design was unrealistic, or even inconsistent, in believing that
the Special Account would in fact be administered by the CPMO of MOA, while expecting MOF to be
responsible for financial management of the project; as well as in expecting MOA to be able to play a
major role in project supervision.
7.2 Supervision:
Project supervision by the Bank was regular and generally constructive and supportive of project
implementation. Supervision staffing for livestock aspects lacked continuity. Quite severe problems arose
on procurement, largely as a result of bulking of items required by the various participating provinces.
These difficulties could have been overcome by greater flexibility on the part of the Bank over procurement
procedures to be adopted.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The overall Bank performance was satisfactory. Project objectives were relevant to the country's needs
and Government and Bank development priorities and strategies. Project preparation, appraisal and
supervision were generally satisfactory. The Bank also showed a sensitive and pragmatic approach in
allowing extension of the credit closing by six months, so as to allow completion of staff training
programmes and other activities.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Experience has shown that the project design developed by the local teams, with the assistance of FAO/CP,
was really too complex and had too large a geographic scope to be implemented as a centrally managed
project. MOA's attitude during preparation was very positive, supporting a number of innovative ideas,
including a much increased emphasis and investment in training, training and employment of women,
greater commercialisation of services, and introduction of IPM and Farmers'Associations. Project design
also included some ambiguity over the roles of MOA and MOF, in particular over adrninistration of the
Special Account.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government commitment and support for the project has been good and consistent throughout
implementation. Government's national administrative reform programme had a markedly adverse effect on
the project in slowing or stopping some of the institutional restructuring being supported by the project (at
provincial and prefecture levels). Lack of control of the administration of the Special Account by the
CPMO meant that the account was of no help in expediting the reimbursement of expenditures financed by
scarce local counterpart funds, particularly for relatively poor prefectures and counties. Splitting off the
NAPQS from the MOA in 1998 resulted in the ternination of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Services
component without adversely affecting the plant quarantine devices.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The institutional arrangements for project implementation have proved adequate to bring the project to a
successful conclusion. However, procurement aspects were particularly problematic. The centralised
procurement and bulking of equipment into a few large tenders meant that individual provinces had less
say than they would have liked in the equipment procured, while at the same time being wholely responsible
for repayment of the equipment costs. Some special procurement arrangement and provincial staff training
in procurement would have helped alleviate the slow execution of procurement actions. Despite the agreed
- 10-



design as set out in the SAR, the CPMO did not administer the Special Account and consequently was
unable to accelerate reimbursements to cover the cost of initial purchases financed by local counterpart
funds. The CPMO never managed to develop the strong supervisory role expected of it in the SAR and
project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) has been correspondingly adequate but not superior. Close
coordination between the participating agencies has been generally good and arrangements made for future
project operation and maintenance are satisfactory. The overall performance of the implementing agency is
rated as satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
The overall performance of the borrower was satisfactory since the Government continued to support the
project throughout the implementation period. All covenants were complied with and not in a timely
manner.
8. Lessons Learned
Lessons learned based on the review of the ICR mission are as follows:
a)    Strong, stable and consistent management both for the Borrower and the Bank is essential for the
successful implementation of institutional development projects (para. 7.7).
b)    In multi-province projects, special arrangements and greater autonomy in project procurement
needs to be given to the individual provinces in the interests of appropriate equipment procurement and
good accountability (para. 7.2).
c)    Project staff should receive more substantial training in contract management, ICB and WB
procurement procedures at or before project commencement if delays in implementation are to be
minimised (para. 7.6).
d)    The project Special Account is intended to provide some accelerated reimbursement of
expenditures made from local counterpart funds and can only operate effectively if it is managed by the
agency responsible for project implementation (para. 7.6).
e)    Adequate funding and priority has to be given to monitoring and evaluation if project management
is to have up to date and good information for project operation (para. 7.6).
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Comments From CPMO Of MOA
We believe the assessment of the project in the ICR generally reflects the actual situation of the
project. We are satisfied with the mission's assessment for the achievements of project objectives, outputs,
project management as well as supporting services. We appreciated very much the efforts made by all of
the ICR mission members. However, we would like to propose that you make the following modifications.
Section 2.1. We do not fully agree with the mission's assessment that project management was over
centralized in the hands of CPMO with little autonomy provided to the participating provinces. This point
was mentioned in paragraph 2, 5, 30, and 32 of the ICR several times. We think the point was over
emphasized. CPMO's roles in the project are mainly to coordinate the project implementation activities
- 11 -



and to monitor the progress of the project. We think what the CPMO did in terms of management was in
full accord with its responsibilities as designed in the SAR ( SAR 4.2).
We agreed that there was a few cases of over centralized management for how it should
procurements, especially for ICB procurement of vehicles, fertilizer, steel, which was conducted in the
early implementation period of the project. However, those ICB procurements mentioned above have all
been agreed by PPMOs and have all been approved by the Bank. According to the Bank's procurement
guidelines, it is impossible for each PPMO to do their own ICB procurement.
Section 2.2. In paragraph 13, DOA should be replaced by "Center Station of Administration Rural
Cooperative Economy".
Section 2.3. There are two paragraph 29.
Section 2.4. Paragraph 29( second ), Devaluation of the Yuan did not increase the need for counterpart
funds, because the imported equipment was entirely paid for from the credit since equipment was 100
percentage financed from the credit.
With the proposed changes mentioned above made to the ICR, we would be in full agreement with
findings and assessment of the ICR mission.

Additional Annex 8.1 mplementing Agency ICR
I. Project Background. Since reform and open-up, China had witnessed a significant growth in grain
production in the early years of the reform period thanks to the introduction of production responsibility
system and other relevant policies, however, grain production stagnated during 1985-1988 period. To
further the sustained, stable growth of agricultural production and increase farmers' income, in the late
1980s and early 90s, the Government of China requested IDA assistance in financing a project to
reinforce its agricultural support services system. The project was identified in Aug/Sept 1990 and took
effect on June 18, 1993. Meanwhile, domestic procedures for approval of project and signing of the
onlending agreements between MOF and project provinces were completed.
Project Objectives and Description. The project was designed to increase agricultural production and
farmers' income through strengthening institutional development of agricultural support services as
shown in the following project components:
A. Agricultural Information Management
To reinforce the establishment of information network of MOA, new hardware and software would be
added to the existing equipment under the network.
B. Agro-technical Extension Services
* Improvement of facilities of ATECS. To build new or rehabilitate existing office buildings,
labs, training centers of ATECs at various levels and supply necessary equipment.
* Reorganization. To solve the problems of institutional duplication and intellectual waste in
ATEC system, the project would initiate a reorganization scheme to merge the previous separated
stations of agrotech extension , soil/fertilizer, plant protection, and seed into a integrated
Agrotechnical Extension Centers at central, provincial, prefecture, county, and township levels,
providing integrated services.
*   Training. To improve capability of ATECS through in-service and full-time education and
training of staff.
*  Test services and pesticides/fertilizer quality control. Chemical and fertilizer analysis labs of
the Institute for Control of Agrochemicals (ICAMA) and National Soil and Fertilizer Testing
Center under MOA and 9 corresponding provinces would be upgraded with new equipment to
improve their capability of quality control for agro-chemicals and provision of soil/plant sample
test services for farmers.
*  Pilot projects. Trial operations for Farmers' Association and Integrated Pest Management, etc.,
whose experience would be summed up and spread.
C. Seed supply services
Overall objectives of seed component is to guarantee the quality and quantity of the commercial seeds
provided for farmers thereby contributing to the sustained and stable development of grain production,
through establishment of seed quality control and test network and improvement of fine variety provision
and extension system.
Major project activities:
* Infrastructure. The project would build or rehabilitate the new or original offices, processing
houses, seed labs, warehouses, drying floors, and support associated equipment.
* Institutional restructuring. As requested by the project, seed regulatory function in the project
units should be separated administratively from the seed business operation and build up as an
-29-



independent service during the project implementation period.
*   Staff training. To enhance the overall quality of the staff in the seed sector through long and
short term training both home and abroad under the project.
D. Livestock
*   Improvement of facilities of livestock services. To build new or rehabilitate existing office
building, labs, training centers of AHVSCs at various levels and supply necessary equipment.
*  Reorganization. Same as crop component, in order to solve the problems of institutional
duplication and unreasonable setup in AHIVSC system, the project would reconstruct an
independent AHfVSC system separate from administrative authorities at five different levels,
providing integrated services.
*   Training. To improve capability of AHIVSCs through in-service and full-time education
programs.
*   Quality control system. To improve AHVSC system through establishment of labs (processing
plants) in respects of animal pharmaceuticals, feed, veterinary diagnosis, livestock products
testing, veterinary instrument testing, plant and animal gene resource protection and SPF egg
production.
*  Adaptive research. Some small-scale adaptive research on varieties, prevention and control of
animal diseases and feed would be conducted, findings of which would then be popularized to a
greater extent.
Project location. For the crop component, the project would support ATECs in 10 provinces (Beijing,
Hebei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangxi, and Sichuan), 13
prefectures or municipalities, 52 counties and 649 townships, NATEC, National Soil/fertilizer Testing
Center, ICAMA, CATBS and Information Center of MOA; the seed component would involve 63 project
units (8 at provincial level, 14 at prefecture level, and 41 at county level) in 10 provinces (Beijing, Hebei,
Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hunan, Guangxi, and Sichuan); livestock component
would support AHVSCs in 9 provinces (Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Guangxi, Jilin, Hunan,
Shanghai, and Sichuan), 13 prefectures or municipalities, 52 counties and 649 townships, and NAHVSC,
NCIVBP, CNCQSTF and Nanjing SPF egg production factory.
Adjustment. The first adjustment: The mid-tenn review and adjustment were carried out in March 1996
with the major adjusted components as follows:
*   Long-term degree training. As constrained by its entrance examination, most of grassroots
ATEC staff were difficult to obtain the access to master-degree training. Consequently, most
long-term training was converted to short-term in-service training in some project provinces.
*   Equipment procurement. Information technology is growing so fast that the computers
proposed under the project at appraisal was inadequate both in quantity and quality. As a result,
some provinces replaced original field test equipment like tractors and harvesters with computers.
The second adjustment: At the end of 1999, the second adjustment was undertaken. In this adjustment,
the refund from the project units at central level (NAPQS, NATEC) for the reasons of governmental
restructuring and difficulties for repayment was reallocated to Guangxi and Hebei for improvement of
existing project sites and construction of new project sites. The amount of credit on each category due to
the 2 adjustments are summarized in the following table.

11. Realization of project targets
It's been a decade long since the project preparation through implementation to the completion. Thanks
to the hard work of project staff and support by governments at all levels, the project's been progressing
smoothly. All the specific targets at appraisal have been reached or even exceeded, and the overall
objective accomplished. The implementation under the components of crop, livestock, seeds is briefed as
follows, and detailed infornation of achieving each target contained in Annexl.
Agricultural information system. Based on original equipment of Information Center of MOA, the
hardware and software include ALPHA7710 and RAID, net server, graphic, lan switch and compatible
operating system, database system as well as Chinese information retrieval system have been purchased,
installed, commissioned and put into operation in 1995. With utilization of the above equipment, Center
of Information under MOA established an internet web site www.agri.gov.cn (China Agricultural
Informnation) plus its email system, one of the earliest government web site providing information services
to the general public. This information system contains a subsystem on animal husbandry and veterinary
services which is the official web site for the sector with linkages with most provincial/regional animal
husbandry departments. . The www.agri.gov.cn conveys information on policies, technology and market
to the farmers, while collecting local agriculture production information.

prefecture (13 prefectures), county (55 counties), and township level (705 townships) were
strengthened through: a) construction or rehabilitation of a total of 215,749 m2 of offices, labs,
training classrooms, and sales offices; b) supplying 780 vehicles, 12,796 pieces of lab apparatus
and training equipment. The project activities reinforced infrastructure of ATECS, improved
working conditions of ATEC staff, thus greatly enhancing ATEC services. It's well worth
mentioning the role of TATECs in the project. Before the project, most of township
agro-technical extension stations didn't have their offices, and worked in offices in township
governments with backward equipment and limited means of extension. Under the project, all the
TATECs were supplied with their own offices, training classrooms, and sales offices for
commercialized services. All of these created sound conditions for ATEC staff to popularize new
technologies, provide technical assistance, which was very popular among farmers. Civil works
targets at appraisal were often exceeded in practice, because: the higher authorities wanted the
relevant activities packaged together to save land acquisition cost; and city planning departments
have a certain standard for buildings' size.
*   Reorganization of ATECS. ATEC system reorganization module was worked out with
assistance of foreign experts in 1993. Subsequently, project units formulated their corresponding
reorganization proposals with reference to their respective situation in 1994. Since 1995, some
project units started trial operation of reorganized institution, however, this process was affected
by domestic governnent restructuring. Up to date, NATEC and a couple os PATECs, and most
- 31 -



of CATECs have completed the reorganization with new system in operation, while others have
yet to be approved by government authorities.
*   Training and TA. A total of 190 person times of overseas training and study tour have been
completed, including training on farmiing system/crop management In IRRI, and training of
directors of ATECs at provincial, prefectual, and county level in the United States, Canada, and
Thailand, etc.; as for domestic training, 11959 person long term training including master-degree
and post-graduate training of 261 persons, and short-term technical training of 30208 person
times have been completed. (Details in Annex 1 ). TA under the project comprises formulation of
scheme for ATECS reorganization provided by Public Administration Service of U.S., and
overseas and domestic training on farming system conducted by IRRI.
*  Regulatory control of pesticides and fertilizers. Fertilizer/pesticides labs in MOA and 9
project provinces have been upgraded with new lab equipment and staff training, these help to
improve the lab's analysis efficiency and quality control capability. With the exception of
Beijing which is still applying, all the pesticide/fertilizer analysis labs have obtained quality
certification by national or corresponding provincial Bureau of Technical Supervision with the
authorization to conduct quality supervision and arbitration, which outdid the SAR target.
*  Pilot projects. Farmers' Association. Studies on FA were started in 1993, and a set of
indicators on specialized FA was designed later the same year. Based on the indicators modified
by experts in 94, data on rural specialized FA were consolidated in 95, leading to an overall
understanding of FA in China. Two study tours were organized to investigate FAs in South
Korea, Malaysia and Australia, partaken in by 28 FA specialists from MoA and project
provinces, who then provided valuable advice on driving FA's development in China making use
of experience of other countries. Miyun, Gu'an, Shangzhi Shehong and Leshan were selected as
FA "pilot counties" for in-depth review of organization and operation of FA. To better study and
exchange experience on FA, the originally proposed national seminar on FA was expanded into
an international seminar, involving 51 participants composed of experts on FA and cooperative
economy both home and abroad and representatives from pilot counties.
IPM. IPM pilot project was implemented during 93-95 period. 6 counties were selected for pilot
research and extension of IPM on rice, cotton and vegetable respectively. A package of practical
technical research was undertaken, including selection of disease/insect-resistant varieties,
incidence of natural predators and their affecting factors, and pesticide test, etc. Subsequently,
IPM technology model was established and improved, and technologies were applied into the field
through extensive demonstration and training activities. Over 60 field studies were conducted,
contributing to improvement of IPM technology models at each project site. A total of 4179
persons of trainers' training as well as 42300 persons of farmers' training were completed. The
finished investment has totaled 900,000 yuan by the end of 1995. After 1995, the remaining
funds had been proposed for further expansion of the demonstration, however, in consideration of
repayment capacity of MOA, IPM expansion was continued by NATEC with domestic
appropriation. Implementation of and experience gained from the project during 93-95 period
has been itemized in a manual published by China Agriculture Scientific Press.
CATBS. In order to heighten its video production level to meet national television standards and
gear to international TV production, the video production equipment was upgraded under the
project. The new equipment was delivered in Oct 95, and then associated training organized. The
added equipment contributed a lot to the build-up of program production capacity of CATBS.
Since Nov 1995, a total of 15480 minutes of teaching video in 26 courses, 14 programs of
practical agro-technology and comprehensive teaching materials, totaling 2070 minutes were
- 32 -



produced, and 600 hours of teaching programs were edited using the equipment. The above
programs were broadcast at CCTV and China National Education TV station, as well as released
as video tapes, VCD etc. to the CATBS at all levels, thereby supporting higher education and
technical training among farmers.
Livestock
*   Infrastructure construction of AHVSC system. AHVSCs at national, provincial (9 provinces),
prefecture (18 prefectures), county (56 counties), and township level (308 townships) were
strengthened through: a) construction or rehabilitation of a total of 201286.5 m2 of offices, labs,
training classrooms, and sales offices; b) supplying 549 vehicles, 11795 pieces of lab apparatus
and training equipment (detailed data by province in Annex 1). The project activities reinforced
infrastructure of AHVSCS, improved working conditions of AHVSC staff, thus greatly
enhancing AHVSC services. The role of TAHVSCs in the project is the most significant. Before
the project, most of township stations didn't have their labs, veterinary staff had to work in poor
conditions. Because of lack of necessary equipment, only some simple surgeries like "castration
of hog" could be available, effective control over animals in locality was by no means possible.
Reinforcement of capability through establishment of offices, labs and training classrooms, and
installation of office, preliminary diagnosis and training equipment under the project enabled
AHVSCs at township level to conduct timely diagnoses and forecast of animal diseases thereby
effectively preventing epidemic diseases outbreak and curbing livestock mortality.
3  Reorganization of AHVSCS. AHVSC system reorganization module was worked out with
assistance of foreign experts in 1993. Subsequently, project units formulated their corresponding
reorganization designs with reference to their respective situation. Since 1995, some project units
started trial operation of reorganized institution, however, this process was affected by domestic
government restructuring. Up to date, NAHVSC and AHVSCs in Beijing Municipality,
provinces of Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Guangxi Autonomous Region, and Beijing have
completed the reorganization with new system in operation, while others have yet to be approved
by government authorities.
v  Training and TA. A total of 387 person times of overseas training and study tour have been
completed and 92241 person times of local training including both long term education and short
term training programs have been completed. Training enhanced the overall capability of
AHVSC staff.
*  Animal husbandry and veterinary service system and quality supervision system.
Labs/plants for animal pharmaceuticals, feed, veterinary diagnosis, quality test for animal
products, veterinary instrument testing, genetic resources protection and SPF egg production
have been upgraded through lab equipment procurement and staff training. The upgrading of lab
equipment has improved analysis efficiency and quality control capability. All the analysis labs
have obtained quality certification by national or corresponding provincial Bureau of Technical
Supervision with the authorization to conduct quality supervision and arbitration for animal
pharmaceuticals and feed, which outdid the SAR target. And lab equipment of AHVSCs at
prefecture and county level have been upgraded, some of them have also obtained certification
from local technical supervision bureaus.
Seed Supply Services
*   Offices, seed testing labs, processing houses, warehouses, drying floors totaling of 96185 m2
were built or rehabilitated at 60 project sites.
*  A total of 1570 pieces of lab equipment, processing equipment and office equipment and 188
vehicles procured in the project. All of the above combined led to great improvement of working
- 33 -



conditions in terns of office, training, test, and sales, strengthening of fine variety breeding
services, stir-up of enthusiasm of staff, and consequently the upgrading of project units' image.
*  Reorganization. Separation of regulatory function from commercial production of seeds is one
of the major objectives of the project. By the end of 2000, the separation of seed regulatory
service and seed business operation has been realized at all 63 project sites. The reorganized
seed management station is responsible for seed quality control, popularization of new varieties,
regulatory service, market management; by comparison, seed companies engaged in breeding,
seed production, processing, and marketing. Promotion of seed commercialization is also an
objective of this component. It's noticeable that a couple of seed companies including Shunyi
County of Beijing Municipality are public shareholding companies now.
*  Training. Since the project implementation, 9 groups of training or study tours composed of 53
person have been fielded to the U.S., Japan, Australia, Thailand, and South Korea to have an
understanding in aspects of seed processing, seed reproduction system, seed law, seed company
management, a total of 283 technicians have been selected to receive postgraduate, college and
professional education at leading agriculture universities in China, resulting in better grasp of
theories; in addition, a total of 10529 person times of short-term training of a variety of
techniques has been conducted in the light of local conditions. Competence and capability of the
project staff both in management and technology have generally been improved thanks to the
training of different levels and types.
Procurement of goods
CPMO organized 4 unified procurement using methods of ICB, LIB, LS, purchasing the major laboratory
equipment, vehicles, steel, fertilizer, VA and office equipment. Minor ancillary equipment of small
amount and value has been procured by implementing agencies in method of LS. All procurement were
undertaken strictly following the standard procedures required by the Bank, and bid evaluation was
carried out in compliance with Procurement Guide of the Bank, therefore, faimess and openness was
ensured.
Utilization of project funds. By the end of June 30, 2001, the closing date, the finished investment has
totaled 214440 yuan, or 90% of SAR target. The finished investments under each components are
specified as follows:
unit: 000 us$
Local                IDA                 Total
Crop                      45542                51954         97496

HI. Benefits
In the course of project implementation, the project units made every effort to combine the physical
construction with institutional development pursuing the full achievement of project objectives. The
improved ATEC and livestock services, upgraded service facilities and well trained staff laid the
foundation for realization of project objectives in terms of economic, social, environmental and technical
benefits.

Economic benefits
*   Yield growth. Since project implementation, crop yield in project area has been increasing,
thanks to R&D and extension of applicable technologies, such as introduction of fine varieties of
crops, formula application of fertilizer, and IPM, etc. The increase of crop yield in project area
according to household sample survey is shown below, the real incremental yields of all major
crops have exceeded SAR targets.
Crop                Before project      Without project    - With project
Rice                5.59                7.2                 7.53
Wheat              3.22                 3.33                3.96
Coin               4.0                  4.62                4.77
Soybean             1.41                1.43                1.57
Increase of farmers' income. The household sampling survey indicates doubled income happened to
households in most of project areas compared with before the project, and significant growth compared
with non-project area. See farm model attached for detailed information.
*  Financial analysis. Financial analysis was carried out for both crop and livestock component
based on incremental income of project households. Project costs include all project investment,
recurrent costs and farm production cost. Buildings are assumed to last 20 years, equipment and
vehicles are assumed renewed every 8 years, training costs are reduced after project year 6 and
continue at 50% of annual average investment during implementation period; other recurrent
costs are assumed to last after project year 6.
e   Economic analysis. Input and output prices in financial analysis are converted into 2005 world
price, prices for nontraded goods are estimated using conversion factors, the prevailing exchange
rate of Y 8.27 to $ 1 is adopted. Economic analysis indicates an ERR of 39% for crop
component and 58 % for livestock component.
*   Reinforced quality control over agricultural inputs guaranteed quality of pesticides, fertilizer, and
seeds, and extension of advanced technologies reduced application of agrochemicals. Take IPM
pilot county for instance, survey shows times of annual field application of pesticides in pilot
project area is 1.5 less than non-project area and net application amount per mu 37%-59% less,
while net income increased by 382-527 yuan.
*  Profitability of ATECS. Establishment of commercial service branches in ATECs systen levels
expanded their commercialized services capacity. Activities like combination of technology and
inputs supply and unified growing and harvesting benefit both farmers and ATEC organization.
According to incomplete statistics, net income from commercialized service of project ATECs at
all levels reached 118,006,000 yuan in 2000, which is 70% higher than that in project
commencement. Income from agricultural commercialized services built up ATECs' capability
and improved staffs welfare, as well as making up for shortage of funds for extension work, as
test, demonstration, and training, etc.
*   Since project implementation, livestock production, percents of animals with improved genetics
and percents of animals receiving recommended health care in project area have been increasing
and animal mortality rate decreasing, thanks to introduction of improved breed, adaptive research
and improvement of service and capability of staff, etc.
*   Considerable improvement of infrastructure and better management resulted in increased fine
variety reproduction, and seed supply and net income. Annual seed production of project units
totaled at 401236 tons in 1999, an increase of 111659 tons over 1993, seeds sales volume
402045 tons, 113713 over that of 1993. Output value from 1549 million yuan to2288 million
yuan, up 47%, seed test samples from 33214 in 93 to 69991 in 1999, up 110%. Upgraded
commercial services brought substantial income growth to project units: the gross income of
- 35 -



project seed companies increased from 693.8 million yuan in 1993 to 1662.6 million yuan in
1999, 140%up, net income from 175.5million yuan to 1487.98 million yuan, 203% up.
Social benefit
*   Strengthen ATEC system. Excellent performance by project ATECs played a demonstration
role, leading to input of domestic funds by governments at various levels into ATECs following
project models, as the case in Guangxi and Sichuan.
*   The long-term degree training and short-term in-service training have considerably built up
capability of ATEC staff. Proportion of personnel with bachelor's degree which used to be very
small has greatly risen. For example, in Heilongjiang, the proportion in CATECs increased from
15% before the project up to 35% at present. There were hardly personnel with postgraduate
background in ATECs at prefecture and county level before the project, however, the project
enabled 261 extension staff under the project to take part in postgraduate or master degree
training. It was often the first time that prefecture and county ATECs had personnel with higher
education background available. Most of the trainees who had already been equipped with rich
practical experience become backbone or even the leaders of ATECs after receiving formal
education, playing a leading part in extension work.
*   Improvement of farmers' culture and technical quality in project area. It's reported that
grassroots project units organized 64,099 training courses, totally 45,460,164 farmers
participated in practical technology training and Green Certificate training held by Agricultural
Broadcasting Schools. Many of the trainees become technology demonstration households.
*   Advancing technical progress. Since project implementation, ATECs have been actively
engaged in development of applicable technologies and extension thereof by means of
demonstration, field training, VA and printed materials, resulting in considerable growth of
agrotechnology adoption rate and contribution rate by agrotechnology to agriculture output
growth. In Shanghai municipality, new technology adoption rate rose from 70% in 92 to 90% in
99, with annual growth rate 10-15% higher than non-project according to sample survey.
*   Agrochemical analysis labs established under the project strengthened quality control and
improved quality of fertilizer and pesticide, which on one hand protected farmers' interests, and
irnpeded entry of faked inputs with negative environmental irnpact into the market on the other
hand. According to Jiangsu's report, the rate of qualified fertilizer rose from 65% in 1992 to
80% in 2000.
*   Scientific application of agrochemicals, maintaining fertility and reducing poUution. The
balanced fertilizer application based on soil testing and fertilizer formulation promoted by
ATECs of the project area made better use of agrochemicals and reduced water pollution by
Nitrogen erosion. The traditional practice of application of hypertoxic pesticide has been
replaced by a complex of IPM technologies involving pest-resistant varieties, culture techniques
and application of high efficiency, low toxicity and low residue pesticide and bio-pesticide. As a
result, application of bio-pesticide increased 192% over 92 in Jiangsu, while hypertoxic pesticide
decreased 208%, reducing the environmental impact by pesticide.
IV.  Experience from and affecting factors to project implementation.
ASSP is a comprehensive project involving 13 provinces and several sectors. Project implementation
coincided with political and economic reforn. Despite of difficulties encountered during implementation,
the project has been successfully completed thanks to the support by government at all levels and hard
work by project staff. There are a great deal of experience and lessons that can be drawn from the
project.
- 36 -



The key to smooth implementation is the support from government at all levels. The support from
government authorities together with respective SPCs and DOFs at all levels has been provided from the
time of project formulation, analysis through implementation. PLGs have been established down from
township up to province to supervise project progress and coordinate key issues like land acquisition and
counterpart funds.
Sound project management agencies guaranteed project implementation. Standing project
management units were established from county up to MOA, staffed in respects of M&E, procurement,
training, financial management, etc., thereby ensuring stable project implementation.
Commercial services built up agro/livestock extension sector's capability providing solid foundation
for sustainable development. In conformity with requirement of market economy, on the basis of
physical construction, project units are exploring new approaches of socialized agriculture services, such
as establishment of economic entities giving full play to their own technology advantage, oriented at
agricultural industrialization. Growing capacity of ATECS is the prerequisite of agricultural technology
advancement.
Promotion of project construction in combination with institutional development. At the early stage
of the project, there existed a trend to lay unbalanced emphasis on hardware rather than software, on
construction rather than management. Realizing it, CPMO held a national project meeting urging project
units by means of exchange of experience and talk in a bid to shift work focus and connect physical
construction with staff training and institutional development. The trend was corrected at late stage thus
the project ideology was fully reflected.
Major lessons
The overall government reorganization slowed down project reorganization of ATECS. Two
government restructuring occurred in 96 and 2000 during project period. As government restructuring
should be undertaken prior to institutional reorganization, although reorganization plan of project units
had been hammered out and accepted by provincial government, operation of reorganized agencies has yet
to be started due to uncertainty of staff arrangement. The actual progress of ATEC reorganization was
behind the SAR target.
Lack of operational funds encountered by ATECS in transition from planned economy to market
economy. Despite income from commercialized agriculture services, appropriation from government is
declining as a result of Asian financial crisis and reform on govermment budgeting, leading to lack of
funds for ATECs to do the R&D and low utilization of project purchased equipment in project units, at
prefecture and county level in particular.
Flood in 94 and 98 brought negative impact on agriculture production and fanners' living in Hunan and
Guangxi project area.
Difficulties for project for public goods to repay and bear the foreign exchange risks. Project
investment that was largely put into infrastructure construction and staff training of ATECS doesn't
generate direct income; nature of services provided by ATECs is to great extent for public welfare, such
as demonstration, training, forecast of diseases and pest, whose benefits would be reflected in increment
of farmers' output and income. All of the above caused difficulties for project units to repay, which even
affected implementation at late stage of the project, consequently, cost recovery mechanism has yet to be
improved.
- 37 -



V. Bank's performance
During the 10 years from preparation through implementation of ASSP, the World Bank fielded many
supervision missions to make on-the-spot inspection of the project, in which the Bank gave a great deal of
valuable comments and recommendations, helping the project units overcome problems of a wide range.
The Bank's staff and consultants' hard work and conscientiousness won the praise from the project units.
Bank's project management is considered very productive.
Rigorous management mechanism. In the project period of a decade, Bank's rigorous and systematic
management deeply impressed the project units. At time of preparation and appraisal, meticulous and
thorough analyses and justification of the project model design, cost estimates laid sound foundation for
future project operation. And some of Bank's practices like routine site inspection, strict bidding
procedures, etc., have been followed in domestic project management.
Long-term perspective of project designing. Project activities such as reorganization in ATECS,
livestock and seed sector and mid & long term training had once been unacceptable to project units,
nevertheless, with the project progressing and economic and social transition, the project design once
deemed as overadvance has been found to conform to the trends. The long-term perspective of project
design was spoken highly of.
Consultants' technical advice helpful to project implementation. In over a dozen of Bank's
supervisions, consultants have been able to provide constructive recommendations and effective measures
addressing certain problems existing in project implementation, conducing to project progressing towards
SAR targets.
Cooperative partnership with flexibility and practicality. During the 10 years from project
preparation through implementation, there were 3 task managers involved in this project. Chinese staff
highly appreciate their seriousness and cooperation. In the project implementation, within the framework
of Bank rules, task managers gave serious heed to opinions from Chinese side and provide timely support
to adjustment of credit and procurement. Their support and directives contributed a lot to the smooth
implementation of the project.
VI.  Sustainability
Project construction laid foundation for ATECS development. Project model which has been playing a
demonstration role is adopted beyond the project area. The reinforcement of ATECS, operation model
under the project, managerial experience concluded from the project created favorable conditions for the
sustainable development of ATECS.
The training under the project upgraded agrotechnology extension staff both theoretically and practically,
providing sound human resources conditions for further R & D for adaptive technologies.
VII. Commercialized agricultural services developed under the project tapped new approaches for
expansion of ATECS service scope in market economy, and accumulated valuable experience.
