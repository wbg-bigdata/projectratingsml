FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(IOAN 1803-AL)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Education
Project in Algeria, for which a Loan (No. 1803-AL) of US$87.0 million was
approved and signed in March 1980.   US$40.0 million of the Loan amount was
cancelled with effect from November 1981 and a further $43.2 million was
cancelled with effect from September  1983.   The $3.8 million remaining in
the Loan account was completely disbursed by July 18, 1986.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by a consultant to the
Population and Human Resources Division of the Europe, Middle East and
North Africa Region.  No field  trip was undertaken, the Project Completion
Report being based on a desk review of material in the Bank's files
relating to this project,  and  interviews  with  Bank  staff who have been
involved in the projefct.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies, as well as the two c.%financing agencies for
comments in August 1988.    Comments  rec:eived  from the Borrower have been
taken into account in revising the PCR and the incoming letter and telex
are reproduced in English as Attachments I and II.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA
FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1803-AL)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The project under review was the fifth World Bank operation in
support of Algeria's education sector.    It  was  prepared on the basis of
pre-investment studies financed under the two preceding loans (Loans 1209
and 1595-AL), appraised in March/April 1979, presented to the Board in
March 1980 and became  effective  in  June  1981.    Total project cost was
estimated at US$151.1 mil. ion, with US$87 million, or 58%, to be covered by
the Bank loan and the rem&inder by the Government budget.
Objectives and Content ot hie Prolect
Like its predecessors, this project was i.o assist the Government
ia developing its education and training facilities for professionals,
technicians and skilled workers in selected fields, in order to meet the
economy's  requirements  of  skilled  manpower.    It  was  to  comprise an
Administration Center and Institute for Instructor Training for Maintenance
Trudes as well as three Maintenance Training Centers and three Industrial
Training Centers, all under the Ministry of Light Industries, computers and
software for the Ministry of Higher Education and five universities, and
related technical assistance (PCR, paras. 2.02-2.03).
Implementation Experience and Results
A look at the Basic Data Sheet (PCR, pp. iii and iv) suggests that
there may have been less than complete agreement between the Government and
the Bank as to the objectives, scope and content of the project: three
post-appraisal missions were necessary (one of them after negotiations)
before the project could be presented to the Board, and the effectiveness
date had to be postponed six times for lack of the necessary legal opinions
(PCR, para. 3.01).
Five months after effectiveness (in November 1981) US$40 million,
or 46% of the loan funds, were cancelled at the request of the Government.
This sum referred to the three industrial tr.ining centers which were
deleted from the project.    Twenty-two  months  later (in September 1983),
another US$43.2 million, corresponding to the rest of the original project,
were cancelled (PCR, para.  2.06).    Following a Government-Bank agreement
dated April 30, 1984 the remaining US$3.8 million were to be used to
finance a total of 15 man-years of fellowships and 26 man-years of
specialist services for the National In-Plant Training and Apprenticeship
Institute (INDETE) and the 174ze-Ministry for Seacondary and Technical

Education (PCR, para. 2.07). This substitute operation (which was strictly
speaking a technical assistance project) was implemented as envisaged,
although it was necessary to extend the Closing Date twice (by a total of
about 1-1/2 years) to permit loan funds to be disbursed.
Sustainability
Previous  Bank  education  problems   in  Algeria  had  persistL.it
problems with undisbursed loan funds which amounted to 68X of the first
loan (Ln. 913-AL) and to 931 of the fourth (Ln. 1595-AL). However, one
could say that the respective project concepts remained intact, with the
Government providing the necessary financing over a longer implementation
period. In this case, though, there is no information whether or when the
investments constituting the original project will be realized (PCR, para.
3.03). Since the substitute project was a technical assistance operation,
the question of sustainability does not pose itself.
Findings and Lessons
The main conclusion concerns the abandoned original project and
derives from an obvious  contradiction:    that  the  Bank,  in the face of
mounting delays and disbursement shortfalls and of evidence that the
Government preferred to finance development projects from its own resources
rather than through loans, continued to move ahead with new projects (four
loans totalling over US$270 million in the space of four years) instead of
consolidating its sector portfolio. The PCR (para. 3.20) suggests that the
perception that the lending program was "weak" (presumably meaning "small")
exerted substantial pressure to develop new projects. (A sixth project was
appraised in 1981 but not processed to the point of Board presentation--
PCR, para. 3.20, footnote).   The  PCR  stresses the priority of addressing
persistent problems in existing projects over the development of new
operations.

F1FTH EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 1803-AL)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This Project was the fifth in a series all of which were to assist
the Government of Algeria in its efforts to provide trained manpower to aid in
the country's industrial expansion. As with all its predecessors, most of the
loan funds were cancelled, as the following table shows;

1.02     The main issue posed therefore by this project experience is why the
Government and the Bank were, throughout the 1970s, unable to develop together
an educational lending program in which projects were either not very
substantially changed during implementation (as the Fifth Project was) and/or
for which the Government ultimately did not use Loan funds for which it had
had to pay substantial commitment charges.
1.03     After a brief description of the project as originally conceived and
as finally implemented this Project Completion Report examines some of the
reasons underlying this project experience.

U. THE PROJECT
Bank Strtexy and Lending for Education
2.01     Up to and including the Fifth Education Project Bank strategy in
education lending was to try to meet the shortages of professionals,
technicians and skilled workers, shortages which were said to have been
causing major bottlenecks in almost all sectors of the Algerian economy, with
resultant deleterious effects on economic and social development; in addition,
a large proportion of professionals and technicians were expatriates. For
these reasons and in the perspective of the country's development strategy for
1974-85, Bank lending in the first four education projects in Algeria had thus
far placed main emphasis on development and reform of technical education and
vocational training so as to assist the government in: (a) meeting urgent
manpower needs for maragement/professional staff and higher technicians,
(b) replacing the lacge numbers ot expatriate professionals employed, and
(c) supplying much needed middle-level technicians and skilled workers.
Alongside this surport the bank was, through financing technical assistance in
these projects, assisting the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher
Education in institution building, educational planning, implementation of
educational reforms, and development of adult eduzation and literacy
training. The first project (Loan 913-AL) was designed to increase technician
outputs from the Algerian Petroleum Institute (API), the Institute of Mining
and Metallurgy (IMMA) and the Institute for Agricultural Technology (IAT),
through equipping the API and IMMA and constructing and 3quipping an extension
to the IAT. The second project (Loan 1209-AL) was to support the
establishment of a national Institute for Electricity and Electronics for
training engineers and higher technicians and provided a wide-ranging program
of technical assistance. The third project, (Loan 1378-AL), was intended to
assist the Government in implementing a major reform of its education system
through establishing a new network of 30 technicums (15 Bank-financed),
expanding the network of Vocational Training Centers through financing two
pilot centers, and developing school mapping. The fourth project, (Loan 1595
AL) through the establishment of training institutes for mechanical engineers
and higher technicians, a vocational instructor training college and extending
the technical teacher training college, was intended to assist in supplying
urgently needed highly trained Algerians for industrial management and
technical posts as well as teachers and i.istructors to train middle-level
technicians and skilled workers.
Objectives and Scope of Initial Fifth Project
2.02     Against this background the Fifth Education Project was prepared on
the basis of pre-investment studies financed under Loans 1209 and 1595. The
Project was designed to assist the government in establishing:, on a pilot
basis:
0467g



-3-
(a)    Maintenance Training Centers (MTCs) for much-needed skills in the
installation and maintenance of equipment for the construction,
automobile and household equipment fields to avoid costly operational
disruptions and early write-off of expensive imported equipment;
(b)    Industrial Training Centers (ITCs) for special skills to develop key
Algerian light industries to provide scarce industrial products and
generate employment in regions experiencing unemployment and
underemployment in agriculture. These training centers were to be
located to cater for regional needs in line with the government's
policy of reducing regional inequalities, and dispersal of skill
training opportunities, stimulation of local employment and regional
development.
(c)    Additionally, the project was to assist the government with
computerization of data processing in the Ministry of Higher Education and
five universities to improve the efficiency of educational administration.
2.03     Specifically, the project was intended to comprise:
(a) Architect's fees and construction/equipping for:
New     Annual   Annual
Grades   Places   Intake   Output
Ministry of Light Industries (MOLI)
Administration Center and Institute for
Instructor Training for Maintenance
Trades (NIMTA/NIMTI)                       13-14       420        220      200
3 Maintenance Training Centers (MTCs)             7-11    1,380       1,020      900
3 Industrial Training Centers (ITCs)              4-9      3,000      5,625   4,500
(b) Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE)
Installation of small computers
and required software in the MOHE
and 5 universities;
(c) Technical assistance related to the above items.
2.04     The Project was estimated to cost US$151 million and the proposed
Loan of US$87 million was to cover the foreign exchange component. The Loan
was approved and the Loan Agreement signed in March 1980.
2.05     Rather significantly, the Staff Appraisal Report for the Project
atated that the Bank was assisting the Government in developing important new
and unfamiliar fields, including institution building, while the government
was contino.ing to invest in familiar areas at all levels.

Project Modifications
2.06     None of the original project elements was ultimately financed under
the project.  The Loan Agreement was modified twice to take account c' these
modifications.
Amendment No. 1 (effective date November 22, 1981)
At the request of the Government the three industrial training
centers were deleted from the project, and $40 million of the Loan was
cancelled, leaving US$47 million in the Loan Account. As the ITCs accounted
for more than a half of estimated project costs it might have been expected
that a greater amount should have been cancelled but this was not done because
of:
(i)    delays in implementation and escalation of costs of remaining items
and
(ii)    the idea of supporting in some way apprentice training in industry
had already been mooted and it was considered prudent to retain some
project funds for this purpose.
Amendment No. 2 (effective date September 23, 1983)
lUnder this amendment a further US$43.2 million was cancelled, leaving
US$3.8 million available for the project. All the remaining original elements
of the project were eliminated, (i.e the MTC and computer elements) and
pro ect funds were to be used for Technical Assistance and fellowships, almost
entirely in support of training workers and apprentices in industrial and
commercidl establishments.
The Final Project
2.07.    As described in a mutually agreed letter between the Bank ard the
Borrower dated April 30, 1984, the project now consisted of:
Part A. This provision of about 5 man-years of fellowships and about 26
man-years of experts' services to assist in the setting up of the Borrower's
Institut National de la Promotion et du Developpement de la Formation
Professionnelle en Entreprise et de l'Apprentissage (INDEFE).
Part B. The implementation of a training program for the Borrower's
Vice-Ministry for Secondary and Technical Education through the provision of
about 10 man-years of fellowships.
Both of these project elements were co-financed by UNDP and the second by the
Government of Belgium (subsistence anc training costs).
2.08.    Under part A the Bank was to finance the Government's contribution,
estimated at US$3.7 million, to UNDP project ALG/82/001, under which the
INDEFE would be assisted in its initial operations by a team of ILO experts,
0467 9



and some fellowships would be provided for key Algerian staff for INDEFE. The
original UNDP contribution was .2stimated at US$300,000.  This UNDP project had
been approved in late 1982 by the Government, the UNDP and the ILO. Part B of
the project also came under the aegis of the UNDP, under its project No.
ALG/83/003, a project which had been initially assisted under the Bank's ThirG
Education Project, Loan 1378 AL.
mll. PROJECT IdPLEMENTATION
The Original Project
3.01     This Project began to encounter problems very soon after the Loan had
been signed in March 1980, the very first supervision mission reporting that
the Government had not renewed the contract with the private architectural
firm responsible for all items except the MTCs. Also by this early date,
there was a question of change of sites for the three ITCs. Bank staff were
not happy about these developments and sought, for example, more justification
than the Government was willing or able to provide for the proposed changes in
sites. In the meantime, effectiveness was being held up by a delay in
providing the necessary legal opinions. Ultimately six extensions to the
Effectiveness Date were needed (see Basic Data), with the project being
declared effective only in June 1981, well over a year after Loan signature.
3.02     By this time new Bank staff were working on the project, who were not
personally committed to the project as appraised and were ready to look afresh
at this project in the light of new ideas on what was most needed in Algerian
technical education. An IL0 mission, which visited Algeria at the request of
the government in March 1981, had already recommended the establishment of an
"Institut National de Recherche Technique et Pedagogique pour la Formation
Professionnelle en Entreprise", or INRTP, in accordance with legislation
previously adopted by the Algerian government. The Institute was renamed the
iLnstituL National de Promotion et de Developpement de la Formation
Professionnelle en Entreprise et de l'Apprentissage or INDEFE, to better
reflect its purpose. It was to receive the bulk of the Loan funds which were
disbursed.
3.03     In November 1981 the Minister of Finance requested cancellation of
the ITC items and $40 million of Loan funds were later cancelled as of this
date. It is to be noted that, unlike cancellations in previous Algerian
education loans in which the project content remained essentially the same
with the Government itself undertaking for example the construction involved,
in this fifth project the project content was itself changed. No supervision
missions reported on the ITC items once they had been deleted from the
project, and we have no knowledge of any of the original components of this
project, whether, for example, they were constructed using Government funds,
or not.
3.04     It is clear, with hindsight, that by early 1982 the Government had
already made up its mind on how the loan funds should be used.
0  r 67g



Legal statutes establishing INDEFE had beer signed in late 1981, and a UNDP
project to assist it was signed on November 29, 1982. Under this project ILO
was to supply technical experts to assist in INDEFE's start-up operations; the
salaries of these experts, some fellowships for their counterparts, and
necessary equipment would be paid for by the Government (using Loan funds) and
the UNDP.
3.05     In late 1983 all remaining funds relating to the original project
were cancelled; for some time there had been a lack of cooperation on the
part of some of the Algerian Ministries still officially concerned in the
project (for example the Ministry of Higher Education had for some time not
made itself available to Bank supervision missions in relation to the proposed
computer systems). As has already been noted, we have no information on the
original project items which were in the event not financed.
Implementation of the INDEFE component
3.06     The INDEFE was assisted under a UNDP project which was administered,
it appears generally very effectively, by the UNDP Office in Algiers. Much
material on Bank files from early 1983 onwards consists of telexes relating to
Bank approval of individual Technical Assistance experts being proposed for
the project by ILO in Geneva. It seems that it was difficult for Bank staff
to comment usefully on individual experts in this way; in certain cases the
Bank approved experts to whom it had originally expressed objection and these
experts appear to have performed as well as others to whom no initial
objections were raised. In another case an expert worked in a different
speciality to that originally envisaged. The Bank should consider how it can
best assist implementing agencies in selecting efficiently individual
consultants on the basis not only of their paper qualifications but also on
the basis of their personal q -lities.
3.07     More seriously, the ILO experts appointed under the UNDP project to
assist the INDEFE were appointed originally for one year, with possibility of
renewal. It would seem that few really first class experts would be prepared
to accept such terms, and for the future the INDEFE would do well, in relation
to its Technical Assistance needs, to consider:
(i)    longer term appointments (of at least two years) for qualified staff
required on a continuing basis; and
(ii)    short-term assignments of at most a few weeks duration for very
highly qualified experts who would not be free or who would be
unwilling to accept longer term assignments.
3.08     It is the view of the PCR that one-year assignments represent the
worst of all worlds; they are unlikely to attract the best experts, and are
unlikely to be very productive granted the fact that much of the time of an
expert appointed for such a term can be taken up in finding a suitable place
to live.

Extension of the Closing Date
3.09     The original Closing Date was 31 December 1984, and Bank staff in
December 1984 suggested a one-year extension i.e. to December 31, 1985. UNDP
was requesting quarterly loan disbursements based on a schedule extending
through 1986. The balance of Loan funds was disbursed by July 1986 to UNDP
within 7 months of the closing date.
Disbursement of Loan Funds
3.10.    While all Loan Funds are shown as having been disbursed under
Category 1 -Experts Services- one disbursement, of US$162,960, was made for
Part B of the project; this disbursement should properly have been recorded
under Category 2 - Fellowships. All the remaining Loan funds, something in
excess of US$3.6 million, were disbursed to UNDP under the terms of a
Government approved project relating to INDEFE, under which the originally
estimated Government contribution was put at US$3.705 million.
The INDEFE: past, present, and future
3.11     The aims of the INDEFE as spelled out in 1981 were to provide
services and support to employing agencies (mainly the larger employers)
already engaged in the training and career development of their work forces.
Thes- services would include:
(a)    the training of instructors and training managers from employing
organizations in the specific techniques and modalities of
"on-the-job" training;
(b)    the study of individual training situations aimed at reaching the
most cost-effective solution to the problem with the minimum of
interruption to production; and
(c)    the preparation and distribution of training materials and aids to
employers working in various secLors of the economy.
To cover apprentice training it was envisaged that the Institute should be
equipped and staffed to provide training, especially covering basic technical
knowledge, for apprentices.'/
3.12     It is clear that these functions of the INDEFE represented, and
represent, extremely complex tasks, very different from those posed by the
establishment of an ordinary school, in which many precedents exist for
staffing, curricula and so on. It is clear also that the INDEFE, even if it
achieved only partially its aims, was well justified as an institution in the
Algerian training system. It is also clear that evaluating such an
institution as the INDEFE would be difficult.
1/ The view has been expressed that requiring the INDEFE to provide
apprentice training in addition to its other functions represented too
broad and heavy a workload for a new institution. This viewpoint appears
to have merit, but poses the question as to the best way of providing
apprentice training in the Algerian context.

3.13     The INDEFE was originally established in temporary premises, a former
school, at El Marsa near Algiers.  It was staffed by Algerian nationals aided
by the ILO team financed under the project.  Members of this team wrote
various reports during the project period (ending in December 1986); indeed
the documentation on education and training matters is rather more copious
than one would wish, with several views being put forward on desirable future
developments, achievements to date, and so on. One senses a certain amount of
special pleading in these documents. What is conspicuously lacking is any
view in them of what employers thought - and after all the INDEFE's main
function was to provide employers and their employees with training services.
In any future development of the INDEFE it would seem essential that employers
be represented on its governing body, which up to the present comprises only
representatives of various Government Ministries, and indeed seems never to
have met.
3.14     In April 1988 a more thorough and independent evaluation of the
INDEFE appeared, based on a brief visit by a UNDP consultant in March
1988''. This seems a very reasonable evaluation of the INDEFE although
carried out under conditions of some difficulty - all the ILO team had left;
the Institute had itself been relocated to former university buildings in
Rouiba, some 40 kms from Algiers and lOkm from the INDEFE former location at
El Marsa; there had been many staff changes, including a change in director.
3.15     This April 1988 evaluation report, made to UNDP as a final report on
the UNDP project ALG/82/001, is not easily summarized and indeed such a
summary may be out of place in this PCR.  The report, whilst critical of
achievement in several -espects - a too theoretical approach by the foreign
experts, for example, with an emphasis on training materials insufficiently
adapted to the specific needs of the Algerian enterprises, nevertheless
concludes that the INDEFE project was worthwhile and has probably justified
the financial outlays involved. In addition to the regular on-the-job
training provided to their Algerian counterparts by the ten experts financed
under the project, Algerian INDEFE staff took part in ten training courses
given at the ILO Industrial Training Center in Turin, Italy. These courses,
for up to 13 participants at a time, lasted from five to eight weekb.
Training for company staff was provided by means of seminars, either held at
the INDEFE or at the company or organization concerned. These seminars, based
on individual training modules, lasted four days and the first eight seminars
were each attended by about 60 people. In addition to these training
activities the project has provided basic materials and equipment for the
INDEFE, which has been used to develop and print training programs, cost
studies, inventories of existing training materials, and so on.
3.16     The evaluation report also recommends, in reference to a possible
further recourse to external assistance, that such assistance should be
conceived of as extending over rather a long time period, but for short
intervals of time. This recommendation is strongly supported: the direction

of the INDEFE in the future must continue to be seen as Algerian, with foreign
experts called on as, when and if required to help with specific problems and
usually only for short periods of time. These comments are being taken into
account in the development of a proposed Vocational Training Project in which
further Bank assistL:ce for the INDEFE is proposed.
Trasuig under Part B of the Project
3.17     One disbursement only, in the amount of US$162,960, was maae to the
UNDP in respect of this Part of the project, whose aim was to train
administrators, school principals, and specialist technical teachers in
connection with a Government program to develop technicums, upper secondary
schools with a strong vocational bias. Substantial assistance to the
technicum program had been intended under the Bank-assisted Third Education
Project, but this project was itself considerably scaled down during
implementation. Most of the training under both the Third and Fifth pr'jects
was given in Belgium, and consisted of 8- and 16-week courses given in Belgian
technical establishments, with costs being shared between the two Governments,
the Bank, and the UNDP, which administered the Bank-financed part of the
program. In 1985-86 about 100 technical teachers were to undertake the 8-week
course in various specialties, with 44 taking the 16-week course. While the
indications are that this program was satisfactorily undertaken, the Ministry
of Educaticn has not yet presented a formal evaluation report.
Problems of Bank & Government Cooperation in the Project
3.18     The PCR for the Fourth Education Project attributed the problems that
project suffered, with only US$6.14 million disbursed out of a Loan of US$90
million, to:
(i)    lack of Government interest in Bank money because of rapidly
increasing Government revenues;
(ii)    the policy of decentralization, with the local authorities being
unfamiliar with Bank procedures; and
(iii)   the imperatives of dealing with the October 1980 El Asnam earthquake.
3.19     The cancellations under the Fifth Education Project took place more
or less at the same time and it is likely that similar considerations affected
the project, though it must be said that the project files in the Bank make no
reference to any of these problems.
3.20     In regard to the Fifth Project, what seems to have had an impact was
the evident pressure the Bank exerted in the late 70s to proceed with new
education projects in Algeria, even though existing projects had serious
problems. On the other hand, existing projects seemed to interest the Bank
less - supervision missions for them were as often as not referred to as
"Limited Supervision" missions. The conclusion is inescapable that the Bank
was too interested in develeping new projects, which were often too
complicated to implement effectively, and which were also involved in new and
untamiliar fields (see para 2.05), rather than attempting to resolve the
considerable problems existing projects were experiencing.

3.21     In the recent years, the macro-economic context in Algeria has
changed dramatically. The economy is undergoing significant changes as it is
adjusting to the 1986 recession, triggered by the decline in hydrocarbon
prices. .he success of the proposed reforms, which emphasize efficier- -y and
accountability throughout the economy and increasing autonomy for production
enterprises depends to a large extent, on the availability of well trained
managerial and technical staff. It is in this context that a new dialogue has
been established and lessons from past lending have been taken into account as
evidenced by the recent Vocational Training Project. The management of this
new project rests with a single entity, which has the necessary resources for
monitoring project implementation and has the leverage to resolve issues
promptly; a full time project coordinator with an implementation team, fully
conversant with Bank procedures, ensures day-to-day management and
coordination of the project activities; local officials, who are responsible
for implementing the project, have been involved early on at the preparation
stage.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
4.01     This project, as implemented, bears no relation to the project as
appraised, and the Bank has no information in its project files as to what has
happened to the original project items. As these items were deleted, it could
of course be argued that there is no reason why it shou'.d have; Bank policy is
unclear on this matter. However, this situation is different from that in
previous education projects in Algeria where, though small percentages of the
Loans were disbursed, individual project content was less changed, the main
change being that the Government undertook itself to finance the project
institutions.
4.02     The main institution actually aided under the project, INDEFE,
appears to be well justified in the Algerian context and, granted the
difficulties inherent in establishing and running such an institute, to have
made a reasonable start. Only US$3.8 million of the originally estimated Loan
amount of US$87 million was utilised. The Government paid commitment changes
of nearly US$l million in respect of this Loan.
4.03     The major lesson to be drawn from this project, as from previous
education projects in the country, is that Bank-financed education projects in
Algeria need to be simplified, with the administration of the loan and where
possible the management of the project being assigned to a single authority.
Furthermore, the Algerian authorities should confirm their interest by
specific request for Bank Group financial involvement. In this project, as in
most of the Algerian education projects so far reviewed, Government interest
in Bank involvement is none too apparent from the files.

COMMENTS OF THE
MINISTRY OF LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS
ON THE FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
(IBRD LOAN 1803-AL)
The report relates to a project covered by Loan Agreement 1803-AL of
March 1980 in the amount of US$87 million to finance a series of programs
concerning several sectors.
The examination by the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social
Affairs extended only to the IYDEFE (National Institute for Promotion and
Development of In-Company Training and Apprenticeship) component, which it
prepared and implemented. This is only one among several components of the
project.
This explains the large share devoted in the report to evaluation of
this component, which was executed entirely within the framework of the Fifth
Education Project.
Para. 2.07, part A
This item, which describes the INDEFE component, mainly in terms of
man-years of experts' services, should in our view set forth meaningfully the
nature of INDEFE's tasks and the goals assigned to it in the context of
implementation of official in-company training and apprenticeship policy.
That information would fully recognize the importance accorded to
INDEFE and justify the eligibility of this project Zor cooperation with United
Nations institutions.
Para. 3.02
It is stated that an ILO mission in March 1981 had already
recommended the establishment of an Institut National de Recherche Technique
et Pedagogique and this Institute, renamed INDEFE, received the greater part
of the loan's funds that were disbursed.

(Page 3 of 5)
The wording of this senter.ce suggests that:
-    the idea of establishing an institution responsible for in-company
training and apprenticeship came from ILO;
-    the institution subsequently underwent a simple change of name.
It is pointed out that the legislative and regulatory provisions
enacted by the Algerian authorities (Law 81-07 of June 27, 1981, concerning
apprenticeship, and decrees 82-298, 82-299 and 82-300 of September 4, 1982,
concerning in-company training) entailed, in the natural order of things, the
creation of an operational instrument to implement the in-company training and
apprenticeship plans drawn up.
It was thus at our request that an ILO mission visited Algiers in
March 1981 to help formalize the various dossier documents drawn up by our
staff with a view to a request for technical support required for start-up of
INDEFE.
Moreover, the change in name chiefly reflects the clear difference
in activities and purpose from the INRTP project, which was radically altered
in the interest of implementation of the above-mentioned legislative and
regulatory provisions.
Finally, the reference to certain project cumponents (CFO, CTA,
etc.) should for clarity's sake include the sectors to which they belong.
Par. 3.04
In the view of Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Affairs
staff, it would be more in line with the MTFP/UNDP/ILO project document if the
report were to state that the Loan Agreement related to technical support for
INDEFE (experts, advanced training fellowships and equipment procurement)
rather than to "fellowships to assist with the realization of 300 CFPAs."
Para. 3.05
The report speaks of a lack of cooperation on the part of the
ministri2s officially concerned in the project. However, it does not give the
necessary information to back up this assertion, which would be contradicted
(as regards the MLESA) by all the representatives of IBRD who served on Fifth
Education Project missions (we mention for the record Messrs. Wilson,
de Messieres, Chittelburg, Verdier, etc.).
Para. 3.06
The report should also indicate that INDEFE, ILO and MLESA staff
contributed actively, with UNDP, to proper administration of the project.

Para. 3.11
Reference should be made in this paragraph to the missions assigned
to INDEFE that it assumed in compliance with the provisions of Decree 81-396
of December 26, 1981 establishing INDEFE.
Para. 3.13
This paragraph refers inter alia to lack of cooperation with
employers and suggests that employers should be represented on INDEFE's
governing body.
It should be noted that employers (large and medium enterprises)
have always been actively associated in the execution of INDEFE'c annual
program through the seminars, discussion sessions, study days and all other
gatherings at the national and local levels.
Moreover, the National Consultative Council on Vocational Training
is regarded as the primary body for consultation with all partners and
operators concerned with vocational training.
Finally, it is pointed out that representatives of these enterprises
sit on the INDEFE's Board of Directors as full members.
The last meeting of the Board of Directors took place at INDEFE
headquarters on April 4, 1988.
Para. 3.14
Contrary to what is stated here, INDEFE has always been under the
supervisory jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social
Affairs and has never been transferred.
Para. 3.15
This paragraph, which is devoted mainly to the report drawn up in
April 1988 by the UNDP consultart, Mr. Runner, should be completed by a
reference to the following two documents added to the INDEFE file:
-    the evaluation report drawn up by the executing agency (ILO);
-    the summary report of the Tripartite Review (Algerian authorities/
UNDP/ILO) held in Algiers on May 22, 1988.
Para. 3.16
The opinion concerning the direction of INDEFE needs to be
corrected. INDEFE has in fact always been directed by Algerian officials,
under whose authority the executing agency (ILO) experts have worked.

Conclusion
For the sake of completeness, the completion report should take into
consideration the above comments by Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social
Affairs staff, who have had to closely monitor the progress of the INDEFE
component, which, we hardly need to recall, appears to be the only important
component to have been fully executed.

COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER 2)                                 ATTACHMENT II
(Page 1 of 2)
Translation of incoming telex from People's Democratic Repvblic of Algeria
Algiers
December 3, 1988
FROM:     MINISTRY OF LABOR, EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS
TO:       WORLD BANK
Attention: Mr. Graham Donaldson, Division Chief,
Operations Evaluation Department
Further to my message of November 12, 1988, I am now pleased to give
you a summary of this Ministry's main comments on the Completion Report on the
Fifth Education Project (Loan 1803-AL). The full text of all comments will be
forwarded to you by the Ministry of Finance. Examination of the PCR by the
Ministry of Labor was concerned only with the INDEFE component, which it
prepared and put into effect but which was only one of the various segments of
the Fifth Project.
Re para. 3.02: It should be noted that the ILO mission (in March
1981) referred to here took place at the request of Algeria. Its purpose was
to help translate the Ministry's plans into bidding documents for the
procurement of the technical support services essential if INDEFE were to
become a reality. It should also be noted that establishment of such an
agency was a natural consequence of the body of legislation and regulations
created in 1981 and 1982 (Law 81.07 of June 27, 1981, governing
apprenticeships, and Decrees Nos. 82-298, 82-299 and 82-300 of September 4,
1982, governing in-service training). As Lo the change of name, it reflected
cbanges in activities and purposes which clearly differentiated INDEFE from
INRTP; in fact, the INTRP project was altered radically to make it into a
vehicle for application of those legislative and regulatory provisions.
Finally, the PCR would be clearer if the summary of certain project components
(Centres de formation ouvriere, Centres de formation technique pour les
metiers de l'artisanat) indicated the particular sectors to which they were
related.
Re para. 3.04: It would be more in line with the Ministry of
Labor/UNDP/ILO project document to indicate that the Loan Agreement envisaged
support for INDEFE (experts, training fellowships and equipment purchases) and
not "fellowships to assist with the creation of 300 Centres de formation
professionnelle."
Re para. 3.05: There is a reference here to a lack of cooperation
on the part of the Ministries officially associated with the project, but no
other particulars are given. The departments of this Ministry meet with all



- 22 -
ATTACHMENT II
(Page 2 of 2)
World Bank missions in the country on business connected with the Fifth
Education Project (Mr. Wilson, and Messrs. Chittleburg, Vierdier....).
Re para. 3.06:  The PCR should also indicate that INDEFE, ILO and
the departments of the Ministry of Labor contributed actively, together with
UNDP, to effective administration of the project.
Re para. 3.13: Here, it is asserted that there was no consultation
with employers, and the suggestion is made that they should be represented on
INDEFE's governing body. In fact, employers (large and medium enterprises)
have always been actively associated with implementation of the INDEFE annual
program, through seminars, conferences, "study days" and all the other group
meetings arranged at the national and local levels. Furthermore, the Conseil
national consultatif pour la formation profession.nelle is regarded as the
main instrumentality for consultation with all partners and operators having a
vested interest in questions of vocational training. Finally, it should be
noted that the INDEFE Board of Directors includes representatives of industry
and other interested sectors as full members. The most recent meeting of the
Board took place at INDEFE headquarters on April 4, 1988.
Re para. 3.14: Contrary to what is stated here, INDEFE is still
under the supervision of the Ministry of Labor. There has been no transfer of
the supervisory responsibility.
Re para. 3.15: This material, whic:h deals mainly with the April
1988 report written by Mr. Runner, a UNDP consultant, would gain if expanded
by references to the following two documents also concerned with INDEFE:
-    the evaluation report presented by the executing agency, ILO;
-    the minutes of the tripartite review meeting (Algerian authorities,
UNDP and ILO) held in Algiers on May 22, 1988.
Re para. 3.16: The opinion expressed on the management/direction of
INDEFE needs to be rectified. In actual fact, management of the agency has
always been in the hands of Algerian officials, under whose authority the
experts assigned to the executing agency (ILO) carried out their mandate.
Conclusion
In our view, a full Completion Report on this project should take
account of the observations set out above, since they come from the Algerian
authorities whose task it was to monitor the INDEFE component closely and
since that component -- it hardly seems necessary to recall -- was the only
major segment of the project carried out in its entirety.
As soon as convenient, kindly let us have your opinion on this point.
Yours, etc.
Signed: M. Tessa, Chief, International Cooperation.
