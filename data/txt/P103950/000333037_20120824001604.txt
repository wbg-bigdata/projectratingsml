                                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER


I. SUMMARY
1.       This restructuring paper (RP) seeks approval of the Executive Directors to restructure of
the Madagascar Second Governance and Institutional project (P103950). The proposed Level 1
restructuring includes: (i) extending the closing date from August 31st, 2012 to August 31st,
2014; (ii) a revision of the project development objective (PDO) and the results framework; (iii)
modification of the components and activities; (iv) revision of the implementation arrangements;
and (v) reallocation of proceeds. The proposed restructuring aims at taking into account
significant changes in the project environment and addressing both weak results and delays
during the first three years of project implementation. The project does not have any audit
reports or Interim Financial Reports overdue. The recipient’s Action Plan regarding the activities
to be carried out during the extended period of time was reviewed and found to be satisfactory to
IDA. The changes proposed are consistent with the Government’s formal request to revise the
institutional anchoring 1 and to restructure the project 2. The Financing Agreement will be
amended. The revised updated indicators will be integrated in the project manual.


II. PROJECT STATUS
2.      The project (originally US$36.70 3 million equivalent), which aims to improve
governance and strengthening public sector capacity, was approved by the Board on June 3rd,
2008 and became effective on October 13th, 2008. The objective of the project is to improve the
efficiency and transparency of Government and selected public services in Madagascar in line
with the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP). The project comprises six components: (i)
Improvement of Public Expenditure Management; (ii) Strengthening of the Efficiency of
Government Operations; (iii) Rule of Law and Fight Against Corruption; (iv) Transparency and
Social Accountability; (v) Monitoring & Evaluation; (vi) Program Coordination.

3.      The Government requested that US$7.84 million be cancelled from the project’s original
budget. This cancellation was requested by the Republic of Madagascar in their letter to the
World Bank dated March 21st, 2012 and was approved by the Country Director on April 3rd,
2012. This cancellation was justified by the slow progress towards the achievement of project
results as a direct impact of the crisis. The cancellation had already been contemplated in the
February 2012 World Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Madagascar as well as the
recommitment of the cancelled amount to other country operations.

4.     The Project Development Objective and Implementation Progress were both rated
Unsatisfactory in the last ISR, largely as a consequence of the political situation prevailing in the

1
    Request received on May 21st, 2012.
2
    Official request received on July 18, 2012.

    Initially US$ 40 million equivalent to SDR 24 million in 2008.

country since March 2009. Bank operations in Madagascar are guided by the operational
directive OP/BP 7.30 “Dealing with de facto Government? since the unconstitutional change of
Government in March 2009. The achievement of the PDO and the implementation progress has
been undermined by the political crisis, ambivalent governance reforms priorities, limited
dialogue; and restricted project funding from March 2009 to May 2011. This 26 month technical
suspension undermined the ability of the project to implement planned activities and achieve the
expected results. Due to the political turmoil and insecurity, the Bank was only authorized to
conduct the first project supervision mission in November 2009. The first Implementation Status
and Results Report (ISR) (released in December 2009) was rated Moderately Satisfactory.
Subsequent ISRs present Unsatisfactory ratings.

5.      Despite these challenges, the Government has confirmed commitment to governance
reforms and to facilitate intergovernmental coordination on issues pertaining to project
management. Government recently indicated its commitment to addressing major governance
and public sector constraints through the Second Governance and Institutional Development
Project, more specifically in the area of public financial management (PFM) reforms, land
management reforms, decentralization, access to statistical information and social accountability.
This is not only welcomed by the Bank, but also by other development partners active in
Madagascar; including the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the European Union (EU).
The recent decision (Decree adopted on June 28th, 2012) to transfer the Programme des
Réformes pour l’Efficacité de l’Administration 4 where the project is housed from the Presidency
to the Prime Minister’s Office is also an illustration of the positive benefits of sustained dialogue
between the development partners and the coalition Government. The selection of the Prime
Minister’s Office as the revised project institutional anchoring is justified by the cross-cutting
and cross-sectoral nature of the reforms to be supported by the project. The transfer of the
project institutional anchoring was a Bank condition to proceed with the project extension and
restructuring.

6.       In June 2012 Bank staff agreed on restructuring principles, and preparing the
restructuring request. During the mission, the Government and the Bank agreed on the following
restructuring principles: (i) anchoring in the Prime Minister’s Office; (ii) focus on consolidating
already existing reforms and informing future development partners’ (including the Bank)
support in the area of governance and public sector capacity; (iii) focus resources on most
achievable activities with strong development impact; (iv) consolidate project activities to
optimize procurement transactions; (v) strengthen support to project implementation and
monitoring; and (vi) enhance and document the knowledge generated by the project. On the basis
of these principles, the Government and the Bank mission jointly agreed on the revised project
institutional anchoring; the restructuring of activities and related reallocations of proceeds; the
change of indicators; the consolidation of the project procurement plan; and the preparation of
the restructuring request, which is presented in the next section of the paper.


III. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.       The original project included components that are no longer feasible and consequently
must be revised or eliminated with funds reallocated to continuing components. The PDO and
Results Framework will need to be altered to reflect the restructured operation. Owing to
implementation time lost, a two-year extension is requested. Implementation arrangements will
also need to be modified to reflect new institutional setup. The proposed changes also aim at
aligning revised project scope with the Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Madagascar. The
Pillar I of the ISN focuses on governance and public sector capacity.

  The public sector reform and governance program, established by decree no. 2005-803, of November 23, 2005, as amended by Decree no.
2012-661 dated June 28, 2012.



                                                                 4
       A. Project Development Objective (PDO) and Results Framework
8.     The original Project Development Objective (PDO) is “to improve the efficiency and
transparency of Government and selected public services in Madagascar in line with the
Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) 5?.

9.      This PDO as defined in the Financing Agreement should be revised for several reasons.
First, the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) is no longer guiding Government policies and
programs following the unconstitutional change of Government in March 2009. Second, the
PDO is too broad in nature. Third, the local level of government appears to be able to withstand
the effects of a crisis essentially focused on the central level and deserves to be supported to
maintain minimal services delivery that can mitigate the impact of the crisis. Finally, there is a
need to simplify the PDO and bring it in line with what the project can actually achieve in the
current country political and socio-economic context. Hence, the new and revised PDO is “to
strengthen the Recipient’s public financial management and social accountability at the central
government and the Communal levels.? It will be measured through the revised Results
Monitoring Framework (see Annex 1).

10.      In line with the PDO revision, the supporting Results Monitoring Framework (RMF)
should also be amended in order to take into account the changes in Project activities and
components (see below). The new indicators are expected to reflect the desired impact and
outcomes from project activities of the overall Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms,
both at the national and communal levels, while supporting enhanced social accountability. In
addition, indicators and targets are revised to address the slow implementation pace and reflect
results that could be realistically delivered by the revised end-date of the project.

11.      Indicators have been updated to better reflect project impact and adjust to current
circumstances. The revised indicators better articulate the relation between inputs, outputs and
outcomes in the project. New indicators have also been introduced to reflect the contribution of
activities to the PDO. Targets reflect realistic estimates, which take into account counterpart
capacity and the situation prevailing in the country. The revised Results Framework features an
innovative approach to project monitoring that will be based on an on-going learning system.
More specifically, indicators pertaining to financial management will be monitored through a
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) self-assessment. While this
methodology was selected because of the current situation in Madagascar, a major benefit of the
exercise is for the Government to get more familiar with the PEFA methodology, to gather data
on PFM and to learn about PFM bottlenecks and improve them accordingly (see Box 2).

    The Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) is the national poverty reduction strategy adopted by the former Government in 2006.



                                                                      5
                       Box 1. PEFA Self-Assessment of PFM Performance


                                 Using the PEFA Framework

PEFA: The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Program is a multi-donor
partnership between seven donors agencies and international financial institutions to assess the
condition of country public expenditure, procurement and financial accountability systems and
develop a practical sequence for reform and capacity-building actions. In particular, the PEFA
Framework has been developed as a contribution to the collective efforts of many stakeholders to
assess whether a country has the tools to deliver three main budgetary outcomes: aggregate fiscal
discipline; strategic resource allocation; efficient use of resources for service delivery.

Objective: The Government of Madagascar expressed the interest to carry out its own
assessment (self-assessment) of the public finance management based on the PEFA methodology
as a key learning tools for the PFM reform

Methodology: The objective of the self-assessment is to evaluate – with the help and external
consultants - the overall performance of the Malagasy PFM systems, as well as to follow-up on
progress against the PEFA indicators from the 2008 PEFA so as to measure changes in
performance over time.

A Government PEFA Self-Assessment Steering Committee, including key stakeholders and the
Ministry of Finance and Budget will be created to ensure strong Government involvement and
ownership of the PEFA Self-Assessment. The PEFA Self-Assessment will be executed under
PEFA Guidelines, which aim at securing the PEFA Check of Quality. Planning and executing the
PEFA Self-Assessment will be carried out in close coordination between Government (including
oversight institutions), the PEFA Secretariat and relevant development partners.

Benefits: The self-assessment will not only support documenting the results of the project, but
will also contribute to inform future areas of reforms in the context of a potential donors’ re-
engagement. This exercise will allow updating the overall assessment of PFM systems, processes
and institutions. In this sense, a major benefit would be for the Government to learn about PFM
systems and bottlenecks, gather precious information and maintain the PEFA as a reference to
assess the progress in PFM.


12.      Moreover, the results framework will be part of an overall learning system that will
capture all the knowledge produced by the project including monitoring the indicators and
activities (see Box 2).

                                  Box 2. A “Learning System?

          Madagascar Second Governance and Institutional Development Project

                                     -   A “learning system? -

A learning system will be built to enhance project performance through the identification,
capture, validation, and transfer of knowledge. The learning system will be implemented through
a common platform that will capture and organize all the knowledge produced by the project so
that all the stakeholders will have easy access to it. Rather than being a mere website, the
platform is intended to be an intelligent infrastructure that rationalizes, organizes, and sustains
significant data and information. Such platform will not only inform the progress towards the
achievement of the project results and improve its performance, but will also inform
Government's future programs and Bank potential re-engagement in the country.

Benefits: Overall, building such a platform will at last improve project performance. In
particular, the platform will have the following benefits:
    ? Improved communication and access to information: Communication among
        stakeholders will be facilitated so as to have a continuous flow of information that is up-
        to-date and reliable.
    ? Improved monitoring: Monitoring the project and keeping track of its progress (or lack of
        it) will be facilitated by enabling stakeholders to access project information and provide
        feedback accordingly.
    ? Improved performance: The feedback mechanism will make sure that the project is on
        track and that stakeholders provide timely reactions regarding its implementation.
    ? Increased trust: Improved communication and increased visibility of the project will
        contribute to increasing trust among stakeholders, above all, between the citizens and the
        Government.


   B. Components and Activities
13.    Proposed changes refer primarily to the project components. Two of the original
components will be revised, and four of the six original components will be dropped as they are
no longer relevant in the current country context. Table 1 below presents the components and the
change proposed by the restructured project.

14.    The name given to components one and two will be revised to better reflect restructured
project priorities. Component one will be renamed “Improvement of Public Financial
Management? and component two will become “Improvement of Local Governance?.

15.     The project will also introduce two new components. A component aiming at
strengthening institutional capacity and enhancing knowledge management (component 3) and
another focusing on project coordination 7 (component 4) will be added. The four components
continuing in the restructured operation will use the reallocated additional funds to deepen and
broaden efforts that are generally congruent with original PDO expectations and purpose. The
table 2 below provides the details of the proposed changes to the original project design.

16.      Transparency and Social Accountability will be the overarching theme linking the fours
restructured components. The four components of the restructured project will each include
activities supporting transparency and social accountability to enhance Government’s
accountability vis-à-vis its citizens and to enable citizens to monitor public policies and service-
delivery.

    The figures presented in the table only represent IDA’s share. It does not capture Government’s contribution.

  As per the initial project design, the PIU was mandated to coordinate all Government reforms in the area of governance and anti-corruption and
component 6 focussed on program coordination. However, the project is currently the only important operation still active in this area.
Therefore, there is currently no pressing need for coordination. However, this situation may evolve with future donors’ re-engagement.

 The difference between the estimated amount identified in the PAD (Report No: 41885-MG) and the amounts presented in the RP (Report No:
71384-MG) is explained by a variation of the exchange rate between the US$ and the SDR. 1 SDR= US$1.51041.

will be transferred to the restructured
component 2 (Improvement of Local
Governance). Budget Transparency at the
National Level will be addressed through the
tentative introduction of internationally
recognized practices like the Open Budget or
the Open Aid initiatives. As mentioned above,
the following sub-components: (i) fostering an
enabling environment for social accountability
practices; (ii) building the capacity of civil
society and Government actors; and (iii)
monitoring social accountability activities will
be transferred to the new Component 3
“Institutional Strengthening and Knowledge
Management?.
Component 5 - DROPPED: Monitoring and               6.42

Funds initially allocated to this component
were cancelled in April 2012. The main
activities planned under this component meant
supporting the National Statistics Office to
develop of the Madagascar Action Plan
monitoring and evaluation system and conduct
the National Population and Habitat Census.
Both these activities cannot currently be
implemented. However, as mentioned above,
the Bank will pursue its collaboration with the
National Statistics Office under the new
component 3.

    C. Institutional Arrangements
17.     Under the leadership of the Steering Committee (Conseil d’Orientation et de Suivi –
COS), hosted at the Prime Minister’s Office, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be
responsible to carry out project activities, in close coordination with key institutions. The
selection of the Prime Minister’s Office as the revised project institutional anchoring is justified


                                                         11
by the cross-cutting and cross-sectoral nature of the reforms to be supported by the project. The
Ministry of Finance and Budget will lead the implementation of component 1 in association with
the Auditor General. Activities under component 2 will be executed jointly by the Local
Development Fund and the land administration. More specifically, the management of the
Communal Grant will be entrusted into the Fond de Développement Local (FDL) (Local
Development Fund). Finally, component 3 will be implemented with the support of the Global
Development Learning Network, the National Statistics Office, the Observatories, the
Ombudsman, and the Grants Administrator responsible to administer the Social Accountability
Grant.

18.     The PIU still needs to improve institutional setting and staffing even if new personnel
have been hired. The PIU implementation capacity has been eroded since March 2009 and was
undermined by the technical suspension. Since May 2011, the PIU slowly regained its capacity
through the hiring of technical staff (Land Management, Social Accountability, Procurement and
M&E specialist). Financial management systems are adequate. There are no outstanding audits
or IFRs for the project. Nonetheless, timely implementation of activities remains a challenge.
The monitoring and evaluation and procurement capacity of the project still need to be
strengthened. The PIU Director position is currently staffed by an Acting Director. The new
PIU Director is expected to be contracted by August 31st, 2012, in any case as a condition of
effectiveness of the Amendment to the Financing Agreement. He/She will be responsible to
assess PIU staff performance and address potential human resources challenges by October 31st,
2012 to ensure improvement of project performance. The Task Team will also provide sustained
implementation support.

        D. Project Extension
19.     The Government has reaffirmed its strong commitment to the proposed restructuring and
completion of the project. An extension of 24 months is requested to ensure successful project
completion. A 24 months period will be needed to address delays incurred by the 26 months
technical suspension following the unconstitutional change of Government in March 2009. It
will also allow the implementation key governance reforms (public financial management,
decentralization, land management) and systems, such as, the roll out of the integrated financial
management system. Finally, the restructured and extended project will help foster greater social
accountability. The PIU is in compliance with Bank’s financial management requirements, and
there are no overdue audits or financial reports.

20.     Reallocation of proceeds will reflect the proposed changes in project activities. Project
funding has been substantially reallocated. Allocations to component 1 remain essentially the
same 10. The funds from the former dropped components 3, 4, 5 and 6 are allocated to
components 2 and new components 3 and 4. The Table 3 below shows changes project cost
while Table 4 indicates the reallocation of proceeds.

     The overall figure allocated to the component is lower that what was indicated in the PAD due to a variation in exchange rate.

21.    It is also proposed that IDA to finance 100 % of category 3 as an application of the
country policy. This proposed change does not affect the achievement of expected objectives.

22.    A revised and vetted procurement plan was developed to reflect proposed revised
components and activities. (See Annex 2) Considering the short timeframe for the
implementation of the restructured project, the proposed procurement strategy aims at meeting
60% of the planned commitment during the first half of 2013 and 90% in the first half of 2014.
The procurement plan of the project will be updated quarterly and permanently accessible
through the project website. Given the role of the project in promoting good governance, in
general, and procurement reforms, in particular, a Community Scorecards of the projects
procurement activities will be conducted on a semi-annual basis. The Community Scorecards
will measure the level of satisfaction of project components and private sector vis-à-vis the
procurement performance of the PIU.

23.     The procurement methods have been updated to reflect the updated procurement plan,
and now include, in addition to ICB, NCB, Direct Contracting and Shopping, the following
additional methods: LIB, Framework Agreement, and Procurement from United Nations Office
for Project Services (UNOPS). For consultants, procurement of Individual Consultants has been
added as a method.

   E. Amendments to the Legal Agreement
24.     The Financing Agreement (FA) is being amended to reflect the above proposed
restructuring. The conditions of effectiveness of the agreement amending the FA are the: (i)
recruitment of a Project Director with terms of reference, experience and qualifications
satisfactory to IDA; and (ii) update of the project implementation manual (PIM) in form and
substance satisfactory to IDA.

25.     Project covenants have been modified to reflect changes in project design. The PDO,
Project description, institutional, monitoring, procurement and disbursement arrangements and
Closing Date have all been revised in the amended agreement to reflect the proposed
restructuring outlined above. In addition, several dated covenants, which are summarized below
in Box 3, have been added.

26.     Finally, an additional event of suspension has been added in the event of violation of or
adverse changes in legislation pertaining to the financial autonomy of the Communes that would
affect implementation of the revised Project or achievement of its objective

IV. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

   A. Economic and financial analysis
27.     The economic and financial analysis of the restructured project has been updated to better
reflect the current country context. The cost benefits analysis of the restructured Madagascar
Second Governance and Institutional Development Project aims at assessing the efficiency of the
project compared to the status quo. The benefits are defined as savings made by Government as
a directed result of project investments. The estimated cost for implementing the project consist
of the initial investment and increasing recurrent cost of the targeted department and agencies
which benefits from the project. Due to unique country circumstances, the analysis also
estimated the cost of inaction and its impact on previous investments.

28.    Project investment to support the roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management System
(IFMIS) will allow for substantial savings for Government. It is estimated that the Ministry of
Finance and Budget (MFB) will save US$1.4 million in operating cost with the deployment of
wireless antennas and the deployment of an inter-city computerized network compared to the
market value of the required connections.

29.     The revised total benefits generated by the activities supported by the project will reach a
net value of US$420 million over 10 years instead of the estimated US$446 million anticipated
prior to the crisis. The diminution of the expected benefits is explained by the declined in fiscal
revenues since 2009 as a result of the crisis. According to the Ministry of Finance and Budget,
tax revenues declined by 18.4% between 2008 and 2011. The main decline was observed in
customs due to low imports, while taxes collected on domestic transactions were only 10% lower
than in 2008. Revenue Taxes have increased by more than 20% and VAT on domestic
transactions remains at the same level as in 2008.

                                      2008-2011                                      2,180, 000
                                      Total                                          13,350,000

30.    Investments estimated at about US$13.35 million may be lost if investments in the
modernization of the IFMIS are interrupted as the result of the suspension of project
implementation. Indeed, due to Government financial constraints resulting from the crisis, the
Ministry of Finance and Budget made no investment to maintain or expand the system since
March 2009; with the exception of the investment made by the project. If the system becomes

  The depreciation of more than 1.5% from the 2008 assessment was calculated from the average annual decline in tax revenues from 2009 to
2011 compared to the average achievements in fiscal revenue between 2003 and 2008.




                                                                  16
obsolete, there is a risk civil servants return to manual public financial management operations
which would impact negatively on budget management, transparency and accountability.

     B. Technical
31.     The proposed revised project design builds on significant analytical work. The updated
project design is informed by recent World Bank political and economic analysis 14 and the
evaluation of past project activities, such as, the evaluation of participatory budgeting pilots and
policy notes. It is also informed by analytical work conducted by other donors, mainly in the area
of land management. Recent small-scale technical assistance on decentralization and land
management also contributed identify propose revised project priorities.

32.      Technically, the project is smaller and should present no unforeseen or overly difficult
challenges to the Bank and Government teams. The revised first component relies upon PEFA
self-evaluations and will build on the PEFA assessment conducted in 2006 and 2008 and benefit
from the international experience. The PEFA self-assessment presents an innovative way of
favoring dialogue on public financial management in a context of fragility. The local government
component will require close supervision by both Bank and Government teams, but results will
be established based in part upon already established instruments for adjudging operational
performance.        Finally, the third component focusing on institutional strengthening and
knowledge management will make use of existing public institutions, facilities and civil society
organizations to build and share knowledge on governance and public sector capacity reforms. In
all of these cases the new component will be piloting innovations approaches and tools hence the
challenge is confined to a subset of feasible undertakings.

     C. Social
33.      The project has several potential benefits identified during project appraisal which are
still relevant despite of the crisis. The original project design had a specific component focusing
on transparency and social accountability. The activities planned under this component were
implemented despite of the difficulties resulting from the political crisis.          For example,
participatory budgeting initially piloted in 10 communes is now roll-out to 69 communes and
yield positive results in terms of budget transparency, sound management and improved service-
delivery.

34.      Activities pertaining to the former social accountability component have been
mainstreamed into the components of the restructured project with the objective of enhancing the
positive social impact of the operation. The restructured project will promote transparency and
social accountability by supporting activities related to public financial management and social
accountability. It provides a far more robust program of intervention, making use of existing
commune performance and social accountability tools. It also addresses and advances the
critical land titling issue which has a huge potential to reforms and revitalize local production,
employment and investment. Hence the restructured project is promoting social advancement in
terms of accountability, inclusiveness and meaningful institutional strengthening.

                                                                17
       D. Risks
35.      The proposed restructured operation risk is high. Political instability, in a pre- electoral
period 15, as well as weakened capacity at all levels of the administration makes the risks related
to the implementation of this restructured operation particularly high. However, the project itself
is seeking to address these risks by focusing on strengthening public financial management at the
central and local level of Government through the provision of technical assistance, while
deepening transparency and accountability. In this regard, not only will the project support key
public institutions to prevent further state fragility and pursue existing reforms, but it will also
work in close cooperation with oversight institutions, media and civil society to favor and
promote public debate and access to information on public sector and governance issues.
Moreover, the revised project institutional anchoring at the Prime Minister’s Office responsible
to: (i) build consensus across the coalition Government; (ii) to lead the governance agenda; and
(iii) promote inter-governmental coordination, will protect the project from potential political
interference. Finally, the project also intends to strengthen the capacity of the PIU to keep the
focus on technical aspects of governance reforms. As a result of these efforts, the potential
benefits of strengthening governance and public sector capacity in Madagascar are expected to
be greater than the risks incurred by the project.

36.    Project stakeholder risks are moderate. Specific stakeholder risks associated with the
Government consist of potentially weakened leadership and ownership, as well as, fragmentation
of views on governance and public sector capacity priorities due to the crisis. There is also a
potential political capture of selected NGOs who will benefit from the Civil Society Grant.
However, the recruitment of an independent Grant Administrator will help circumvent risk of
capture.

37.     Project implementation risks are moderate. The number of activities to be supported by
the project has been reduced to ensure full implementation over the 24 months project extension.
The selection of activities has been carefully conducted to ensure the achievement of tangible
results before the end of the project.
