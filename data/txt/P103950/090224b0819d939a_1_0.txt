                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in August 2012 and extended until June 2014. The restructuring takes into account significant changes in the project environment and identified actions
                         to remedy weak results and delays during the first three years of project implementation. The restructured project focuses on: (i) supporting on-going initiatives on governance,
                         transparency and participation; and (ii) building knowledge and analysis to inform future governance and public sector reforms.

                         The last supervision mission conducted in November 2012, only six weeks after the restructured project became effective, acknowledged good progress regarding the implementation
                         the activities pertaining to local governance championed by a newly recruited project staff and government counterparts. However, delays in recruiting staff to support the
                         implementation of activities pertaining to public financial management reforms, capacity building and knowledge management undermined the ability of the project team to start

                         In July 2012, the Government of the Republic of Madagascar agreed the institutional anchoring of the project be transferred from the President's Office to the Prime Minister's Office.
                         The selection of the Prime Minister’s Office as the revised project institutional anchoring is justified by the cross-cutting and cross-sectoral nature of the reforms to be supported by
