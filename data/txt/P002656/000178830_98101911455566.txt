APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report appraises a second education project in Swaziland for
which a Bank loan of US$4.0 million is proposed.
ii.       The first Bank Group education project (Credit 518-SW of 1974) pro-
vided US$5.0 million to assist the Government in increasing the number of
primary and secondary school teachers and in improving facilities for training
of craftsmen and technicians. It also emphasized expansion of rural education
and associated curricula development. Project implementation is proceeding
satisfactorily and present indications are that the credit will be fully
disbursed well before the Closing Date and, in consequence, the price esca-
lations anticipated during appraisal have been largely avoided resulting
in some cost savings.
iii.      In common with many LDCs, in a similar stage of development, school
enrollments since Independence (1968) have grown rapidly, mainly as a result
of private initiative and to meet social demand; 73% of the age group attend
primary schools and attainment of universal primary education is expected
for 1985. A National Education Commission developed a long-term plan in 1975;
the main objective is to improve the educational system to enable trained
personnel to be produced in skills and numbers appropriate to estimated needs.
iv.       There is a severe shortage of Swazi manpower particularly in those
occupations, e.g., agriculture and engineering, which need a sound basic
education in scientific and practical subjects required for professional
training and on-the-job experience. This view is supported by statistics
which show a very high reliance on expatriates for key positions in Government
and the private sector; for example, in 1976, expatriates occupied 238 Govern-
ment professional posts and 50% of teaching appointments in secondary schools.
v.        Given continuation of the present output of only some 30 students
p.a. from the science streams of secondary schools and with an out-of-balance
educational system which results in only one in thirty-five of grade 12
secondary school leavers having an acceptable standard in science subjects,
the manpower shortages mentioned in the last paragraph are unlikely to be
resolved in the immediate future. Government has therefore determined to take
remedial action through a well-conceived program.
vi.       Government policy for building its educational system includes a
balancing of the educational content of its junior secondary schools, as well
as their gradual numerical expansion so that ultimately basic education will
last for ten years and comprise seven years of primary and three years of
junior secondary schools where the teaching of science and practical subjects
would receive emphasized attention. By 1985, enrollments in junior secondary
education would increase to 24,800 (54% of the age group) from the 1975 level



- ii -
of 13,400 (38% of the age group). The planned expansion of basic education is
within the Government resource capability; this expansion together with other
improvements to the educational system are estimated to result in the educa-
tional sector requiring about 20% of total Government recurrent expenditure
during the next decade; this is reasonable in relation to corresponding ex-
penditures in LDCs of similar economic status.
vii.       The proposed project would assist:  (a) the expansion and improve-
ment of junior secondary schools to support effective teaching of science and
practical subjects; (b) the expansion of facilities to support agricultural
teacher training; and (c) operational costs of program administration and pre-
investment studies for a possible third education project. It would consist
of:
(a) Buildings, furniture and equipment for the following institutions:
-    the extension of 13 existing junior secondary schools;
-    four new junior secondary schools; and
-    a "model agricultural center" to support agricultural
teacher training at the Faculty of Agriculture at the
University of Botswana and Swaziland. 1/
(b) The cost of professional services and technical assistance in
the Program Unit including future project preparation costs.
viii.      The main benefit expected from the proposed project is to help im-
prove the quality of the educational system by introducing into 13 existing
junior secondary schools (grades 8-10) science and practical subjects; 3,960
students would be enrolled in these schools. Also supporting a better balance
of the secondary education system and assisting equity in opportunity for
secondary education would be the inclusion, in the proposed project, of four
new junior secondary schools which would be sited in areas where there are now
no such schools. The four schools would have a capacity of 960 students. By
about 1983, when these improved and new schools are fully operational, they
would account for 22% of planned enrollments in junior secondary schools and
so substantially help to bring education content into a more favorable and
practical balance.
ix.       The graduates from the project-assisted junior secondary schools
would be suitable either for direct employment or for further education and
training to meet manpower shortages especially of technicians and profes-
sionals in science-based occupations. At present, there are inadequate suit-
able personnel to fill training places at the Swaziland College of Technology
where weak background of entrants adversely affects the quality of courses.
1/   The financing of the University includes an arrangement whereby each
country largely supports all activities on campuses within the country,
but with some adjustments for the numbers of exchange students between
the two countries.



- iii -
x.        As required by Government policy, all education and training after
basic education will be in accordance with estimated needs for middle- and
high-level manpower. These needs are being evaluated by an ongoing compre-
hensive manpower survey expected to be completed by October 1977, when
detailed planning of related education and training facilities will be under-
taken with a view to generating a possible third education project for Bank
Group assistance; funds for assisting this preparation work are included
in the proposed project.
xi.       The Program Unit established under the first education project,
responsible to the Minister of Education, would administer the proposed second
project; the Ministry of Works would cooperate with the Unit for all civil
works including designs, preparation of contract documents and supervision of
construction. The Unit is headed by an expatriate program director, who is
an architect, and the staff includes an assistant program director, an account-
ant, a procurement specialist and support personnel.
xii.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$6.40 million
equivalent including taxes and customs duties of US$0.40 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$3.36 million; representing 53% of the
total. Construction costs have been estimated as of February 1977, on the
basis of contracts recently awarded under the first education project. Space
standards for facilities compare favorably with similar institutions both in
other Bank-assisted projects and in Swaziland. The estimated average unit
cost of school building construction per square meter of gross area is US$150
which is below that in most East African countries. The recurrent expenditure
incurred by project institutions is expected to constitute about 3.1% of the
Government's recurrent education budget in 1985-86.
xiii.      Procurement contracts for civil works, furniture and instructional
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines for Procurement except as
follows:
(i) Civil works contracts to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent
each (total estimated at US$2.15 million);
(ii) Furniture and equipment contracts to cost less than US$50,000
equivalent each (total estimated at US$150,000); and
(iii) Locally procured transportation services for furniture and
equipment (total estimated at US$50,000).
Contracts for items (i), (ii) and (iii) would be awarded on the basis of competitive
bidding, advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory
to the Bank. The aggregate value of these contracts is likely to be US$2.35
million equivalent before contingencies. The building works are within the
capacity of Swaziland's construction industry; contractors would be prequalified.



- iv -
Based on experience under the first project and on the expected size of the
contracts, it is anticipated that civil works contracts would be won by local
firms. Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a
preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the
total applicable customs duties and import taxes, whichever is lower.
xiv.      The proceeds from the loan account would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and furni-
ture or 80% of the cost of locally manufactured equipment and furniture;
(b) 60% of total expenditures for civil works and locally procured equip-
ment and furniture; and (c) 80% of total expenditures for program adminis-
tration and future project preparation. Disbursements would be fully docu-
mented with the exception that disbursements for program operating expenses
including preparation of future projects and transportation would be made
against certificates of expenditure, documentation for which would not be
submitted for review but would be retained by the Borrower and would be
available for inspection by the Bank.
xv.       The proposed project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$4.0 million for a period of 20 years, including a grace period of 4-1/2
years.



APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Swaziland has received one IDA Credit (Credit
No. 518-SW of 1974) providing US$5.0 million for the establishment of seven
new rural education centers, the expansion of (a) the Swaziland College of
Technology, (b) the William Pitcher Teacher Training College, and (c) the
Curriculum Development and Education Materials Production Center; as well as
support for the student guidance system and professional services for a
Program Unit. Implementation of the project is well ahead of the schedule
developed at the time of appraisal.
1.02      Most of the construction work at the Swaziland College of Technology
and at the William Pitcher Teacher Training College has been completed. Work-
ing drawings and tender documents for all remaining buildings were completed
in mid-November 1976 and bids for their construction invited from qualified
firms; civil works are estimated to be completed 22 months ahead of the
appraisal mission's implementation schedule. Procurement of equipment and
furniture is similarly 30 months ahead of schedule. As a result of this
satisfactory performance, it is estimated the final project cost is likely
to be lower than the appraisal estimate. It is too early to assess the
overall educational effects of the project, but at this stage it is clear
that operation of the College of Technology needs improving; this matter is
discussed in detail below in para. 3.04.
1.03      Two Bank Group missions visited Swaziland in January and July 1976;
the first mission identified and broadly agreed with the Government on the
composition of a proposed second education project and also gave general
advice on project preparation; the second mission gave further guidance and
advice to the Program Unit to enable the preparation work to be completed.
The project was appraised in October-November 1976 by a mission composed of
Messrs. R. F. McMahon (technical educator), K. Andersen (architect), S. R.
Santos (agricultural educator), T. B. Torrance (economist) and M. W4odajo
(general educator).
1.04      The proposed project supports the Government's education policies as
defined in the Ministry of Education's documents "Report of the National Educa-
tion Commission" 1975 and "Current Trends in Educational Policy" 1976; these
documents are intended to form the basis of the educational section of the
Third National Development Plan (1978-83) now under preparation. The publica-
tion of these educational policies which show a need for urgent improvements
to secondary schools, and the indication that finance is unlikely to be a
major restraint on well-designed improvements to the educational system
have encouraged the Government and Bank Group to develop a second education
project at this time.



II.   ECONOMIC SITUATION, EMPLOYMENT AND
HUMAN RESOURCES
2.01      Background.  Economic performance in Swaziland, as measured by con-
ventional indicators, has been impressive; GDP has increased, in real terms,
by about 7% p.a. during the last four years. Per capita income, higher than
most countries in East Africa, is now about US$470 equivalent. The general
consensus is that the recent past growth trends are likely to continue,
perhaps not as high as 7%, but of the order of 6% p.a.
2.02      Agriculture and forestry are the mainstays of the Swaziland economy:
commercial estate agriculture, mostly plantations, contributes approximately
18% of GDP, while traditional agriculture and forestry contribute 14%.
A major goal in the present development plan and probably in the forthcoming
one is to accelerate the rate of change from subsistence to commercial farming.
The Government is encouraging this by purchasing land from absentee non-
citizens as a part of a program of agricultural modernization. The introduction
of new crops, particularly cotton, and new agricultural production inputs
(e.g., fertilizers, seeds, extension services) into the rural areas should
have a major impact of bringing more and more subsistence farmers into the
monetary economy. The spread of extension services to the traditional farming
areas is expected to have a major effect in encouraging farmers to adopt new
practices.
2.03      Agricultural products, both raw and processed, comprise about 60%
of exports and most industry is based on processing agricultural and forest
products. Swaziland's heavy dependence on sugar and woodpulp makes the
economy vulnerable to international price changes for these commodities.
As a result, the Government has started a program of agricultural diversifica-
tion which is being assisted by the Bank.
2.04      The industrial sector has expanded rapidly, although from a small
base, in recent years with industry now comprising about 25% of GDP. Many
new industries have been oriented toward export markets, (primarily the
Republic of South Africa); they include television assembly, fertilizer
and small tractor production. Increased efforts to promote industrial de-
velopment involve an expanded role for the National Industrial Development
Corporation and the Small Enterprises Development Company - both being assis-
ted by the Bank Group - in providing, inter alia, "workshop shells" for
prospective enterprises and training of industrial entrepreneurs.
2.05      Tourism, which accounts for 5% of GDP, has also been an active growth
sector with the number of hotel guests rising from 43,000 in 1969 to 96,000 in
1974.



-3-
Population, Labor Force and Employment
2.06      The national population, as estimated in the census conducted in
August 1976, is 525,000, of whom temporary absentees in the Republic of South
Africa number 28,700. The annual growth rate is about 3.2%.
2.07      The labor force was about 225,000 in 1976, of whom 73,000 were
employed in the modern sector in Swaziland and 28,700 were in the Republic of
South Africa. The rest of the labor force, mostly working in traditional
agriculture, is underemployed and has low income. A Bank Group rural develop-
ment project is addressed to improvements in outputs and living standards in
rural areas (para. 2.03).
2.08      Discussions with Government officials and private entrepreneurs in
Swaziland indicate that the modern sector employment is not likely to expand
at the relatively sustained rate of the 1970 to 1974 period (7% p.a.) and
might be as low as 3% a year. Likely factors in this projected slowdown of
employment are increased mechanization of commercial agriculture, particularly
sugar, slower growth of an already overstaffed public service and new manufac-
turing enterprises likely to be more capital than labor intensive. However,
employment in the informal sector, such as small scale commerce and industry,
could expand significantly if Government policy and support by the Small
Enterprises Development Company have the positive impact expected.
Human Resources
2.09      In April/May 1976, an ILO mission visited Swaziland to assess
employment, underemployment and poverty as well as to examine some of the
policy issues relating to employment. Subsequently, in order to define the
need for middle- and high-level manpower more clearly, the Government has
started a comprehensive manpower survey which is expected to be completed
by October 1977 (Appendix I). In the meantime, any observations on manpower
supply and demand would have to be provisional. However, it is quite clear
that the rapid economic growth of recent years has been heavily dependent
upon the extensive employment of expatriates at skilled, professional and
managerial levels: for example, within the Government there are 238 expa-
triates in senior positions, all without counterparts. Including the private
sector, over 2,500 of the 10,000 high- and middle-level jobs are filled by
expatriates. Some 40% of administrative and technical employees are expa-
triates. Non-citizens predominate especially in those occupations (e.g.,
engineering, agricultural research and extension) requiring a science back-
ground.
2.10      Following publication of the manpower survey report, the Government
intends to plan in detail for the education and training of the various levels
and types of skilled manpower. However, it is already apparent that the chief
manpower shortage for many years is likely to be in the engineering and agri-
cultural sectors and in other occupations requiring a training in science as a
basis upon which to build appropriate skills. This view is reinforced by the
small number of secondary schools teaching science subjects effectively: of



- 4 -
the 3,000 candidates for school certificate (grade 12) in 1973-75, only 86
qualified in science subjects, often with low grades. Clearly, there is an
urgent need to balance the subjects taught in schools as between humanities
and sciences and to bring them more in line with the country's probable needs.
There is also a need to improve the general effectiveness of teaching in
secondary schools: in 1973-75, of the above 3,000 school certificate candi-
dates, only 460 obtained a certificate of sufficient merit to qualify them for
further education and training.
III.   THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Issues in Educational Development
3.01      Comparative education indicators are shown at Annex 1, the education
and training sector is described in Appendix II and basic data are given in
Annexes 2 and 3, and Charts 1, 2 and 3.
3.02      In the decade since Independence (1968), the formal education
system, principally in response to strong social demand, has expanded rapidly
and at a rate which has necessitated the employment of untrained teachers in
primary schools and a heavy reliance on expatriates in secondary and tertiary
education. In 1975, 73% of primary teachers were not qualified and 50% of
secondary teachers were expatriates. The Government is planning that by 1983,
some 74% of primary teachers would be qualified and all secondary schools
would be staffed entirely with qualified Swazis (Annexes 4, 5 and 6).
3.03      The shortage of skilled manpower in the teaching profession is also
reflected in staff shortages in the Ministry of Education (Min/Ed) where con-
siderable reliance is being placed on expatriate staff for key functions. The
planning section, which has bilateral assistance from Unesco and USAID, but
is headed by a competent Swazi, is efficient; other sections dealing with
inspection of schools and scientific and technical subject development require
reinforcement which can be achieved only some years hence after Swazi teachers
have gained adequate practical experience in schools and in the educational
system generally. In the meantime, some continued reliance on expatriates is
inevitable.
3.04      The Min/Ed is responsible for all institutions within the formal
system except the Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT). SCOT provides voca-
tional and technical training under the Ministry of Labor. This separation
has caused little difficulty in the past; however, as the secondary schools
are increasingly including commercial, woodwork and metalwork courses, and
are adding facilities for rural skill training for adults, increased coopera-
tion between SCOT and Min/Ed is necessary, mainly because SCOT trains teachers
of practical subjects for secondary schools. This teacher training program
is in urgent need of development so that practical subject teachers may be
trained in adequate numbers. Consequently, the Government has recently pre-
pared a plan to expedite the training of technical teachers at SCOT. The



Government agreed to start implementation of this plan not later than
December 31, 1977. Government is aware of the need to plan and reorganize
SCOT and therefore has recently (September 1976) appointed a Governing Body
with the Permanent Secretary of Min/Ed as Chairman. The Governors, in order
to form a base for adequate programming of developments in technical educa-
tion and vocational training, intend to carry out, with external assistance,
a full inspection of the College to determine the optimum quantitative and
qualitative potential of the College and to outline possible future invest-
ment in technical and vocational education. The results of the inspection
would be coordinated with the projections of the manpower survey now under-
way to plan future training needs in this educational sub-sector.
3.05      The rapid expansion of the formal educational system has inevitably
resulted in a qualitative standard in schools which the Government wishes
to improve, not only by increasing the general competence of students in the
long-established basics of reading, writing and arithmetic, but also in
significantly modifying the curricula to include subjects expected to be
relevant to the increasing introduction of technology and improved agricul-
tural processes in Swaziland (paras. 2.02-2.05). With bilateral assistance
from USAID, curricula reform and development are being undertaken and new
curricula are gradually being successfully introduced into schools.
3.06      Crucial to the Government's planned educational developments is
a supply of Swazi teachers trained in subjects relevant to the new curricula.
Primary teachers are trained in two-year programs at William Pitcher Teacher
Training College (WPTTC) and Nazarene College. The WPTTC now graduates 60
teachers p.a. which will rise to 90 in 1980; the output from Nazarene College
is constant at 50 p.a. A new primary teachers' college with assistance from
DANIDA, is planned to produce 100 teachers in 1982, 180 in 1983 and 200 p.a.
subsequently. Employment in primary schools of these outputs would increase
trained Swazi teachers from 639 in 1975 to 2,800 by 1985, i.e., to about 80%
of the 3,600 primary teachers required in that year.
3.07      Secondary teachers are trained at the University of Botswana and
Swaziland (UBS), WPTTC and SCOT. The University trains teachers of humani-
ties, science, agriculture and domestic science for all grades of secondary
schools whilst the William Pitcher College trains teachers in humanities and
science subjects for junior secondary schools. The College of Technology
has training programs for commercial and practical subjects. The 1976 total
output of 80 secondary teachers is planned to rise to 140 by 1983 which
should be sufficient for all secondary schools at that time to be staffed
with trained Swazis provided that adequate personnel are trained in each of
the various subjects of the new curricula (Annex 5). Except for the train-
ing of practical subject teachers for which urgent action is being under-
taken (para. 3.04), the planned output of teachers able to deal with all
subjects of the new curricula is satisfactory.
3.08      For the foreseeable future teacher training colleges will have to
rely heavily upon expatriates to carry out teacher training programs and
indications are that bilateral agencies will continue with their present



- 6 -
substantial support: for example, the UK Overseas Development Ministry's
present intention is to supply, on a continuous basis, 70 personnel qualified
in English, mathematics, science and practical subjects for employment in
teacher training colleges and higher education. For the longer term, the Gov-
ernment policy is to appoint Swazis to the colleges after they have obtained
adequate educational and pedagogical experience and so gradually reduce the
dependence on expatriates and maintain a high standard in the colleges.
3.09      Since publication of the Second National Development Plan (1973-77)
which placed emphasis on technical education, gave priority to rural and adult
education and in addition, demanded that places be made available in secondary
schools for all who achieve the necessary qualifications, there has been a
modification in this policy and the revision is to be incorporated in the
Third Development Plan. The new policy is to extend basic education, which
currently comprises seven years of primary school, to ten years so that
eventually all children after completing primary education will be able to
attend three-year junior secondary schools. The Government plans to imple-
ment this policy gradually, so that by 1985 there would be places in primary
grades 1-7 for all children and by the same year enrollments in junior
secondary schools would be increased to 24,800 (54% of the age group) from
the 1975 figure of 13,400 (38% of the age group). Full development of a
ten-year basic education is expected for the early or mid 1990s.
3.10      Educational developments after junior secondary school levels are
to be geared to estimated middle- and higher-level manpower requirements to
be defined by a manpower survey now in progress and expected to be completed
by October 1977 (para. 2.09). Based on the findings of the manpower survey,
the Government intends to develop a third education project for consideration
by the Bank Group. Consequently, the project proposed in the next chapter
contains no item to support post-junior secondary level education and training.
Financing Educational Development
3.11      The expansion of Swaziland's education system is reflected in the
growth of expenditures (Annex 7). In recent years, recurrent expenditures
devoted to education have increased from 18% to 22.5% of total Government
recurrent expenditures. Because of expected rapid increase in recurrent
revenues (para. 3.13), planned expansion of the education sector is likely to
result in a decrease of this proportion:

The projection is based on the enrollment targets in the primary and secondary
education summarized at paras. 3.09 and 3.10 above and on conservative extra-
polation of trends in enrollment growth in post-secondary and adult education.
The ratio of educational recurrent expenditures to Central Government total
budget is similar to those in other African countries as shown by the
following:
Botswana   Lesotho   Madagascsir  _i.bia    Kenya

3.12      In addition to Government, the financing of education includes school
fees paid by parents as well as contributions from multilateral agencies,
foreign governments and religious organizations. Fees for primary students
are E 20 p.a. and average E 60 per student in secondary schools. For 1976,
estimates for school fees total about E 2.93 million. Contributions from other
sources, due to lack of data, cannot be quantified, but are significant.
3.13      The above financial projections reflect the high priority accorded
by the Government to educational developments; recurrent educational expendi-
tures during the decade 1976-86 are to be allowed to rise at nearly 8% p.a. as
compared with GDP increasing at about 6% p.a. and total Government budget at
about 10% p.a. 1/ After 1986, by when universal primary education should have
been attained, it would be possible to further reduce the growth rate of
expenditures to education or to increase more rapidly expenditure on adult
education than estimated at present.
1/   This is a conservative assumption in the light of recent rapid revenue
growth (25% p.a. from 1972 to 1976 in real terms).



-8-
3.14      Capital expenditures of the Ministry of Education during the three
years 1974-76 were actually E 4.3 million against a budgeted E 6.2 million;
the reason for this difference was a shortage of qualified staff to execute
the physical planning, particularly at the Ministry of Works where future staff
shortages are likely to result in continued shortfalls between budgeted and
actual capital expenditures. Projections of capital expenditures for primary
and secondary education call for an annual outlay of about E 3.5 million
at 1975/76 prices over the next decade.  There is some possibility that in
the short term, the planned volume of educational expansion may not be obtain-
able and the recurrent costs may be lower than those indicated above in
para. 3.11.
Bank Group Strategy in Support of the Sector
3.15      The Bank Group strategy in support of the education sector of
Swaziland has above all, the objective of redressing imbalances with a view of
(i) meeting manpower requirements and (ii) reducing inequities in the provi-
sion of educational opportunities. For this reason, the first project gave
priority to technical and vocational education and to the establishment of a
rural education system together with support to educational planning and to
labor market studies. Pending the completion of the ongoing manpower survey
(para. 2.09), the proposed second education project would place emphasis on
the reorientation of secondary education to increase its practical content
and improve its efficiency as a prerequisite for providing students with the
background and the skills required for entrance in further educational insti-
tutions and in the labor market. A possible third project has been tenta-
tively identified; as it would support the expansion of specialized education,
its development requires the completion of both the manpower survey and the
detailed planning of vocational and technical training (para. 3.04). The Bank
Group strategy complements the efforts of other agencies that are providing
assistance to primary education (SIDA), curriculum development and educa-
tional planning (USAID and ODM), primary teacher training (DANIDA), technical
training (Federal Republic of Germany and ODM) and agricultural training
(European Development Fund).
IV.   THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The principal objectives of the proposed project are (i) to support
Government policy to expand its basic education cycle from the present seven
to ten yea.rs; (ii) to improve existing junior secondary schools, i.e., the last
three years of basic education, by the addition of facilities to enable science
and practical subjects to be taught; (iii) to support Government policy of
equity in educational opportunities by building new junior secondary schools
in rural areas presently devoid of such schools; and (iv) to enable the Govern-
ment to execute preparatory work for further educational projects.
4.02      The proposed project would meet these objectives with the following
items:



- 9 -
(i)  Buildings, furniture and equipment to support the teaching of
science and practical subjects in 13 junior secondary schools
whose present capacity of 2,900 students would be increased to
3,960.
(ii)  Buildings, furniture and equipment for four new junior secondary
schools to be sited in rural areas. Each school would have a
capacity of 240 students.
(iii)  Simple livestock buildings and equipment to support the agri-
cultural teacher training program at the University of Botswana
and Swaziland.
(iv)  Operational costs of program administration, local transpor-
tation costs and pre-investment studies for future projects.
Project Items
4.03      Extension to junior secondary schools.  Swaziland has 40 junior
secondary schools (grades 8-10) and 22 high schools (grades 8-10 and 11-12).
Under the first education project, two junior secondary schools are being
developed as rural education centers to enable them to serve as focal
points for a variety of courses and services (e.g., agricultural extension,
nonformal training, literacy classes) for local communities. The first
education project also includes five new rural education centers each
incorporating a junior secondary school. The Government has considered
including rural education centers in the proposed second education project
but has decided not to do so because the seven centers in the first project
are highly experimental and are in the early organizational stage; there-
fore, before requesting assistance for additional centers the Government
wishes the first seven to become operational and an evaluation of them made.
The 13 junior secondary schools selected for improvement as a part of the
proposed project are all sited in rural areas so that depending on the
outcome of the evaluation, they may eventually be converted into rural
education centers. The improvements consist, by and large, of the provisions
of science laboratories and practical subjects workshops. Curricula and
syllabi have already been developed with assistance from a major USAID curri-
culum development project. It is expected that 35%-40% of the junior second-
ary school leavers, unable to have access to senior secondary schools,
would enter employment in agricultural or the small scale industrial and
services sectors; therefore, instruction in science and practical subjects
is necessary to provide them with attitude and background on which to build
on-the-job training and experience. Science and practical subjects account
for about 40% of the weekly timetable.
4.04      Four new junior secondary schools would support the Government
policy of education system building by helping to extend basic education from
seven to ten years by providing 960 student places in four new schools. They
would also provide a fairer and more equitable distribution of schools by
each being sited in a rural area where there are no junior secondary schools.



- 10 -
4.05      Selection of the 13 schools for extension and the sites for the
four new schools was influenced by the potential student supply in the dis-
trict around each school. The density of child population in each district
is such that each school could be filled by day-students thus eliminating
the need for expensive boarding facilities. Depending upon its size, each
school would be provided with three or four houses of a modest size for key
staff.
4.06      The supply of teachers in the various humanities, sciences and
practical subjects of the new curriculum, would be adequate for the junior
secondary schools in the project, if appropriate steps to improve the prac-
tical teacher training program at the Swaziland College of Technology are
taken (para. 3.04).
4.07      Agricultural teacher training facilities.  The Faculty of Agricul-
ture of the University of Botswana and Swaziland 1/, located at Manzini, is
generally well equipped for its agricultural teacher training program from
which an output of 9 teachers is scheduled in 1977, 14 in 1978 rising to a
steady output of 20 p.a. in 1980; these would be sufficient to meet fore-
seeable demands of secondary schools. The Faculty's only need to support
the program is for a "model agricultural center" of a type which is being
included in junior secondary schools; it comprises livestock facilities
(pigs, rabbits and poultry), crop facilities and a laboratory workshop.
4.08      Program administration:  operating expenses and pre-investment
studies. The Program Unit formed for the first education project has oper-
ated satisfactorily and the Unit, working in cooperation with the Ministry
of Works, would continue to function in its present form for the proposed
second project. The Unit's operating expenses, including quantity surveying
services, salaries of some staff, furniture and equipment, would be financed
as a part of the project.
4.09      Following completion of the ongoing manpower survey in late-1977
and clarification of the country's need for middle- and higher-level manpower,
the Government wishes to prepare in some detail a third project for possible
Bank Group financing (para. 3.15). As the items of this project are likely
to incorporate training programs for agricultural, commercial and technical
manpower, design of the physical facilities would be of some complexity
and existing standard drawings and equipment lists could be used only to a
limited extent. Consequently, detailed preparation of architectural and
engineering work with equipment and furniture lists before appraisal would
result in expeditious project implementation. Consultants may be required
to assist in this work as well as to undertake studies in connection with
project preparation.
1/   The financing of the University includes an arrangement whereby each
country largely supports all activities on campuses within the country,
but with some adjustments for the numbers of exchange students between
the two countries.

V.   PROJECT COST, FINANCIAL PLAN, IMPLEMENTATION
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
5.01      Project cost.  Construction cost estimates have been derived from
costs obtained following recent competitive bidding and contract awards in
the first Bank Group education project. Classrooms in Mbabane/Manzini cost
about US$150 equivalent per square meter with the rest of the country 10%
higher. As indicated by the following, building costs in Swaziland are
reasonable in relation to other East African countries:
Tanzania       (December 1975)         $300 sq. m.
Mauritius      (October 1976)          $205 sq. m.
Lesotho        (December 1976)         $185 sq. m.
Botswana       (May 1976)              $135 sq. m.
Schedules of accommodation have been prepared for all project institutions and
are functional and appropriate to student enrollments. Estimates of equip-
ment and furniture costs are also based on recent information obtained during
implementation of the first Bank Group education project. The estimated
costs of the various parts of the project and categories of expenditure are
given in Annex 8 and are summarized below:

5.02      Customs dutLes and taxes.  Swaziland forms a customs union with
Botswana, Lesotho and the Republic of South Africa. Import duties and
sales taxes are not levied on Government purchases of furniture and equip-
ment. Construction materials originating within the customs union are tax
free.  Altogether, taxes are estimated at US$0.40 million equivalent.
5.03      Coiti-encv e   liwances add 10% for unforeseen physical events to
the base So<-:           O .  es ot civil works and furniture, and 5% for equipment.
Estimated acunual p-ice increases are 8% for furniture and equipment and 12%
for civil works during the project implementation period 1977-1980 (Annex 9).
5.04      Foreign exchange component.  The foreign exchange component has
been estimated at US$3.36 million equivalent or 53% of the total project
cost including contingencies and has been calculated as follows: (a) site
development and construction 45%; (b) furniture 65%; (c) equipment 85%;
and (d) project administration 50%. The foreign exchange component wao
estimated, inter alia, on the assumption that building contracts would be
won by local firms and is therefore less than if awards to foreign contractors
had been assumed. This assumption is justified on two counts: (i) contracts
under the first project have all been awarded to local firms, and (ii) the
schools, because they are small and sited in rural areas, are unlikely to
interest international civil works contractors.
5.05      Financial plan.  The total project cost of US$6.40 million equiva-
lent would be financed as follows: (a) an IBRD loan of US$4.00 million
equivalent would meet the foreign expenditures and 21% of the local currency
expenditures; and (b) the Government of Swaziland would finance from its own
resources the remaining local currency cost of US$2.40 million equivalent
(US$2.00 million equival.ent net of taxes).

three years (Annex 9) after the date of loan effectiveness including six
months for the completion of payments and withdrawals from the loan accounts.
5.08      Administration.  The Program Unit established for the first project
would continue operations for the proposed second project. The Unit includes
a Program Director, an Accountant and a Procurement Specialist who were se-
lected in consultation with the Bank Group. The Government agreed to con-
sult with the Bank Group for any new appointments to the position of Program
Director, who is presently an expatriate. To ensure continued efficient
progress in project implementation when the present Program Director leaves
Swaziland, the Government has recently appointed a counterpart for the Program
Director.
5.09      The Program Unit would be provided, at no cost to the project, with
architectural and engineering assistance, including supervision of construc-
tion, from the Ministry of Works (MOW) for all the construction in the pro-
posed project. Quantity surveying services would require the use of consult-
ants for which provision is included in the proposed project under program
administration expenses (para. 4.08). Standardized designs and master equip-
ment lists have already been developed for most of the project schools. The
Government confirmed that MOW services will continue to be available when
requested by the Program Unit.
5.10      Sites for the new schools under the proposed project are already
owned by the Government; the existing institutions for expansion are located
on satisfactory sites which are either Government owned or controlled.
5.11      Procurement.  Contracts for civil works, furniture and instructional
equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines for Procurement except as
follows:
(i) Civil works contracts to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent
each (total estimated at US$2.15 million);
(ii)  Furniture and equipment contracts to cost less than US$50,000
equivalent each (total estimated at US$150,000); and
(iii)  Locally procured transportation services for moving furniture
and equipment (total estimated at US$50,000).
Contracts for items (i), (ii) and (iii) would be awarded on the basis of com-
petitive bidding, advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. The aggregate value of these contracts is likely to
be US$2.35 million equivalent before contingencies. Based on experience under
the first project and on the expected size of the contracts, it is anticipated
that civil works contracts would be won by local firms. Local manufacturers



- 16 -
of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of 15%
of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the total applicable customs
duties and import taxes, whichever is lower.
5.12      Standardized sketch designs, draft tender documents and master lists
of furniture and equipment have been reviewed by Bank staff. Proposed group-
ing for tender would be reviewed by the Bank before procurement. Items would
be grouped, to the extent practicable, to encourage competitive bidding and to
permit bulk procurement. Review of tender evaluation documents by the Bank
prior to award would be required only for contracts of US$250,000 equivalent
and above for civil works and of US$50,000 equivalent and above for equipment
and furniture.
5.13      Disbursement.  Disbursement (Annex 10) would be on the basis of:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and furni-
ture or 80% of the cost of locally manufactured equipment and furniture;
(b) 60% of total expenditures for civil works and locally procured equip-
ment and furniture; and (c) 80% of total expenditures for program adminis-
tration and future project preparation. Disbursements for program adminis-
tration including preparation of future project and local transport services
would be made against certificates of expenditure, documentation of which
would not be submitted for review but would be retained by the Borrower and
would be available for inspection by the Bank during project supervision.
All other disbursements would be fully documented. Procurement is expected
to be completed by April 1979, and the project by October 31, 1979, with a
proposed Closing Date of June 30, 1980.
VI.   BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project's principal objective is to support the Government's
policy to develop its educational system by gradually expanding young people's
basic education from the present seven to ten years and so produce an upgrading
of the work force in keeping with Swaziland's probable trained manpower demands
to support potential economic development.
6.02      The need for an upgrading of the work force is urgent.  As indicated
in paras. 2.09 and 2.10, secondary school leavers qualified in science and re-
lated subjects totalled only about 30 p.a. during 1973-75, i.e., only one out
of every 35 secondary school leavers had received basic education in scien-
tific subjects; the outputs in previous years were even smaller. This has
resulted in a severe shortage of specialist personnel for Government and
private sector appointments, many of which are now filled by expatriates.
Because of the long lead-time required to develop remedial educational and
training programs, replacing of expatriates with Swazis is likely to take a
long time.



- 17 -
6.03      The 17 junior secondary schools in the proposed project, when
built and fully operational by about 1983, would produce an output of some
1,400 graduates p.a. all of whom would have benefited from a teaching pro-
gram based on a well-balanced humanities-science curriculum designed and
developed to enable the graduates to be acceptable and receptive, not only
to further formal education, but also for those who would then terminate
formal education, to employment in the modern sector or employment in the
informal sector. The graduates' suitability for on-the-job training and
associated part-time training at the Swaziland College of Technology and
other institutions would thus be substantially improved. It would be these
graduates, after some years of industrial and commercial experience reinforced
with appropriate courses, who would replace the expatriates in Government
and private sector and become the skilled manpower upon which Swaziland's
economic development depends.
Risks
6.04      In view of satisfactory performance of the Program Unit and gen-
erally good management and effective practical cooperation with the Ministry
of Works, prospects for completion of the physical facilities (buildings,
furniture and equipment) for the proposed project before Closing Date and
within the cost estimates are especially favorable.
6.05      Intrinsically more difficult, however, would be fulfillment of the
main educational objective of the proposed project, viz., the successful
implementation of the new curriculum. In many Bank Group-assisted education
projects, the introduction of science and practical subjects into secondary
schools has not always met with the success expected, usually for these
reasons (i) a lack of appropriately trained teachers and (ii) provision of
inadequate recurrent resources to support the teaching of scientific and
practical subjects; this results in a dearth of expendable materials, e.g.,
chemicals, wood and metals essential for the functioning of laboratories and
workshops. On point (i), there are reasonable prospects that teachers trained
in all subjects will be produced in adequate numbers to meet school expansion
needs except for practical subject teachers as already discussed in para. 3.04
above. Due to the shortage of, and subsequent high demand for, personnel
trained in commercial and technical skills, there will be, for some years, a
distinct probability that teachers trained in these subjects will, because of
higher salaries, take up appointments outside teaching and so nullify progress
in attaining the educational objective. This problem was discussed with the
Government who provided an assurance that conditions of service of teachers
of commercial and practical subjects would, from time to time, be reviewed
to ensure that secondary schools are adequately staffed. On point (ii), an
assurance was obtained from the Government that adequate recurrent funds would
be annually budgeted and earmarked for expenditure on educational expendable
materials. Also, the Government agreed that within twelve months from the
completion of the project, the Min/Ed would prepare and send to the Bank a
report providing a preliminary assessment of the project's educational re-
sults. The scheme of evaluation would be developed in consultation with Bank
staff.



- 18 -
6.06      Altogether, these risks are small and measures are being taken to
minimize them as outlined in the previous paragraph. In spite of these risks,
the project's objectives and expected benefits point to its suitability as an
integral part of a program to redress imbalances within the education system
and to improve the quality of education with a view of supplying Swaziland
with the trained local manpower to execute its development program.
VII.   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement was reached with the Government on the following principal
points:
(a)  Training and condition of service of teachers of
practical subjects (paras. 3.04 and 6.05);
(b)  Project implementation arrangements (paras. 5.08
and 5.09); and
(c)  Project monitoring and evaluation (para. 6.05).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of
US$4.0 million to the Kingdom of Swaziland for a term of 20 years, including a
grace period of 4-1/2 years.



APPENDIX I
SWAZILAND
MANPOWER AND EMPLOYMENT
1.        The modern sector provides over 80% of the GDP, while about one-
half of the population continues to depend directly on subsistence agricul-
ture. The dominant sectors, agriculture and manufacturing, account for
about 32% and 15% of GDP, respectively, while mining contributes just under
10%. During the 1950s and early 1960s, GDP grew at about 12% p.a.; since
then its growth has averaged about 7% p.a. High prices for sugar and wood
pulp in the last few years have considerably strengthened the export-oriented
base of the economy.
2.        Recent comprehensive statistics on the size, distribution, and
growth of Swaziland's labor force are not available because the last in-depth
manpower survey was completed in 1969. The 1976 labor force is estimated at
about 225,000 with about one-third of them in the modern sector in Swaziland.
The 1976 estimated breakdown of the labor force by type of activity is:
Total labor force                             225,000
Total paid employment:
(a)  in Swaziland                         73,000
(b)  in South Africa                      28,700
Other employment                               10,000
Total "modern Sector" employment              111,700
Labor force dependent on traditional
agriculture                                 113,300
Paid employment is allocated among the various sectors as follows:
Industry Group                         1972              1976 (est.)
Agriculture and Forestry             24,332                 30,000
Mining and Quarrying                  2,950                  3,400
Manufacturing                         6,512                  9,900
Electricity                             514                    800

APPENDIX I
Page 2
Of those in paid employment in Swaziland, almost one-quarter are employed in
the public or quasi-public sector. Swazis are employed for the most part in
the less-skilled occupations; in ract, over 90% of all Swazis in paid employ-
ment in 1973 fell outside the administrative technical categories.
Manpower Gaps
3.        One of the most serious barriers to development in Swaziland is the
shortage of high- and middle-level manpower. Mlany of these posts in the
private sector are currently filled by expatriates; over 50% of the adminis-
trative and technical workers and 40% of the skilled workers are expatriates
(excluding agriculture). Thus, much of the modern private sector is controlled
by expatriates and in spite of various broad policy statements, no concrete
plan exists for localization. At the middle-levels, many vacancies exist, and
this impairs the effectiveness of expatriates at higher levels. In 1976,
expatriates occupied 238 Government professional posts and 50% of secondary
school teachers were expatriates. The expatriate high-level manpower is
virtually irreplaceable in the near future, given the number of students in
training or serving as counterparts as well as the long training period need
to gain on-the-job experience, so the manpower policies of Government should
be directed at meeting needs at the middle-levels. Still, the shortage at
middle-levels will be difficult to reduce in the near future because currently.
all level I and II school certificate passes go to UBS and level III and IV
passes generally are not considered to be capable of doing the work effectively.
The quality of secondary education must be improved - in recent years the
enrollments in secondary school have increased at 15% p.a. with virtually no
absolute increase in level I and II school certificate passes. Still, increas-
ing the quality of formal education will have only limited impact on the
qualifications of school leavers, particularly in the short run. Rather,
closer communications between employers and training institutions and a better
awareness of the capabilities and potential of young job-seekers are needed.
Manpower difficulties can be addressed much more effectively by operating
through employers and dealing directly with specific employment opportunities
than relying solely on a general upgrading of a formal education system. At
some point, an apprenticeship scheme would be quite beneficial, but major work
on establishing channels of communications and coordinating mechanisms should
occur first.
Future Manpower Requirements
4.        The latest data on employment by industry was collected in a 1973
survey of establishments, while the only other manpower survey that collected
data on skill levels related to educational attainment was conducted in
1969. The 1969 survey is of little use since no industry/occupation matrix
was established and any extrapolation to 1975 or beyond would be quite super-
ficial. While projecting from the 1973 survey is tenuous, it is the best
source of data available. All projections should be understood to indicate
order of magnitude only (within broad confidence limits), especially



APPENDIX I
Page 3
when attempts are made to match supply and demand. On completion of the
ongoing manpower survey in late 1977, a much better analysis of the situation
can be undertaken subsequently.
5.        The table below projects manpower needs to 1980 (projections to
1985 were not made because of the weak data base, but there is no reason to
assume that the same trend would not continue). The projections are based
on assumptions of a 5% p.a. growth rate of employment (3% p.a. productivity
increases at all levels), 3% p.a. attrition, and approximate targets concern-
ing the localization of certain jobs. The assumptions on productivity
increases are high, but realistic in light of expressed desires of the
private sector to increase mechanization (e.g., one estimate places labor
productivity increases in the paper and pulp industry at 50% between 1971
and 1973). These figures are extremely sensitive to the above assumptions -
for example, a change of 1% in the growth rate (or labor productivity rate)
would imply about a 15% change in the manpower requirements. There is a
high degree of substitutability among the various skill levels, and the
impacts of excesses of demand or supply will be lessened at each level by
spillover from other levels (e.g., unqualified teachers employed at primary
levels).

Assuming that administrative and technical workers should have either degree or
specialized post-secondary training, the data show a serious shortfall (a supply
of about 450 p.a. versus a demand of 620). The most serious shortages will be
in professional and technical occupations, jobs that cannot be filled in the
near future by students currently in training due to the significant amount of
experience required in many cases. On the other hand, there could be surpluses
of degree graduates in humanities and social sciences. The openings in small
firms or Government agencies that require substantial experience from applicants
will either have to be filled by expatriates or left vacant. The output from
SCOT should be adequate to fill recurrent annual demand for skilled workers by
1980, assuming expansions proceed as planned, but little localization will
occur. Rough projections to 1985 indicate that shortages at high- and middle-
levels will still exist, even if post-secondary institutions are expanded
significantly over this period. On the other hand, the situation for second-
ary school leavers is much less encouraging.  In aggregate, it appears that at
this level 3,700 applicants p.a. will be produced for 2,300 jobs. This figure
is, however, highly sensitive to the assumptions made as to participation rates
in the labor market and attrition for marriage, death, retirement or alike.
7.        There is a seeming paradox in that manpower shortages can exist from
the employer's point of view while there is substantial unemployment among job



APPENDIX I
Page 5
seekers. Structural imbalances are a major cause, but they cannot explain
the entire gap. Any modern sector, especially one as small and diverse as
Swaziland's, can absorb only a limited number of trainees each year, both
because many jobs require experience and because training puts significant
demands on the already overworked trained manpower. In addition, serious
misconceptions exist concerning the capabilities of entrants to the labor
market. Interviews with a number of Swazi employers indicate that they place
more demands on new recruits than would be placed in a developed country. In
addition, the Government should consider sponsoring programs to assist employ-
ers in providing on-the-job training to new employees.
The Manpower Survey
8.        The manpower survey, presently being undertaken in Swaziland, will
provide a range of data on the labor force in Swaziland which should facili-
tate manpower and educational planning. The survey is being undertaken by a
team led by a statistician under ODM auspices. ODM is helping to meet some
of the financial costs of the survey. The survey commenced in October 1976
and the final report is expected by October 1977.
9.        In particular, the survey will provide information on vacancies in
both public and private sectors and the necessary level of education and
training which people would require to fill these positions, presently un-
available in present statistics. The survey will pinpoint the characteristics
of the stock of high- and middle-level manpower working in Swaziland. Infor-
mation on nationality, age, sex, occupation, earnings, education and training
received and training being presently undertaken will be requested in indivi-
dual or collective interviews with high- and middle-level personnel. Parti-
cular attention will be paid to expatriate employment and anticipated rates of
localization. After the "stock-taking" is completed, the survey will address
itself to projected increases in the number of skilled employees needed over
a five-year period. The definition of a skilled employee will be an employee
with at least three years post-primary education and training.
10.       In the private sector, coverage of all firms will be complete except
for Agriculture and Wholesale and Retail Trade where only a sample of estab-
lishments will be visited. It is anticipated that 800 establishments will
be surveyed and up to 7,000 skilled employees interviewed. A team of 15-20
enumerators will be hired to do the interviews. A separate survey will be made
of the public sector including education.
11.       The survey will provide data which will enable a skill-by-skill
by industry inventory to be made for Swaziland. Industry by occupational
matrices can be developed and relationships of earnings to skill level and
educational qualifications can be measured. With a projection of likely skill
by skill needs, the nature and scale of educational and training programs can
be more accurately gauged than presently is the case. The public sector
survey should provide the basis for development of a centralized personnel
record system for the public service.



APPENDIX I
Page 6
12.       Localization efforts are hampered by inadequate data on the
deployment and qualifications of expatriate personnel. At present, no
localization or training plans are required of employers and expatriate
recruitment is handled on an ad hoc basis. The survey will provide infor-
mation by which permits can be more efficiently allocated to expatriates.
As a result, localization policy would be more systematically developed
and administered.
13.       Scholarships to Swazis studying at the post-secondary level tend
to be granted too much in line with student preferences rather than to the
needs of the economy. The survey should provide the information by which
scholarship can be more effectively channelled.
14.       At present, data on salaries, wages and earnings in general tend to
be fragmentary and when available, only in the form of broad aggregates. The
formulation of a policy on incentives, wages and incomes will require much
more detailed data. Information collected in this survey should be a valuable
supplement to existing data.
15.       The manpower survey should also provide additional information which
will throw light on the extent to which trained persons take jobs that are
related to their studies. Some judgements can be made on the extent to which
usable skills are picked up during the education process. It is possible that
the survey will be helpful in providing some insights on the relative effective-
ness of informal job training versus the formal system.



APPENDIX II
SWAZILAND
THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Historical Background
1.        Western education in Swaziland dates back to the middle of the
19th century with the arrival of the first missionaries. Over the years, the
number of mission schools has grown steadily until today mission-related
schools account for about 80% of primary, and about 45% of secondary school
enrollment. The rapid development of mission schools is responsible for
a comparatively high (about 50% of adult population) literacy rate. Inevi-
tably, the mission schools, stressed the literary (academic) subjects at the
expense of science and mathematics so that much of the curricula in the
mission schools had little relevance to the developmental needs of the coun-
try. Also, since the mission schools were located near the early missionary
settlements, the result has been a gross disparity in the distribution of
educational facilities, particularly at the secondary level. In recent years,
particularly since Independence in 1968, the Government has increased its
control and supervision of the country's educational system, with a corre-
sponding decrease in the role and influence of the mission schools.
Administration
2.        Three types of schools are found in the Swazi system:  Government,
Aided and Private. The main difference between the types lies in the level
of Government support and method of control. Government pays all expenses
in Government schools and teachers' salaries in the aided schools, but no
financial support is provided to the private schools. Most of the aided and
virtually all the private schools have mission affiliation. In terms of
control, the Ministry of Education is officially responsible for all schools;
its control being exercised directly through the headmaster in the case of
Government schools, and indirectly through the chairman of the school committee
in the case of the private and aided schools. Chart 1 shows the organizational
set-up of the Ministry of Education in 1976.
3.        The Ministry of Education is also responsible for teacher training
and the International Education Center, an institution that offers correspond-
ence courses mostly at the Junior Certificate level. The Ministry is also
represented on the governing Council of the University of Botswana and
Swaziland and the Ministry's Permanent Secretary is the Chairman of the
recently formed Board of Governors of the Swaziland College of Technology.
4.        In addition to educational institutions administered by the Ministry
of Education, there are a number of educational and training programs operated
by other ministries and agencies. These include:
(a) The Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT) administered
by the Department of Labor in the office of the Deputy
Prime Minister;



APPENDIX II
Page 2
(b) Farmer Training Centers and an Agricultural Extension Program
operated by the Ministry of Agriculture;
(c) The Staff Training Institute (for civil service training) and
the Works and Communications Training both operated by the
Ministry of Establishments and Training;
(d) The Handicrafts and Co-operative Training Centers, both ad-
ministered by the Ministry of Commerce and Cooperatives;
(e) The Youth Training Center under the Ministry of Local Adminis-
tration; and
(f) Training programs for nurses under the Ministry of Health.
In addition, various private training programs are operated by mining, sugar,
timber and railroad corporations.
5.        The rapid expansion of the formal educational system since Indepen-
dence has resulted in the employment of a large number of unqualified teachers.
This is especially the case at the primary level. In 1975, of the 2,363
primary teachers only 639 (27%) were considered qualified on the basis of the
Government's own standards. The massive expansion has also had a detrimental
effect on the Ministry's capability to supervise and control the quality and
efficiency of the school system. During the past few years, the Government
has taken steps to strengthen the planning and supervision functions of the
Ministry of Education. However, there is still a need to strengthen in parti-
cular the Ministry's supervisory capability in technical/vocational education
and training because of the introduction of practical subjects in the second-
ary schools.
Structure
6.        The primary cycle is seven years long, followed by a five-year
secondary cycle, of which the first three years constitute junior secondary
and the last two years, high school level. Entrance to both junior and high
school is through competitive examinations. At the end of the junior school
cycle, a Junior School Certificate is awarded; at the end of high school, the
students sit for the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate. The structure of
the educational system is shown in Chart 2.
General Education
7.        Primary Education has a duration of seven years; the first two years
are called grades, and the remaining five years are referred to as standards.
The local language, Sisweti, is the medium of instruction during the first
three years, after which English becomes the medium of instruction throughout
the school system. The Swaziland Government has decided to work toward univer-
sal primary education (UPE) by 1985.  This decision followed the 1975 "Report



APPENDIX II
Page 3
of the National Education Commission". In this context, UPE means opportuni-
ties will be made available for every child in the age group 6-13 to find a
place in school over the ten-year period.
8.        In 1975, there were 412 primary schools in Swaziland of which 51
(12.4%) were Government, 241 (58.5%) aided and 120 (29.1%) private. Not all
primary schools, however, provide the full seven-year course. Most of the
incomplete schools offer only the first four years of the primary cycle, and
in 1975 none of the private primary schools offered full primary courses.
9.        In 1975, enrollment in all primary schools totalled 89,528, of which
43,984 (49%) were female (Annex 3). The breakdown of primary school enroll-
ment in 1975 by type of school was as follows: Government, 17,534 (19.6%);
aided 63,076 (70.4%); and private, 8,918 (10.0%). Excluding over-age child-
ren, in 1975, 71.4% of the males aged 7-13 and 73.4% of that age-group for
females were enrolled at the primary level.
10.       The Government has undertaken a major curriculum reform for primary
schools. The main thrust of the reform is to introduce students to agricul-
ture and other elementary practical subjects. Similarly, the mathematics and
science courses have been revised and teachers are being trained to teach
them.
11.       The main bottleneck at the primary level remains the poor quality
of the teaching staff. Of the 2,363 primary school teaching force in 1975,
only 639 (27%) are regarded as qualified by the Ministry of Education. An
in-service training course has been mounted (with UNESCO assistance) to up-
grade the underqualified teachers. Similarly, expansion is in progress (with
Bank Group assistance) at the country's main primary teacher training insti-
tution, Willian Pitcher. These combined efforts will significantly improve
the trained teacher supply so that by 1985, some 80% of the teachers will
be trained.
General Secondary Education
12.       In 1975, there were 62 secondary schools in Swaziland.  However,
most of them offered courses only through the junior secondary level; the
senior schools were located in the larger urban centers. Enrollment at the
secondary level totalled 16,198 of which 13,364 (82%) were at the junior
secondary level. 45% of secondary enrollment were female. In terms of par-
ticipation rates, 25% of boys aged 14-18 and 23% of girls of that age-group
were enrolled in secondary schools. Secondary enrollment has been expanding
rapidly over the past ten years; it grew from 2,390 in 1965 to 16,198 in 1975.
During the last three years for which complete statistics are available (1972-
1975) enrollment grew by about 52% from 10,664 to 16,198.
13.       The pressure for expanding junior secondary is very strong; the
Government has accepted this expansion, and in accordance with the recommend-
ation of the National Education Commission, it is now Government policy to



APPENDIX II
Page 4
include a three-year post-primary education as part of the basic 10-year
education package which the Government plans to provide by the turn of the
century.  However, the Government intends to control expansion at the senior
secondary level; enrollments at that level and in higher education institu-
tions are geared to manpower requirements.
14.       The secondary school curriculum which hitherto had a strong academic
bias is being revised to include science and practical subjects such as
agriculture, industrial arts and domestic science. These subjects are being
introduced in some schools and with Bank Group assistance, an increasing
number of schools is being provided with workshops and appropriate equipment
for the teaching of practical subjects.
15.       As with primary education, shortage of qualified teachers, espe-
cially for science, mathematics and practical subjects constitutes the main
constraint for the expansion, diversification and upgrading of secondary
education. In 1975 there were a total of 737 teachers of which 520 (71%) were
qualified. Of the 520 qualified teachers, 210 were Swazi citizens, most of
whom were qualified to teach only at the junior secondary level. The problem
is even more acute with respect to practical subjects. The Swaziland College
of Technology, the only institution training practical subjects teachers, is
producing only a handful of teachers (about 5 a year). Unless immediate
action is taken to increase substantially SCOT's output (to 20 a year), the
Government's efforts to introduce science and practical subjects in secondary
education will obviously be thwarted.
Technician and Vocational Training
16.       The Swaziland College of Technology (SCOT) offers a variety of
courses of 1 to 2-1/2 years duration in electrical technology, motor mechanics,
fitting and turning. It also provides training in carpentry, sheetmetal and
building technology. SCOT also provides three-year (post-secondary) programs,
one year of which is on-the-job, in mechanical engineering, agricultural
mechanics, drafting, communications and electricity. The first Bank Group
education project provides assistance to SCOT for the improvement and expan-
sion of the technician and vocational training capability of SCOT.
Commercial and Administrative
17.       SCOT operates training programs in typing, shorthand, bookkeeping
and in related commercial fields. The Staff Training Institute provides
pre-service as well as in-service courses for civil servants.
18.       In addition to the above courses, there are specialized pre-service
and in-service courses offered by a number of Ministries and by private and
public agencies. The Ministry of Health administers three-year nursing train-
ing programs and plans to introduce courses for health inspectors and health
assistants. The Ministry of Works offers in-service training in construction
and communications.



APPENDIX II
Page 5
Teacher Training
19.       Primary and Iunior secondary teacher training is provided by
Willian Pitcher College in Manzini and by a mission-affiliated institution,
the Nazarene Teacher Training College. The University of Botswana and
Swaziland (UBS) offers degree and diploma courses primarily for high school
teachers. The output from William Pitcher in 1976 was 60, but the number will
go up to 90 a year beginning in 1980. About 100 prospective teachers are en-
rolled in the various teacher training programs at UBS. UBS is expected to
graduate about 460 secondary teachers between 1976 and 1985. A new primary
teacher college with enrollment of about 400 is planned.
20.       Teacher training is provided by UBS in agriculture, by SCOT in prac-
tical subjects and William Pitcher in home economics. The number of practical
subject teachers being trained at SCOT is inadequate in view of the Govern-
ment's efforts to diversify the junior secondary curriculum. The Government
is studying proposals for increasing SCOT's output of practical teachers, on
a crash basis to meet the acute need for practical subject teachers.
University Education
21.       In 1975 Lesotho withdrew from the tri-national University of
Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland to form its own national university. Botswana
and Swaziland, however, are maintaining a joint university, although the
university's draft ten-year development envisions the formation of separate
university institutions in the two countries. Some modifications to the draft
are envisaged on completion of the ongoing Government manpower survey.
22.       Enrollment in 1976 was 563, of which 169 were non-Swazis, including
about 100 from Botswana. It is generally accepted that university expansion
will be geared to the country's manpower requirements. According to the ten-
year development plan referred to above, enrollment on the Swaziland campus
will grow modestly from 563 in 1976 to 886 in 1981, and 1013 in 1986. Further,
it is expected that the largest growth will take place in science and in the
faculty of economics and social studies, which offers the "content courses" for
education students.
23.       One of the major problems the University has faced in the past has
been its high recurrent unit cost (estimated at E 2,600 in 1975). The
University's low enrollment contributes to this high unit costs. A number of
cost-reducing measures directed at lowering the recurrent cost and at improv-
ing the University's internal efficiency are being introduced.
Non-Formal Education
24.       Swaziland has an extensive network of non-formal educational programs.
However, lack of proper coordination has greatly reduced the cumulative impact
of those programs. There is a Rural Development Council, consisting of repre-
sentatives of the various ministries concerned with non-formal, adult education,
but the ability of the Council to effect real interministerial cooperation
appears to be somewhat limited.



APPENDIX II
Page 6
25.       The following is a partial list of the principal agencies in non-
formal, adult education:
Ministry of Agriculture  : Farmer Training Centers
Training of Extension workers
Ministry of Education    : Rural Education Centers (under construc-
tion)
International Education Center
Evening Classes in some schools and at
the University
Ministry of Commerce      : Cooperative Movement
Handicrafts Development
Ministry of Local
Administration          : Sabenta Literacy Institute
Low-Cost Housing Project
Youth Center Courses
Missions                  : Lutheran Agricultural Management Training
Encamberi Mission
St. Joseph's Mission (handicrafts)
St. Philip's Mission (handicrafts)
26.       The Ministry of Agriculture provides an extension service which ad-
vises on livestock, crop production and veterinary, domestic science and nutri-
tional services. The service constitutes one of the largest bodies of people
working in non-formal education in the country. In addition to field staff,
there are supporting specialists in crop production, horticulture, grain stor-
age, irrigation, mechanization and soil testing.
27.       The Ministry of Education conducts evening classes for adults wish-
ing to make good deficiencies in their formal schooling. The Ministry is also
responsible for the Swaziland International Education Center. This center,
funded by DANIDA, is the correspondence college for the country, at present
concentrating on Junior Certificate subjects. In addition to correspondence
courses, the college has limited,radio time and it also offers some face-to-
face instruction through study centers in Mbabane and Manzini in residential
courses. The Center also offers a fully residential course to prepare stu-
dents for the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate. Those admitted are
people who need only one or two subjects to complete a full certificate, and
they are given an intensive nine-month course. A third program is a voca-
tional course in woodwork. This is organized on a "sandwich" basis, four
months in the Center, four months in industry and four months back in the
Center.
28.       An important development ia non-formal education is the phased open-
ing of the Rural Education Centers provided under the first Bank Group project.



APPENDIX II
Page 7
These will be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, but
they will act as a focus for all non-formal adult education within their
respective catchment areas. Their program will be based on community needs
for adults and youths, with special emphasis on the manual skills required
by rural dwellers.
29.       The Ministry of Commerce is responsible for the development of the
cooperative movement. It operates a training center for officials in coop-
eratives, which was built with Swedish Government assistance. The Ministry
has five full-time officers in each of the four administrative districts of
the country. There are 87 cooperatives, of which 28 are savings and credit
unions and 47 are farmers' cooperatives. The expansion of the handicrafts
industry is also being undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce. A training
center has been established by the Government of the Republic of China and
instructions is provided in ceramics, soapstone carving, leatherwork, and
wood carving. There are about five students in each subject, and boarding
facilities have been built near the Center. It is proposed to expand the
work of the Center through the construction of more workshops.
30.       The Ministry of Local Administration operates the Sabenta National
Institute, the organization responsible for literacy work throughout the
country. The national literacy rate for adults is currently estimated at
about 50%, and it is hoped to have eliminated illiteracy by the early 1980's.
The Sabenta Institute is responsible for all the operations associated with
literacy, that is prime production, the training of staff, administration
and supervision of classes and the provision of follow-up material. About
1,000 groups are formed annually, each with the average of 11 to 12 students.
The duration of classes is normally between 5 and 6 months, and there is a
remarkably small dropout rate. At the conclusion of a course, each group
is given a small library of books. The Institute has a modest printing
facility and produces posters and charts both for use in its own classes and
for educational activities sponsored by other agencies. It also has a small
film and photographic department. Community Development is a concern of the
same Ministry. There are 29 field officers whose task is to help villages
to solve their immediate problems through the encouragement of self-help
schemes.
31.       A new feature of non-formal education is the "Women in Development"
scheme, which is being launched with UNDP technical assistance. The scheme
has just been initiated and it is not yet possible to state how it will
develop, and what its main thrust will be. Clearly there is a great need
for advancing the opportunities for girls and women in Swaziland so that
they may be more actively involved in the processes of development in the
country.

Note:  The main assumptions in the Ministry's projections (e.g., a 6% rate of teacher wastage and the opening of a
new Primary Teacher College in 1980) were retained. However, the teacheristudent ratio was increased to 1:40
after 1978, and the upgrading of underqualified teachers through in-service programs was continued at 150 per
year after 1981.
