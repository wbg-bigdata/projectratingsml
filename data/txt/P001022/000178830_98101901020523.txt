PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the First Highway
Project for which Credit 596-GUI was signed on December 23, 1975 in the
sum of US$ 14.0 million. The Credit was fully disbursed and closed on
June 30, 1980.
The PCR was prepared by the West Africa region following a
mission in April 1980 and incorporates comments received from Government
officials on a first draft.
The PCR was not audited by the Operations Evaluation Department
in accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting approved by the Executive Directors.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on November
23, 1982. No comments had been received by February 7, 1983.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of Guinea and
the project staff met during the preparation of this report is gratefully
acknowledged.

Highlights
i.        The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate and ensure continued
maintenance of Guinea's priority road network. The project provided for
rehabilitation of existing equipment and workshops, the purchase of equip-
ment, spare parts, supplies and materials needed for a road maintenance and
rehabilitation program and for technical assistance for project implementa-
tion, training, and preparation of a follow-up program.
ii.        The project was successful.  About 86% of the 2491 km of project
roads were maintained or rehabilitated, which is remarkable under a first
highway project in a difficult environment where no road maintenance had
taken place for a decade. However, the 900 km of paved roads were patched
only instead of given full surface treatment. The gravel roads were re-
habilitated (930 km, of which 744 km regravelled) or graded (300 km).  The
start of project implementation was delayed by about 20 months; after a
difficult start-up period, the project crews had excellent outputs by West
Africa standards and the Government performance was outstanding for 2 years;
difficulties developed the third year with considerable diversion of equip-
ment to non-project uses. The project achieved the estimated rate of return
of over 100% and a benefit cost ratio of 4.6.
iii.       The following points may be of particular interest:
(a) the 10% of spare parts foreseen underestimated needs;
27% were actually used (para 3.10)
(b) the costly substitution of a patching unit for a re-
sealing unit (para 3.12)
(c) the staff commitment to the project, resulting in
high brigades output (para 3.16) and equipment use
ratios (para 3.17)
(d)  the wide variations in Government's performance
(para 4.02)
(e) the positive effect of the project on road users
(para 5.05)






PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Guinea's transport system comprises about 14,000 km of classified
roads (of which about 1,100 km are paved), 1,100 km of railways, two deep
water ports and ten airfields. Following the construction of the 600 km rail-
way between Conakry, Mamou and Kankan 70 years ago, this has been the main
transport artery of the country; the remaining three railway lines link the
coast with mining developments.
1.02      The Government has, in the past, been particularly concerned with
the mining sector and this has considerably influenced the transport policy,
with efforts concentrated on developing rail and road links from the interior
to the country's two principal ports. Attention was also given to upgrading
key secondary roads feeding the Conakry-Mamou axis. In contrast, insufficient
efforts were given to preservation of the remaining road network, which is
vital to the exploitation of the country's rich agricultural potential.
1.03      Under the last Five Year Plan (FYs 1974-1978), the Government put
greater emphasis on agricultural development, including rehabilitation and
maintenance of roads serving agricultural areas. While practically no roads
have been paved since 1975, the gravel road network has been upgraded, parti-
cularly under the First Highway Project and the classified network increased
by 700 km.
1.04      The Credit (No. 596-GUI) for US$14 million, signed on December 24,
1975, was the first Bank transport operation in Guinea since 1968 which was not
related to mining. Earlier Bank projects in the transport sector made provision
for extensive port and rail infrastructure needed for the Boke bauxite project
in the northwest. The Second Highway Project (Credit 953-GUI), signed in 1979,
continues rehabilitation work carried out under the First Project through pro-
vision of further equipment, training and technical assistance to build up the
maintenance capability which will be needed after its completion.
1.05      The main sources of information for the present report are documents
produced by consultants who assisted in preparing and implementing the project
and Bank supervision missions.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Preparation
2.01      In 1966, a firm of French consultants was commissioned by the Government
to carry out studies of highway organization and the feasibility of constructing
a road from Kissidougou and N'Zerekore to the Liberian border. The highway organi-
zation study, financed by UNDP with the Bank acting as executing agency, explored
in particular maintenance organization, labor, work methods and equipment and
examined the need to rehabilitate the road network. The report was published in
1969 and in 1970 the Bank held discussions with the Government and indicated its



interest in financing a road maintenance project. At that time, the Government
did not attach a high priority to road maintenance and so declined the proposal,
preferring to construct the Kissidougou-N'Zerekore road, of which only the 85 km
section from Kissidougou to Gueckedou was paved.
2.02      By 1974, the Government had decided to put more emphasis on agriculture
and in view of the continuing and rapid deterioration of the road network, it
began to reconsider its position. Meanwhile, a Bank Transport Sector Paper, pro-
duced in July 1974 and based on the findings of an economic mission, concluded
also that the principal problem in the highway sector was inadequate road mainte-
nance. It recommended a pilot maintenance project in one region of the country
and the provision of equipment and spare parts for maintenance of roads of highest
priority.
2.03      A preparation mission visited Guinea in September 1974 and confirmed
the findings of the consultant study that poor maintenance resulted from lack of
equipment, spare parts, and repair workshops as well as from inefficient mainte-
nance organization. The mission proposed a two-phase strategy: a first project
which would provide financing for restoration and maintenance of priority roads
and strengthening of the Government's maintenance capacity and subsequently a
second project to extend these efforts to cover the entire road network.
2.04      The outline proposal submitted by the preparation mission was accepted
by the Government which then formally requested Bank assistance in December 1974.
In January 1975, two consultants, chosen and financed by the Bank and approved by
the Government, each visited Guinea for two months. They produced detaiLed
recommendations of organizational changes based on the 1969 highway organization
study. They also defined the roads to be rehabilitated and maintained under the
project, equipment and training requirements and means of improving maintenance
operations.
B. Appraisal, Negotiations and Anticipated Cost
2.05      A mission comprising two Bank employees and one consultant appraised
the project in May/June 1975. Limited availability of IDA funds and the Govern-
ment's reluctance to accept cofinancing meant that the scope of the project had
to be reduced from that originally proposed. The total length of roads to be
rehabilitated and maintained was reduced from 3,500 km to 2,500 km, decreasing
the total cost from $22.6 million to $18.6 million, with a foreign exchange cost
of US$14.0 million financed by IDA. The reduced project was considered t:o have
the advantage of delaying the arrival of certain equipment before the maintenance
organization was improved sufficiently. Somewhat reluctantly, the Government
accepted this reduction and also agreed to finance all local costs.
2.06      A key issue focused on whether the political and administrativet climate
in Guinea would permit successful implementation of the project. A particular
risk was that the equipment would be used to upgrade rather than rehabilitate
roads, or for other purposes. The risks were, however, considered justifiable in
view of the country's economic difficulties at the time, of assurances made by
the Government and its desire to have Bank assistance on a potentially worthwhile
project of this kind.



- 3 -
2.07      After the return of the appraisal mission in June 1975, a new Minister
of Public Works was appointed who requested changes in the list of roads to be
covered by the project. Supplementary studies and discussions followed, although
no slippage occurred in processing the project. Negotiations were held in Decenber
1975 and full agreement was reached without the need for special covenants or
conditions of effectiveness. The Government assured the Bank that all equipment
provided would be used solely for the Project until its completion, and thereafter
for maintenance and rehabilitation and not for heavy earthworks (Section 3.03 of
Credit Agreement). The Government also agreed to limit vehicle dimensions, weights
and speeds (Section 4.03).
2.08      The Bank insisted on the appointment of consultants to advise and assist
the Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DPC) in carrying out the project. The
Government agreed, somewhat reluctantly because of its wariness about foreigners
in its ministries, and selected consultants according to the Bank guidelines and
on the basis of mutually agreed terms of reference.
2.09      In retrospect, one key to the success of the project was the work done
at preparation and appraisal phases and its concentration on the right issues:
smooth introduction of road maintenance which allowed the road users and the local
authorities to witness its beneficial effects and to push for extension; monitoring
of the use of equipment which ensured that project use was given priority over
other uses and appointment of consultants whose help was fruitful and let the way
to the continuance of foreign expertise which was and is still needed. It is
doubtful, however, whether more frequent contacts with Government officials might
have avoided some of the subsequent requests for changes during the start-up period,
since these came from top-level Government.
C. Objectives
2.10      The ultimate goal of the project was to permit and encourage the deve-
lopment of the agricultural sector in Guinea, which was being impeded, inter alia,
by deterioration of the road network. To achieve this end it was necessary to
rehabilitate and ensure continued maintenance of the road network. This project
represented the first phase of a long-range program and included provision for
institution building as a preparation for the subsequent project and for eventual
self-sufficiency in maintenance operations. The quantifiable objectives of the
project were to rehabilitate as needed and begin maintenance of 2,491 km of roads
and to train 90 mechanics and 45 equipment operators, who would afterwards work in
the Ministry.
2.11      It is not known to what extent the ultimate Roal, to encourage Agricllitural
development, was achieved. Overriding factors such as overall economic conditions
and inadequate agricultural prices and marketing system prevented overall increased
production. In 1980, however, traffic or. the improved gravel roads was about
double the expected levels and the road users were beginning to benefit directly
from reduced transport costs. All other objectives were achieved, albeit not 100%
of the quantified ones; especially below target were the routine maintenance
operations.

D. Project Description
2.12      The project consisted of a three-year program for rehabilitat:ion and
initiation of maintenance on 2,491 km of high priority roads and includesd the
following componernts:
(a)  repair of existing equipment, plant and rehabilitation oE work-
shops;
(b) provision of (i) highway equipment and spare parts, (ii) workshop
equipment and tools, (iii) equipment for engineering and labora-
tory work and training material, (iv) radio equipment, and (v)
other materials and supplies necessary for the project; and
(c) 264 man-months technical assistance to the Directorate of Roads
and Bridges (DPC) for (i) implementation of rehabilitation and
maintenance program, (ii) training of mechanics and equipment
operators, and (iii) preparation of a second phase program.
ITI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
A. Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      The Credit Agreement was signed December 24, 1975 and was to be effec-
tive by March 24, 1976; actual effectiveness took place March 19, 1976. No
special condition of effectiveness was required. The provision of $150,000 for
retroactive financing of technical assistance had not been used because of delays
in project start-up.
3.02      Road maintenance and rehabilitation operations actually started in
November 1977. During this unusually long start-up period (20 months), several
special problems developed and were solved. They were due mainly to the fact
that the project was one of the first World Bank Group projects to follow a
15-year absence of foreign assistance to the Guinean economy outside the mining
sector.
3.03      The first special problem occurred in May 1976 when the Government sub-
initted draft bidding documents for equipment procurement with major changes in the
list of equipment to include heavy earthwork equipment. The Association sent a
special mission at once to discuss the issue. On June 2, 1976, the Government
and the Association agreed on a new list of equipment to be purchased, only 8%
costlier than the appraisal list, and to increase the amount allocated for equip-
ment under the Credit from US$5.1 million to US$5.5 million. No heavy earthwork
equipment was included and changes were minor, except for the following: 5 vibratory
compactors substituted for 10 pneumatic compactors; one asphalt distributor truck
instead of two; four hydraulic excavators instead of one and an addition of five
flat bed trucks.
3.04      On July 31, 1976 a special high-level mission delivered a letter, again
requesting major changes in the project in order to procure more equipment,
to include the whole network in the project, to remove the foreign technical assis-
tance and to involve the Pouvoirs Revolutionnaires Locaux (PRL) in road maintenance.



-5-
After the Association replied indicating it was prepared to agree to the revisions
but that they would necessitate a reappraisal and cause some delay, the Government
decided by letter of September 30, 1976, to continue with the project as negotiated
with minor modifications to procure hand tools for the PRL to allow them to parti-
cipate in road maintenance operations.
3.05      The second special problem arose from a decision at a political meeting
on October 29, 1976, to trigger an emergency road rehabilitation operation. As the
state of the road network had deteriorated significantly after the rainy season,
it was decided to use all available means--Ministry of Public Works (MPW) staff
including office clerks and PRL volunteers--to carry out emergency rehabilitation
of about 2,200 km of roads. The works started at the end of November 1976 and
ended in April 1977. They were carried out on an emergency basis and no record
of expenses was kept. Road network improvement was spectacular during the dry
season, but was washed out by the next rainy season as the materials used were not
suitable and no drainage provisions had been made. The Association did not dis-
burse for these works since the Government could not present any accounts or records.
Inasmuch as a supervision mission had cautioned that the works as being carried
out would not endure, the experience proved a good learning experience and encouraged
better performance in the future.
3.06      The last problem was a substantial delay in workshop rehabilitation.
Although the Government had agreed at negotiations to undertake immediately the
necessary preparations for rehabilitating and equipping the main Conakry workshop,
actual work did not start until June 1977. Work took one year to complete, thus
delaying the rehabilitation of existing and the employment of new equipment until
after September 1977 when a part of the workshop had been put in temporary working
order.  Contrary to what wasforeseen at the appraisal stage, it was decided, with
Association approval, to set up a new central workshop in Conakry instead of reha-
bilitating the old one.   The Government, after having called for bids which were
too expensive, decided to carry out the civil works on the four workshops under
the project by force account.
3.07      The positive aspects of the project start-up period, such as the early
mobilization of an effective Guinean team working closely with the Association
staff, did little to mitigate these major problems which delayed the commencement
of physical works.
B. Procurement
3.08      Following the delays in reaching agreement on an equipment list, bids for
equipment procurement were opened on November 4, 1976, about three months behind
schedule. The bidders were asked to lengthen the bid validity period. Contracts
were awarded in January 1977. Most of the equipment was delivered by July 1977 and
had to be stored for a few weeks awaiting the setting up of minimal workshop facil-
ities to maintain them.
3.09      The borrower had no difficulty following the Association's guidelines
on procurement. Bidding documents were well prepared; the bids were evaluated
and analyzed comprehensively by a 12-man tender board representing the Ministry
of Public Works, various other Government agencies and the consultants. The
lowest evaluated bids were accepted consistently. Only a few difficulties occurred.



One supplier requested a letter of credit before shipping the equipment which
delayed delivery of patching equipment until February 1978. Spare parts delivery
by one supplier was slow which delayed equipment repair and the probleim was aggra-
vated by the low stock level of spare parts kept in the Conakry workshop. Twenty
percent of the spare parts were procured locally and paid for in Sylis.
3.10      Under Category 1 of the Credit, $5,294,500 was spent for equipment pro-
curement and $1,429,500 or 27% for tires, batteries and spare parts. This
expenditure for spare parts is normal and the appraisal allowance of 10% under-
estimated needs.
3.11      Procurement of radio equipment was first cancelled and then r:ransferred
to the Second Highway Project, because Guinean regulations forbid its use in
general, and because the MPW did not consider the matter to be of sufficient priority
to warrant pursuit of a special permit at that time.
C. Rehabilitation and Maintenance of High Priority Roads
Paved Roads
3.12      Of the 1,046 km of paved roads included in the program, 405 km were to
be rehabilitated by either an asphalt surface treatment or asphalt resurfacing.
AAlthough the rehabilitation program was later reduced to 100 km of surface treatment,
even this was not carried out and only about 200 km had drainage structure improved.
The resealing unit that was to carry out surface treatment works was not constituted
because the asphalt distributor ordered and delivered under the project was not
equipped with a heater to use cut-back bitumen necessary for this type of work and
had not been modified before project funds were exhausted. As a result the intended
resealing unit was replaced by a patching unit which proved an insufficient and
costly substitute for the resurfacing intended. The impact of the project on paved
roads was less than expected.
3.13      Three to five brigades carried out patching works on about 800 km of
rural roads and 100 km of streets. They patched at least twice urban roads in
Conakry (although these were not included in the project), Faranah and the worst
sections of Conakry-Kindia, Kindia-Mamou, Mamou-Labe and Mamou-Faranah; Faranah-
Kissidougou and Coyah-Forecariah sections were patched once. The brigades used
about 6,000 m3 of screened laterite aggregates and 800 tons of bitumen, and a con-
crete mixer to prepare the cold mix. The output was good: 150,000 m2 were patched.
In contrast, the patching was in general of inferior quality because of poor
materials, the absence of compaction and the carrying out of the works under rain.
On some sections, potholes reappeared on previously patched spots after the rainy
season.  It was also realized that 190 km of roads included in the progra; built
more recently, did, in fact, need no work.
3.14      A chip screening and washing station for the production of materials for
resealing and patching works was first installed at Kolente between Kindia and
Mamou and thereafter moved to Faranah. It produced a total of about 13,000 m3 of
materials, well under its nominal capability, because of operational difficulties,
inexperienced staff, shortages in fuel supply and lack of working stock equipment.



-7-
Gravel Roads
3.15      The project called for reshaping, regravelling and improvement of
drainage on 1,445 km of roads, 270 km of which were also to be rehabilitated to
the extent of some alignment and grade corrections but exclusive of heavy earth-
works. Five regravelling units began the rehabilitation of the laterite roads in
November 1977, one year later than scheduled. During the first season, execution
of the work steadily improved. As of June 1978, about 390 km were completed by
rehabilitation and 60 km started. In early 1979, with the Association agreeing
"a posteriori", four of the five units were regrouped into two heavy brigades,
which allowed more flexibility for the use of equipment and reduced the drop in
output when one critical piece of equipment was out of order. Tn the second year
of the project, 370 km were rehabilitated. As of February 1980, 170 additional
kilometers were rehabilitated bringing the total to 930 km. Furthermore, a total
of 300 km were graded. Brigades carried out the rehabilitation of the following
project roads:  Dubreka-Kolaboui, 188 km out of 213 km; Mamou-Dabola-Kankan, 256 km
out of 410 km; Kankan-N'Zerekore, 384 km; and Gueckedou-Macenta-N'Zerekore, 100 km
out of 243 km. The rehabilitation of the remaining sections of these roads and
Macenta-Konsan Koro, 100 km and N'Zerekore-Liberian border, 95 km, were transferred
to the Second Highway Project. Of the 930 km rehabilitated by reshaping the road
to a 6-m width and grading, about 80% were regravelled by a 12 to 15 cm layer of
laterite and less than 5% have undergone alignment and grade corrections. Thus in
all, about 85% of the estimated work was achieved to acceptable standards, which
is remarkable, given the fact that the brigades' outputs were overestimated at
appraisal.
3.16      NPW staff carried out the works with enthusiasm, working overtime
daily and seven days a week when the brigades were in working order, and producing
an excellent daily output of 0.5 km or 500 m3. Unfortunately, brigade work was
halted on numerous occasions for such causes as: transfers--in particular the trans-
fer of one regravelling brigade from N'Zerekore to Macenta which took two months
because of bridge out of service and could have been avoided; shortages of fuel; and
towards the end of the project, equipment failure. The brigade chiefs placed more
importance on kilometrage than quality, which was uneven: (i) drainage works were
sometimes poor with shallow ditches and few turn-outs downhill; (ii) culverts were
sometimes badly located and with shallow cover; and (iii) compaction did not keep pace
with grading or was sometimes omitted entirely. More field supervision trips by the
consultants might have improved the quality. Overall, in spite of shortcomings,
the work on gravel roads was acceptable and, indeed, remarkable when viewed in the
context of maintenance standards prevailing prior to project implementation. Further
improvements are taking place under the Second Highway Project.
3.17      Equipment was used intensively the first two years, but less so later
when some pieces began to need major repairs. The annual average outputs were:
trucks 35,000 km; wheel-loaders 1,500 h; bulldozers 1,300 h; graders 1,200 h;
vibratory rollers 700 h; and hydraulic excavators 400 h. Except for the hydraulic
excavators and to a lesser extent the vibratory rollers, these outputs were excellent,
well above the usual 700 h for West Africa. The agreed equipment changes were
advantageous except for the one concerning the compactors. It was realized early
during supervision that the project would have worked better with five additional
compactors and all of the pneumatic type rather than vibratory, as the latter are
fragile, need daily maintenance and do not suit force account uses in Africa.



-8-
3.18      A program of rehabilitation or reconstruction of bridges on the Mlamou-
Kankan-N'Zerekore, Macenta Gueckedou and Macenta-Konsan Koro roads was prepared
after stock taking of the needs and preliminary design of some typical bridges.
Works were carried out on only four bridges. Under the Second Highway Project,
the bulk of the works is to be carried out by seven brigades.
3.19      Routine maintenance for the project roads was to be carried out by
subdivision forces. Twenty-one subdivisions and the PRL bordering the roads
were provided with trucks and small hand tools for carrying out ditch clearing and
vegetation cutting by labor-intensive methods (cantonnage). The results were
deceiving: only a limited number of subdivisions such as Mamou carried out can-
tonnage with civil servant laborers (cantonniers) regularly. The other subdivisions
claimed they had a limited budget to pay temporary cantonniers and also that nobody
was willing to work for the wage they were allowed to pay--GSy 1500 per month; as
a result of the quasi-absence of routine maintenance, roads deteriorated rapidly
during the rainy season. As maintenance is even more critical under the Second
Highway Project, the Government is considering introducing a production--related
salary system for cantonniers.
D. Training
3.20      Under the project 90 mechanics and 45 equipment operators were expected
to be trained for MPW. The training center in Conakry began training mechanics for
the project in June 1977: 14 mechanics were trained the first year, 13 the second
and 12 the third. These low annual outputs (representing only 25% of the appraisal
estimate) were due to the extended duration of the training--much longer than fore-
seen because of the trainees' low level of education. Based upon this experience
MPW decided the third year to hire at the much higher level of education of "Brevet
d'Enseignement Superieur", plus 3 years of practice. In order to focus training on
the main center in Conakry, the training center in N'Zerekore was not opened. No
formal training for equipment operators was implemented, but both MPW equipment
operators and mechanics were carefully selected and received on-the-job training.
More than 500 staff were employed under the project and on-the-job training proved
effective. The brigades are now working well, completely manned by Guineans,
E. Implementation Schedule
3.21      By December 1978, the original target completion date, only about 35% of
the appraisal physical targets were completed. The delay was due mainly to slow
start-up; one supplementary year should have been included for procurement and pre-
paration of project implementation. By June 1980, 70% of the targets were completed
and the credit fully disbursed. The appraisal team overestimated by about 30% the
overall output of the brigades, despite the excellent production rate achieved by
them.
F. Reporting
3.22      The MPW reported very well from the beginning of the project to mid-1979.
During this period, the inception report and the quarterly progress reports were
received on time. They were comprehensive and whenever the need arose, were comple-
mented or updated by letter or cables. Good reporting stopped mid-1979 with progress
report No. 8 and no more were received. Also beginning around mid-1979, some
changes to the project schedule were decided without informing the Association before-
hand. Most of the changes produced problems



-9-
which would have been minimized had the Association been informed in time. A
completion report prepared by the consultants was submitted to a supervision
mission in draft form only.
G. Costs
3.23      The project cost was estimated at $18.7 million, however, about $22
million would have been needed to complete the execution, which is continuing
under the Second Highway Project. Resulting from variations in unit prices and
increases in the number of units procured, the cost of highway equipment was
underestimated by about $1 million. Inasmuch as the 10% spare parts allocation
for new equipment proved insufficient, 27% of the original equipment cost was
used; this was, however, partly compensated by the deletion of parts for repair-
ing existing equipment and lower expenses for shop equipment and miscellaneous
tools. The net increase in equipment, parts and tools cost was about $400,000.
In addition, the unit cost of technical assistance was underestimated by almost
50%, the actual cost amounting to about $11,160 per man-month, in line with rates
under other similar projects. Although the project estimated 264 man-months at
about $2 million, in effect, 224 man-months had been provided at a cost of $2.5
million by November 1979 when technical assistance financing was transferred to
the Second Highway Project. Materials and supplies for the brigades were esti-
mated at $5.4 million; but while the funds available enabled purchases totalling
$6 million, an additional $1 million would have been required to complete the
program. Thus there was an overrun on the order of 30%, partly due to procure-
ment delays during an inflationary period. Skilled and unskilled labor was
estimated at $3.7 million, whereas only $2.8 million was actually spent on wages
resulting from the fact that routine maintenance was not carried out. The
Government also spent the amount foreseen, which, as it contributed more towards
materials and supplies, helped to offset the lower contribution to routine
maintenance. Foreseen and actual costs for the reduced project are shown in
Table 1.
H. Disbursements
3.24      By July 1977, only 20% of the expected disbursements were made, reflect-
ing the slow procurement process; however, there was a steady flow thereafter
(Table 2). Final disbursement was made on July 2, 1980, one year later than the
expected credit closing date of June 30, 1979. Disbursements from the Credit on
each category are shown in Table 1.
I. Performance of Consultants and Suppliers
3.25      The joint venture of consulting firms providing technical assistance
performed well in an environment previously closed to foreign experts. After a
difficult start and a change of mission chiefs, the team of consultants func-
tioned satisfactorily and established good relationships with Guinean counterparts
and officials. With the Government, it prepared the inception report which pro-
vided a good basis for the project. From 1976 to early 1979, it recommended
improvements in the project structure to assist the brigades in carrying out the
works, advised Government officials adequately and prepared quarterly progress
reports; those shortcomings experienced were related mostly to poor traffic counts
and weak economic justifications. Around mid-1979, the consultants' work
deteriorated: field supervision slackened, written reports and recommendations
appeared to become scarce and the smooth relationship with the Government became
less effective, with fewer of the consultants' recommendations implemented. Sub-
sequently the consultants carried out a study which served as a basis for the



- 10 -
Second Highway Project and were retained for its implementation. They are still
the only expatriates in MPW.
3.26      Under the Project, 224 man-months were provided, less than the foreseen
264 despite a longer implementation period. This modification was due to a
sharp reduction in the duration of the bridge engineer position (2 man-months in-
stead of 30) and of equipment and shop specialist and mechanics positions (77 man-
months instead of 96).
3.27      Suppliers' performance was, in general, good.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFOR}ANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
4.01      Few institution-building issues were addressed, but priority was given
to the build-up and execution of actual maintenance and rehabilitation work.
The project was carried out through a Project Directorate which basically worked
independently from the 31 subdivisions. The Project Directorate concept worked
very effectively and is continuing under the Second Project, in the course of which
the Directorate will gradually be integrated into the Ministry.
A. Management and Organizational Effectiveness
4.02      After start-up problems were solved, MPW performance became outstanding
for two years: the Minister, the project team and the consultants had established
good mutual working relationships and managed to get the best out of the equipment
and to dramatically improve the main gravel roads. Actions were planned and
decisions made after careful study; priority was given to the most efficient pro-
cedures. A constant dialogue between professionals at project management level,
consultants and MPW officials was fruitful.  Confidence was also built among
suppliers, however, difficulties developed the third year (1979). Regrouping of
regravelling units in heavy brigades, transference of brigades and rehabilitation
of non-project roads did little to improve efficiency, output and quality of work,
but rather had the effect of delaying project completion. Thereafter, under the
Second Highway Project, MPW performance improved.
4.C)3     The leading weaknesses were possibly:  (a)  emphasis on quantity rather
than quality; (b) delayed repair works, which reduced the effective fleet, and
were directly related to the lack of a good stock-ordering system; and (c) admini-
strative delays in purchasing fuels, materials, and spare parts (which sometimes
halted works), in presenting disbursement requests to the Association and in pay-
ing wages and bonuses. The weaknesses are being corrected under the Second Highway
Project, and were in retrospect of limited significance when viewed in the context
of project achievement.
B. Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
4.04      From 1975 to 1979, the MPW staff increased from 2,000 to 3,000.  Of
these, 18% or 540 were occupied in carrying out the project. Equipment operators
and mechanics were only partly trained at Conakry, but acquired good training and



- 11 -
experience on-the-job and were integrated into effective brigades. Guinean
brigade chiefs also acquired more experience and by the end of the project
carried on successfully without expatriate counterparts. The turnover of MPW
employees was low; the project manager and MPW professioals kept their posi-
tions throughout the project period.
4.05      Project staff received a special bonus:  they were fed at the site.
This factor was probably more important than receiving wages on time and proved
an effective incentive to overtime work, as well as ensuring a well-nourished
staff. Sometimes, however, food supplies were scarce or late. One of the
reasons why cantonnage failed was that such a bonus had not given to subdivision
staff and few people were prepared to work for the regular daily wage. Under
the Second Highway Project, routine maintenance is being carried out through the
subdivisions with cantonniers paid by task at competitive wages and the reha-
bilitation works continue through the Project Directorate. The FAO program
provides food to the brigades, thus releasing the Government from this responsibility.
C. Covenants
4.06      The Government complied with the axle-load regulation covenant and
issued a decree in 1976 limiting the loads to 5 tons on unpaved roads during the
rainy season and established rain-barriers. This law was not enforced, however.
4.07      The Government complied with the covenant limiting the scope and standards
of road works, and for the most part limited improvement works to the agreed project
roads (Table 3). One brigade did, however, improve in the last year some 30 km not
included in the project, parallel to the railway and to a project road section from
Dabola towards Kouroussa. The administration determined that the appraisal report
map was wrong; the town of Bissikrima was shown on the south section, whereas the
town should have been on the north section. Subsequently the Government opted to
improve both alignments. In fact, it appears that two equally influential towns,
one on each alignment, wanted the expected long distance traffic business the
improved road would provide. The south section corresponded to the most justified
alignment.
4.08      Despite the covenant that the use of equipment was to be limited to project
works, it is apparent the trucks were also used for carrying agricultural produce after
the brigade working day was over. While the brigade output was not directly affected
by this diversion and there was no apparent misuse of fuel stocks, the practice did
result in the deterioration of vehicles at a faster than expected rate. Trucks
supplied for routine maintenance were additionally used for non-project transport
needs. Given the scarcity of trucks at the time, it is difficult to say which use
was the most economical in the country context rather than in the project-only con-
text. In the long term, however, lack of routine maintenance is expensive.
4.09      Although systematic traffic counting was scheduled to begin no later
than June 1977, only ad-hoc counts were carried out, mainly by the brigade personnel
(Table 4). Fuel consumption data, which were not available at appraisal, are well-
documented (Table 5) and new estimates of the vehicle fleet have also been made (Table
6).



- 12 -
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      In the appraisal report, the estimated rate of return for the project
was over 100% and the benefit cost ratio was 4.6, at a 12% discount rate. This
very high return was based on the expected extreme deterioration of the network
if the project had not been implemented. The project was therefore expected to
produce very high operating cost savings and to obviate the need for expensive
reconstruction.
51.02     A number of the assumptions which formed the basis of the economic
appraisal now need to be revised, in the light of recent actual information and
the performance during implementation. One significant revision arises from
the shortfall in meeting production targets: of the 1,046 km of paved roads to
be improved in the original program, 190 km did in fact not need any works
because they are of recent origin; 800 km were patched, one or two times, and
the 400 km of resurfacing were not done; 100 km of city streets, not all origi-
nally included, were also patched. Of the 1,445 km of gravel roads to be
rehabilitated, 930 were rehabilitated although to lower standards than foreseen,
and 300 were graded. The improvement costs per km averaged $11,000 for gravel
roads and $3,000 for paved roads, including technical assistance costs.
5.03      Another revision concerns the traffic data.  The 1975 volumes considered
in the appraisal report were based on small samples and now appear to have been
overestimated; conversely, the 3% p.a. growth seems underestimated. The vehicle
fleet would have more than doubled from 1975 to 1979, that is, a 19% annual growth
rate on average, and the fuel consumption statistics show an annual increase of
5% over the same period.  Based on some traffic counts taken from 1977 to 1980,
traffic expected on the paved roads appears to have been overestimated to varying
degrees while traffic expected on the improved gravel roads seems underestimated
by about half (Table 4). The veh-kms benefitting from improved paved roads would
be as expected, however, around 508,000 per day in 1980, as the Conakry streets
carry higher volumes than other paved roads not improved. Assuming an average of
60 vpd, veh-kms per day on improved gravel roads would number about 73,600 or
about 30% more as compared to a projected 57,000 veh-km per day for 1980.
5.04      As a result, the vehicle operating savings need to be revised, too.
Vehicle operating savings per km are somewhat less at 1975 prices given the lower
quality of the improvement. At the same time, operating costs increased more than
general inflation: about 50% for light vehicles and more than 100% for trucks,
between 1975 and 1978. Thus, the expected unit savings at real 1978 values are
at least as much as expected at appraisal (Table 7) and total vehicle operating
savings are anticipated to be higher at least in the first years, tapering off
as the quality of the improvements is lower and economic life shorter. On
balance, and calculated in the same way, the project achieved the expected rates
of return. This expectation is, however, contingent on appropriate road mainte-
nance being carried out routinely.
5.05      In terms of effectiveness, gravel road rehabilitation has had the
greatest impact; the Mamou-Daboula road can be considered as an example. Prior
to the improvement the road was so degraded that maximum possible speed was about
20 kph, thus requiring a whole day for the 150 km trip; the fare per passenger
was GSy 500. Immediately after the rehabilitation in 1979, the fare was reduced
to GSy 200, but increased to GSy 300 in 1980 following fuel price increases; the
trip requires less than 4 hours, allowing the passengers to attend to business



- 13 -
and return the same day. Traffic has more than doubled--which can be accomplished
with the same number of vehicles given the halving of the trip time. Reportedly,
there is still a significant unmet demand because of the lack of vehicles; in Guinea,
at present, there is still only one vehicle per about 270 persons. Thus, motor-
cycle and bicycle traffic has also become increasingly important, even more so as
the road passes a densely populated area with towns at an average distance of 3.6 km,
and despite that a bicycle costs about GSy 10,000 (about 4 times the average farmer's
monthly income) and is difficult to obtain. The railway, which parallels the road,
is only used as a last alternative but is nevertheless congested. There is only
one train per week, which takes 5-6 hours with no possibility of a return trip the
same day; a one-way fare in 1980 cost GSy 94 in third class.
5.06      Passengers are also carried by private transporters who are also making
a net profit. Furthermore, it could be said that the private carriers are com-
petitive, pass on benefits to the direct users, and charge according to costs; on
average in 1980, the fare was about GSy 1, 2 and 4.30 per passenger-km on paved,
good gravel road and unimproved earth roads, respectively. This additional func-
tion was not anticipated at appraisal, when it was envisaged that Government would
be the main beneficiary.
5.07      Unaccompanied freight is, however carried mainly by Government truck.
The Government apparently charges a flat GSy 2.5/ton-km, which has not changed for
some time, but the official agricultural farm gate prices do not vary either by
location or transport costs. Thus, to some extent, Government redistributes bene-
fits from areas near Conakry or with low transport costs to other less favorable
areas; specific road improvement can so delay overall price increases. Furthermore,
gravel road improvements assisted those people dependent on agriculture for a live-
lihood by lowering their cost of transport to local or regional markets, and although
not intended, transport for produce was provided by the project trucks. It is not
known to what extent these improvements may have influenced production.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Objectives and Justification
6.01      The project objectives were the right ones to pursue; the most trafficked,
main network has now been improved, and the Second Highway Project extends the
effort to upgrading the remainder of the main network and to appropriate routine
maintenance. On balance,the project was successful. The expected economic return
will continue to be achieved provided that routine maintenance is carried out on the
improved roads.
Project Content, Implementation and Scheduling
6.02      The appraisal design was adequate in size and complexity, although the
expected outputs were overestimated and operating costs underestimated. There
were few noteworthy problems in implementation, and none intractable, although
the schedule should have allowed more time for start-up period. The Borrower's
implementation capacity was evaluated within an acceptable range.
Covenants and Conditions
6.03      The Bank's pre-agreement requirements were reasonable, and the credit
covenants were appropriate and in general, enforced.   However, axle-load control on
unpaved roads (Section 4.03) was not enforced, and some minor non-compliance could

be observed on other covenants, e.g., the material was not used exclusively for
project roads. These aspects are being monitored under the Second Highway Project.
Bank Supervision and Working Relationship with Government
6.04      The Bank supervision was adequate, with a stable team that had a good
working relationship with the MPW staff and consultants. In the final project
year, however, changes in personnel resulted in relations which were less smooth.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The project was successful; 900 km of paved roads were patched and
1,230 km of gravel roads were improved. The length improved and the standards
achieved, while somewhat less than foreseen, are nevertheless remarkable under a
first highway project in a country where no road maintenance had taken place
for over a decade. Overall, it would rather appear that appraisal expectations
were optimistic.
7.02      Training, especially on-the-job, was very successful as the brigades
now work without expatriates, achieving some of the best results in West Africa.
The expected rate of return of 100% has so far been achieved; for it to continue
adequate routine maintenance will have to be carried out. This aspect is being
followed-up under the Second Highway Project.
