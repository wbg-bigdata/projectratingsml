INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guinea for the equivalent of US$14.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project to rehabilitate
and begin maintenance operations on about 2,500 km of the highest priority
roads.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report (No. AF-63b, dated September 1, 1967)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 22, 1968. Economic
missions visited the country in November 1970, February 1973, and January
1974.  The findings of the latest mission are incorporated below.    Country_
data appear in Annex I.
Economic Structure
3.        Guinea's natural endowments make it potentially one of the richest
countries in West Africa, with substantial resources in the rural sector,
mining and hydroelectric power. Rural potential is very diversified,
reflecting the different climatic conditions throughout the country, which
range from the sub-saharan areas in the north and sub-tropical mountain areas
in the center to the tropical forests in the south. The wide variety of agri-
cultural commodities which can be produced includes such food crops as rice,
cassava and maize and such export crops as coffee, pineapples, palm kernels
and bananas. The country is particularly well suited for rice production and
cattle raising. With respect to mineral resources, Guinea's bauxite deposits
are tentatively estimated at 4-5 billion tons, equivalent to nearly half of
the world's known reserves. High grade iron ore deposits are estimated to
be over one billion tons.
4.        Despite the country's natural resources, economic growth has been
slow, probably not more than an average annual rate of 2.5 percent since
Independence in 1958, or somewhat less than the estimated annual population
growth of 2.8 percent. In 1972, GNP was estimated at US$450 million, popula-
tion at 5.1 million, and per capita income at US$90. Latest estimates show
the continuing predominance of agriculture and related activities in the
country's structure of production. In 1972 the rural sector contributed 49
percent of GDP, mining and manufacturing about 12 percent, public administra-
tion about 17 percent and transportation, construction and other services



the remaining 22 percent. With respect to the distribution of income,
estimates made on the basis of the official 197) census indicate that GNP
per capita might be on the order of US$55 in tlie rural sector and US$315 in
the non-rural sectors.
5.        Since Independence, a comprehensive reorganization of economic
and social activities has been undertaken with a view to building a socialist
economy. This has entailed a sharp curtailment in the role of the private
sector and a corresponding increase in that of the Government, public agencies
and state enterprises. Manufacturing and banking are almost entirely controlled
by state enterprises while mining has been declared a mixed sector, with Gov-
ernment and foreign companies working together. Trade in agricultural and
consumer commodities is de jure Government controlled, but a large parallel
market continues to function outside the official system of price controls
and state trading enterprises. Similarly, despite more than ten years of
effort to introduce cooperative and collective production and marketing
systems throughout the agricultural sector, traditional forms of farm orga-
nization prevail. The emergence of two separate production and marketing
systems, one operating through official channels with controlled prices and
rationing and the other operating through unofficial channels at much higher
price levels, is a major structural weakness of the present Guinean economy.
Economic Objectives
6.        The Government's economic objectives may be viewed in the context
of its development plans, which have emphasised infrastructure, manufacturing
and mining. Over the last ten years, Plan outlays have averaged 15-16 per-
cent of GNP, increasing from some US$53 million per year between 1966 and
1970 to nearly US$70 million during the past three years, when implementation
of the Boke and Kindia bauxite mines resulted in a sharp increase of invest-
ments. These figures include not only public investments per se, but also
private participation in major mining enterprises which might account for
approximately 80 percent of total investment in the country. From May 1964
to September 1971, investments were carried out in the framework of a Seven
Year Plan. On the whole, Plan implementation reached a high 81 percent of
its goals; however, this was due primarily to much higher mining investments
than originally anticipated, which partly resulted from the far greater than
expected costs of the Boke project. Excluding investments in mining, manu-
facturing, and energy (accounting for 47 percent of total Plan outlays), 58
percent of Plan targets were fulfilled. The shortfall was particularly
marked in the rural sector with a fulfillment rate of only 38 percent; this
reduced the share of rural development outlays to 6.9 percent of total Plan
outlays as compared to the original target of 15 percent. Transport and
communications accounted for one-third of total Plan expenditures.



-3-
Performance
7.        The emphasis in the Government's investment strategy on heavy out-
lays in infrastructure, mining and manufacturing, combined with the relative
neglect of agriculture, contributed to serious economic difficulties during
the period of the Seven Year Plan. Expansion and improvement of the infra-
structure of the country did not stimulate rural production which was in-
creasingly hampered by lack of producer incentives. Investment in mining
did not generate a significant rise in mineral output and export during the
Plan time-span, given the long gestation periods of the projects undertaken.
Many new manufacturing plants were set up in the seven years, but production
levels at most of them remained low relative to capacity because of poor
design, lack of local raw materials and unavailability of spare parts. With
declining exports of the country's principal agricultural commodities and
rising import demand, the balance of payments came under substantial pres-
sure.  Heavy foreign borrowing brought debt service obligations to exceptional
levels,which in turn put a drain not only on limited foreign exchange
resources but on government revenues as well.
8.        Guinea's long-term development record has been disappointing, but
there have been marginal improvements in performance over the past three
years. First, inflationary financing of public development outlays has been
sharply curtailed.  As a result, the money supply has increased very
little.  While this has not alterec the fundamental disequilibrium between
demand and supply, at least the situation has not worsened. Second, after
a period of large budget deficits on current accounts in the late 1960s,
current budgetary surpluses were realized in each of the three years 1969/
70 - 1971/72. Third, the performance of public enterprises has somewhat
improved; while their production does not seem to have risen much, their
financial situation has definitely improved, contributing among other things
to a better public finance situation. Fourth, management of the foreign
debt has become more efficient; the considerable short-term debt in the
form of accumulated deficits of bilateral trading accounts has been con-
solidated and the use of supplier credits has declined. As a result,
authorities have regained some margin of maneuver with their foreign re-
sources, and foreign exchange reserves have slightly increased. Fifth,
overall economic management shows signs of improvement as a result of more
and better-qualified local staff. Technical ministries are better staffed,
but still suffer from over-centralization of decision making.
Prospects
9.        These factors have been either too limited or too recent to lead
to tangible changes in the overall economy, which is still seriously de-
pressed. However, the situation is likely to improve substantially over



-4-
the next decade because of sharply expanding mining production which will
bring about sizeable improvements in the country's balance of payments
and public savings.  The situation is all the more favorable as the two
major bauxite projects were completed (Boke in the fall of 1973, Kindia in
mid-1974) before world-wide inflation pushed up investment costs. Exports
from these projects along with a 10 percent increase in alumina output will
alone double the value of exports in constant 1972 prices by the year 1977.
At current prices, total export values in 1977 would be six times as high as
in 1972 (US$350 million compared with US$57 million in 1972). Import prices
during the same period are projected to rise by 75 percent. Looking farther
ahead, prospects for continued growth in mining production and exports are
excellent, and include additional bauxite expansion as well as some 5 million
tons of iron ore annually from Mount Nimba by the early 1980s.
10.       The projected increase in export earnings will permit the Government
much more maneuverability in its balance of payments and public financial
policies. Nevertheless, during the next two or three years the Government
will be constrained by the existing claims of public debt service and trans-
fers associated with the new mining enterprises, which are expected to run
at annual levels of US$60 million and US$70 million respectively. The extent
to which the availability of foreign exchange over and above these amounts
will contribute to real economic development depends very much on the orienta-
tion of public development policies.
11.       In this connection, development of the rural sector would permit--
more than any other strategy--the bulk of Guinea's population to participate
in the expected benefits from mining. At the same time, it would enlarge
the country's production base and make it less dependent on price fluctuations
of minerals. Creation of job opportunities in the rural sector--for which
there is a definite potential in Guinea--would also help slow down rural-
urban migration with all its social and economic problems.
12.       Under the circumstances, except for the possible development of
aluminum transforming industries, medium and long-term rural development
ought to receive top priority in parallel with expansion of mining industries.
Within the rural sector, development of smallholder farming and livestock
herding ought to receive primary attention although some plantation develop-
ment could also be justified, particularly nucleus estates providing extension
services to outgrowers. Such an investment strategy should not exclusively
concentrate on directly productive investments, but should also include im-
provement of rural education, health services and the necessary transport
infrastructure. There is now evidence that the Government is thinking along
these lines and is exploring ways and means to develop the rural economy.
13.       With respect to the fiscal situation, budgetary revenues are
expected to increase very substantially through 1977, owing particularly to
rises in taxes and profit sharing revenues from mining companies as well as to
rising receipts from import duties. Current expenditures are projected to
grow by at least 16 percent annually from 1972-77, considering that there is
a serious need for such increased expenditure, first of all in the rural
sector and for road maintenance throughout the country. With this probably
somewhat conservative expenditure estimate, public savings could attain the



- 5 -
high level of 15 percent of GDP in 1977. However, most of this surplus will be
absorbed by the high public debt service, so that the Government's ability to
finance new development expenditures will remain very limited, including the
increase in maintenance expenditure necessary to keep existing infrastructure
operational.
14.       Similarly the balance of payments is likely to remain under pressure
through 1977. This reflects in part the deterioration in Guinea's terms of
trade, but is due primarly to sharply increasing transfer payments associated
with the recently established mining enterprises, imports in association
with expected new mining investments, and the expected and much-needed rise
in imports of intermediate and consumer goods. During 1972-80, imports are
projected to rise by 20 percent annually in current prices (8 percent in cons-
tant terms). Throughout the period, import demand and debt service and trans-
fer payments will substantially exceed export and other current foreign
exchange receipts and an average annual gross public capital inflow on the
order of US$100 million will be required.
Foreign Assistance, Debt Service and Terms of Lending
15.       Guinea has always received a high amount of foreign aid.    During
1970-72, gross capital inflow averaged about US$55 million per year, or
about US$11 per capita. Until 1970, about 68 percent of that aid came
from centrally planned economies. Large IBRD disbursements for the Boke
project reduced this share to an average of 45 percent in 1970-72. The
bulk of foreign aid was in the form of loans and credits (in part on very
soft terms) while grant aid has been limited. Since the resources necessary
to service debt were not generated, frequent and sizeable debt rescheduling
became inevitable. In mid-1974 Guinea's public debt, outstanding and dis-
bursed, stood at an estimated 120 percent of GNP. Actual debt service pay-
ments in 1974 were over 30 percent of export earnings (Annex I). Considering
that over the next few years, an increasing part of formerly rescheduled debt
will become due, this ratio is likely to decline only marginally to about 25%
by the end of the 1970's in spite of the jump in bauxite revenues.
16.       There is now some evidence of the Government's heightened concern
to improve resource allocation and economic management--both necessary
corollaries of capital assistance if it is to be effective in promoting
development. In view of the deferred debts and notwithstanding the more
favorable prospects for Guinea's export growth and financial position, the
country's ability to service new borrowing is negligible and its credit-
worthiness vis-a-vis private and other lenders is doubtful. Yet Guinea
will still need large gross capital inflows through 1980 to realize its
development potential. In view of the above constraints and Guinea's
low per capita income, assistance ought to be given on highly concessionary
terms and donors should be prepared to finance a proportion of the local
costs of development projects.



- 6 -
17.       An economic mission to re-evaluate the country's situation and
prospects is planned for next spring.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GUINEA
18.       In the past, Bank Group lending to Guinea has included three loans
in the mining sector and, recently, one credit in the agricultural sector.
The three loans were all associated with the Boke bauxite mining project.
The credit was for a pineapple development project.
19.       In 1966, the Bank made a US$1.7 million loan (Sl-GUI) for engineer-
ing studies for infrastructure related to development of the Boke mine. This
loan was absorbed by the 1968 US$64.5 million loan (577-GUI) for construction
of the mining town-site and for port and railway facilities to provide a
transportation system for export of the bauxite. The 1971 US$9.0 million
Boke extension loan (766-GUI) increased the evacuation capacity from the
originally planned 6.6 million tons per annum to 9.2 million tons. The
Bank's project has been completed satisfactorily (about a year behind
schedule) despite two accidents in July 1973 and 1974 which destroyed two
locomotives and a large section of track and hampered full utilization of the
railroad. The mine itself, financed by a consortium of private sponsors with
Government participation, is also complete, although harder than anticipated
bauxite necessitated substantial modifications in the crushing machinery and
a slower than anticipated build-up in bauxite production. An estimated 4.5
million tons of bauxite will be exported this year, up from 700,000 tons last
year.  Despite the delays, the successful completion of the construction phase
of both the mine and the infrastructure has demonstrated the feasibility of
establishing large-scale mining ventures in Guinea.
20.       In June 1975, a development credit of US$7.0 million (569-GUI)
was approved for a pineapple development project. The project consists of
the development of a pineapple estate, assistance to small growers in the
vicinity of the estate and provision for studies and project preparation in
the rice and livestock fields. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
Group operations in Guinea as of November 30, 1975.
21.       The Bank Group's inivolvement in Guinea had until the pineapple
development project been limited to the Boke project. The problems Guinea
has had in sustaining an effective development plan and in managing its
economic affairs, together with its lack of emphasis on the rural sector,
made it difficult to agree on the exact nature of projects to be submitted
to the Bank for financing. Recently, however, there has been some evidence
(para 8) of improvement in fiscal and monetary management, and of opportuni-
ties for development afforded by the increased financial resources expected
during the next few years from mining operations. In addition, Government
has been exploring ways of developing the rural economy. We believe that
these signs of improvement in Government's policies and priorities provide



- 7 -
grounds for Bank Group assistance in sectors directly related to rural deve-
lopment. We began with a small agricultural project, which is so far pro-
gressing satisfactorily, and we propose to continue with a road rehabilitation
and maintenance project, which was appraised following the updating of an
earlier road maintenance study and on which agreement was reached with Govern-
ment in record time. In the light of Guinea's poverty and low per capita
income and the size of its prospective debt service obligations, this assist-
ance should be on IDA terms.
22.       The major constraints impeding rural development are poor sector
planning and a concomitant difficulty in properly preparing projects, weak
institutions, a general lack of technical expertise to implement projects,
and a lack of real assistance to and incentives for producers. The Pineapple
Development Project is an attempt to demonstrate that farmer incentives are
basic to agricultural development. The proposed project will provide assis-
tance to the rural sector by facilitating travel and economic activity and
stemming the deterioration of the present road system. Future operations
are designed to facilitate the transfer of benefits accruing from mining
operations to rural areas.
23.       The Bank Group's share in Guinea's publicly guaranteed external
debt outstanding and disbursed amounted to about 9 percent in mid-1974. At
that time, the Bank Group's share of debt service payments was about 3% as
amortization of the Boke loans had just begun. Two missions, one to update
our debt information and another to collect all information available on the
mining sector, visited Guinea during September and October, 1975.
PART III: THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Geographical Situation
24.       Guinea is bordered by Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Mali to the north,
the Ivory Coast to the east, Liberia and Sierra Leone to the south and the
Atlantic Ocean to the west. Land communications with its neighbors are
difficult. Internally, the country is divided into four major geographical
regions: Lower Guinea, which comprises mainly low-lying coastal plains;
Middle Guinea, with altitudes between 600 and 1,500 m; Upper Guinea, which
straddles the flood plains of the Niger River and its affluents; and the
Forest Region, in the south and southeast of the country. Road and railway
construction becomes progressively more difficult and costly as one moves
away from the Lower Guinea region, and is especially difficult in the
mountainous areas of Middle Guinea and the Forest Region.



-8-
Transportation Sstem
25.       The transportation system consists of about 13,300 km of roads,
1,tOQ km of railroads, two deep water ports at Conakry and Kansar, an
international airport at Conakry and ten airfields in the interior of the
country served by the domestic airline. For the bulk of the population as
well as for transportation of minerals, the rail and road networks represent
the most important means of transportation. While the extent of these
networks is considered generally adequate for Guinea's needs at least over
the next five years, the condition of both is poor mainly because of inade-
quate maintenance. In the past, Guinea's strategy for development of the
transportation sector was two-fold: to provide the infrastructure needed
for exploitation of its mining reserves and to pave the more important roads.
Railways
26.       The railway system consists of four lines:   the 70 year-old main
line from Conakry to Kankan ('660 km), which runs parallel to the road, and
three other lines connected with bauxite mining operations; Conakry-Kindla
(135 km); Kamsar-Sangaredi (136 km) and Conakry-Fria (145 km).    Traffic on
the main line has declined substantially since 1965, reflecting the general
decline in the economy. Plans for further railway construction depend almost
entirely on developments in the mining sector; at present, two additional
lines are contemplated: a 17 km line connecting a proposed iron ore mine
at Mount Nimba in the Forest Region with the railway across the border in
Liberia which is used to evacuate Liberia's iron ore deposits from that
region; and a 60 km line connecting the Kamsar-Sangaredi line with Aye-Koye,
site of a proposed bauxite mine. The Government also has a far more ambi-
tious project under study, but not yet indicated in the Plan, to construct
the Trans-Guinean railway (about 1,200 km long and estimated to cost about
US$1.2 billion) to transport iron-ore and timber from the Forestry Region
and bauxite from the Tongue-Dabola area to Conakry.
Hizhways
27.       Guinea's highway network comprises about 13,300 km of roads and
tracks. It includes 6,000 km of national and inter--regional roads linking
the main population centers with each other and with the transport networks
of Mali and Liberia, and 7,300 km of local roads which provide access to
rural areas. Emphasis has been put on paving selected primary roads. Over
the past 9 years the total of paved roads increased from 190 km, about 90%
of which were in Lower Guinea, to nearly 1,060 km of which more than 50% are
outside Lower Guinea. Rehabilitation and maintenance of roads falls under
the Directorate of Bridges and Roads (Direction des Ponts et Chaussees, DPC)
in the Ministry of Public Works, Mining and Geology (NPW); while the DPC
appears to poasess the manpower to carry out maintenance operations, it has
been considerably hampered by a lack of funds, spare parts and equipment.
The effects of inadequate maintenance are visible everywhere with many roads
no longer at a proper level of traffic serviceability nor in suitable condi-
tion for normal maintenance operations. Government realizes that much higher



- 9 -
returns from investments could be derived from a comprehensive program of
rehabilitation and maintenance works rather than new construction; the first
highway project is designed to help Government put this realization into
practice.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
28.       The First Highway Project is based on a 1969 consultants' Road
Maintenance Study, financed by the UNDP, which was subsequently updated in
February 1975 by consultants. An Association appraisal mission was in Guinea
in May/June 1975. Negotiations took place between November 17, 1975 and
November 20, 1975 with a delegation led by M. Mohamed Lamine Toure, Minister
of Public Works, Mining and Geology. A credit and project summary is attached
as Annex III. The Appraisal Report (No. 882a-GUI) is being circulated sepa-
rately to the Executive Directors.
Description of the Project
29.       The deterioration of the road network during the last few years
has increasingly hindered Government's attempts to revitalize the rural
sector and expand the exploitation of forestry resources. While a complete
program of road rehabilitation and maintenance will require between 8-10 years
to implement, the proposed project is aimed at preventing further deteriora-
tion of the system and providing the basis for improving Government's mainte-
nance capacity. Accordingly, the three year project would consist of:
(a) rehabilitation as needed of 2491 km of high priority
roads and initiation of proper maintenance of these roads;
(b) repair of existing equipment and plant and rehabilitation
of workshops;
(c) purchase of (i) highway equipment and spare parts, (ii)
workshop equipment and tools, (iii) parts for repair of
existing equipment and plant, (iv) engineering and
laboratory equipment and training materials, and (v) radio
equipment;
(d) purchase of materials and supplies for project operations; and
(e) technical assistance to the Ministry of Public Works,
Mining and Geology for the implementation of the project,
the training of mechanics and equipment operators, and the
preparation of a second phase of the rehabilitation and
maintenance program to be executed over 1978/79-1980/81.



- 10 -
Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Roads
30.       Rehabilitation of much of the system is a prerequisite to regular
maintenance operations. Agreement has been reached concerning the roads to
be included in this project (Annex A to Schedule 2 of the draft Credit Agree-
ment). These roads are designated on Map IBRD 11698R which is attached.
Of the roads included, 1046 km are paved (nearly the whole of the country's
present paved system) and 1445 km are gravel and earth. The rehabilitation
works included in the program are those required to return the selected
roads to standards as originally designed or as subsequently improved.
31.       A number of road crews will be created to carry out the required
operations with separate crews for paved roads, gravel and earth roads,
production of selected materials, bridges, and routine maintenance. The
personnel for all of these crews will be drawn from among the existing
employees of the DPC.
32.       The benefits from improved maintenance will be lost unless steps
are taken to control the weight of loads transported on the roads during the
rainy season.  The Government has recently issued a Decree reducing the maxi-
mum axle load to 5 tons for vehicles using unpaved roads during the rainy
season and has agreed to take the necessary measures to enforce this new
regulation (Section 4.03 of the draft Credit Agreement).
Rehabilitation of Workshops and Repair of Existing Equipment
33.       The low priority given to maintenance operations in the past is
reflected in the poor condition of the various workshops throughout the
country, the deterioration of equipment and plant, and the lack of spare
parts; little equipment is left worth repairing. DPC has been cleaning up
and leveling workshop yards, in anticipation of the arrival of new plant and
equipment, and has been redesigning some for on expanded role.
Training
34.       A major component of the project is the training of mechanics and
equipment operators. The main training center will be in Conakry where
facilities already exist, to avoid trainees going through prolonged absences
from home, a second, smaller training center will be opened in N'Zerekore.
The proposed training courses will produce sufficient mechanics and equipment
operators to cover DPC's most urgent needs. However, this should be con-
sidered as only the beginning of personnel training. Skilled labor is in
short supply in Guinea, and DPC will find it necessary to continue to develop
skilled mechanics and operators starting with partially trained personnel,
and in many cases, with totally unskilled laborers. Continuation and expansion
of this training effort wilL be a key component of the second phase of the
rehabilitation and maintenance program to be prepared during the execution
of this project.



Project Implementation
35.       The project will be executed by the Directorate of Bridges and Roads
(DPC) within the Ministry of Public Works, Mining and Geology (MPW). However,
successful execution, including the training of mechanics and equipment
operators, will require technical assistance. Government has agreed to secure
the services of an international consulting firm selected on terms and condi-
tions acceptable to the Association (Section 3.02 of the draft Credit Agreement)
and has already taken the initial steps to hire such a firm.
36.       Because Government has given priority to road construction in the
past, there is a risk that project inputs, such as equipment, material and
personnel, could be diverted to purposes not included in the project des-
cription. This issue was thoroughly discussed during negotiations and
assurances were given by the Government (Sections 3.03(b) and (c) of the
draft Credit Agreement) that the program of works would be carried out as
agreed. In addition, special efforts will be made to monitor project imple-
mentation closely, including establishing a detailed system for reporting
progress against the agreed work program.
Costs and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project (net of taxes) is estimated at US$18.6
million with a foreign exchange component of US$14.0 million (76 percent of
the total cost). The project is expected to be completed in three years.
Details of cost estimates are shown in Annex III.
38.       The proposed IDA credit of US$14.0 million would finance all of the
foreign exchange costs of the project. The remainder of the costs, US$4.6
million, mostly local wages and salaries of personnel who are presently employed
by Government but also including the local cost of the consultants' housing,
would be met by Government.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Equipment, spare parts for new equipment, supplies, and materials
amounting to about US$8 million will be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. The following
items will be procured on the basis of quotations from local suppliers: (i) fuel
in the amount of about US$2 million, (ii) spare part for existing equipment
amounting to some US$600,000; and (iii) equipment or groups of the same items
of equipment with a value less than US$20,000 but in the aggregate not ex-
ceeding US$100,000. In evaluating bids for equipment purchase, the availabi-
lity of after-sales service and spare parts will be important considerations.
40.       Credit proceeds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(i) 100% of the c.i.f. costs of equipment and other imported
supplies and materials, and 85% of the cost of imported
items purchsed locally; and
(ii) 100% of foreign expenditures for technical assistance.

Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
41.       The success of Government's efforts to revitalize the agricultural
sector will depend partly on the availability of an efficient and reliable
transport system linking the widely dispersed population centers and productive
areas, and between these centers and the port of Conakry. As roads provide the
predominant means of transport, the highest priority requirement of the trans-
port sector consists of the preservation, by rehabilitation and subsequent
regular maintenance, of the road network.
42.       In defining the scope and content of the proposed program, considera-
tion has been given to the length of the roads which most urgently need reha-
bilitation and maintenance, their traffic, the economic potential in the road's
influence area, the necessity for geographic coordination in execution of
works, and the capacity of DPC to implement the works. The proposed program
will ensure greater transport reliability, expand the seasonal use of the
most important unpaved roads, and reduce transport costs. Other benefits in-
clude those associated with the training of DPC staff, especially mechanics
and operators, as well as avoidance of the need for costly reconstruction of
extensive sections of the network which, at the current rate of deterioration,
would be inevitable within a few years. Finally, the placing of an experienced
team of consultants within the MPW is expected to afford opportunity for
demonstration of basic organizational techniques and for realistic evaluation
of the country's highway needs.
43.       A high proportion of the project's benefits, as savings both to the
Government Agency Office National Rail-Route (ONRR) and MPW, will accrue to
the Government. Private car and truck owners will also benefit directly from
a decrease in vehicle operating costs. Although a large part of private trans-
porters' operating costs is expected to be retained by them, part of these
savings may be passed on to consumers and passengers in the form of lower tariffs,
since some competition exists in the private sector of the transport industry.
44.       For the purpose of analyzing the justification for the project,
the cost of the proposed program has been taken to include the cost of
equipment, spare parts, tools, materials, technical assistance and labor.
To reflect the difference between official domestic prices and market prices,
local cost components were shadow priced at one sixth of their actual market
values at the official exchange rate. The quantifiable benefits included in
the analysis are (i) the reduction in vehicle operating costs and avoidance
of future increases; and (ii) the savings in delaying the need for road recon-
struction. The economic life of the project has been estimated to be 10 years,
reflecting the estimated economic life of the rehabilitation works. The eco-
nomic return of the project is high, mostly due to the savings in roads cons-
truction costs. On the basis of the above inputs, the project has a benefit/
cost ratio of 4.6 with the stream of costs discounted at 12%; this corresponds
to an economic return which exceeds 100% and indicates that the project is
long overdue. In view of the uncertainty which exists about the assumptions
used for the above economic analysis, the sensitivity of the estimated return
to variations in these assumptions has been tested. Even under very pessimistic
assumptions, the proposed project is still well justifie(l.
