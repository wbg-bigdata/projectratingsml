3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

Original Objective: The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) lists two major objectives: (i) to create a
unified water supply and sanitation Utility for the city of Mostar; and (ii) to improve service. The Credit
Agreement combines the two major objectives in a succinct statement: "The Objectives of the Project are to
improve water and wastewater services in the City of Mostar and promote reconciliation in the water
sector."

The objectives were appropriate given the post conflict situation in Mostar and the need to rehabilitate
water supply and sewerage service due to the destroyed infrastructure during the war and lack of
maintenance.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The original objectives were not revised. The PAD also states that the Project seeks to achieve progress by
including the following sector development objectives: (i) develop the merged Utility into an efficiently
managed and commercially operated entity that will enjoy greater autonomy to conduct its operations; (ii)
provide water for selected poor and non-served refugee areas on the periphery of the city; (iii) assist the
merged Utility to become financially viable by improving billings and collections through the introduction
of better commercial practices and by harmonizing tariffs between the Eastern and Western parts of the
city; (iv) improve the quality and reliability of water service to the population of Mostar on both sides of
the city; and (v) improve the efficiency of the water supply system by reducing water wastage and
addressing serious network leakage problems and hydraulic inefficiencies. These detailed "sector
development objectives" are clearly meant to be secondary to the two major objectives, as is demonstrated
by the fact that they are not recorded in the Credit Agreement. The Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) will limit itself to evaluating to what extent the two major objectives were met. However, some of
the reported Project performance indicators deal with the progress in meeting the secondary objectives.

3.3 Original Components:

The Project consisted of six components:

A.       Priority investments for water supply rehabilitation and improvement:
         ·   Installation of production meters on sources not yet metered;
         ·   Protection of four of the five sources;
         ·   Replacement of pipe sections known to have high leakage rates;
         ·   Construction of a 600 mm main from the Radobolja spring to the Glavica reservoir to replace
         500 mm. of poor quality pipeline;
         ·   Construction of pump stations, reservoirs and distribution networks to serve Bijelo Polje and
         Orlac;
         ·   Purchase of leak detection and flow measurement equipment; and
         ·   Purchase of hardware and software in support of project implementation.

B.       Water distribution network rehabilitation and improvement fund;

C.       Sewerage network rehabilitation fund;



                                                      - 2 -

D.       Institutional strengthening fund for the purchase of hardware and software to strengthen the Mostar
         Water Supply and Sewerage Utility (MWSSU) and build institutional capacity and to train
         MWSSU personnel;

E.       Technical Advisor/engineering services in order to:
         ·   Improve MWSSU's operational performance;
         ·   Identify works of network rehabilitation;
         ·   Assist in identifying the most urgent sewerage rehabilitation investments; and
         ·   Introduce and/or upgrade the hardware and software of MWSSU's commercial system in order
             to identify investments financed by the institutional strengthening fund;

F.       The financing of critical operating expenditure following the merger of the Eastern Utility and the
         Western Utility.

3.4 Revised Components:

There were no revisions of the original components.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

There was no formal evaluation of the quality at entry by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). However,
there was a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) undertaken by QAG during the second year of
implementation organized to review the design and preparation of the Project. In particular, the QER panel
commended the Project team on the simplicity of the two objectives that the panel felt was appropriate, in
view of the risks of the Project and the relative inexperience of the Borrower. In addition, the Project
focused on the objective of reducing costs by creating one unified Utility where there had previously been
two during the conflict. The QER panel also provided a list of those technical items that were needed to
attend to the most obvious post-conflict needs, such as increasing efficiency and quality of supply and of
building a modern water supply and sewerage Utility. The latter included the exceptional financing of
critical operating expenditure and supplies to rebuild the ability to actually normalize service following the
damage inflicted by the conflict.

The project concept, approach and objectives were rated "1". The assessment rating was based on a scale
from 1-4 with 1 defined as highly satisfactory and 4 as unsatisfactory.

The QER submitted the following text on the project: "The panel rated the project's Concept, Objectives
and Approach as Highly Satisfactory, and each of the remaining quality dimensions, and the overall rating,
as Satisfactory. Project preparation was unusually complicated in view of the unusual setting of a seriously
divided ethnic community, the post conflict environment, charged atmosphere, and heavy involvement by
the EU and other donors. The preparation team as well as Country and Sector management are to be
congratulated for working together to design a scheme that fits the difficult circumstances."

In addition, the project was prepared in a timely manner. The Project Concept Meeting was held in
December 1999 with Board approval in June 2000. There were no revisions of the original components
and no extensions were required; all confirming a strong quality at entry.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The two primary objectives were summarized in the Credit Agreement to read: "The Objectives of the
Project are to improve water and wastewater services in the City of Mostar and promote reconciliation
in the water sector." There are two sources of data to evaluate whether the objective was met: (i) the
performance indicators of the Mostar Water Supply and Sewerage Utility, and (ii) the perception of Mostar
Water Supply and Sewerage Utility customers. The Mostar Water Supply and Sewerage Utility
performance indicators are those from the PAD and are summarized in Annex 1.

Total electric energy consumption was gradually reduced from 9.4 MWh in 2001 to 8.2 MWh in 2002, 7.2
MWh in 2003 to an annual rate of 5.6 MWh in 2004. At the same time, the number of water connections
grew from 27,200 in 2001 to 29,600 in 2004 by rehabilitation of the system (and not expansion) and the
share of the population benefiting from continuous service rose from 59% in 2000 to 75% in 2004.

The energy consumption per cubic meter produced has decreased after the construction of the Bijelo Polje
gravity supplies that reduced pumping. The rehabilitation investments focused intensely on leakage
reduction and committed much effort and substantial project resources to this goal. The rehabilitation and
replace of old networks in the city center substantially contributed to the reduction in losses (as
approximated by the Unaccounted-for Water (UFW)) from 84%in 2001 to 68% in 2004. The losses have
been further reduced to 61% for the first half of 2005. Further reduction of water losses and energy
consumption will be achieved with the operation of the Radobolje gravity pipeline and the Neretva river
crossings, completed in September 2005. The crossings will allow gravity water to be transported across
the river, thus further reducing present deep well pumping costs.

However, unaccounted for water (Indicator #1) was not reduced to the projected amount of 38% in the
PAD. It proved overly optimistic to expect leakage reduction of 15% per year. In addition, consultants
provided differing calculations at different times resulting in a moving target for leakage reduction. At one
time, unaccounted-for-water was thought to be below 50% but near the end of the Project it was estimated
at 61%. The lesson learned is that estimating leakage reduction is challenging, however, it is nowhere near
as difficult as actually reducing leakage. In addition, it is important to be far more realistic about the
actual amount of losses that can be achieved at the preparation phase of the project. That lesson is
especially applicable after the initial investments and pipes are repaired or replaced, resulting in substantial
early gains in leakage reduction. Further reduction becomes increasingly difficult.

The collection ratio (Indicator #2), the ratio of collections to billing has reached 75% so far in 2005. The
ratio was 61% in 2004, although the amount billed fell that year because of harmonization of the low tariff
charged by the western Utility with the extremely high amount charged by the eastern Utility. Nonetheless,
the 2005 collection ratio of 75% is moving in an upward direction that should continue after project
closing.

Profit/loss results over the past 4 years show steady improvement: a loss of BAM ­3,621,805 in 2001 was
cut in half to a loss of BAM ­1,752,442 in 2002 and reached the break-even point in 2003. As the
turnaround continued, a profit of BAM 24,818 was posted in 2004. Under extremely difficult economic
conditions in Mostar, substantial improvements were made in the financial results with the operating ratio
improving from 147% in 2001 to 124% in 2002, 100% in 2003 and 2004.

The remaining Performance Indicators as indicated in the ISR were all met or exceeded. For example,



                                                       - 4 -

Indicator #4, the testing of the quality of the public water supply met the standard of 99%. Indicator #7, to
achieve 50k of transmission and distribution pipelines repaired or replaced was met 100%. Indicator #8, to
achieve a 20% increase in hydraulic efficiency or pipe networks was achieved. Indicator #9, installation of
20% production and 4000 consumption meters were completed (entirely by the staff of the utility).
Indicator #13, to consolidate the accounts of the two Utilities by January 1, 2001 was also completed on
time. The City of Mostar provided full support of the consolidation of the accounts and should be
commended for their role as the owner of MWSSU.

The second part of the Project objective "...to promote reconciliation in the water sector" was met. The
western half of the water system was integrated with the eastern parts. The two, previously separate, water
and wastewater companies were united and now operate as one Mostar Water Supply and Sewerage
Utility. The Rapid Network Analysis study, carried out at the start of the project clearly explained the
benefits of joint operation and made first steps towards development of a hydraulic model. The model has
been further developed during project implementation and will serve as a solid basis for optimal operation
of all facilities in the near future. The purchase of leak detection equipment and thorough training of
MWSSU personnel in the elaboration of annual leak detection and repair programs will also contribute
towards further reduction of water losses and energy consumption. The litmus test was the unification of
the water supply and sewerage tariffs. At project approval, the western parts of Mostar paid tariffs that
were less than t half of what the eastern parts were paying. For the first time after the war, all citizens of
Mostar are paying the same tariff. Domestic tariffs have been KM 0.69 (US$ 0.43) per m3, industrial
tariffs KM 1.31(US$0.81) per m3, and public tariffs KM 0.79 (US$0.49) per m .      3




Summarizing, recorded performance indicators indicate a Project outcome as "satisfactory" because one
of two main objectives was fully achieved ("to create a unified water supply and sanitation Utility for the
city of Mostar") and because the other one was partially achieved ("to improve service"). In retrospect, it
must be acknowledged that the Bank expectations of rate at which unaccounted water could be reduced
proved to be overoptimistic. However, all other technical assumptions were all met and often exceeded
projected performance indicators (see Annex 1 for Table of Indicators).

Consumer Perceptions of Project Outcome

In order to properly evaluate how the Project changed consumer attitudes and satisfaction, the Borrower
and the Bank jointly decided to conduct a formal consumer survey. The survey results were first
disseminated in the local press and then discussed at an open hearing to which consumer and authorities'
representatives were invited. A Bank supervision mission in October 2004 started the preparations with the
MWSSU. It was decided to entrust the design and implementation of the survey to the MWSSU, backed
up with Bank advice. The decision to allow the MWSSU itself to undertake the survey was prompted by
the fortuitous fact that the MWSSU Financial Director had substantial experience from conducting
statistical surveys and by the absence of additional financing to pay for the substantially higher survey
costs that an external evaluation agency would have charged. The sense of economy characterized the
design of the survey instrument (see Annex 8), and the actual administration of the survey for which
university students were employed under the supervision of the MWSSU Financial Director. The survey
instrument was designed from October to November 2004, the actual survey was conducted in December
2004, the responses were tabulated and analyzed in January and the public hearing was organized in
February 2005. The survey results are shown in Annex 8 and relate to several of the aspects on which to
base the ICR evaluation of the Project outcome.

Project Objective One: "... to improve water and wastewater services in the City of Mostar."



                                                       - 5 -

A number of questions dealt with the actual and perceived improvement of services:

Question 8: "Did you have a water connection in 2000 (before the project) and in 2004 (latest year of
project implementation)."

Survey result: The share of the population with a water connection rose from 93% to 98% in the course of
the Project.

Question 10: "Did you have continuous water supply in 2000 and in 2004?"

Survey result: The share of the respondents reporting as receiving continuous water supply rose from 59%
in 2000 to 75% in 2004. Another 23% reported continuous water service for most of the time and the
balance of 2% said they did not have continuous service."

Overall evaluation of the survey results: The questions addressing service coverage and quality showed an
improvement during the relatively short Project period of 4 years. On the basis of the relevant questions in
the beneficiary survey, the ICR rates that the outcome of the service quality objective was satisfactory.

The second objective "... to promote reconciliation in the water sector." was achieved since the two
separate water companies were reunited and one uniform tariff was applied in the city.

Concluding the ICR rates the project outcome as "satisfactory" given that the consumer survey indicates
a satisfactory outcome and given that the recorded performance indicators show a "marginally satisfactory"
rating.

4.2 Outputs by components:

A.       Priority investments for water supply rehabilitation and improvement (Annex 2 provides total
costs):
         ·     Installation of production meters on sources not yet metered;
         Status: Contract was completed in January 2002.
         ·     Protection of four of the five sources;
         Status: Contract was completed in December 2003.
         ·     Replacement of pipe sections known to have high leakage rates;
         Status: Contract was completed in May 2002.
         ·     Rehabilitation of a 600 mm main from the Radobolja spring to the Glavica reservoir;
         Status: Contract was completed in September 2005.
         ·     Construction of pump stations, reservoirs and distribution networks to serve Bijelo Polje and
         Orlac;
         Status: Contract was completed in April 2003
         ·     Purchase of leak detection and flow measurement equipment;
         Status: Contract was completed in February 2005.
         ·     Purchase of hardware and software in support of project implementation.
         Status: A total of 11 individual contracts were completed from July 2001 to January 2004.

Overall implementation of component A: All sub-components were completed from July 2001 through
January 2004 with all work of satisfactory quality.



                                                     - 6 -

B.       Water distribution network rehabilitation and improvement fund. Status: All components were
completed from April 2004 to May 2005 and proved of satisfactory quality.

C.       Sewerage network rehabilitation fund. Status: Components were completed in April 2004. The
sewerage network rehabilitation replaced and rehabilitated sewer pipes and purchase of equipment to clean
out obstructions in the sewerage network that had accumulated during 12 years of conflict and post-conflict
when routine cleaning proved impossible to undertake. The works also comprised the partial financing of
a study of how to improve the quality of the Neretva River. The study resulted in a US$ 8.9 million grant
from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) that was approved on June 21, 2005.

D.       Institutional strengthening fund for the purchase of hardware and software to strengthen the
MWSSU and build institutional capacity, financial viability and to train MWSSU personnel. Status:
Contracts were completed in July 2003. The lower expenditure for the institutional strengthening was
possible because of the decision to limit international contracted consultancies and technical assistance to
local and regional expertise when possible and also, train staff on the MWSSU payroll.

E.       Technical Advisor/engineering services in order to:

         ·     Improve MWSSU's operational, institutional and financial performance;
         ·     Assist in identifying works of the network and the most urgent sewerage rehabilitation
               investments; and
         ·     Introduce and/or upgrade the hardware and software of MWSSU's commercial system in
               order to identify investments financed by the institutional strengthening fund.

Status: Seven contracts were completed from January 2002 through December 2004. The institutional
development impact is rated as high.

F.       The financing of critical operating expenditure for international audits, expendable supplies and
materials following the merger of the Eastern Utility and the Western Utility.

Status: The higher-than-expected cost to pay for current expenditure is explained by the fact that the
international audits were extremely high and by the need to pay for initially operating expenditure that
proved necessary to effectively merge the two previously separate water Utilities. The operating
expenditure had been anticipated and approved by the Bank during the PAD review process.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

No rate of return was calculated because none was calculated in the PAD. However, it is likely that the
investments have generated a high return because they were almost exclusively rehabilitation of assets that
had been damaged in the war. One of the five subsidiary sector development objectives dealt with more
efficient service: to improve the efficiency of the water supply system by reducing water wastage and
addressing serious network leakage problems and hydraulic inefficiencies. The relatively short Project
implementation period was insufficient for the ambitiously forecast reduction of the percentage of
unaccounted water. However, indirectly the steadily decreasing consumption of electric energy does
indicate higher efficiency of production.




                                                     - 7 -

4.4 Financial rate of return:

No financial rate of return was calculated because the valuation of fixed assets is uncertain that a
calculation of the financial rate of return on the rate base is not meaningful. The Mostar Utility has
managed to reverse annual losses in the years 2001 and 2002 and generate a small annual profit in the
years 2003 and 2004, respectively. The gradual upward trend is expected to continue.

The difficulty in increasing collections, however, hampered the MWSSU through Project implementation.
Improving collections was particularly difficult as the bulk of the arrears were the result of a handful of
industrial and state entities that were either non-operational or going through a privatization proves and
unwilling to settle their arrears with MWSSU. The settlement of these arrears was a key objective of the
MWSSU management. The remedy to force collections, proved time-consuming because it requires the
MWSSU to sue those clients that are in arrears. The whole process has been extremely costly and required
3 to 4 years.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

At the beginning of the Project, there were two separate Utilities, each serving one side of the river. At the
end of the Project, the City of Mostar had one well-functioning Utility that had acquired the capacity to
plan, implement and operate water supply and sewerage investments. Similarly, at the conclusion of the
Project, the Utility had successfully created the technical project implementation capacity in a Technical
Project Implementation Unit, staffed entirely by employees of the MWSSU. The decision to train and
create units within the Utility, instead of employing consultants for this purpose was vindicated because the
capacity was retained at the conclusion of the Project. In addition, the staff working in project
implementation will now return to their jobs in the Utility. The capacity of the Financial Project
Implementation Unit is also high, which led to the successful implementation of the financial management
requirements of the Bank. As a result, the MWSSU was entrusted with the implementation of the grant for
improving the environmental condition of the Neretva River, for which GEF approved a grant of $8.9
million on June 21, 2005.

Mostar Utility personnel also received extensive training during the life of the Project. The utility staff and
the Project Implementing Team (PIT) attended several courses in financial management and procurement
procedures for the World Bank financed projects. Personnel from both Financial and Technical Units also
attended programs in the latest financial, technical and commercial practices organized by United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) and other donor agencies. The entire Management Team
attended various training and seminars to learn about modern methods of utility management and
operations, planning and engineering, commercial management and finance. They also attended and
successfully completed the course on customer service, communications and media relations' strategies.
MWSSU personnel are highly satisfied with the training and exposure to international experience and
sector best practices. They seek to apply the training to local conditions in the daily operations of the
utility. For the above reasons, the ICR rates the institutional development impact as "high."


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

There was no major factor outside the control of the central and municipal governments or outside the
control of the MWSSU that affected either implementation or outcome.




                                                       - 8 -

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

The local government lent full and strong support to the efforts of the MWSSU to collect arrears from a
few large industrial and official clients, but the time-consuming and costly process of civil litigation meant
that progress was much slower than projected at appraisal.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

The main, long-term accomplishment of the MWSSU has no doubt been the creation of financial and
technical Project implementation capacity within the MWSSU itself. The establishment of a technical PIT
and a financial PIT-Finance proved sustainable since the staff stayed within the MWSSU and now can use
their experience gained during project implementation inside the utility. In addition, MWSSU will
implement the GEF-funded Water Quality Improvement project, in an amount of US$8.9 million in foreign
funding.

5.4 Costs and financing:

Total Project costs and their financing are shown in Annex 2. Total Project costs are forecast to reach
US$15.02 million, compared with the appraisal estimate of US$13.38 million, an overrun of 12%. The
overrun was largely due to the exchange rate between the SDR and US dollars.


6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The three most significant factors for judging the likelihood of sustainable Project benefits deal with the
technical, institutional and financial aspects of the Project. The technical sustainability is "likely" because
of the substantial and successful implementation that was focused on rehabilitating the existing facilities
and investing in such works that would reduce operating costs (notably energy costs). The institutional
sustainability is "likely" because of the success in integrating what had become two separate Utilities on
two opposite sides of the City during the recent war. The fact that the Project accomplishments were due
to strengthening of the Mostar Utility itself and to added qualifications and confidence of Utility staff also
speaks in favor of an institutional sustainability rating of "likely." The financial sustainability has also
shown improvement on revenue and expenditure. The Mostar Utility has managed to reverse annual losses
in the years 2001 and 2002 and generate a small annual profit in the years 2003 and 2004, respectively.
The gradual upward trend is expected to continue and the ICR rates the financial sustainability as "likely."
Combining the three feasibilities, the ICR rates the composite sustainability as "likely."

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

No special transition arrangements were necessary because the decision was made to implement the project
within the Utility itself and its staff during Project implementation.




                                                        - 9 -

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank performance during lending is rated as "satisfactory." The Bank correctly focused on the
objective of creating a unified water supply and sewerage Utility for efficiency and reduced operating costs.
Substantial resources were devoted to building support in favor of the simple project concept and the effort
proved successful. The simple project concept with a focus on rehabilitation and gradual improvement of
basic services also favored the acceptance. The Quality Enhancement Review that was organized during
implementation rated the quality of project design as "high."


7.2 Supervision:

Bank performance during supervision is rated as "satisfactory." The decision to delegate daily Project
supervision to a local Project officer stationed in the Sarajevo World Bank office sped up Project
implementation and helped build local ownership in the Project. At the same time, the Bank allowed Utility
staff to get exposed to international utility practice through extensive training and the organization of study
tours. The study tours served the double purpose of widening the horizons of staff and as an incentive to
maintain good Project implementation performance.

The Project managed to enlist Norwegian co-financing to build the Bijelo Polje gravity supply. This
Project was completed, albeit with some delays and resulted in substantial energy savings, particularly
during the summer months when electricity rates in Bosnia and Herzegovina are higher. A similar
co-financed component, the Rades Low and High Zone water supply schemes, as well as the rehabilitation
of the Rades pumping station, reservoir and primary network, constructed with EU aid immediately after
the war were based on Italian official aid that was also completed although it had to be financed from the
IDA credit because of delays on finalizing the Italian funding. These works, valued at approximately
US$1.9 million, also explain the reason for the cost overrun of US$1.64 million.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

The overall Bank performance is rated as "satisfactory".

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Borrower performance during preparation is rated "satisfactory." The simple project concept facilitated
the task of keeping all parties continuously involved in the Project preparation in order to build support in
favor of the unification of the two Utilities.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

The Government implementation performance is rated "satisfactory." Again, the simplicity of the Project
made it easier to keep the City of Mostar and the Entity Government closely informed on implementation
progress. The Project implementation arrangements of having Utility staff paid similar salaries as other
utility staff and implementation taking place within the Utility was rated as best practice in the Country

Portfolio Performance Review for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

The performance of the implementing agency, the MWSSU is rated as "satisfactory." From being two
separate Utilities, the combined Utility gradually managed after an internal reorganization to operate in an
efficient structure which included reduction of 67 employees and was able to implement the Project largely
within budget and the timeframe allotted.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

The ICR rates the overall Borrower performance as "satisfactory" because all levels of government
performed satisfactorily during the preparation and implementation stages.

8. Lessons Learned

Lesson One: Project objectives should be closely tailored to the country aspirations during Project
preparation and to the capacity of the government and agency to implement the Project. The Mostar
Project focused on the obvious objective of working in a post-conflict environment and addressing sector
issues related to rehabilitation of the water supply and sanitation system as well as reducing operating
costs. In addition, Mostar was selected as the symbol of the effort to rebuild trust in a post-conflict
environment through the creation of one unified Utility providing the basic services of water supply and
sewerage. The Project was kept as simple as possible to match the initial capacity of the Utility.

Lesson Two: The chances of a satisfactory Project outcome and of sustainable Project benefits are
increased if the Bank has a broad and sustained relationship with a city. In the particular case of Mostar,
the Bank supported the reconstruction of the Mostar Bridge that had been destroyed during the war;
approved the Mostar water supply and sewerage project; financed solid waste management, an Urban
Service Delivery project with a component on urban management in Mostar and facilitated GEF financing
of improvements in the Neretva River. The continuous and widespread support of the rebuilding of the city
of Mostar built trust in the Bank as a development partner and facilitated the acceptance of the advice and
assistance provided by the Bank on the policy dialogue as well as investment projects.

Lesson Three: Small borrowers pay a relatively large cost to comply with the Bank's fiduciary
requirements for Financial Management Systems (FMS). The Mostar Utility paid about US$550,000 for
four external commercial audits during implementation and two during preparation as well as technical
assistance to upgrade the accounting system to comply with the FMS requirements. The perception of the
Borrower is that these costs were extremely excessive and did not add value commensurate with the large
sums of money expended. The sums expended appeared all the more aberrant in a situation when the
MWSSU was meeting a serious challenge to increase its collections to a level sufficient to pay for current
expenditure. The clear lesson is that the costs mandated under the Bank's fiduciary FMS requirements
should have a relation to the economic capacity of the Borrower, the size of the project and the value
gained. Despite improvements in the Bank's FMS requirements since the preparation phase of the Project,
they continue to be both costly and not necessarily taking in account the value gained to the client.

Lesson Four: A fortiori from lesson three, the Project showed the virtues of limiting the externally
contracted consultancy to what the MWSSU was not able to create with its own staff. The decision to
create financial and technical Project implementation capacity within the MWSSU itself, with its own staff
that stayed on beyond completion of the Project was vindicated on grounds of economy and institution
building. The created capacity has enabled the MWSSU to provide technical assistance to other utilities
and infrastructure related Ministries in Bosnia and Herzegovina that have contracted with IFIs for financial

assistance.

Lesson Five: The Project demonstrates that a public sector operator can improve service quality and
operational efficiency without the help of private sector operators. The improvements justified the clear
preference of the MWSSU to discard the private sector option.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

The Mostar's Utility experience with the Bank is excellent. During the start of project preparation, the
Vodovod did not have any experience in Bank financed project and the extensive IDA regulations and
guidelines. Over time, the Utility became familiar with all the regulations and guidelines and completed
implementation in compliance within the regulations. The project was completed at the closing date did not
request any extensions. The capacity of the Utility was solid at the beginning of project preparation and
now has improved even more after the experience of working with the World Bank.

Due to the lack of experience with World Bank projects, the Utility was assisted by World Bank task team,
the World Bank training programs and high quality staff from county office in Sarajevo. Consultants were
also hired when it was needed but only for specialized tasks as it was important for the Utility staff to avoid
expensive international consultants as these funds were needed for investments in the City of Mostar.

The Utility created within its own organization a project implementing unit (PIT) staffed by its own
personnel who were experienced civil engineers and experienced financial officer. The salaries of the PIT
were exactly the same as those of the utility staff. Since the project was implemented inside the Utility,
there was daily and easy communication/collaboration between directors/technical department and PIT. The
relationship between the PIT and Utility was based on a common objective to implement the project for the
city of Mostar. The technical part of PIT was made up of experienced engineers who had been working in
the Utility for many years and were familiar with the preparation of project design and supervision of civil
works. This experience was useful during the preparation of technical specification for procurement of
Goods, works and services. The financial part of PIT was also made up of Utility employees. Now, the PIT
is working back in the Utility and the experience gained will be used inside the Utility.

One area of concern is the Extremely high costs of audit in the amount of US$550.000. These were paid by
the Utility and were a very expensive way to spend money. Even after spending so much money, the
problems with financial management were not fully resolved as after the closing of the project, the utility
will return to its internal procedures that are required by the laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The money
spent was only for the Bank requirements. This is difficult for the Utility which needs to use all its revenue
for operation of the Utility and investments and rehabilitation. For us as a small client this was not easy.

Lessons Learned

Even though there was difficulty in collections, there were constant improvements. The tariffs were
harmonized and for the first time after the war, all of Mostar pays the same tariffs. The Utility improved
financially each year and showed improvements throughout the project. The financial viability is the cost
important aspect of utility management.

The utility believes that domestic consultants, if qualified, should be favored instead of international
consultants on grounds of cost efficiency and effectiveness of assistance. Foreign consultants cost about
ten times as much as domestic consultants.



                                                      - 12 -

The success of the Project Implementation Teams (PIT) that were created within the Mostar Water Supply
and Sewerage Utility was evident and saved a lot of funding compared to the alternative of hiring foreign
consultants.

The project demonstrated that private sector participation was not a requirement for a water supply and
wastewater project to succeed. The Utility management felt that private sector participation had an
unsuccessful history in B&H. For example, the Tuzla, Gradare, Konic, and Travnik bulkwater private
sector contracts had not been very successful. However, some service contracts for pipe maintenance
might be justified. The Mostar project was the right design for the project.


(b) Cofinanciers:

Not available.

(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):

The positive views of Mostar Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) were documented during the
public meeting when the results of the consumer survey were presented and discussed.

    SURVEY RESULTS OF CUSTOMERS OPINION ON SERVICES GIVEN FROM
                                       «VODOVOD» D.O.O.

                                       Jan. 10. 2005. Mostar

        This survey was intended to be a tool in ,,how to obtain"data of customer satisfaction level
in services received from «VODOVOD» D.O.O. and what further improvements are expected.
Certain objectives and survey methods were ,,placed "in order to completely succeed in
examination.

        Basic problem imposed after preparation of questionnaire and other technical aids for
performing survey, is selection of sample. What group of people or which individuals are to be
examined persons in questionnaire? In most cases you want to have ,,as many as
possible"participants in order to operate with highest possible to ,,real"data in shaping final survey
results. Most ideal would be to examine all possible persons in given survey process. However it is
unacceptable since it would require too much of assets and effort. This is why we use method that
involves fewer assets and amount of effort and give optimal picture of survey results. This is
method of selecting examined persons - portion of population completely identical to ,,real
"population. This survey is conducted with individual persons taking in account all parts of town.

         Survey results in certain questions are presented in graphic and tables as shown in coming
pages.

Table 1 ­ Examined persons by age

 Age                             18 ­ 30 yrs.       30 ­ 50 yrs.        over 50 yrs.      TOTAL
 Number of respondents           711                719                 559               1.989
%                               36%                 36%                 28%               100%

Previous graphic shows that survey included almost equal numbers of all age groups. This
information is not meaningless. It is in favor of examining different age groups with great
percentage of accuracy and can suggest that data derived for this survey in this manner are more
relevant and more objective.

Graphic 2 can serve as conclusion source for determining that more than 50% of participants
have none or small income and this certainly affected their answers in questionnaire.

Responses in this case can be explained by the following facts: During this survey research
(November - December) we had longer period of rains that caused turbidity of water-. Our
consumers received timely notice. Water was controlled daily and the results showed that water
was drinkable but, due to increased level of chlorine it was recommended to boil the water every
day. We believe that this affected the course of answers.
