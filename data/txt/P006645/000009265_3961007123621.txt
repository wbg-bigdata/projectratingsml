MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Chile
Alto Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission Project (Loan 2833-CH)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Chile: Alto Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission Project
(Loan 2833-CH), prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Region. The Borrower contributed
Part II of the PCR.
Power sector policies and institutions in Chile are among the most effective in the developing
world. The main project objective was to provide low cost and reliable electric energy with minimum
negative impact on the environment by expanding the high voltage transmission and switching system
of ENDESA, the Borrower, and providing the associated training.
This objective was fully met and the US$21.5 million loan was fully disbursed in 35 months
or 19 months before schedule. Actual cost was US$47.8 million. The 26% cost overrun, fully financed
by ENDESA's cash generation was caused by the need to build a two-circuit 500kV transmission line
instead of a single-circuit one, in order to meet a power demand growing at a faster rate than estimated
at appraisal.
The project was implemented when a new legal and regulatory framework and a regulatory
agency -- the National Energy Commission -- were already in place in the country, and in the midst of
power sector privatization. ENDESA was Government-owned when the project was initiated. It was
transformed into a private company. Remarkably, this did not disrupt project implementation but
necessitated a change of focus of its training program from engineering to commercial and management
matters.
The outcome of the project is rated as highly satisfactory and its institutional development
impact as modest. Since the Borrower is fully committed to the project, met all loan covenants, has
an excellent record in its operations and maintenance, and enjoys a healthy financial situation within
a very favorable macroeconomic environment, the project sustainability is rated likely.
The PCR provides a satisfactory and concise account on the project implementation and results.
The project may be audited together with the Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2832-CH) to
extract lessons form the privatization process and its impact on sector operations.

ALTO JAHUEL - POLPAICO TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2833-CH)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Alto Jahuel-
Polpaico Transmission Project in Chile, for which Loan 2833-CH in the
amount of US$21.5 million was approved on June 9, 1987. The loan was
fully disbursed, the last disbursement being made on December 18, 1992,
eighteen months ahead of the Closing Date of June 30, 1994.
This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Country Department IV
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). It was sent to the Borrower
ENDESA whose comments are included as Part II.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan
Agreement, progress, project conclusion, and annual reports by the
Borrower, audit reports by the external auditors, supervision reports by the
Bank, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
documents.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE
ALTO JAHUEL - POLPAICO TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2833-CH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives and Description
1.    The Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project was an integral part of
the Bank's strategy for Chile at the time of appraisal and approval to increase
efficiency in the delivery of public services and strengthen the
implementation of a financial policy based on long run marginal cost of
system expansion at least cost. As the previous six power projects, it aimed
at providing low cost and reliable electrical energy for the production of
goods and services and final consumption with minimum negative impact on
the environment. For that purpose, the project comprised: (i) the
construction of 80 km, single circuit transmission lines as part of a ring
around Santiago and leading to the north; (ii) one switching station and the
enlargement of 3 substations; as well as (iii) training for ENDESA's staff in
the operation of high voltage systems.
Project Implementation
2.    The loan was approved on June 9, 1987, signed on December 16,
1987, and declared effective on February 19, 1988. Initiation of the project
was delayed by approximately one year because ENDESA decided to
redesign the project from single circuit to double circuit due to a more
positive perception about the future growth of the Chilean economy. Once
this obstacle was overcome, implementation of components (i) and (ii)
proceeded swiftly and was completed in May 1991, eighteen months ahead of
schedule. At the same time, staff received the described training, although at
a somewhat reduced level due to a cost reduction policy put in place at the
time.
3.    Actual net cost in real terms of the goods and services originally
included in the project amounted to US$28.1 million as compared to
US$24.7 million in the SAR, an increase of 14%. It was caused mainly by
an underestimation of the cost of land and rights of way, and the cost of
supervision by consulting engineers. Total current cost for the project with
the expanded scope including taxes, import duties, and interest during
construction came out at US$47.8 million, US$9.9 million above the SAR
estimate. ENDESA financed the cost increase out of its internally generated
funds.

Project Results
4.    Average peak demand growth in the five year period 1987-92 for the
Central Interconnected System reached 6.7%, well above the forecast of
4.3% in the staff appraisal report, due to a more rapid development of the
economy. When the positive outlook for the Chilean economy is added, the
capacity increase from single to double circuit appears fully justified.
5.    Project implementation coincided with the restructuring of the Chilean
power sector and its subsequent privatization. ENDESA, as a public
company, had extensive participation in distribution companies. As a result
of the restructuring of the power sector, ENDESA was reduced to a company
dedicated exclusively to generation and transmission. Privatization made it
the most widely held company on the Santiago Stock Exchange. The
company's policy is determined by its two principal shareholders, the
conglomerates Enersis and Luksic. While as a publicly owned company
ENDESA was recognized for its technical expertise, after privatization the
issues of cost control and financial performance also became paramount. As
a result, ENDESA has increasingly become a holding company leaving the
operation of facilities to its subsidiaries. In the face of opposition to further
expansion within Chile and to reduce risk, the company began searching
outside Chile for investment opportunities and now has become an important
power generator and distributor in Argentina. It has also succeeded in
obtaining a triple B rating from Standard and Poor's.
Project Sustainability
6.    Given ENDESA's excellent record in maintenance, the benefits of the
installations are expected to be sustained throughout their service life.
Experience with operation so far has been above average, with only minor
repairs required. While more important threats have come from vandalism
and terrorist attacks, no permanent damage was inflicted.
Lessons Learned
7.    On balance, the Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission Project should be
judged highly successful based on its technical, financial, and institutional
results.
8.    The Borrower was fully committed to the project, as shown by its
reaction in adjusting the project design to changed circumstances, absorbing
with its own funds the resulting cost increase, and assigning the necessary
manpower to assure its implementation. ENDESA has a long history of
experience in implementing projects with Bank financing and was therefore
fully aware of procurement requirements.



- Iv -
9.    The project was kept simple, with no features attached to make it look
more attractive. The macroeconomic and sector environment supported the
execution of the project, as the economy was developing rapidly, tariff policy
was already sound at appraisal, and the restructuring and privatization, which
occurred simultaneously with project execution, further improved the
performance of the executing agency. However, some features of the
resulting market structure are suboptimal, and almost impossible to change
after the transfer of ownership. As an institution, ENDESA can be
considered "graduated" and-after the Bank fulfilled its role-has become a
client of IFC.

ALTO JAHUEL - POLPAICO TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2833-CH)
PART I - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name:     Alto Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission
Project
Loan Number:      2833-CH
Loan Amount:      US$21.5 million
RVP Unit:         Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office
Country:          Chile
Sector :          Energy
Sub-Sector:       Power
2.    Background
2.1   The Energy Sector. The country's hydro potential is its most
economic and abundant energy resource, followed by coal and petroleum.
Chile's primary energy demand (326,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day)
and overall energy intensity (0.79 kgoe/US$GDP) are low compared to other
countries in the region, especially considering the importance of energy
intensive consumers like mines and smelters for the economy. In the 12
years, between 1979 and 1990, when GDP growth averaged 3.7% p.a.,
primary energy demand increased only slightly higher at 3.9% p.a.
However, in the same period, power consumption grew at 4.8% p.a.,
resulting in an elasticity of power-demand-to-GDP of 1.3. Thus, energy
intensity in the economy expanded by only 0.2% p.a., whereas for power
intensity the growth rate was 1.1%.
2.2   Power Sector Objectives. The Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission
Project as the previous power projects aimed at promoting social and
economic development by providing low cost and reliable electrical energy
for the production of goods and services and final consumption, with
minimum negative impact on the environment.
2.3   Power Sector Strategy. The project was an integral part of the
Bank's strategy for Chile to increase efficiency in the delivery of public
services and strengthen the implementation of a financial policy based on the
long-nin marginal cost of system expansion at least cost.



- 2 -
2.4   Bank Power Lending. At the time of project approval, the Bank had
financed six power projects in Chile between 1948 and 1976 for a loan total
of US$144 million, mostly for power generation.
2.5   Power Demand and Supply. Due to the rapidly expanding economy,
with a GDP growth rate averaging 7.1 % in the last 5 years, power demand
grew by 6.6% p.a. To satisfy these additional energy requirements,
efficiency gains on the supply and demand side should be implemented first,
as long as their cost are below those of system expansion and because of
their additional environmental benefits. The remaining gap has to be covered
by added capacity. While the production, transmission, and distribution
systems have reached a high degree of efficiency, a considerable potential for
additional efficiency gains remains on the end-user side. However, even if
the remaining savings potential is being realized, capacity additions will be
necessary. As the hydropower plants close to the population centers have
already been constructed, additional capacity has to be built by exploiting the
potential further south in the country. This in turn requires increased
investment in transmission lines and substations to transport the electricity to
the centers of consumption. The incremental demand also creates a need for
enforcing the existing transmission systems within and around the centers of
consumption, and to expand the distribution systems.
2.6   Pbwer Sector Organization. In the early eighties, the Government
of Chile (GoCh) started the modernization of the power sector with devising
a new tariff based on long run marginal cost. Two regulators, the National
Energy Commission, CNE, and the Superintendency for Power and Fuel,
SEC, were created. The tariff system has generally performed well, but
some alterations are being prepared to facilitate sales by cogenerators and
make the system more transparent. One disadvantage is its lack of incentives
for end-user energy conservation.
2.7   As a next step, the structure of the sector was changed. In the
Central Interconnected System (SIC), where about 95% of total electricity is
consumed, the two biggest companies ENDESA and CHILECTRA, which as
vertically integrated entities performed the functions of generation,
transmission, and distribution, were limited to generation and transmission.
ENDESA's shareholdings in distribution companies were terminated, and two
distribution companies for Santiago (CHILECTRA METROPOLITANA) and
the Fifth Region (CHILQUINTA) formed. To make the package more
interesting for later sale, no separate transmission company was established,
despite the recognized disadvantages for market structure. Also, by not
depositing the water rights for future projects in an entity different from
ENDESA, its dominance in expansion programs for hydropower was
safeguarded. In the second most important part, the Great Northern
Interconnected System (SING), the separation of the functions of generation
and transmission is underway and is completed for distribution.



- 3 -
2.8    After the restructuring in the SIC was completed, the GoCh started
with the privatization of the state-owned compar.ies. Corporacion de
Fomento de la Produccion, CORFO, a state owned development bank which
acted as the holding company for the government in the power sector, was
entrusted with the sale. Four big companies were successfully sold to the
public, consisting of local and foreign financial institutions, local private
companies inside and outside the sector, and individuals some of them
company employees. Only Colbun, a 490 MW hydroproject, still remains
publicly owned. In the SING, public ownership of generation and
transmission still prevails but its majority is being reduced. By not
separating generation from transmission and permitting cross holdings, the
privatization of the power sector failed to create a market structure composed
of a great number of economically and financially independent producers and
distributors.
2.9   Once privatized, the entities undertook their own restructuring by
establishing new companies to perform certain functions that were previously
done inside, by outsourcing other functions, by strengthening the financing
department, and by reducing staffing in other parts of the company. They
also started to look outside to acquire ownership of companies already in the
sector or recently created to implement new projects.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   Project Objectives. The objective of the tangible components of the
project was to provide expanded transmission capacity for the power
generated in new power plants in the South of the country to the load centers
in Santiago and the North. The training component aimed at upgrading the
knowledge of ENDESA's staff in areas related to high voltage transmission
technologies and daily systems operations.
3.2   Project Description. The project included three components:
(a)   Construction of two transmission lines, consisting of the
following subcomponents:
(i) 500 kV single circuit transmission line of 63 kmn length
between Polpaico and El Rodeo;
(ii) 220 kV single circuit transmission line of 17 km length
between El Rodeo and Alto Jahuel;
(b)   Expansion of substations, consisting of the following
subcomponents:
(i) Construction of a new 220 kV switching station with
seven bays at Polpaico;
(ii) Enlargement of the following substations: San Isidro
(150 MVA), Alto Jahuel (two extra bays), and Colbun
(two additional bays).
(c)   A training program for around 50 of ENDESA's professionals
for a total of 135 staff-months, in the following fields:



- 4 -
(i)  design, operation, and maintenance of extra-high
voltage transmission systems;
(ii)  design and operation of encapsulated (SF6) type
substations;
(iii) environmental impact of extra-high voltage transmission
systems;
(iv)  applications of direct current transmission systems;
(v)  use of new computer technologies for the design and
control of high-voltage transmission systems;
(vi) new instruments in international financial markets.
4.    Project Design
4.1   Conceptual Framework. Although the economy started to grow
more rapidly in the mid 1980s, the project design was still based on the past
modest growth rates experienced by the economy. When after project
approval ENDESA became convinced that the acceleration of the growth rate
of the national economy was sustainable, it decided to adjust the assumptions
for the calculation of the transmission system requirements and redesign the
project.
4.2   Project Preparation. Feasibility studies and engineering designs
were available. Training requirements were defined with a more generous
approach and to a great extent directed at the engineering department of
ENDESA, in line with the prevailing thinking at the time.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1   Changes in Project Scope. ENDESA had initially designed the
transmission system as a single circuit 500 kV transmission line between
Polpaico and El Rodeo to be operated in the earlier years at 220 kV, and a
single circuit 220 kV transmission line between El Rodeo and Alto Jahuel.
With the change in assumptions described above, ENDESA decided to
change the design to double circuit instead of single circuit. After Bank
approval, bids were issued with this enlarged scope. When ENDESA was
privatized during project execution and the engineering department
transformed into the separate consulting company INGENDESA, the
inclination to spend substantial amounts on training diminished and the
amount allocated to the training component was reduced; part of this training
was then provided by suppliers.
5.2   Project Implementation Schedule and Procurement.
Implementation of the physical components of the project according to the
SAR was scheduled to start in June 1987 and take five and a half years until
December 1992. Due to the redesigning of the transmission lines, invitations
to bid were issued one year later. Thanks to its vast experience and buoyant
financial situation, ENDESA was able to recover this delay and complete the



- 5 -
project in May 1991, eighteen months ahead of schedule. Goods and
services and civil works for the transmission lines and substations were
procured through ICB. The purchase of PCs, which was included in the
training component, was done on a local basis and had to be excluded from
Bank financing. As planned from the beginning, the engineering services
were provided by ENDESA, first by its own engineering department and
later by its affiliate INGENDESA, and were therefore not eligible for Bank
financing.
5.3   Project Cost. The actual investment cost at current prices including
financial cost amounted to US$47.8 (+26%) for the revised scope of the
project as compared to US$37.9 million estimated in the SAR for the original
scope. When only the physical components of the original single circuit are
considered, the actual cost in real terms of US$28.1 million represented a
14% increase compared to the SAR estimate of US$24.7 million. This was
caused mainly by an underestimation of the cost of land and rights of way,
and cost of supervision by consulting engineers. Also noteworthy is the 60%
reduction in the financial cost, due to the shorter implementation period.
5.4   Project Financing. Financing the project presented no problem as
ENDESA's cash flow was more than sufficient to absorb the additional
US$9.9 million. The Bank's financing share was consequently reduced to
50% of the total cost at current prices net of taxes and import duties as
compared to the initial ratio of 66/34 between the Bank and ENDESA.
Allocation of loan proceeds and disbursements were slightly altered in favor
of civil works to adjust to contractual arrangements. While loan
disbursements were slow to start, they picked up once the redesigning of the
project was concluded. The last disbursement was made in December 1992,
eighteen months ahead of the closing date.
6.    Project Results
6.1   Project Objectives. The original project of a single circuit of 80 km
was implemented in concept and detail as foreseen at appraisal. To this was
added a second circuit of the same length. Therefore, not only was the
original objective achieved but with the second circuit the available capacity
was doubled. The Central Interconnected System is therefore easily able to
meet increased demand.
6.2   ENDESA's Institutional Performance.  In 1986, CORFO had
already sold several former ENDESA subsidiaries: the distribution companies
of Coquimbo (EMEC), Melipilla (EMEL), and Atacama (EMELAT), and a
small generation company (Pilmaiquen). Pullinque, another small generation
company and former subsidiary of ENDESA, was sold to private investors in
1987. Between 1988 and 1990, the distribution companies of Antofagasta
and Tarapaca were sold to the private sector and ENDESA maintained only a
participation of 8% in the generation/transmission company EDELNOR,
responsible for the SING. In addition, the ownership of ENDESA in the



companies that serve the southern regions of Aysen and Magallanes,
EDELAYSEN and EDELMAG, was terminated. ENDESAs role was
therefore limited to generation and transmission in the CIS.
6.3   The privatization of ENDESA created an ownership structure
composed of private pension funds, companies belonging to one of the big
financial conglomerates of Chile, insurance companies and investments funds,
employees, and other private shareholders. At the end of 1992, ENDESA
had 60,389 shareholders, with individual investors holding 30% of its capital,
pension funds 29%, non-financial sector companies 28%, local investment
banks 6%, foreign investment funds 4%, employees 2%, and insurance
companies 1 %. However, the main influence is exercised by two financial
conglomerates, Enersis and Luksic.
6.4   Privatization brought about a new management at ENDESA. It soon
started reorganizing the company. The functions of engineering, real estate
management, and health services were spun-off into separate, at least 90%
owned companies called INGENDESA, ENIGESA, and ISPEN. Data
processing is provided by IDESSA in which ENDESA owns 50.1 % of the
shares. It streamlined the remaining organization, and reduced staffing in all
but the financial area which now plays a much more important role.
6.5   Recently, ENDESA increasingly has become a holding company
leaving the operation of the facilities to its subsidiaries. While the internal
consolidation was being implemented, ENDESA also began searching for
additional possibilities to invest in the Chilean power sector. When in 1989
CORFO offered the shares of Pehuenche for sale, ENDESA presented the
highest bid. Since then, it has created a new subsidiary in charge of building
the 450MW hydropower station Pangue, and has transferred the transmission
business to a fully owned subsidiary called TRANSELEC. Moreover, since
ENDESA faced opposition to its expansion in Chile and to reduce risk, it
started to look outside for investment opportunities. When the Argentine
power sector was privatized in 1992/93, ENDESA founded a subsidiary there
(ENDESA Argentina S.A.) and acquired as a member of various consortia
with different degrees of participation shares in thermal (Costanera) and
hydroelectric (El Chocon) plants and power distribution companies (Edesur),
thereby returning to the business of retail power sales it had abandoned in
Chile the previous decade.
6.6   To facilitate its financial operations it established Endesa-Chile
Overseas in the Cayman Islands. It has received a triple B rating from
Standard and Poor's for its external debt, the first Latin American company
classified as "Investment Grade."
6.7   ENDESA's Financial Performance. When comparing the financial
results forecast in the SAR and their actual value it is important to note that
these numbers refer to two very different organizations, since the dynamics
of the above changes in ENDESA were clearly not anticipated in the SAR.



Financial statements are fully consolidated for those going concerns where
ENDESA's holdings are over 50%, i.e., ENIGESA, INGENDESA, ISPEN,
E.E. Pehuenche, ENDESA Argentina, Endesa Chile Overseas, and IDESSA.
Investments in other companies are incorporated proportionally according to
ENDESA's participation in their capital including accrued net income.
6.8   Average rates and sales revenues remained below forecast because
they no longer include sales at the distribution level. Except for 1989 and
1990, which were years with below average rainfall and therefore required
heavy expenditures for fuel, operating ratios (1992:44%) were well below
forecasts, confirming the expectation of increased efficiency due to
privatization. The average financial rate of return for the five-year period
1988 to 1992 reached 8.6%, only modestly above the long term bond yield in
Chile, thus reflecting the relatively low risk involved in the power business.
The return on equity at 9.7% was higher, demonstrating a successful
management of financial resources and assets. However, only 12% of the
total capital investment program of US$555 million was financed with own
resources, mainly caused by an average dividend payout for the same period
of 118% of net income excluding adjustments for inflation. This is indicative
of a dividend policy that is not sustainable over the long run, especially when
seen in connection with the lack of additional paid-in capital.
6.9   Economic Reassessment. At appraisal Bank staff and Chilean power
authorities expected the Project to contribute to the economic growth of the
area affected, mostly related to industrial growth, and to the improvement of
the standard of living of the population. To reach these objectives and to
provide for expected load growth, the Project was designed as part of a least-
cost generation/transmission program.
6.10  During the period up to 1990, the actual level of peak demand in the
SIC (2,326 MW) remained very close to the forecast. In 1991, because of a
drought, it was below SAR estimates, only to exceed them by circa 8% at
2,778 MW in 1992. Overall, growth of peak demand averaged 6.7% p.a.
compared to 4.3% p.a. anticipated in the SAR. Development of energy
generation was similar to peak demand (11,866 GWh in 1987, 16,302 GWh
in 1992 or 6.6% p.a.). The increase in transmission capacity of the Project
therefore seems justified.
6.11  The current forecast for peak demand of 4,316 MW in 2000 is based
on a 5.7% growth rate, in accordance with a 5% growth rate of the
economy. In view of the strong growth of the Chilean economy in the last
three years, which was inconceivable in the mid 1980s at the time of
appraisal, the current forecast appears rather conservative. Only if
considerable efficiency increases in production and end-use are realized
and/or economic growth rates are substantially reduced will peak demand
expand at this rate.



- 8 -
6.12  As the project was part of the least-cost expansion program for the
power sector, an isolated economic evaluation of the project was not made,
because it was not meaningful to allocate benefits to the various components
of the whole program. Instead, the internal rate of return for the overall
1986-95 investment program for the SIC was calculated at 11.2%, based on
data provided by CNE, which in turn drew on information made available
from the state owned power companies. Since privatization, CNE no longer
obtains this type of data. It is therefore not possible to recalculate the actual
rate of return of the investment program. This would not only require data
on past performance of the many companies involved in the SIC, but also
knowledge of their future plans, which as private companies they have little
interest in providing. However, the information given in previous paragraphs
on demand development, investment costs, and time of commissioning
demonstrates that actual developments exceeded those of the appraisal
forecast. It thus seems safe to assume that the cost effectiveness was actually
better than estimated in the SAR, and possibly the internal rate of return as
well.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.1   Benefits of the installations are expected to be sustained throughout
their service life given ENDESA's excellent maintenance record. Experience
with the equipment so far has been above average. The only problem
detected was that 25 % of the transformers showed some minor oil leakage
which the supplier still has to repair. The major risk has been the exposure
of the transmission line to vandalism (11 cases) and terrorism (4 cases). No
permanent damage resulted.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1   Only 63 staffdays were spent in the field for project preparation and
appraisal, and 53 staffdays for supervision. This low level of staff input
represents the economies of scale made possible through the managing of two
power projects that advanced basically at the same speed (the other being the
Pehuenche Hydroelectric Project), the straightforwardness of the project, and
the experience of the implementing agency. In retrospect, staff was too
conservative in assessing the potential for dynamic changes caused by
privatization. The continuation of the guarantee of the Republic of Chile in
the case of privatization of ENDESA should have been stipulated. Financial
covenants were also not tailored sufficiently to ENDESA's future character
as a private company. At least a dividend cap related to actual cash
generation should have been covenanted. During implementation, Bank staff
showed flexibility when ENDESA decided to redesign the project within a
relatively brief period after Board approval. Supervision was adequate with
no delays in project execution attributable to slow response by the Bank.

9.    Borrower Performance
9.1   The performance of ENDESA in managing the project was highly
satisfactory, and was given high marks by Bank staff. ENDESA is a
disciplined entity, which was reflected in its active participation in the
preparation of the project, its attention to detail during supervision, the
exacting standards it set for its contractors, and its periodic reports on project
implementation. It continues to be a large organization with a high degree of
specialization requiring a great amount of coordination. Its transformation
from a publicly to a privately owned corporation primarily affected its
approach to cost and financial management, but in no way has implied a
lowering of technical standards.
10.   Bank-Borrower Relationship
10.1 The relationship between ENDESA and the Bank was a close one
characterized by considerable continuity in the staff and managers working
on the project both in Chile and in the Bank (with the exception of changes
brought about by the Bank's reorganization in 1987). Perhaps the only area
in which the Bank could not exercise a positive influence on the course of
events was the restructuring of the power sector prior to privatization, as
well as the modalities of the sale of the public power companies in general
and ENDESA in particular.
11.   Consulting Services
11. 1 ENDESA preferred to use first its engineering department and
afterwards its affiliate INGENDESA as consultants instead of hiring outside
consultants through Bank-approved procedures. Overall, they performed
well. Engineering costs as a percentage of project costs were relatively high,
which in part can be explained by the need to redesign the project.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  Project documentation and data include the SAR, the legal documents,
the progress and final reports by the Borrower, supervision reports by the
Bank, correspondence, financial statements, annual and audit reports. The
SAR and legal documents were adequately prepared and generally
comprehensive and did provide a useful framework of reference during
project implementation. Semi-annual progress reports were prepared
regularly informing on project implementation, status, and the financial
situation of the Borrower. Audit reports were comprehensive and submitted
on time, all auditor's opinions were unqualified. The final project report was
helpful in preparing this report. Bank records were well kept and
information retrieval was easy.

PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Letter from ENDESA, dated November 11, 1993 (translation)
From the analysis of the content of Part I it can be deduced that it
interprets faithfully the objectives that were taken into account when the
project was developed, as well as its implementation and results. Also of
interest is the description given about the evolution of ENDESA during the
recent years. It allows the reader to understand the level of development
which the company has achieved.
In addition, the relationship with the analysts of the Bank should be
specially highlighted, as well as their flexibility to face the changes in the
project when necessary. For example, at the time when the studies and
analysis indicated that it was convenient to change from single to double
circuit.
The flexibility and extent of judgement shown by the technical and
financial staff of the Bank made it possible to develop the project, thereby
making compatible the aspirations of the lender and borrower.
We consider the flexibility shown by the parties a point worth
highlighting. This should serve as an objective for future projects.
Moreover, given the experience of the Bank and ENDESA in this
type of projects, there were no frictions between officials of the two entities.
Relations were conducted at a cordial, honest and professional level. This
deserves to be emphasized, and was the reason for great effectiveness during
the evolution and execution of the project.
