MEMORANDUM AND RECCNMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEPNATIONAL PEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATTON
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO) THE REPUBTLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A SIJCOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and reco menda-ion on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 16.1 million (US$21.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms and 40 years maturity and would help finance urban
development in Burundi.
2.      Tragic events shook Burundi last August.  A mission visited Burundi
in October to assess tha situation and its likely evolution. It concluded
that the currer.t Government approach -- working toward reconciliation and
building national unity .-- represents the best hope of peacefully resolving
the long s.onding ethnic issues which have affected the country. Our
assistance to burundi will continue supporting Government's efforts to
ensure that the benefits of economic development accrue to all Burundians.
This proposed urban project is an important step in this long-term
strategy.
3.  Background: With a population of about 5 uillion, Burundi is the
second most densely populated country in Africa. With a constant growth
rate of 32, which corresponds to a decline of the fertility rate, the
population would be 7.5 million by the year 2000 and 10 million by the year
2010. The present percentage of urban population is only 7%. If this
percentage were not to increase, the rural population would double by the
year 2010, greatly increasing the pressure on already scarce land.
Therefo-e, the additional rural population will have to migrate into the
eastern lowlands, where population density is lowest, and into the towns.
Up until now, significant urban development has been confined to the
Bujumbura area. The city grew rapidly during the 1950's and 1960's, at
annual rates of 6-9%, but its growth slowed down during the 1970's to a
current 3-5% per year. In the secondary centers, due to administrative
restrictions, growth rates have been highly unstable. However, the need
for decentralization and mobilization of local resources has progressively
emerged during the Fourth Development Plan (1983-1987). The preparation of
the Fifth Development Plan (1988-1992) has shown that an acceleration of
urban growth rates, both in Bujumbura and in secondary towns, is a
necessary condition for modernization of agriculture, long-term food
security, employment generation and income growth rates. The purpose of
the second urban project is to deal with this expected growth in an
efficient and affordable manner. The First Urban Project
(Credit 1049-BU) assisted the Government by improving living conditions of
the urban poor through provision of basic infrastructure (serviced sites
and neighborhood upgrading) and loans for housing construction and
improvement; promotion of artisans through training and credit;
construction and renovation of primary schools; and institutional and
especially financial strengthening of the Municipality to provide
maintenance services to Bujumbura.



2
4. Prolect Oblectives: The long-term objective of the project is to set
the stage for an acceleration of the urban growth rate, particularly in
secondary towns. This will be based on a better division of labor between
rural and urban populations, on the development of activities and
employment in urban areas and on the strengthening of urban-rural linkages.
The proposed project constitutes the cornerstone of the new urban policy,
and must be considered as a major step in a longer-term process of
modernization of Burundi's economy, that will have implications on all
other sectors including agriculture. In the short term, in order to
strengthen the economy of secondary towns, the project would provide the
necessary infrastructure and community facilities, as well as employment
opportunities, and would estajlish the institutional and financial
environment that would help these semi-rural agglomerations to evolve into
actual urban centers. The project would expand the experience of the first
urban project in improving the living conditions of the urban population in
Bujumbura and in five selected secondary centers, mainly by upgrading
existing low-income neighborhoods.
S. Prolect Description: The proposed project wonld include the following
components in five secondary centerst Gitega, Ngozi, Kayanza, Rumonge and
Bururi, and in Bujumbura.
(a)     Promotion of Artisanst  technical and financial assistance,
provision of workshops and stores, creation of activity
areas and machine/training centers, and provision of
installation and equipment creditsl
(b)     Uparadint of Infrastructure:  roads and drainage, mainly in
the urban low-income areas which are poorly served;
(c)     Housing:  upgrading of 15 ha and development of 30 ha at
Gasenyi, on the northern outskirts of Bujumbura, and
opening up of new areas at Gitegs, Rumonge, Ngozi and
Kayanza. This component also includes provision for
housing credits mainly for low income families in Bujumbura
and Gitega, and creation of a self-sustaining Housing Fund;
(d)     Community Facilitiess  markets with sheds, small shops,
stores, cold storage rooms and slaughterhouses. Social
facilities:  five health centers; and a community hall at
Gasenyi;
(e)     Institutional Strenathening:  technical assistance for the
communes, upgrading of commune resources, reinforcement of
financial services and reform of the legislation governing
communal finances, creation of an Urban Equipment Fund for
Secondary Centers, and a study on communal resources;
(f)     Training:  for communal financial and technical staff, and
for project staff; and



3
(g)     Project Coordination:  technical assistance and facilities
for a project unit established in Bujumbura.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$24.1 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$13.7 million (57%). A breakdown of
costs antA the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procvrement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key pro,ect processing events and the
status of Bank Troup operations i4. Burundi are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  Map is attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7013-BU,
dated July 20, 1988, is also attached.1
6. Rationale for IDA Involvement: The Second Adjustment Program
(Cr. 1919), approved by the Executive Directors in June 1988, aims at
achieving a more rapid GDP growth while diversifying the economy to reduce
its dependence on coffee. The urban sector can make an important
contribution to the growth of commercit agriculture. IDA's continuous
dialogue with the government under the Lrst Urban project has been
essential to set up mechanisms to fostex efficient urban growth in
Bujumbura. IDA can also make a crucial contribution to establish the
financial and institutional environment which can assist the growth of
secondary centers.
7. Axreed Actions: The Government has agreed to the following: (i)
formulating guidelines for a national urban policy acceptable to IDA; (ii)
approval of a new organization of the Bujumbura Municipality; (iii) reform
of legislation regarding communal finances and amendment of land tax and
tax on rental income, in order to improve communal financial resources; and
(iv) creation of an'Urban Equipiint Find for Secondary Centers   Conditious
of effectiveness will be: (i) promulgation of decree-laws transferring the
land and rental income taxes to the Municipality of Bujumbura and to the
communes; and (ii) submission of a draft decree for the creation of a
Housing Fund.
8. Benefitst The project will improve the living conditions in Gasenyi
(Bujumbura) and the five secondary towns, and will provide 650 new serviced
plots in Gasenyi. The project will also strengthen the operations of
existing urban institutions and contribute to the development of new
institutions. Finally, the project will help employment generation by
promotion of artisans and increase monetary income of the urban as well as
rural population in the towns covered by the project and in their
hinterland.
1/ Other than on general country grounds (whose assessment is reflected
here), the August events have had no direct impact on the project's
appraisal. Hence the staff appraisal report, which was ready for
distribution to the Executive Directors in July, has not been modified for
time and cost reasons.

9. Risks: At the country level, the major risks are those inherent in
opening up an heretofore tightly controlled society. The Government's
determination to build national unity, and the support of these efforts by
the international community, should help minimize these risks. At the
project level, the main risks faced by the project are those derived from
weaknesses of local authorities. Specific measures, including a high
degree of institutional support, have been included as part of the project
to limit these risks.
10. Recommendation:
I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

(1) US$ amounts are computed at rate of negotiations dates for the Original Principals,
whereas the current rate is applied to the Undisbursed Amounts.
(2) Because of the depreciation of the $US w.r.t. the SDR (i) it is possible that the
Undisbursed amount is higher than the Original amount, and (ii) the sum of Total
now held by IDA and Bank and Total Undisbursed, is higher than Total outstanding.
