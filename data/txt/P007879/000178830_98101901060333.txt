PARAGUAY
SEVENTH LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         The Republic of Paraguay.
Beneficiaries:   Livestock Fund (FG).
Loan Amount:      US$25.0 million.1!
Loan Terms:       17 years, including four years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Relending:        The local currency equivalent of the Loan's proceed would be
et-lent to FG at an interest rate of 0.5% above the Bank rate
for repayment in 17 years, including four years of grace. The
Government of Paraguay would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:    The project aims to increase livestock output, for which the
country has a comparative advantage, thereby increasing the
incomes of agricultural producers and the export earnings of
the country; and strengthen the administrative and technology
transfer capabilities of FG. It would provide subloans to
about 350 large-scale ranchers with holdings in excess of
2,500 ha; about 700 medium-scale ranchers with 250 to 2,500 ha
of land; about 225 specialized small-scale livestock
producers, especially dairy farmers, with holdings up to 250
ha; and some 445 cattle fatteners. Funds would be provided
for purchase of feeder steers and on-farm investments in:
(a) pasture establishment, improvement and subdivision; (b)
provision of watering points; (c) infrastructure in livestock
handling facilities; (d) purchase of breeding cattle; (e)
destumping of arable land; and (f) purchase of machinery and
equipment. The project is expected to have an important
impact on increasing production and productivity of the
livestock industry and augmenting the export earnings of the
country. It is expected that aggregate production of beef
would be increased by 121,000 tons and that of milk by 10.4
million liters. (It is estimated that three fourths of the
incremental meat products would be exported.) The technical
and administrative capacity of FG would also be strengthened.
Previous Bank experience in the sector with FG, as well as the
market prospects for live cattle in Brazil and the recent
increase in export of processed beef to countries in Latin
America and Europe, would indicate that risks are minimal;
however, given the importance of international markets for
establishing farm-gate prices, a significant drop in prices in
these markets could reduce demand for term credit.
1/ A "B" loan for US$15.0 million is being considered.

II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Background
2.01      Agriculture is the most important economic activity in Paraguay,
accounting for about 30% of GDP, over 95% of the country's total exports, and
nearly half of the employment. Seventy percent of the total population of 3
million lived in rural areas in 1980. The sector supplies most of the
products needed for domestic consumption except for wheat, dairy products and
fruits, which are imported mainly from neighboring countries. The Eastern
region, with good soils and well distributed rainfall, is the principal crop
production area and accounts for over 97% of the population and GDP and
comprises pasture, crop and forested areas. The Chaco area, to the west of
the Paraguay river, generates only 1.5% of the agricultural production,
mostly from extensive livestock ranches.
2.02      Much of Paraguay's land area is most suitable for livestock
production. In some areas such as the lower Chaco and the south-central part
of the country, low soil fertility and/or low, poorly distributed rainfall,
only allow extensive livestock raising. In other areas, where soil fertility
is high, extensive livestock production is now practiced due to the low
rainfall. In the extreme southeast, there are areas with crop potential for
production but the investment costs to drain frequently flooded lands would
be prohibitively expensive under present conditions. Parts of eastern
Paraguay remain in livestock production for lack of adequate transport
infrastructure.
The Livestock Subsector
2.03      Cattle is the most important class of livestock in Paraguay.
Smaller species such as poultry, swine and sheep have relatively little
importance although the country is generally self-sufficient in eggs, poultry
and pork. It is estimated that the average annual growth rate of the
livestock subsector has been between 3 and 4% during the 1970s. Reliable
data on total beef production however, are not available because of
non-registered slaughter for consumption in the interior and the non-registered
sale of live cattle to Brazil for fattening or slaughter. Local trade
estimates indicate that up to 300,000 head may have been marketed to Brazil in
peak years, such as those from 1978 to 1980.
2.04      The potential of the subsector by far exceeds present production
levels. The incorporation of better, already tested and known management and
technological practices could rapidly increase production in the medium-term
with economically feasible investments. However, any significant increase will
require a change in attitude of the traditional producers; relatively
stable export demand for cattle or processed beef at attractive viable
prices; and the availability of financing, research data and technical
assistance.
Marketing and Prices
2.05      In general, the marketing of agricultural products in Paraguay has
been free from Government regulations, and the prices for most products are



- 4 -
determined by domestic supply and demand and external market conditions,
especially in Argentina and Brazil. The only exceptions are the guaranteed
price for wheat, payable at the mills, and reference, but not guaranteed,
prices for sugar and cotton.
2.06      Domestic beef cattle prices have improved since the mid-1970s because
of increased internal demand, installation of live cattle auction markets,
improved quality and high demand from Brazil. Since the late 1970s, exports of
processed meat have been declining, in part because of the overvaluation of the
exchange rate. Registered exports of meat almost ceased at the exchange rate
of G 126 = US$1, since exporters could not compete with the prices paid in the
internal market or prices that could be obtained for unregistered live cattle
sales to Brazil. Beginning in July 1982, Government approved a preferential
exchange rate for processed beef exports, which in March 1983 was about G 190,
increasing further to G 205 in May 1983. At these exchange rates, the
exporting industry is becoming competitive and exports of processed beef are
increasing.
2.07      Total milk production is insufficient even for Paraguay's low per
capita consumption and is marketed mainly in the raw form through individual
consumer distribution. The lack of an organized processing industry and
competition from imported processed and dry milk have an important negative
impact on prices to producers. Commercial milk production has been based on a
temperate climate model using dairy breeds, mainly Holstein cattle, which
requires costly feeding and management inputs. Recent investments in a milk
processing plant by a Mennonite cooperative will provide pasteurized milk to
Asuncion and there are plans to modernize one of the milk plants in Asuncion.
The Ministry of Agriculture has requested funds from the Second Preinvestment
Studies Project (Loan 1780-PA) to conduct a complete study of the milk
industry, including production, processing and marketing. This study, in
addition to cooperative investments and further technical assistance, should
Lead to a rationalization of the industry.
2.08      Prices for pork products are low because of the lack of a significant
processing industry and the low quality of animals produced. The production
and marketing of poultry is controlled by a small number of producers and it is
well organized.
2.09      The Government places high priority on the development of the
livestock subsector in view of the comparative advantage vis-a-vis crop
production in most parts of the country and the potential for increasing
foreign exchange earnings.
2.10      Agriculture is subject to a tax on farm property of 1%.  The value is
established periodically with a supplement for large properties. A transfer
tax cf G 1,000 (US$6.25) is levied on each head of cattle sold; also,
slaughterhouses and meat processing industries are subject to a tax of G 1,025
per head. Agricultural inputs and products are free from sales taxes but
import duties are significant and range from 59% on the c.i.f. price of
generating equipment to 24% for most machinery and averages about 9% for the
investment items contemplated in the project.



-5-
Research and Extension
2.11      The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) is responsible for
policy formulation and for administering support services. Its most important
activities are research, extension and marketing and collection of agricultural
statistics. There are two centers and six substations for agricultural
research and three livestock research substations with a total staff of 73
professionals. While there have been some successes in crop research, there
has not been much progress in the livestock sector because of limited funds and
lack of trained scientists as well as inappropriate research directions.  In
part, lack of funding is the consequence of the long-term nature of livestock
research, as compared to crop research which gives almost immediate returns.
With the possible exception of pasture research, this deficiency will only be
critical in the long term. The Bank is presently conducting a sector study
which will consider the need for possible assistance ir. the area of research.
The information gained by Argentina and Brazil in livestock research could
prove to be ver-'  seful to Paraguay.  Improved technology has been imported,
mainly from Brazil, but is incorporated haphazardly on a trial and error
basis. This applies particularly to livestock. The extension service, with
some 300 technicians, also suffers from lack of adequately trained staff and
insufficient funding.  The National Development Bank (BNF), with 93
agricultural technicians, also provides some extension services. Neither of
these agencies has significant programs for livestock production. Private
middlemen and suppliers are also sources of technology transfer, especially in
the principal export crops and for disease prevention and control in
livestock. The National University of Asuncion provides most of the advanced
level agricultural education and some research. The Livestock Fund,
strengthened by credit support from the Bank, maintains a task force of
technicians for credit and technical assistance. They provide limited
technical assistance, besides helping ranchers prepare investment plans and
loan applications, supplemented by contracted private technicians. It is the
only significant source of assistance to the livestock sector.
Agricultural Credit
2.12      Institutional agricultural credit in Paraguay is provided by the
general banking system and certain specialized entities. The banking system
consists of the Central Bank, the Government-owned National Development Bank
(BNF), 22 private commercial banks and the specialized public credit erntities
comprise the Livestock Fund (FG) and the Small Farmer Rehabilitation Credit
Agency (CAH). Farmer associations and cooperatives which are affiliated either
with the National Credit Cooperative, Ltd. (CREDICOOP) or the Federation of
Producers Cooperatives (FECOPROD) also act as credit intermediaries.
Non-institutional sources are important in providing seasonal production credit
and consumption credit to smallholder producers of cash crops.
2.13      BNF is by far the most important source of institutional credit to
crop and mixed crop/livestock farmers in Paraguay.  In 1981 it accounted for
51% of the US$200 million total agricultural institutional lending in Paraguay
serving about 15% of the farmers and financing 30% of the area under cash
crops. Over 80% of :its borrowers were small-scale farmers. In spite of the
importance of BNF, FG is basically the only source of term lending in the
livestock sector. FG was established with Bank assistance in 1969 and became
an independent branch of the Central Bank in 1974 and it has developed into an



- 6 -
expanding source of investment credit for livestock.  Of the six credits/loans
from the IDA/Bank primarily for financing investment programs for livestock
production, the last three have been implemented by FG as an autonomous
institution. FG has provided credit assistance to a total of about 8,500
producers, of which 2,000 received subloans under the most recent loan
(1979-PA).
2.14      The beneficiaries of FG lending are, in general, commercially
oriented livestock producers. Traditionally they have been classified into
small, medium and large categories based on physical farm size, which is not
always an appropriate indicator of the production potential of the farm. Under
the most recent project (Loan 1979-PA), the typical "large-scale ranch" had an
average of 4,000 ha with 1,900 head of cattle and a net income before project
of about US$12,000. The average size of investment loans approved was
US$62,400.  The "medium-scale ranch" had 1100 ha, 330 head of cattle and about
US$3,000 net income. The average subloan size was US$28,400. The "small
producer" had 54 ha and 14 cattle but almost all of his cash income was from
sale of cotton and soybeans. The average loan size was US$10,600. Hence, the
large producers benefitting from the project were not among the bigger cattle
ranchers which typically have more than 10,000 ha and more than 5,000 cattle.
In Paraguay these very large producers do not work with FG because of
restrictions on subloan size, and have other sources of financing. In recent
years, these large landholders have been primarily foreign investors.
2.15      Policy-making and loan approval functions in FG are vested in a
coordinating committee which operates as a Board of Directors; it consists of a
senior staff member from CB as President, a senior staff member from BNF, and
FG's Technical Director. There are two in-line Directorates --Administrative
and Technical-- and one in-line Evaluations Division. The Directorates are
assisted by specialized Divisions and Sections with headquarters in Asuncion.
There are three branch offices in the interior operating as extensions of the
Teclhnical Directorate (in Concepcion, San Ignacio, and Ciudad Presidente
Stroessner).
2.16      FG has operated since its inception with funds provided from World
Bank credits/loans. In the initial years, CB provided counterpart funds, but
in the last four projects these have been generated within FG by roll-over
funds from earlier Bank/IDA projects. In the sixth project (1979-PA), the OPEC
Fund provided US$10.0 million of cofinancing. Total Bank/IDA support since
1963 has been US$72.45 million, with total project costs of US$136.4 million.
Between 1973 and the end of 1982, FG, with its own funds, has provided
subloans, additional to Bank projects, for a total of US$28.0 million. These
subloans have been for periods of one to five years, primarily for
supplementary investments and purchase of breeding stock. Because of the rapid
disbursement of 1979-PA and the resulting demand for counterpart funds, FG now
has very limited funds available for non-Bank financed lending.
2.17      FG has maintained a strong financial position throughout its
history. Average revenues from lending operations have been almost twice the
average borrowing costs of FG and operating expenses have been maintained at
under 2% of the average loan portfolio. Average cost of borrowing has ranged
between 4 and 5%, while average revenue from loans has ranged from 8% to 9%.
FG has been characterized by a strong management and emphasis on careful
selection of beneficiaries, preparation of detailed investment plans, close



- 7 -
supervision of investments, a history of applying positive interest rates, and
prompt collection of subloans. FG's gross disbursed and outstanding loan
portfolio as of December 1982 was equivalent to US$98.0 million. This
portfolio accounted for over 95% of total assets, and it was funded by external
loans (70%) and equity (30%). FG has kept the amount of principal debts in
arrears below 5% except in 1982, when it reached 5.8%. As of December 31,
1982, the number of loans granted was 6,855, with an aggregated principal
amount close to US$155 million equivalent.
2.18      The past association of IDA/Bank has been of great importance in
the institutional building of FG. The earlier IDA credits allowed the
institution to strengthen its financial position rapidly through the large
spread between costs of borrowing and lending and, while this margin has
decreased with Bank loans, it has still been sufficient to permit continued
improvements in the financial position of FG. The allowance for this spread
reflects a Government decision to provide for the capitalization of FG, instead
of relying on budgetary allocations for this purpose.
Bank Group Involvement
2.19      The proposed project would be the thirteenth Bank Group-supported
agricultural project in Paraguay. The first was a general-purpose project in
1951, followed by five livestock projects, four rural development projects, a
livestock and agricultural development project, and an agricultural credit
project, which has recently been approved to provide investment subloans to
small- and medium-sized crop producers throughout the country. In general, the
experience with these projects has been satisfactory, and, despite
implementation delays, they have contributed to increased agricultural
production and hence general living standards of the rural population.
2.20      The Bank has supported the livestock subsector lending since 1963.
The first three operations (Credits 47 and 86, Credit/Loan 156-PA and 620-PA),
were implemented by BNF in conjunction with FG which was a coordinating
committee established in the CB. In 1974, with the implementation of the
Fourth Livestock Project (1037-PA), FG was given full legal and administrative
autonomy and has since successfully implemented the livestock components of
Loans 1674 and 1979-PA. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) of Credit
156-PA and Loan 620-PA by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) indicated
that beef production and productivity fell short of the appraisal projections
as a result of less efficient ranch management, more limited technical
assistance than had been expected and, to a lesser degree, insufficient
progress in expanding improved pastures. The financial rate of return to
sub-borrowers was calculated to be 18% while the economic rate of return was
11% compared to appraisal estimates of 24%-30% and 29% respectively.2/ The
most recent PPAR on a livestock project (Loan 1037-PA) indicated that the
project had brought about increases in productivity, but most of the increase
in production (56.5 m tons live weight of beef and 31.5 million liters of milk)

resulted from increases in production area. The project economic rate of
return was estimated at 23% compared to the appraisal estimate of 24%.3/
2.21      The Livestock and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1674-PA)
included credit and technical assistance components for FG. An extension unit
was established to provide improved technical assistance, primarily to smaller
producers, and an expatriate co-director was employed for three years under a
cost sharing UNDP technical assistance project for which the Bank was the
executing agency. In this project, most medium- and all large-scale ranchers,
who were not themselves technicians, were required to contract an FG-approved
private technician to assist in ranch planning and management improvement. The
credit portion is fully disbursed and the technical assistance project will be
completed in December 1983. The Livestock Development Project (Loan 1979-PA)
which became effective in December of 1981 is 90% disbursed. Under this
project, FG provided free technical assistance to small- and lower level
medium-scale producers.  This project included an important component (45% of
project funds) for small producers based on the assumption that mixed farms
(livestock/crops) but predominantly based on livestock would be established.
In actual practice, these producers were primarily interested in investments
for crop production. Swine production, which had been expected to be the
primary livestock component for the mixed farms did not prosper because of lack
of demand for the product. Moreover, FG was not equipped to provide
specialized technical assistance to this type of producer and it considered
that such lending was in direct competition with the area of responsibility of
BNF. The subloan recovery rate for these producers has been lower than for
livestock investments, because of climatic factors and reduced prices to
producers because of international market conditions. Although physical
production achievements have been lower than appraisal estimates, they have
generally continued to improve in the last few years since most of the earlier
investments were in the provision of water points and fencing of native
pastures and these do not result in immediate increases in productivity.
2.22      The Bank's past association with FG has helped substantially in terms
of institution building and has assisted in the establishment and maintenance
of a beef pricing and marketing system essentially free of distortions and
restrictions. However, despite significant progress over the years, more
remains to be done.
III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01      The proposed project was prepared by FG and the Preparation Report
was received by the Bank in January 1983. A Bank mission appraised the project
in April 1983.

(Loan 1037-PA)".  OED Report Sec M81-3457 of May 26, 1981.

Objectives and Description
3.02      The project proposes to assist in: (a) the expansion of term lending
and technical assistance to the livestock subsector through FG; (b)
strengthening the institution to meet the requirements of a rapidly expanding
number of clients and portfolio; (c) introducing FG to the international
banking system through cofinancing; (d) increasing the income of producers; and
(e) improving the balance of payments situation of the country through
increased exports of beef and reduced imports of milk.
The Lending Program
3.03      Over a four-year investment period, the project would finance up to
1,700 subloans. The projected inflation in Paraguay between 1984 and 1987
could reduce this number to about 1,400. The beneficiaries would be
small-scale (up to 250 ha) mainly dairy producers, and medium- (from 250 to
2,500 ha) and large-scale (above 2,500 ha) beef producers. Mediumr and
long-term subloans to these beneficiaries would finance on-farm investments
consisting of land destumping, purchase of equipment, seeding of improved
pastures, construction of livestock handling facilities, provision of water
points and purchase of improved breeding stock. A supplemental short-term
credit line financed by cofinancier and local funds would be available for the
purchase of feeder steers to more efficiently utilize improved pastures
developed with subloans from FG under this or previous projects. The cash
flows, farm budgets and rates of return for the three investment models are
included in Annex 2. The estimated average size of investment and subloans;
physical ranch size and distribution among the types of beneficiaries are as
follows:
Large         Medium         Small
Scale          Scale        Scale         Cattle
Ranches        Ranches      Ranches       Fattening
Average Investment (US$)       122,500        59,400         75,600            _
Average Subloans (US$)          86,000        44,700         67,700       28,000
Average Farm Size                4,800           900             80            -
Number of Beneficiaries            350           700            225          445
3.04      The proportion of subloans assigned to large- and medium-scale
producers reflects the emphasis placed by Government on the critical need to
increase exports and foreign exchange earnings, and the fact that these are the
types of farmers who mainly contribute to the production of beef which is one
of the four major exports of the country. Besides, the number of small
producers principally engaged in livestock production is relatively small.
Many of these are mixed farmers whose activity is, predominantly, crop
production, and whose credit needs can be adequately attended by the BNF from
the resources available to it from its external credit lines which are mainly
designed to serve such beneficiaries.

Institutional Development
3 05      The project would provide for the preparation and implementation of a
reorganization program for the administrative, accounting and technical
functions of FG. While these are generally sound, such changes would allow the
FG to expand its present capacity of about 900 subloans per year to a level, in
the medium-term, approaching 2,000 annual clients.  It would also provide for a
more effective technical assistance role. This plan would more equitably
distribute the activities and responsibilities of second-tier management,
separate the administrative and service responsibilities of the administrative
director, replace the technical director on the coordinating committee,
computerize the processing and storage of data, strengthen the internal
auditing system and provide for changes in the accounting system, including the
adoption of the accrual system. In mid 1983, FG contracted two local
consulting firms to assist in the institutional and accounting system
reorganization and to provide a systems analysis for the eventual purchase of a
computer and the development of necessary software programs. The consultant
firm for reorganization has presented the first draft of its report which is
being discussed with FG. A draft of this program, along with job descriptions,
would be provided to the Bank for comments and the adoption of the
reorganization program, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. The main proposals for the reorganization were discussed during
negotiations and appropriate assurances were obtained.
3.06      A four-year work program for the Technical Division was discussed
during negotiations. It is a condition of effectiveness that this program be
accepted by the Bank and put into effect. The program would provide for among
others:
(a) A technical assistance program for all sub-borrowers, for a minimum
of two years from the date of subloan approval, such assistance will
be provided to small ranchers by FG staff and to others by rancher
financed private technicians;
(b) A specific training program for FG technicians in the areas of
subloan preparation, farm record systems, project evaluation, forage
production and general livestock husbandry;
(c) At least one general meeting per year of all FG technicians to
discuss FG lending and technical assistance policies (the first to be
organized not later than June 30, 1984) and an annual technical
seminar for FG and private technicians, with their proposed programs,
(the first to be held prior to October 31, 1984);
(d) A schedule of field visits by the technical director for supervision
of project implementation;
(e) Specific methods to be utilized for supervision and evaluation of
private technicians contracted as a condition of subloans; and
(f)  A timetable for the implementation of the internal investment and
technical audit of a sample of subprojects financed under the 1979-PA
and the proposed loans.
Assurances on these points were obtained during negotiations.
The Project Executing Agency
3.07      Fondo Ganadero would be responsible for executing the project.  This
institution was organized in 1969 as a part of CB and in 1974 was upgraded to
an autonomous entity in the CB to provide developmental assistance to the



- 11 -
livestock subsector (para 2.20). A full description of the operations and
organizational and financial structure is presented in Annex 1 and the Project
Performance Audit Reports for two previous projects are summarized in Annex 3.
In spite of the favorable performance of FG to date, additional changes in
organization and operational procedures are required if it is to be able to
meet the demands of an increasing portfolio and provide for much needed
improvements in its technical services. Provisions for these improvements are
given in paras 3.05 and 3.06.
3.08      On the basis of the lending conditions foreseen under the proposed
project (paras 3.10-3.11), FG's financial position is expected to continue to
be sound.  The interest spread between new loans and new borrowings and the
fact that sub-loan grace and maturity periods, are shorter than those for FG's
new borrowings, are expected to generate sufficient funds to amortize the new
debt and to reduce FG's dependence on outside borrowing. Returns of 9% to 15%
on the average loan portfolio are attainable during the forecast period
(1983-92). Paras 4.01 and 4.05, as well as Annex 1 provide details on these
projections.
Project Execution
3.09      The Government of Paraguay would be the borrower.  The proceeds of
the loan would be made available to FG in local currency under arrangements to
be covered by a subsidiary loan agreement, similar to that of previous
projects, between the Government and FG. Execution of the subsidiary
agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. Assurances on this point were obtained at negotiations.
Lending Terms and Conditions
3.10      Government would accept the foreign exchange risk and would on-lend
loan funds to FG at 0.5% above the cost of external financing. This relatively
small commission is justified on the basis of the desire to improve FG's
capitalization and the fact that FG will bear the risk of any increases in
variable interest rates on external financing. Project subloans would bear
interest and commission charges at an initial effective interest rate of no
less than 18% per annum for small- and medium-scale producers (the same as
BNF's interest rate for agricultural lending) and no less than *20% for
large-scale producers. In addition, a one-time front-end fee of 4% for
small-scale producers and 6% for medium- and large-scale producers would be
charged. The effective rates on this basis are positive in real terms and
cover FG's financial and operating costs. In line with FG's policy of
providing loans at positive interest rates, FG, CB and the Bank would review
the rates charged at least once a year and more frequently if necessary. If it
is found that these do not cover FG's net operating costs and maintain the real
value of its capital, they would be modified to meet these criteria in respect
of new subloans. Real interest rates would be determined by comparing rates
charged with reference to FG's financial and administrative costs and the
variation of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the previous calendar year.
Inflation was 22% in 1980, 14% in 1981 and 7% in 1982; and is projected to be
17% in 1983, 14% in 1984 and an average of 9% between 1985-88. If necessary
modifications are not implemented within 60 days of a decision to do so, FG
would not make further commitments of loan proceeds until an agreement is
reached on a new rate among FG, CB and the Bank. Assurances were obtained at



- 12 -
negotiations on these points. CB's approval of these subloan terms and
conditions would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.
3.11      Subloans would finance up to 90% of investment costs for small- and
75% for medium-size specialized livestock producers, and up to 70% for
large-scale ranchers. A summary of the on-lending terms is shown in Annex 1,
para 14. Subloans made to project beneficiaries would follow the sound
stanrard procedures presently used by FG. Investment subloans would be
processed and approved on the basis of detailed farm plans that demonstrate the
technical and financial viability of the proposed investment.  A producer
applying for a repeater subloan would have a study made by FG of the impact of
his previous subloans and would receive further credit only if an adequate
increase in production or productivity, as a result of the previous investment,
could be demonstrated.  The amount of a subloan allocated for the purchase of
breeding stock would not exceed 70% of the total cost of the investment plan,
unless FG demonstrated to the Bank that a higher level could be justified for
specific subloans. In order to assure adequate producer input into, and
commitment to the investment plan to be financed with a subloan, the following
procedures would be followed: (a) subloan requests would not be acted upon by
the coordinating committee without the signature of the borrower indicating
that he is in agreement with the investment plan; and (b) at the time of
sublcan -registration, the borrower would receive a full set of subloan
documents which would include as a minimum (i) a copy of the investment and
amortization plan, (ii) the physical and financial projections for the
subproject, and (iii) a projection of pasture availability, carrying capacity
and utilization. Assurances were obtained at negotiations on these points.
3.12      Assurances were also obtained at negotiations that the total
outstanding debt for subloans from FG to any individual beneficiary receiving a
subloan under the project would not exceed the equivalent of US$150,000, while
sublcans to a cattle fattener would not exceed US$60,000 at the official
exchange rate at the time of the subloan or short-term loan approval.
Project Costs and Financing
3413      The cost estimates and the financing proposed are based on the
following assumptions:
(a)  Bank and other external financing would reimburse the Government in
US dollars against reimbursement requests in Guaranies. The exchange
rate used for the purpose would initially be G 160 = US$1. This is
also the rate at which FE would be provided for the import of project
inputs. However, the foreign exchange component has been reduced to
correct for a possible overestimate of real foreign exchange costs
since the sub-borrower procures inputs from commercial importers, by
direct imports with foreign exchange purchased from CB and direct
purchases in Brazil and Argentina in local currencies obtained from
the sale of cattle. The estimated average exchange rate for these
purchased imports is about G 210 = US$1, therefore, the foreign
exchange cost was reduced by 26%, reflecting the difference in the
Bank disbursement rate (G 160 = US$1) and the import rate
(G 210 = US$1) and the local costs were increased correspondingly.



- 13 --
The Bank disbursement rate may be altered as agreed between the Bank
and borrower from time to time:4/
(b) the only externally financed component of the project would be the
on-lending program with a total cost of US$89.0 million of which
US$55.0 million would be so funded;
(c) the contribution of the beneficiaries is estimated at US$25.0 million
(21%) and represents, in the aggregate, the minimum contribution
required from producers obtaining subloans; and
(d) project costs were estimated on the basis of April 1983 prices
updated to October 1983.
3.14      The direct foreign exchange costs of the project are relatively high
due to the lack of industrial production in the country and the nature of the
investments to be made. Relatively small amounts of local materials and labor
are required for physical improvements to be financed, while machinery and
equipment items are all imported. The indirect foreign exchange costs are also
high due to the considerable petroleum and spare parts contents.
3.15      The following table shows the project and corresponding foreign
exchange costs:
4/   The G 160 foreign exchange availability for imports is generally economy
wide with the exceptions of petroleum and wheat imports (G 143 = US$1) and
payment of external debt (G 126 = US$1). With normal private bank and CB
commissions and interest on deposited local funds, the effective exchange
rate is about G 178 - 180. Since beef exports receive a weighted exchange
rate of around G 205, there is an implied subsidy from exporters to
importers which would disappear if exchange rates were unified.

External financing would provide 100% of the foreign exchange costs and 1% of
local costs, FG's projected cash flow is sufficient to cover the remaining
local financing costs and operating expenses. These projections are in para
4.01 and Annex 1, Table 1.
3.16      The project would thus be financed by the beneficiaries, FG, Bank and
cofinancier funds. The Bank proposes to provide US$25.0 million, and FONPLATA
has agreed, in principle, to lend US$15.0 million. A "B" loan for an addi-
tional US$15.0 million is being explored with CNCA. Meeting the conditions for
the effectiveness of FONPLATA funding would be a condition of effectiveness of
the Bank loan. FG with its own funds would cover operating and technical
assistance costs. A portion of these costs would be met from a special fund
established from the interest earnings of FG on OPEC Fund cofinacing provided
in conjunction with the most recent Bank loan (1979-PA); these funds can only
be used for technical assistance financing. On this basis, the project's
financing plan would be as follows:

b/   FG would also provide G 1,121 million (US$7.0 million) for administrative
and technical services to the present and on-going projects.
Procurement
3.17      Project beneficiaries would purchase, during a four-year period,
on-farm development inputs from established local agents and other ranchers in
Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. The Paraguayan sales agents for physical
inputs represent a broad spectrum of international and local suppliers. The
use of international competitive bidding would not be practical as purchases
would vary widely in location and time; however, local suppliers represent Bank
member countries and provide the required inputs and goods, vehicles and
equipment as well as services. Items to be procured under the project are not
subject to any quantitative import restrictions.
Disbursements
3.18      The proceeds of the Bank/cofinancier loans are expected to be
disbursed over a period of four years. The Bank would disburse 33% of the
amount of long term investment subloans.  FONPLATA and a "B" loan as



- 16 -
cofinancier, would reimburse, pari passu with the Bank, 19% and 5% respectively
of these investment subloans. In addition, the "B" loan would reimburse 90% of
short term cattle fattEning subloans. A detailed disbursement schedule is
presented in para 4.04. All disbursements would be against certified
statements of expenditures. The control arrangements within FG have worked
satisfactorily in earlier projects and are adequate for continuation of this
procedure. The documentation for expenditures would not be submitted to the
Bank, but would be retained by FG for review by the Bank at any time.
Accounting and Auditing
3.19      Separate project accounts, records and documentation would be
maintained by FG and an accrual basis of accounting would be established to
begin on January 1, 1985. Financial statements of FG, including a statement on
sources and uses of funds, would be audited annually by independent auditors,
satisfactory to the Bank, who would adopt the published Bank norms for auditing
of project accounts. This activity has been carried out in past projects by
the Office of the Superintendent of Banks and has been generally acceptable but
some improvements are needed in procedures (Annex 1, para 8). The actual audit
would include financial information supporting statements of expenditures used
to claim reimbursements from the Bank. Certified copies of the audited
accounts and the report of the auditors would be sent to the Bank no later than
six months after the close of Government's fiscal year (December 31).
Assurances on these points were obtained at negotiations.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
3.20      FG would maintain complete project monitoring and an ongoing and
ex-post evaluation for at least 10% of sub-borrowers in each category. The
procedures utilized in the last two projects are generally good but the quality
of field survey data must be improved.  FG would provide a progress report to
the Bank every six months, including key indicator figures and details on
implementation of the reorganization and technical assistance activities.  A
draft completion report would be prepared by FG's evaluation division and
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the closing date of the
Bank loan. Assurances were obtained at negotiations on these points.
Financial and Economic Justification
3.21      The financial and economic justification of the project has been
assessed through the analysis of three farm models, representing different farm
sizes, locations, technologies and investment plans (Annex 2).   Both the
financial and economic analyses have been prepared in constant mid-1983 prices,
taking into account the international price forecasts published by the Bank's
Commodity Studies and Projections Division. Illustrative farm budgets,
financial and economic rates of return, and cash flows, in constant mid-1983
prices, are in Annex 2 and are summarized in the following table:

scale beef ranches respectively and 33% for dairy producers, and indicate that
it would be profitable for producers to undertake the proposed investment. The
expected rates of return are similar to those under earlier FG projects. The

The proposed investments would remain financially attractive within the limits
of unfavorable developments regarding output, prices, investments, operating
costs, and delays in obtaining the benefits as estimated.
Project Justification
3.23      The project would strengthen the self-financing capability of FG and
increase the availability of investment and production credit to farmers,
thereby enabling them to increase beef and milk output, while facilitating the
specialization, among farms, of the national livestock industry. At full
development, it is expected that aggregate production of beef by the project
(liveweight basis) would be increased by 121,000 tons (equivalent to US$74.7
million in constant 1983 terms) and that of milk by 10.4 million liters (US$3.5
million). These rough estimates of aggregate production increases are based on
the projected number and mix of project sub-loans and the illustrative farm



- 18 -
models and may, therefore, be affected by any unexpected developments related
to prices, costs and adoption of improved technology.  It is expected that
three-fourths of the incremental production would be exported as live cattle or
processed beef. The annual net farm income after debt service and at full
development is expected to increase from US$16,100 to US$64,100 for large-size
beef ranches, from US$4,700 to US$29,700 for medium-size beef ranches, and from
US$5,000 to US$42,400 for small-size dairy farms. During the years of debt
service, these income increases are about one-third to one-half of the levels
reached at full development.
3.24      The project would also contribute to further institution building
through the insistence on continued adoption of sound financial policies by FG;
a reorganization to allow FG to adapt to its increased activities,
responsibilities and portfolio size (para 3.05); improved levels of technical
assistance (para 3.06); and initiation of a shift to computerization of
accounting and portfolio control (para 3.05). In addition, the Bank's presence
is helping FG secure US$30.0 million in cofinancing funds and will allow a
continuation of Bank technical assistance which has been a key factor in the
establishment of a sound financial institution in the FG.
Project Risks
3.25      One of the risks associated with the project relates to beef
exports. Recent exports depended predominantly on the Brazil live cattle
market. If this market should become inaccessible because of import or export
controls or because of a relatively unfavorable change in the value of the
Cruzeiro vis-a-vis the Guarani, live cattle exports would decrease and
substantial pressure would be placed on the Paraguayan exporting meat packers
to increase exports of processed beef.  Since Paraguay consumes only about 50%
of total beef produced, the viability of the livestock industry is dependent
upon the availability of an export market. With the low costs of production of
beef in Paraguay, this product should be able to compete with other exporting
countries and the Government is expected to maintain its present policy of
stimulation of beef exports.
3.26      There is also a certain element of risk associated with the
small-scale dairy producer. The production package requires a level of known
management and technical skills that have not been fully applied. The farmer's
willingness to change to a forage-based production system, his ability to adopt
the mechanical milk handling package and to expand forage production adequately
would be tested. A heavy use of concentrate feeds in lieu of forage would
reduce, but not eliminate, the financial attractiveness of the undertaking.
IV. DETAILED PROJECT FEATURES
Detailed Project Costs and Financing
4.01      All project costs and financing are calculated in US dollars at an
exchange rate of G 160 = US$1. The IBRD loan of US$25.0 million, FONPLATA
cofinancing of US$15.0 million and a "B' loan of US$15.0 million would provide
FG with G 8,800 million representing 45% of total project costs, 48% of
investment costs, 62% of on-lending and 100% of foreign exchange costs. FG



- 19 -
would provide G 5,116 million (38%) for on-lending and G 1,121 million for
operating costs. An analysis of FG's cash flow projections indicates that it
would have adequate resources to provide all counterpart funds for the expanded
project costs assuming that the excellent subloan recovery rate is maintained.
Detailed data on FG's historical and projected financial position are given in
Annex 1, Table 1 and are summarized in the following table:

Disbursements
4.03      Bank disbursements under the two most recent FG projects have been
more rapid than appraisal estimates. The ratio of actual disbursements to
profile estimates was 1.38 for the livestock component of loan 1674-PA and
presently is 1.48 for loan 1979-PA. The ratio for all Bank projects in Paraguay
for the years 1979 to 1982 has been 0.93, 1.18, 0.90, and 1.21 respectively.
4.04      Based on this experience and the unmet subloan demand in the livestock
subsector, the Bank/cofinancier disbursements, assuming loan effectiveness in
early FY1985, are projected as follows:
Fiscal Year                1984          1985          1986          1987       1988

Financial Performance Indicators
4.05      The financial performance of FG has been outstanding in comparison
with similar credit institutions in the region. Starting with very limited
resources in 1974, FG, utilizing roll-over funds from project lending, has
strengthened its financial position over the years. The indicators shown in
the following table and detailed in Annex 1, cover FG's historical and
projected financial performance:

Environmental Impact
4.07      The project is not expected to have any adverse environmental
effects. Land converted to pasture from either forest or abandoned crop areas
would have adequate soil cover to prevent or reduce erosion effects. Very
little deforestation would be financed by the project based on data from the
previous project where only 1% of the hectares under crop or pasture production
received funding for deforestation.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a)  FG would comply with the provisions regarding interest rates charged
on its loans and the annual review of the rates (para 3.10);
(b)  FG would apply the subloan terms and conditions outlined in paragraph
3.11;
(c)  The total subloans outstanding to any individual beneficiary would
not exceed the equivalent of US$150,000, and an individual cattle
fattening subloan would not exceed the equivalent of US$60,000, at
the official exchange rate at the time of subloan approval (para
3.12);
(d)  An accrual basis of accounting would be established by January 1,
1985 (para 3.19);
(e)  FG would be audited annually by independent auditors, satisfactory to
the Bank, who would adopt Bank norms for auditing of project accounts
and certified copies and reports of the auditors would be sent to the
Bank no later than six months after the end of each Government fiscal
year (para 3.19); and
(f)  Project monitoring and reporting would be carried out by FG and the
Bank would be provided with semi-annual progress reports and a draft
completion report, the latter no later than six months after the
completion date of the loan (para 3.20).



- 23 -
5.02      Conditions of- effectiveness would be that: (a) FG had prepared a
reorganization program acceptable to the Bank (para 3.05); (b) a four-year work
program, acceptable to the Bank, had been developed for the technical division
(para 3.06); (c) the Government and FG had executed a subsidiary loan
agreement, satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.09); (d) CB had approved the terms
and conditions of subloans (para 3.10); and (e) all the conditions for the
effectiveness of FONPLATA funding have been met (para 3.16).
5.03      With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$25.0 million for a term of 17
years, including four years of grace.

PARAGUAY
LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Fondo Ganadero
Operation, Organization and Financial Performance
A. Operations
1.        FG has operated since its initiation with funds provided from
IDA/IBRD credits/loans (Credits 47-PA, 86-PA, and 156-PA; and Bank Loans
620-PA, 1037-PA, 1674-PA, and 1979-PA). In the initial years, CB provided
counterpart funds, but in the last four projects, these have been generated by
roll-over funds from earlier Bank/IDA projects. In the sixth project
(1979-PA), the OPEC Fund provided US$10.0 million of cofinancing.  Total
Bank/IDA support since 1963 has been US$72.45 million, with total project costs
of US$136.4 million. Between 1972 and the end of 1982, FG, with its own funds,
plus an 18-month loan, for cattle fattening subloans, from CB in 1981, has
provided subloans, additional to Bank projects for a total of US$28.0 million.
These subloans have been for periods of one to five years, primarily for
supplementary investments and purchase of breeding stock. Because of the rapid
disbursement of 1979-PA and the resulting demand for counterpart funds, FG now
has very limited funds available to cope with credit demand.
B. Organization and Management
2.        FG was established in 1969 (Decree 7383, Presidency of the Republic,
dated December 9, 1969, and Law 189 dated June 10, 1970) as a legal entity
under the jurisdiction of the CB. In 1974, it gained full legal and
administrative autonomy within CB. Under its current organizational structure
(Chart 1), the Coordinating Committee has responsibility for policy-decisions
and loan approvals. This Committe consists of a senior staff member from CB as
President, a senior staff member from BNF, and FG's Technical Director.
Management of daily operations is delegated to the President of the
Coordinating Committee. There are two in-line Directorates reporting to the
President: Administrative, and Technical. One in-line Division (Evaluation)
also assists the President with statistical data and is responsible for project
monitoring and evaluation as well as preparation of progress and final
reports. The Administrative Directorate deals with the accounting, treasury,
budget, personnel and general service aspects of management. The Technical
Directorate deals with project analysis, technical assistance and project
supervision. Three regional offices (Concepcion, San Ignacio, and Ciudad
Presidente Stroessner) support technical activities in the interior. FG
operates with 85 staff members; among them there are 25 veterinarians, eight
agronomists, five economists, four lawyers, and 13 others in different
disciplines (accounting, finance and management) plus support staff.
3.        The current organization lacks adequate balance for management
decisions. Decision making is highly centralized with the President assuming
most of the authority. There is little delegation of authority or
responsibility to the directors.  There is an exception in the case of loan
approvals where even though final subloan decisions are made by the



ANNEX 1
Page 2
- 25 -
Coordinating Committee, these are highly influenced by the Technical
Directorate, whose head is also a member of the Coordinating Committee. This
dual function of the Technical Director allows for project evaluation and loan
approval to be unchallenged on technical or economic grounds. Provisions for
reorganization of FG are included under the proposed project and this
organizational anomaly would be corrected, probably by making the Technical
Director an advisor to, but not a member of, the committee. The reorganization
would also include a reduction of the duties of the administrative director,
probably through the formation of a new services directorate.
C. Lending Policies and Procedures
4.        FG has no statement of comprehensive lending policies and the ones in
use have developed from contractual obligations contained in borrowing
agreements, and were applied accordingly on each line of credit. Among those
policies are the following: (a) loans are to be granted only for sound
investment projects adequately appraised by FG; (b) loan size, terms and
conditions are to be compatible with income level of borrowers and somewhat
below commercial banking terms; (c) loans are to be secured by a land mortgage
and/or a chattel mortgage; (d) additional, non-Bank supported loans, are made
from proceeds of roll-over funds, usually to borrowers who had successfully
implemented prior projects and adequately serviced their debt.
5.        Lending procedures are well established and used effectively.  Loan
applications are received and processed at FG's offices in the interior and at
headquarters, but final approval is made only at headquarters by the
coordinating committee. Disbursements are made in several installments and
physical inspections are conducted before each disbursement, to ensure that
loan funds are used for the purpose intended. Investment plans are developed
for all loans at appraisal, including cash flow projections and rate of return
calculations. Although technical and financial evaluation, monitoring and
supervision of subprojects are carried out on a case by case basis, there is
room for improvement in more specific studies and investment plans for
sub-borrowers, before-project performance evaluation and technical assistance
activities.
D. Accounting and Auditing
6.        Records and basic accounts are well maintained on all borrowers for
each line of credit. FG's chart of accounts, and any revisions to it, have to
be approved by the Superintendency of Banks under the CB. Most of the
bookkeeping is done manually. Trial balances are prepared manually and
submitted to CB on a daily basis. An Income Statement, Balance Sheet and
Source and Application of Funds Statement are prepared at the end of each
fiscal year and submitted to the Superintendency of Banks. Current accounting
procedures have some deficiencies. A cash basis of accounting is used to
record revenues and expenditures; therefore, income statements do not reflect
real earnings during each fiscal year, as would an accrual basis of
accounting. Corrective actions are contemplated under the proposed project.
7.        Internal control practices are deficient.  Only recetly has an
internal audit unit been organized to develop and implement internal control
procedures to safeguard FG's assets, mainly, its loan portfolio. Provisions



ANNEX 1
Page 3
- 26 -
for the strengthening of the internal audit unit are included in the proposed
project.
8.        External audit of FG's accounts is performed annually by the
Superintendent of Banks. Although well conducted, the scope of this audit
needs to be extended to adapt to Bank requirements. Among the improvements
needed are: (a) a review and opinion of the internal controls of FG and
suggestions for their improvement; (b) analysis of the portfolio and of
arrears, the latter by age and loan purpose; (c) a review of and an opinion on
the accounting procedures used; and (d) an opinion on the adequacy of
procedures relating to Statements of Expenditures. Provisions to this end are
also contemplated in the proposed project.
E. Loan Portfolio Control and Management
9.        Loan portfolio control and management suffers from lack of
computerization. Extraordinary efforts from the staff are required to prepare
the billing of interest and principal amounts due and to follow up on amounts
in arrears with manual systems. FG needs modern and effective computer
equipment to cope with the increase of its lending operations and to improve
the efficiency in managing its portfolio. Technical assistance, supported by
FG funds, is envisaged under the proposed project to help overcome the
deficiencies described above.
F. FG's Financial Performance
Historical Performance (Tables 2 to 4)
10.       FG has maintained a sound financial position throughout its history.
Average revenues from lending operations were almost twice the average
borrowing costs of FG and operating expenses were maintained at under 2% of the
average loan portfolio. FG's net income increased 1.5 times from 1978 to 1982,
that is, from US$1.3 million equivalent in 1978 to US$3.1 million equivalent in
1982. If financial revenues and expenses had been recorded under an accrual
basis of accounting, net income could have been around 25% larger. This good
record of FG profits was possible because of the low cost of its borrowings as
compared with revenues from its loans. Average cost of borrowings ranged
between 4 and 5% of average borrowing portfolio, while average revenue from
loans ranged from 8 to 9% of average loan portfolio. Other contributing
factors were: (a) grace and maturity periods on FG loans shorter than grace and
maturity periods of borrowings; (b) reinvestment (roll-over) of loan repayments
in additional loans; (c) maintenance of value in two lines of credit through
principal indexing; (d) declining exchange adjustment on two borrowings from
the Bank (1037-PA, and 1674-PA); (e) low operating costs (under 2% of average
loan portfolio) and (f) high subloan recovery rate (90-95%).
11.       FG's gross disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio as of December
31, 1982 was equivalent to US$98.0 million. This portfolio accounted for over
95% of total assets, and it was funded by external loans (70%) and equity
(30%). FG has maintained a highly satisfactory collection record, with
principal amounts in arrears under 5%, except in 1982 when they reached 5.8%.
As of December 31, 1982, the number of loans granted was 6,855, some of which



ANNEX 1
Page 4
- 27 -
were to cooperatives with multiple beneficiaries, with an aggregated principal
amount close to US$154.3 million equivalent. As of the same date, about
US$58.0 million equivalent was repaid.
12.        FG's main source of funds consisted of borrowings from IDA and the
Bank. Borrowings accounted for 86% of FG's loan portfolio at the end of 1978,
but only 70% at the end of 1982. The reduction was due to increased
participation of FG in financing additional loans with internally generated
funds. Borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 1982 amounted to US$69.5
million equivalent, of which US$60.2 million were owed to IDA/Bank.
Projected Performance (Tables 5 to 7)
13.        The proposed project would enable FG to cope with existing demand for
credit, and would inject substantial long-term funds, which would be invested
in medium term loans. These funds would, in turn, generate roll-over funds
which would gradually allow FG to come closer to a self-financed credit
institution. Financial projections prepared under assumptions described in
paragraph 14 show that average returns (on average portfolio outstanding) of
about 10% to 15% are possible during the forecast period.
14.        The following are the assumptions used in calculating financial
projections:
(a) revenues based on accrual method of accounting, from loan portfolio
outstanding were forecast using existing lending terms. Revenues on
new lines of credit arising from the proposed project, and from
roll-over funds, were forecast using the following lending terms:

(b)  financial expenses, based on accrual method of accounting, due to
current borrowing portfolio outstanding were forecast on the basis of
current contractual terms and computed on estimated average amounts
outstanding. Financial expenses due to new borrowings were forecast
using the following borrowing terms:

a/ Variable interest rate (includes 0.5% payable to CB).
b/ On undisbursed amounts.
c/ One-time charge on loan amount.
(c) operating expenses were forecast as follows:
Expense Items                   Growth
Personnel                            13% per annum
General expenditures                 20%
"La Patria" expenditures             20%        '
Provision for bad debts:             2.5% on principal amounts due.
(d)  loan repayments for existing lines of credit were estimated by FG on
the basis of average repayment schedules prepared for each of its
lines of credit. Loan repayments from new lines of credit are
forecast on the basis of amortization periods described in (a) above;
(e) borrowing disbursements were forecast in line with the proposed
external financing reimbursement percentages of subloan
disbursements;
(f) subloan disbursements were forecast on the basis of expected demand
for loans on each line of credit (Models I to III) Roll-over funds
are expected to provide counterpart funds for reinvestment and any
surpluses in additional, non-project, lending;
(g) cash and bank deposit balances are forecast at levels sufficient to
initially cover one and increasing to six months of subloan
disbursements;
(h) outstanding loan amounts on two lines of credit (1037-PA and 1674-PA)
were increased annually by 5% to maintain their value in real terms;
(i) accrued interest receivable on loan portfolio was forecast at levels
not exceeding three months of financial revenues;
(j) other assets include inventories and property for resale (given to FG
in lieu of amortization of principal). Its growth was forecast at
10% per year; and
(k) accrued interest payable on borrowings was forecast at levels not
exceeding three months of financial expenses.

LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Farm Models and Financial and Economic Justification
A. Farm Models
1.        The project constitutes a further stage in Government's Livestock
Development Plan and responds to: an increasing demand for credit nationwide;
the increasing acceptance of physical and technical improvements by cattle
ranchers; and the necessity of a specialized institution to grant credit and
technical assistance. The contemplated livestock development would take
place throughout the country and thus encounter wide variations in climate,
soils, infrastructure, input supply and markets.  Three ranch/farm models
intended to illustrate typical existing and potential development patterns
have been prepared, with a view to reasonably represent the broad livestock
producing areas. These models, as well as the technical coefficients given
here and in Annex 4, have been developed on the basis of evidence provided by
field visits during project preparation and appraisal, supervision data on
the fifth (Loan 1674-PA) and sixth (Loan 1979-PA) projects, data obtained in
the completion report for the fourth Bank-financed livestock project, and
further estimates madLe by Fondo Ganadero's Monitoring and Evaluation and the
Projects Departments. The models reflect national trends in farm development
investments exhibited in previous projects but are not considered as rigid
guidelines for project execution.
Large-size Beef Ranch (Tables 1 to 4 and Annex 4, C.2)
2.        This model is representative of beef ranches under an extensive
production system, primarily in the Chaco region.  This area is typified by
low, poorly distributed rainfall and in some areas, low quality soils. The
physical production potential is lower than that of the rest of the country
and 3 to 5 ha are required per AU. In previous projects, sub-borrower farm
size in this region has averaged 4,800 ha, with about 1,600 head of cattle
and with production activities which have included breeding, raising, and
fattening of the ranch's output. Native forest typically covers less than
50% of the ranch area. Present levels of production are low, with steers
sold for slaughter at about four to five years of age. Management is
generally not good so that technical assistance is required and it is a
condition of subloans of the 1979-PA project that private technicians
approved by the Livestock Fund (FG) be hired to provide technical assistance
at the farm level. The investment plan would comprise the seeding of adapted
artificial pastures, additional infrastructure to facilitate livestock
manipulation and to increase productivity on pasture areas, and the purchase
of additional breeding cattle to improve genetic quality and utilize the
increased carrying capacity of the ranch.
Medium-size Beef Ranches (Tables 5 to 8, and Annex 4, C.2)
3.        The typical medium-sized beef ranch is located in eastern Paraguay,
usually has less than 1,000 ha and about 450 head of cattle, and has more
than 50% of the unit covered with natural forest. The production system



ANNEX 2
Page 2
- 38 -
includes breeding, raising and fattening, plus the fattening of purchased
stock. Productivity is higher than in the Chaco, but weaning rates and age
at sale are well below potential. In contrast to the Chaco producer, the
owner of the medium-size ranch is generally the resident manager, but he must
obtain technical assistance to qualify for the credit. The infrastructure
investments (fencing, pasture improvement and the like) are designed to
increase weaning rates, decrease marketing age, and increase cattle numbers
to match the increased carrying capacity.
Small-size Dairy Farm (Tables 9-12 and Annex 4, C.2)
4.        This model is based on an 80-ha dairy unit specialized in milk
production for sale in raw form to ambulant buyers or to the milk plants.
The units are located near the consumption centers of central, southern and
eastern Paraguay and are characterized by low technical coefficients, lack of
electricity and manual milking. The existing infrastructure of buildings,
low-yielding pastures and 32 milk cows would be complemented with an
expansion of improved pastures and the purchase of a milking machine, cooler,
and 20 heifers of improved quality. In addition, electricity would be
installed and a forage chopper would be purchased. Technicians of FG would
provide technical assistance. The model assumes that feeding of concentrates
is kept at a minimum, utilizing instead quality forage. Family labor would
be utilized fully but additional helpers would be hired.
5.        Under this model, a line of credit has been allocated for
investments on small livestock or mixed livestock/crop enterprises. FG has
recently experienced strong demand for credit for the purchase of small
processing equipment or additional investments in facilities by producers who
otherwise have the infrastructure in an ongoing operation. The types of
investments proposed under this component are: crop machinery, farm coolers,
egg cleaning and classifying equipment, forage harvesters, barn repairs or
expansion, watering facilities, and the like. These investments would be
individually evaluated by FG technicians in view of the overall operation of
the producer.
Credit for Fattening
6.        This line of credit has been included in response to the demand for
credit experienced by FG to finance the purchase of steers by producers who
have received earlier investment subloans and have excess carrying capacity
and who otherwise have all of the infrastructure in an ongoing operation.
Producers often begin a program of pasture development and fencing and for
one or two years are short of cash resources to finance the purchase of
animals to use the available pastures, development of which has been faster
than the growth of the producers' herd. These investments are high yielding
with repayment of the loan being possible in 12 to 18 months. The amount
budgeted for this component is estimated on the basis of an average loan of
about G 4.5 million.

1, 5 and 9 of this annex and are detailed further in the herd projection
tables shown in Annex 4, C.1.
8.        Annual production of the farms participating in the project would
be approximately as follows:

Assuming the project's credit line would finance 1,700 subloans as described
in para 3.13, the incremental production of beef amounting to 74,000 t at
full development, would represent 20% of the 1982/83 national production of
362,155 t; the incremental production of milk of 10.4 million 1 would
represent 7% of the national production of 159 million 1.
C. Markets
9.        Paraguay cattle slaughter between 1976 and 1983 has varied from
557,000 to 950,000 head, oscillating around 600,000 head per year of which
one-third was exported and two-thirds consumed domestically. The bulk of
Paraguay's processed exports (about 70%) have traditionally been canned meats
(corned beef mainly); the remainder was in the form of frozen beef and meat
extracts. Processing was done during a short period of time (three to four
months) in outdated, large-scale, internationally owned packing houses. Age
at slaughter was high (five to seven years) and quality was not a limiting
factor since exports were processed. Europe, mainly U.K., was the
traditional export area.
10.       World oversupply of beef occurred in the mid-1970s (especially
1974-76), when beef production cycles peaked simultaneously in all the major
producing regions. Likewise, the liquidation phase of the cattle cycle in
the mid-1970s occurred simultaneously in North America, South America and
Oceania. Expansion of European Economic Community (EEC) beef production in
1975 coincided with heavy slaughterings in other parts of the world, bringing
about surpluses, increased stocks, restrictive trade policies and a sharp
drop in international prices. Sanitary regulations (e.g., foot-and-mouth
disease) have kept South American fresh, chilled and frozen (uncooked) beef
from entering the North American and Japanese markets, while bone-in-beef
from South America is not permitted in the EEC. Like other developing

ANNEX 2
Page 4
countries, Paraguay has recently responded by seeking markets in other Latin
American countries, southern Europe and the Middle East.
11.       Paraguay's canned beef exports almost ceased in 1978.  Frozen beef
and processed products exports to Europe were reduced to about 4,000 tons
annually and only began to increase in late 1982. Concurrent with the
departure of the international processors from Paraguay in the mid-1970s,
domestic demand increased significantly, mostly due to the effects of
increased economic activity related to the construction of the hydroelectr:ic
project of Itaipu. At the same time, unregistered exports of live cattle
expanded significantly to an estimated peak of some 250,000 to 300,000 head
in 1979/80. Tnese sales were primarily to Brazil, which developed barter
contracts between 1979 and 1982 to exchange meat for petroleum, but the
demand for beef exceeded Brazil's production.  The cattle exported from
Paraguay were initially males between 15 and 30 months of age which were
fattened in Brazil. More recently, due to availability of improved pastures
in Paraguay, most exports are of animals finished for slaughter. The
production and destination of beef cattle between 1976 and 1983 are given in
Table 13. Also, unregistered exports could take advantage of a free exchange
rate, which, beginning in 1981, started to deviate seriously from the
official rate of G 126 = US$1. In July 1982, the Government started to apply
a higher exchange rate for some imports, effort which culminated in the Fall
of 1983 with an application of a rate of G 160 = US$1 for almost all of the
country's imports, public or private. The only exceptions to this
country-wide rate are the public debt and some limited central government
imports (G 126 = US$1). The import rate of G 160 at which the Central Bank
releases foreign currency for most imports becomes an effective rate of about
G 178-180 because commercial banks charge taxes and duties amounting to
G 10,5 per US dollar sold, and importers wish to deposit the local currency
for periods of up to 120 days in commercial banks in order to be able to
expedite the request for the purchase of foreign currency with the Central
Bank.
12.       In a parallel process, and as the economy is moving towards higher
exchange rates, Government has allowed exporters of meat to utilize, since
early 1983, a weighted exchange rate composed of several percentages of the
export value at differing rates, resulting in a weighted average of betweeen
G 190 and G 205. This move has clearly helped to open up meat exports which
had been stagnated until the end of 1982; similar moves have been applied to
exports of soybeans and cotton. The implied subsidy which these sectors may
currently enjoy has permitted the Government to increase export revenues.
13.       During the period of processed meat export reduction, most export
slaughterhouses were closed, but with the reopening of the market, four or
five processors of a relatively small size, with more or less adequate
plants, are potentially able to participate. All of these, except two new
ones, are now improving their facilities to respond to renewed activity. The
industry has potential, as Paraguayan beef now sells at about 60% of the
current international price of US$2,480/ton for frozen boneless beef and can
still cover costs of production and processing. In 1981 constant terms,
domestic farmgate prices of liveweight cattle have increased from G 80/kg in
the early 1970s to about G 100/kg in the early 1980s (equivalent to US$1.57
of deboned beef). The international price projections indicate that the
current prices for deboned beef of US$2.40-2.60/kg will be maintained until



ANNEX 2
-41 -                             Page 5
the early 1900s.  The price series are shown in Table 14.  Beef is being
exported to Chile, Peru, Israel and Germany at present and contracts with
other countries are being negotiated. The industry is seeking to improve the
quality reputation of Paraguayan beef and is selecting young cattle for
export. Export expansion for fresh and frozen beef will be slow until
exports show consistency of homogeneous quality.  Expansion will also depend
on maintaining or improving the exchange rate policies of the Government.
Fortunately, live animal exports could increase, depending on the demand from
Brazil and the parity of the Cruzeiro with the Guarani and the U.S. dollar.
14.       Consumption of beef in Paraguay is relatively high, estimated at
about 30 to 35 kg/person annually, and it is expected to increase as the
Yacereta hydroelectric project is scheduled to begin at an early date.
Incremental production arising from the proposed FG project (121,000 tons
liveweight, or 55,000 tons carcass weight) should have an adequate market,
either internally or outside the country.
15.       Milk production has experienced a steady increase from 1971 (about
85 million liters) to the present, with domestic production in 1982 at 150
million liters, complemented by imports of 59 million liters in liquid or
equivalents of powdered milk, resulting in a per capita consumption of 66
liters annually. Milk production is concentrated around the three major
consumption centers of Asuncion, Ciudad Presidente Stroessner, and
Encarnacion, on about 2,200 farms and in the Mennonite cooperatives in the
Chaco. Characteristically, these farms are small (10 to 40 cows), milking is
done once a day (due to lack of on-farm cooling), and farmers are dependent
on purchased feed because good quality forage is scarce. Exceptions are the
Mennonite colonies in the Chaco and eastern Paraguay, where an integrated
production and processing system exists, aimed at producing processed milk to
supply Asuncion. These producers have developed a high-forage,
low-concentrate, low-cost production system. In addition, pasteurized, low
fat milk is produced by two plants in Asuncion, mostly for the institutional
market. Consumers prefer fresh and creamy raw milk delivered daily by
ambulant buyers, who offer monthly credit and deliver at G 80/1 (or
US$0.50/l). Imported sterile (UHT) milk from Argentina and Brazil
(registered or unregistered) is freely available at about G 140/1 (US$0.88),
as well as powdered milk at slightly lower prices (Annex 4, B.3, Tables 38
and 39, show the pricing and comparisons with internationally produced
milk). According to a recent milk study, Paraguayan milk is reasonably
priced but growth of the market is hampered by uneven quality at the farm
level of milk for fresh consumption, absence of quality pasteurized milk, and
competition from imports of UHT and powdered milk.l/ The study indicates
that failure to control milk quality at the farm level and increase technical
production coefficients are the major bottlenecks to the industry at the
moment. As the road network is being expanded throughout the country,
provision of mechanized milking and on-farm cooling are the factors that
could most quickly overcome the quality constraint. The production and
conservation of high quality forage would increase production while reducing
costs; further, herd management needs improvement to decrease the
inter-lactation periods and to increase calving percentage and milk
production. The proposed project would address some of these constraints by
providing technical assistance and credit for the installation of electricity
and milking equipment and the expansion of pastures with harvesting
equipment. The additional production arising from the project would be
marketed domestically and would reduce imported products.

D. Prices and Taxes
16.       The marketing of agricultural products in Paraguay is free from
Government regulations, and the prices of outputs and inputs are determined
by domestic supply and demand and market conditions abroad, especially in
Argentina and Brazil. Since March 1983, the price received by registered
exports of meat is determined by the applicable exchange rate allowed to the
exporter (para 11), currently about G 190-G 205 = US$1, as compared with the
rate of G 160 = US$1, applicable to imported inputs in the agricultural
sector. The three presently active exporting packers feel that, with the
allowed rate, exports are feasible as far as pricing is concerned. Quality
of stock and continuity in the availability of supplies throughout the year
are the factors that they need to control for exporting (Annex 4, C.1 shows
the historical exported and local prices of beef, together with comparisons
with World Bank projections). Milk prices are freely determined.
17.       There is no income tax applied to agricultural producers.  The only
tax affecting farm property is a real estate tax of 1% annually on the
property value set by Government every year. Property units larger than
5,000 ha in the Eastern region or larger than 10,000 ha in the Western region
(Chaco) pay a supplement which increases with the area in excess of those
ceilings from G 0.6 to G 5 per thousand Guaranies of valuation. On output,
there is a transfer tax of G 1,000 (US$6.25) per head of cattle sold, without
distinction of age or sex. Import duties average about 9% for the investment
packages (Annex 4, C.1, shows the applicable duties to project investments).
Imports of breeding stock and semen do not require duty, following
Government's policy to improve the quality of the national herd. Exports of
domestically produced improved breeding stock are not allowed. Social
security taxes of 16.5% on salaries paid to employees also apply to the farm
labor sector.
E. Financial and Economic Justification
18.       Estimation of the financial and economic benefits accruing to the
project is based on three farm models representing different farm sizes,
locations, technologies and investment plans (paras 2 to 4 and Tables 1 to
12). The technical assumptions are detailed further in Annex 4, C.1. Both
the financial and economic analyses have been prepared in constant mid-1983
farmgate prices, adjusted for expected changes in real prices according to
international price forecasts published by the Bank's Commodities and Export
Projections Division (detailed in Annex 4, C.1.).
19.       Producer benefits in constant 1983 prices and the financial rates
of return to the sub-borrowers are summarized below:

The proposed investments would remain financially attractive within the
limits of unfavorable developments regarding output, prices, investments and
operating costs, and delays in obtaining the benefits as estimated.
21.       For the economic rates of return, the following assumptions were
made: (a) meat exports continue to receive an exchange rate of G 205; (b)
import duties and transfer taxes payable to Government (which should provide
the Government with about US$10.1 million for the investment program and
US$2.8 annually for on-farm expenditures, assuming existing tax regulations
are maintained and enforced); (c) adjustments to the price of meat to reflect
real changes according to the projections made by the Bank's Commodity
Studies and Projections Division; (d) costs of administration, including
extension service costs, which were imputed and charged to the models; and
(e) costs and benefits which were estimated only for the three components
with comprehensive on-farm investment plans; the complementary investments
referred to in para 5 above are expected to have similar economic viability.
The value of family labor was included at the same value as hired labor and
charged at their market costs because unemployment and underemployment are
not prevalent in locations for which the models are representative.
22.       The economic rates of return and the aggregate net present values,
over a 20-year period discounted at 12% (assumed to be the opportunity cost
of capital (OCC) on individual project components are estimated as follows:
large-size beef ranch, 27% and US$132,000; medium-size beef ranch, 29% and
US$84,000; and small-size dairy producer, 39% and US$154,000. The
sensitivity tests are summarized below.

The economic rates of return are satisfactory and slightly higher than the
financial equivalents. Operating costs would need to double or revenues
decrease by about 40% for the economic viability to be reduced to the OCC.

2.        In the rural development projects, implementation has been slow.
Major problems have been encountered in timely building of roads and this has
delayed the progress of the remaining components. To date only one project has
been completed and the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) issued. This
was for credit 509-PA (PPAR SECM 83-294) and concludes that, while the project
achieved most of its physical, economical and social objectives and resulted in
increased yields of cotton, maiz and soybeans, the implementation delays led to
a cost overrun of 25%.
3.        In the livestock subsector, two PPAR's have been issued.  The one for
Credit/Loan 156-PA and 620-PA (SECM78-248) was issued in 1978 and included
results from investments made under credits 47-PA and 56-PA. Since no project
evaluation was carried out by the implementing agency, a consultant was
employed to survey beneficiares. Difficulties were encountered in obtaining
reliable data since few ranchers maintained records adequate for an accurate
measurement of the productivity levels.. The report estimated the FRR to be 18%
and the ERR 11% compared to appraisal estimates of 24-30% and 29%
respectively. As compared to appraisal estimates, assessed by the PPAR to have
been too pessimistic, the beneficiaries had a 50% reduction in mortality and a
3% increase in weaning rate but the increase in stocking rate was only 24% of
that projected.

4.        The second PPAR (SECM81-3457) issued in 1981 for the 1037-PA project
estimated the ERR at 23% as compared to the appraisal estimate of 24%.
Although data collection by FG had improved, serious deficiencies remained in
quality and reliability of the statistics. Estimated physical target results
were based on appraisal estimates and a 1979 FG survey of beneficiaries to
obtain without and with project data. These estimates are as follows:

5.        The estimated annual incremental production of beef was 56,500 mt
liveweight and for milk 31.5 million liters.  A portion of this increase was
due to improved productivity but most was due to an increase in the area under
production.
6.        The Livestock and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1674-PA)
included credit and technical assistance components for FG. An extension unit
was established to provide improved technical assistance, primarily to smaller
producers, and an expatriate co-director was employed for three years under a
cost sharing UNDP/TA project for which the Bank was the executing agency. In
this project, most medium- and all large-scale ranchers, who were not
themselves technicians, were required to contract an FG-approved private
technician to assist in ranch planning and management improvement. The credit
portion is fully disbursed and the TA project will be completed in December
1983. Loan 1979-PA, which became effective in December of 1981 and included a
US$10.0 million cofinancing from the OPEC Fund is 90% disbursed. Fondo
Ganadero provides free technical assistance to small- and lower level
medium-scale producers while other medium- and all large-scale ranchers must
contract private technicians. This project included an important component
(45% of project funds) for small producers based on the assumption that mixed
farms predominantly based on livestock could be established. In actual
practice, these producers were primarily interested in investments in crop
production; swine production, which was the primary livestock component, did
not prosper due to lack of demand for the product. FG was not equipped to
provide specialized technical assistance to this type of producer and it
considered that such lending was in direct competition with the area of
responsibility of BNF. The subloan recovery rate for these producers has been
lower than for livestock investments, due to climatic and product price
constraints. FG, according to OPEC Fund requirements, will continue to on-lend
roll-over proceeds to such small producers and has contracted with SEAG to
provide TA to crop farmers receiving such subloans. Otherwise FG will return
to its role as a specialized livestock credit institution.

7.        The results of the PPAR's quoted and the observations of supervision
missions of production enterprise performance indicate that slow but steady
progress is being made in increasing production and productivity in the
livestock subsector. The lack of more significant improvements is mainly a
result of the inevitably slow process of introducing improved herd and range
management systems essential for the full utilization of the investments made.
Beef production, especially under extensive open range conditions, has a long
gestation period between the time of investment and the achievement of the
incremental production. Cattle ranchers operating under these conditions,
because of past experience of fluctuating beef prices, are usually conservative
in relation to investment and adoption of new technology, although this
attitude is improving with each new generation of participating ranchers. In
the case of Paraguay, in addition to the international beef cycle, the closure
of the EEC market in the mid-1970s, and frequent changes in the value of the
Brazilian Cruzeiro (Brazil is the major market for Paraguayan live cattle) have
resulted in a high degree of price and market instability for beef in the
country. This in turn caused ranchers to go slower than expected with the
introduction of more capital and management intensive production systems and,
in periods of low prices, even to fall back to low input/low risk ranching.
Another cause of the slow productivity growth is the still immature technology
transfer system. Although FG has continued to improve its extension
activities, it has tended to stress more the banking rather than the technical
assistance aspects in its operation. Under the arrangement introduced in the
Sixth Project, with the assistance of an expatriate consultant, FG provides
technical assistance to its small-scale clients and requires the larger ones to
contract private FG-supervised technical assistance. This system is not yet
fully effective due to the traditional conservatism of beef producers and since
neither FG nor the private sector has a cadre of sufficiently experienced
technicians to accelerate the change of traditional attitudes and management
practices of ranchers and farmers which is required for a full utilization of
the investments made. The problem of availability of qualified technicians is
general throughout Latin America, since most University graduates in
agricultural specialties are from cities and do not have adequate practical
experience to complement their formal training.
