MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A FORESTRY RESEARCH EDUCATION AND EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to India for SDR 33.8 million, the equivalent of US$47.0
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance a Forestry
Research Education and Extension Project.
2.        Background. About 19 percent of the land area of India, or about 64 million
hectares, is covered by forests which play an important role in the conservation of
environmental quality. The contribution of the forestry sector to GNP has been estimated at
less than two percent, but this does not take into account non-market and external benefits,
illegally-harvested fuelwood and timber, nor the importance of the forests to supporting the
catde population. Most of India's forests are degraded and productivity is poor. Forest
degradation is increasing with the rising population and over-exploitation of grazing resources
in forested areas. Government is addressing the problems of the forestry sector through
policy reforms, legislation and afforestaton. The National Forest Policy, revised in 1988,
teats forests: first as an ecological necessity; second as a source of goods for use by local
populadons, with particular emphasis on non-timber forest products; and third as a source of
wood and other products for industries and other non-local uses. The policy encourages
industies to obtain raw materials from farm forestry. The Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97)
further emphasizes investments for rehabilitation of degraded forests and fann forestry.
3.        Forestry research has an important contribution to make to the successful
implementation of this policy, through the development of forest management systems and
technologies to improve productivity and the utilization of forest products. The Indian
Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), established in 1986, is responsible for
6 Institutes and a number of research centers, undertaking research in various ecological
zones. ICRE research supports the sector as a whole, and provides an important source of
the improved technology required for successful implementation of IDA supported state
forestry projects. There is a well qualified cadre of research staff in India, and the State
Forest Deparments, Forest Development Corporations, and the private sector, provide a
strucure for the application of research results. However, forestry research is constained by
the lack of a systematic method for determining research priorities and a lack of coordination
among the various agencies involved in research, which has sometimes meant that research
results have not been of immediate practical application. In addition, analysis of the social
and economic implications of policies is sometimes incomplete, or has not been kept up-to-
date. Other constraints have included frequent rotation of staff, inadequate investment in
facilities, equipment, and library and information services, and inadequate operational research
funding.
4.        There are formal forestry education programs in a number of state agicultural
and general universities. The Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun was recently granted
Deemed Forest University status. The major constraints to formal forestry education relate to



2
curricula that do not adequately reflect the requirements of the new forest policy, the need for
a cadre of professional trainers, and a requirement for adequate facilities for post-graduate
research. Forestry extension is primarily the responsibility of State For:stry Departments
(SEDs), though some commercial companies and NGOs run successful extension programs.
The focus of ICFRE's activity in extension is, therefore, the development of research
extension linkages. The main constraints to improved forestry extension services include the
lack of linkages between the research institutions, the state forest services and the private
sector, lack of resources to mount effective extension campaigns, and the lack of experience
of many staff in research institutes and SFDs.
5.        India has a broad range of ecosystems within ten biogeographic zones that
support a wide range of flora and fauna. Many species are endemic and some are
endangered. A growing appreciation within India of the importance of the conservation of
biodiversity has led to the establishment of a large number of Protectd Areas (PAs),
including 75 national parks and over 400 sanctuaries. Although they are widely distributed
thoughout India, they represent less than 4 percent of the total land area. Rapidly growing
human and livestock populations impose considerable pressures on the PAs, resulting in
degradation of vegetative cover and a loss of biodiversity. Past PA management, based on
exclusion and policing, has not been effective in arresting degradation. Attempts are now
being made to involve local communities in the planning and implementation of
ecodevelopment prgrams to generate altenative incomes for those dependent on PA
resources and to create an awareness of the benefits of preserving the PAs.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement and Country Assstance Strategy.
Development of the forestry research system is part of a long-term stategy to improve the
productivity and sustainable use of forests. The project should be seen as part of such a long-
term strategy and the Bank is one of the few institutions that could provide the necessary
continuity of support. The Bank is also well plaed to assist in developing inks with
international forestry research initiatives. In addition, the success of other GOI and Bank
initiatives in the forestry sector in Idia is at least partially dependent on the continuing
development of improved technologies. The Bank's support for research and development of
effective methods for conservation of biodiversity in India, including ecodevelopment
activities, is mandated by its strong commitment to improving environmental management.
The proposed project would be consistent with the overall country assistance strategy,
including the strategy for Bank assistance to the agricultural seo in India, which seeks to
promote increased productivity through better selection of investments and more efficient
public sector management. It is also consistent with the objectives of the Bank's new forestry
policy and the Asia Region's strategy for forestry lending which link policy dialogue with
major investments m the forest sector. Finally, the recently completed Expenditure Review
concluded that further investment it forestry research deserves priority,
7.        Project Objectives  The main objectives of the project are to strengthen the
capacity of national and state institutions to plan and underauke prinoity research programs, to
improve the system of forestry education in research and academic institutions, and to
improve the extension of research findings. Supplementary objectives are to improve the
policy analysis and project prparation capabilities within MOEF, and develop a supportng
forestry statistical service. The project would also aim to develop and test, on a pilot bads,



3
methods for conservation of biological resources in protected areas through ecodevelopment.
8.        Project Description. The project would be implemented over five years and
would have five main components: (i) Research Management (US$5.8 million) based on the
development of ICFRE to improve the management and coordination of forestry research and
extension, through staff training, studies and 4;onsultancies to develop priority setting
methodologies and a management information system, the establishment of an extension
support fund, and provision of a headquarters building and equipment; (ii) Research Program
Support (US$37.8 million) providing necessary infrastructure, equipment and operating
expenses for selected research programs in ICFRE institutes, the establishment of a research
grant fund to commission research by public and private sector agencies, measures to mprove
the quality of plantng stock, human resource development through staff training, scientific
review of institutes and programs, and improvement of library and information systems and
stadstical services; (iii) Foresby Educaton (US$1.8 million) involving the development and
vaidation of forestry cumcula in formal education through provision of funds for review and
revision work, and development of the Deemed Forestry Univursity at Dehra Dun, primarily
by financing post-graduate research and teaching awards; (iv) Forestry Policy nd
Prearation (US$2.2 million) which would strengthen capabilities within MOEF for the
analysis of forest policies and preparation of future forestry projects, through staff training
and provision for studies and consultancies; (v) Conservaon of Blodiversil (US$5.3 million)
which would support development and implementation of programs for ecodevelopment and
resource management around two protected areas, the Great Hmaayan National Park
(GHNP) in the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve
(KMTR) in the State of Tamil Nadu. Ecodevelopment would involve communities in the
planning and implementation of programs for alternative natual or soci resource creation or
income generation. Improved planning and management within the PAs, and associated
research and monitoring programs would also be financed.
9.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$56.4 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$22.8 million (40 percent of total project costs). The IDA credit
would be for US$47.0 milion, or 88 percent of project costs, excluding duties and taxes. The
breakdown of costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. The proposed p nt
arrangements and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12176-IN dated
February 1, 1994, is being distributed separately.
10.       Project Implementation. The organization of the project would be fuly
integrated with the coordination and management of forestry research, education and
extension systems at national, state, research institute and program levels. ICFRE would have
overall responsibility for management of forestry research, and the ICFRE headquarters staff
would provide project administration, procurement and disbursement services. Detailed
research program management would be the responsibility of the Diectors of Institutes, and
other agencies undertaing the research. Mass extension programs are primarily the
responsibility of the State Forestry Departments, but ICFRE institutes would provide support
and advice. ICFRE also has a role in forestry educadon, directly through the Deemed
Forestry University, and indirecdy through its role in curriculum development and validaton



4
of forestry degrees in universities. Policy analysis and the oganization of forestry project
prepartion would be undertaken by MOEF. Responsibility for ecodevelopment activides
would lie with MOEF and the SFDs of GOHP and GOIN. Project Steering Committees for
Forestry Research Education and Extension and for Conservation of Biodiversity would be
established to ensure coordination of activities amongst the implementing agencies and that
obligatons and assurances agreed during project negotiations are met.
11.       Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the project is dependent on the
long-term GOI commitment to forestry research and the conservation of biodiversity. This is
evidenced by the clear recognition in the new forest policy of the role of research in
improving forest management and productivity. GO0 commitment is further reflected in the
increased budget for forestry research in 1991 and 1992. The growing awareness in India of
the importance of biodiversity conservation is evident in government policy statements and
amendments to the Wild Life Protection Act. In addition, there would be a phased increase
in the GOI contribution to incremental recurrent expenditure during the project.
12.       Lessons from Previous BankJIDA Involvement. There has been no Bank
lending specifically for forestry research in India, but there is a portfolio of projects in the
forestry sector, some of which have components to support research and technology
development. These components have seldom been successfully implemented, partly because
states have not assigned priority to research within the wide range of responsibilities that they
cary. For GOI and the states, this lack of commitment to research has pointed to the need
for a project with a specific focus on forestry research. A review of experienc' gained during
the implementaton of Bank-funded forestry projects indicates the need to movw towards a
comprehensive approach to the sector on a national or state-wide basis '. The review
highlights the need to raise the productivity of the sector, dtrough improved planting materials
and practices, a strengthened research system, and an effective forestry extension service.
Experience in India with Bank support for agricultural research is also relevant and shows the
need for research policy to reflect national priorites for the sector, for improved management
of the research system and associated human resources, based on an effective management
information system and a sectoral human resource development plan.
13.       Nor has there been Bank or IDA lending specifically for ecodevelopment
activities in India. Recent forestry projects have included funds for the conservation of
biodiversity, but there is litde implementation experience, as the projects have been effedve
for only a short period of time. There is experience with ecodevelopment in Iltegrated
Conservation-Development Projects supported by the Bank and IDA in other countries. A
recent review of this experience shows that to be successful, they must form part of a larger
framework that includes political support, enabling legislation, realistic insdtutional
anrangements, and compatibility with regional development. These lessons have been taken
into account in the design of the proposed project.

14.       Agreed Actions. During negotiations with Government, the following assurances
and agreements were obtained:
Conditon of Project Effetiveness: An institution, acceptable to IDA, to provide
technical specialists would be identified and a contract for the provision of their services
agreed.
Conditon of Disbursement: Disbursement of funds under the Research Grant
Fund, the Extension Support Fund and the Ecodevelopment Support Fund would depend on
the agreement with IDA on criteria for assessing proposals for funding.
Other Asswunces. These relate to actions to ensure dmely implementation of
project activides and amongst others include: (a) A methodology for setdng research priorides
would be developed by ICFRE, discussed with IDA and approved by the ICFRE Board of
Governors by June 30, 1995. Drafts of the National Forestry Research Plan and associated
Human Resources Development Plan would be completed by June 30, 1996, and agreed with
IDA as part of the mid-term review no aer than February 28, 1997; (b) The fomat of the
Indian Forestry Research Information System would be agreed with IDA by December 31,
1994, and udlized to introduce program budgeting during FY 195-96, for prepartion of the
1996-97 budget to the extent pruaicable and fully utilized for the preparadon of the FY 1997-
98 budget; (c) The first three proposals for funding under the Extension Support Fund, the
Research Grant Fund, and the Ecodevelopment Support Fund would be submited to IDA for
approval; (d) Annual taining plans, acceptable to IDA, for project-financed training would
be prepared not later than September 30, 1994, for the first year of the project and not later
than April 30 of each subsequent year, (e) Review of the sciendfic activities of at least two
ICFRE institutes would be undertken during each year of the project based on Terms of
Reference to be agreed with IDA and the recommendations of the reviews would thereafter be
implemented; (f) In consultation with IDA, the review of the curicula for forestry education
in Indian universities would be completed by June 30, 1996; (g) The posts of PA Director in
both GHNP and KMTR would be filled and staff of the Ecodevelopment Planning teams in
both PAs appointed, and responsibility for Forest Rangers and Forest Guards in the
ecodevelopment areas transferred to the PA Director by September 30, 1994.
15.       Environmental Aspects. The project would support research programs aimed at
increasing the sustainability of the use of forest resources within different ecological zones.
Project support for research into the management and conservation of these resources, through
involvement of communities and tribal peoples would reduce degradation, whilst
improvements to the productivity of plantings on farms, plantations and natural forests would
reduce exploitation. Proje't support for conservation of biodiversity would have direct
benefits for the selected PAs and suroundings and wider benefits, in the long term, for other
protected areas. The project would, therefore, have beneficial effects on the envirnment.
Ecodevelopment planning and implementation would be based on a participatory, micro-level
process. Programs would be small and site specific and it is not envisaged that they would
involve resettlement or impact on tibals. They would inmorporate local communites
environmental concerns and agreement on the criteria for udizaion of the Ecodevelopment
Support Fund would be a condition of disbursement. The criteria would include the need for
proposals to take into account Bank policies on the environment, involuntary resetdement and
indigenous people.

16.       Project Benefits. The project would support a key element of the Government's
stategy for the forestry sector as articulated in the Nadonal Forest Policy. Improvements to
the researh management system would lead to the identification of research priorities that
reflect the tequirements of that policy and the needs of the users of forest resources. Better
research/extension linkages and infomation flows would further wprove the relevance and
quality of on-going and planmed research programs. In addition, project support for forestry
education would lead to a cadre of forestry staff with improved capabilities to apply reseawch
results and manage forests in a sustainable manner with the active pardcipation of
communities. Project support for the conservation of biodiversity on a pilot basis would have
long-term future benefits by developing effective methods for involving communites in the
planning and implementaton of progams that reduce the pressures on PA resources.
Associated research programs would have important benefits for the management of protected
areas as they would provide basic information on the balance between resource use and
habitat preservation. No economic rate of return has been calculated for the project as the
nature of research achieven ents and rate and extent of their adoption is impossible to predict
and will vary from one agro-ecological zone to another
17.       Risks. The main risks affecting the project, as with many reseach projects, are:
(i) that resewch findings generated may be irrelevant to the needs of users, either because
their needs have not been properly identified, or because changes in economic policies render
new technologies unsuitable, that is, not economically viable; (ii) that coordination between
research agencies and between those agencies and the users of  rch results may not be
efective and; (iii) that goverment commitment to funding research may not be sustained.
The project is designed to mininize these risks through providing suprort for an improved
methodology for settng research priorities that explicidy takes into account socio-economic
factors and involves state and private sector  ganiions in deciding on priorities. There are
a number of ris  associated with any program for the conservation of biodiversity through
ecodevelopment activities as the process is not well developed and is likely to need adaptation
for specific sites. The pilot nature of project support for ecodevelopment minimizs these
risks.
18.       Reconmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directos
approve it.
