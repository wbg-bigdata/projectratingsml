MEXICO
EXPORT SECTOR LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Bortower            Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior, S.N.C., (Bancomext)
and Beneficiary:
Guarantor:          United Mexican States
Executing Agency:  Bancomext
Amount:             US$300 million equivalent
Terms:              Repayment in 17 years, including five years of grace.
at the standard variable rate.
Relending Terms:   Bancomext would onlend the credit line component of the
proceeds of the loan to exporters for pre-shipment
financing including acquisition of inputs, fixed assets
and permanent working capital, mainly through the
commercial banking system. Subloans would be
denominated in US dollars. Bancomext administratively
sets the interest rates for final borrowers, and the
rates vary by program. The current export financing
benchmark is 10.5 percent p.a. for short-term financing
of less than one year and 13.5 percent p.a. for longer
term financing of more than one year. Rediscount
margins range from 1.5 to 3 percent to cover
intermediation costs. Maturities range from 180 days
(pre-shipment financing) and up to 5 years (for fixed
capital investment). Within the context of the
transition to a more efficient development bank in a
market-oriented en-vironment, Bancomext's interest rate
policy will reflect the average market rate of interest
for export credits in Mexico. The exchange risk would
be borne by the Borrower.
Objectives:         The ESL is part of a program of Bank support to the
Government's objectives of promoting efficient private
sector development and increasing the effectiveness of
public sector institutions so as to enable the
resumption of economic growth. The loas. would support:
(i) trade and customs reforms aimed at encouraging
efficiency and expanding the tradeables sector; and
(ii) the transition of Bancomext, to a more efficient
role in trade financing in a more competitive financial
system, and provide financing for that role.
Description:        The program includes measures to help implement:
(i) trade and customs reforms and (ii) a more efficient
role for Bancomext. The proposed loan would support
policy changes through Component A of $25 million, and
provide trade-related financing through Component B of



- {i -
$275 million. Most of the trade-related financing would
be onlent to final borrowers through first-tier
commercial banks.
Benefits
and Risks:         If the objectives outlined above are achieved, then the
benefits accruing from the project will be significant.
Continuing liberalization of trade and strengthening
public administration of trade will improve resource
allocation and expand trade. The transition of
Bancomext to a more efficient institution will improve
and expand trade-related financing. There are few risks
to this program. Bancomext is a sound institution, well
experienced in evaluating and implementing Bank-financed
sub-loans. The Government has resolutely carried
through its prograwm of trade and financial
liberalization as part of the broader program of
stabilization and structural reform over the past five
years. This program enjoys strong public support.
Policy reversals which would endanger the program are
considered rather unlikely. Even if either for external
or internal reasons Mexico were unable to stay the
course of broader program of stabilization and
structural reforms, the programs that the ESL would
support in customs reform and Bancomext's transition,
would have a good chance of staying in place and
yielding benefits to the economy. In a broader sense,
the prospects of Mexico's trade sector are always tied
to the health of the world economy, but this is
independent of the program.
Disbursementst      The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed against
eligible import expenditures (Component A) and
documented expenditures of eligible subloans
(Component B). The loan proceeds component will be
disbursed in three equal parts of US$100 million. The
first part including all of Component A would become
available upon loan effectiveness. The second part
would become available after January 31, 1992, and the
third part after July 31, 1992 consequent on
satisfactory reviews of actions taken by the Borrower.
The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December
31, 1993.
Retroactive        US$30 million will be made available for retroactive
Financing:       financing of expenditures incurred from up to six months
prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement.
Rates of Return:   Eligible subloans would have satisfactory FRRs and ERRs
in line with Bancomext's policies.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED EXPORT SECTOR LOAN TO
BANCO NACIONAL DE COMERCIO EXTERIOR, S.N.C.
I submit thte foillowing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Banco Nacional de Comercio Extetior, S.N.C. (Bancomext), with the
guaratitee of the United Mexican States, for the equivalent of US$300
million in support of a program for export sector reform.  The loan will
lhave a term of 17 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variahle interest rate.
PART I - THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
Macroeconomic Developments
1.          Between 1950 and 1974, Mexico enjoyed a remarkable period of
high growth, low inflation and moderate external debt accumulation.  Real
growth averaged 6.4 percent, and inflation was in single digits throughout
the period. This era came to an abrupt end in the early seventies.
Government involvement in the economy expanded rapidly, and increased
public expenditure pushed up aggregate demand and the rate of economic
growth. However, the higher government expenditure was not matched by
rising public sector revenues.  As a result, the inflation tax and external
debt became increasingly important sources of public finance. At the same
time, a decline in private savings incentives (real interest rates turned
sharply downward) prevented a matching increase in private savings;
external debt thus increased, increased oil revenues notwithstanding. The
period of single digit inflation etnded in 1973, the peso started to
appreciate in real terms and the accumulation of external debt accelerated
above the GNP growth rate. A comparatively brief crisis in 1976 terminated
following major oil discoveries in 1977. The ensuing prosperity lasted
until 1982, when falling international oil prices, rising world interest
rates, and massive capital flight led to a refusal by external creditors to
roll over Mexico's short-term debt and a subsequent suspension of Mexican
payments of interest on its external debt.
2.          The onset of the financial and economic crisis of 1982 brought
in its wake explosive inflationary and balance of payments difficulties.
Initial strong fiscal and monetary adjustment efforts were undermined by
external shocks such as the collapse in international oil prices in 1986.
Inflation, rather than slowing down, accelerated, partially in response to
the sharp real devaluation of the exchange rate necessitated by the 1986
downturn in the terms of trade. The subsequent de facto targeting of the
real exchange ratel/, together with an increase in the frequency of wage
and cost adjustments, introduced an element of inherent instability into
l/ The real exchange rate is defined as the price of foreign goods relative
to domestic goods. Appreciation thus implies a decline in this relative
price.

the system, culminating in a run on the peso in the last quarter of 1987
and ttip)le-digit inflation.
3.          The Governiment responded with the "Ecconomic Solidarity Pact"
(Pacto). an agreement between business, labor, and government.  This
agreement called for accelerated structural reform, further tightening of
fiscal and monetary policy, a freeze of minimum wages and of basic public
and private sector prices. and, the cornerstone of the Pacto, a freeze of
the nominal excthange rate against the U.S. dollar.  This partial freeze was
extended at three-month intervals throughi the end of 1988, and renewed.
with sonte modifications, by the new Mexican Administration under the name
of "Pact for Stabilization and Growth" (PECE).  The main change under the
PECE was a daily adjustment of the exchange rate of about one peso against
the U.S. dollar, a rate that has since been lowered to first 0.8 pesos and,
most recently, 0.4 pesos per day.  The PECE was recently extended until end
of 1991. The fiscal measures, backed by the temporary exchange rate freeze
and an array of formal and informal wage and price controls, have had
dramatic success in reducing the rate of inflation, from 159 percent in
1987 to 20 percent in 1989 and an estimated 28 percent in 1990.
4.          Mexico has, throughout this period of macroeconomic turmoil,
transformed itself into one of the most open economies In the world through
an extensive trade reform. Trade liberalization, most of which took place
between 1985 and 1988, has lowered the percentage of domestic (non-oil)
tradeable production covered by import quotas from 100 percent in 1984 to
less than 15 percent at present.  Maximum import tariffs were cut by
similar magnitudes. Non-oil merchandise exports, which represented less
than one-tlhird of total exports in 1984, have doubled their share since
then.
5.          These "core' reforms have been complemented by many others.  In
May 1989, foreign investment regulations were considerably relaxed and made
more transparent. The tax system underwent a series of reforms bringing
marginal tax rates more in line with levels in major industrial countries,
encouraging the repatriation of flight capital, and increasing the
sanctions for tax evasion. The impact of inflation on the (corporate) tax
system was eliminated by removing purely inflationary gains from the tax
base. The Government initiated a parallel process of financial market
liberalization. Ceilings on commercial banks' deposit interest rates were
abolished; forced allocation of commercial credit towards favored sectors
has been abolished too and credit subsidies through official development
banks have been reduced. Most recently, privatization of the commerciai
banks, which were nationalized in 1982, has been announced.
The Debt Restructuring Package of 1989190
6.          Despite the far reaching reforms implemented in Mexico,
international capital markets did not provide the resources needed to
bridge the period between the current costs and the future benefits of the
reform program. The uncertainty caused by future transfer problems,
through its impact on perceived sustainability of the exchange rate regime
and from there on domestic real interest rates, thus became a direct threat



to the survival of the stabilization program and the restoration of
economic growth.  The GoM therefore initiated negotiations to restructure
its external debt in early 1989.
7.          On September 15, 1989, the Government of Mexico and tne Bank
Advisory Conmmittee replresenting the commercial bank creditors reached
agreement on a financing package covering the period 1989-92, restructuring
US$48.9 billion of Mexico's external debt.  The agreement consists of a
menu of financing options which includes two debt and debt service
reduction facilities and four new money facilities and was implemented over
the next 8 months. A total of US$2Z.8 billion was exchanged for par bonds
at a fixed rate of 6.25 percent and US$19.8 billion (US$1.0 billion of
which was brought in by Mexican creditors) for discount bonds at market
rates but with the principal reduced by 35 percent.
8.          The debt relief package has reduced the net transfer Mexico
needs to make to its creditors by almost $4 billion per year over the 1989-
1994 period, or on average slightly below 2 percent of GDP. Half of this
amount is due to the lengthening of maturity implied by the deal, with the
rest coming from lower interest payments and new money disbursements from
the Banks that did not choose one of the two debt service reduction
options. The reduction in required external transfers has a direct
beneficial impact on Mexico's fiscal situation and its likely output
growth. However, at least as important have been the indirect, "secondary"
effects through renewed confidence; reduced net external transfers mean
reduced pressure on the exchange rate, which greatly reduces the risk
associated with Peso-denominated public sector debt. Nominal interest
rates fell from 56 percent to around 36 percent immediately after the
details of the package became known, and have since fallen a further twelve
points to about 25 percent in early 1991. At the same time, the maturity
structure of public debt has lengthened considerably, another indication of
private confidence.
Oil Prices and the Macroeconomic Situation
9.          Just as Mexico was putting the debt package behind it and
starting to look forward to a feasible although somewhat precarious
recovery of economic growth, the entire short term outlook changed because
of events in the Middle East. Mexico stands to gain from the crisis to the
extent that it leads to higher oil prices. But the increased volatility of
oil markets since late August has increased uncertainty concernling Mexico's
future BoP outlook and hence complicated macroeconomic management. Because
of anticipations of future disruptions in oil supply, the bench mark West
Texas Intermediate oil price, at $16 per barrel as recently as last July,
shot up to more than $37 pb in October 1990. Mexico's oil price follows
this benchmark with about a one month lag and a typical negative price
difference of around $3.50 (changes in Mexico's export mix may affect this
difference).  Since the war started, however, the West Texas oil price
dropped to around US$21 pb. And there is a possibility that oil prices may
fall substantially below current levels once the war ends. This
illustrates how uncertain Mexico's oil export prospects remain. While the
Gulf crisis has clearly boosted Mexico's oil revenue in the last four



- 4 -
months of 1990, at current oil prices the value of Mexican oil expcrts in
1991 will in fact be lower than in 1990.
10.         Aside from oil price volatility, other factors may play against
Mexico in this (-cvsis.  First, all of Mexico's major tradlng partnerts
except Canada are net energy importers and may thus be adversely aftectett.
Higher oil prices would cause a slowdlown in economic growth and thus dlemand
for Mexican exports, and higher inflation.  Second, contrary to the two
previous oil shocks in the seventies, there is unlikely to be an upwatd
shitt in the world savings schedule; lower real interest rates are thus
equally unlikely.
11.           With oil prices so unpredictable, the right question is not
Leally how highi future oil prices will go, but which assumption about
future oil prices is least likely to lead to costly mistakes if the
assumption is proven wrong. And this question does have a very clear
answer. Assuming the oil windfall to be permanent could lead to
expentliture programs that could be impossible or very costly to reverse
should the windfall turn out to be temporary. Assuming the windfall is
temporary, and at current oil prices this already appears to be the case,
will just lead to a pleasant surprise if it turns out to be permanent
instead. The GoM has therefore stated that it intends to devote the entire
windfall gain to the repurchase of public debt, and submitted a budget to
congress based on this strategy (the budget assumes $17 per barrel on
average for 1991).
12.         Before the recent increase in oil prices, Mexico had already
set out on a somewhat precarious path of higher growth. Higher oil prices
would improve Mexico's outlook, but would add problems of their own.  In
particular, the sources of Mexico's external funding have, at a time of a
noted deterioration in the non-oil current account, become very volatile.
First of all, the level of future oil prices is extremely uncertain as the
recent volatility suggests. As noted above, with so much uncertainty
attached to future oil prices, the GoM has decided not to translate the
higher revenues into higher expenditure, but instead to devote them to debt
reduction.  The second major source of external funding, the massive return
of flight capital that took place in 1990 (over US$5 bn), could as easily
be reversed. Thus, while the short term outlook has improved a great deal,
obtaining stable sot .ces of external funds remains a high priority.
The Real Exchange Rate
13.         Exchange rate policy in Mexico is complicated because the
nominal exchange rate remains an important ingredient of the Pacto/PECE.
But with price and wage rigidities still prevalent in Mexico, also because
of the PactolPECE, nominal exchange rate policy cannot be separated from
real exchange rate developments.
14.         Mexico's real exchange rate shows a somewhat ambiguous trend
(Fig. 1). Measured against US wholesale prices, much of the increase in
competitiveness obtained during the 1986-87 real depreciation has been
lost; however the economy is now back at where it was around 84-85, with

would call for a real depreciation,

whether the thirty percent against           to. ofeo§i4  iu,u Mu.i_
US producers is enough.  The second              l     tA)  ("        l
line in Fig. 1 shows there is some
additional reason for concerns it
shows competitiveness as measured
not against US producers, but against other countries exporting to the US
(it uses the US import unit value as the foreign price index).  Since other
exporters have by and large not followed the US dollar up, but did follow
it down, Mexico's increase in competitiveness in the early eighties was
smaller, but its subsequent loss of competitiveness was not. The net
result is that measured against other exporters to the US, Mexico is 24
percent more competitive now than it was in 1981 and only 12 percent more
competitive than in 1980.
15.         Some caution is called for before attaching too much weight to
such trends.  Structural changes in Mexico and in Mexico's export markets,
changes in macroeconomic policy abroad and in Mexico and so on all limit
the relevance of historical levels of the real exchange rate for an
assessment of today's degree of competitiveness.  In the first half of 1990
there was a legitimate reason for concern. The strong expansion in private
demand that is behind Mexico's widening trade deficit did not seem to
translate into increased demand for Mexican goods as GDP growth slowed down
to below 2% in the first semester of 1990. This could have signaled an
overvaluation of the real exchange rate, especially since manufactured
exports also slowed down significantly.  If increased aggregate demand does
not spill over in increased sales of Mexican goods, one explanation could
be simply that they are too expensive, i.e. that the real exchange rate is
overvalued. However more recent data do not support such an
interpretation. Manufactured exports strongly recovered in the third
quarter of 1990 and the first two months of the fourth quarter, by more
than 202 in fact; also GDP growth recovered as well, up to 5.5Z in the
third quarter and, on a preliminary basis, 5Z in the last quarter of 1990.
Sttong export sales and increased sales of Mexican non-oil goods in general
(i.e. high GDP growth) do not support an interpretation of overvaluation of
the real exchange rate.
16.         Of course third and fourth quarter data may turn out to have
been misleading in that they present a temporary surge rather than a return
to trend. Thus continued monitoring will be important, the more so because
the current project is export oriented. In this context it should be
mentioned that Mexico is currently about to enter the third year of an EFF



- 6 -
with the IMF: the exchange rate and more in general external
competitiveness is one of the key variables being monitored under that
program on a quarterly basis.
Fiscal Consistency, Debt Management and the Stabilization Progrsm
17.         The previous sections concluded that Mexico is likely to
achieve satisfactory output growth over the years to come. Whether this
optimistic prediction will materialize depends on whether supportive
macroeconomic policies are in place. Mexico's recent reform program has
placed most of the emphasis on private sector development; but before the
necessary private sector investment materializes, entrepreneurs will need
to be convinced that the favorable current environment is permanent.  Thus
credibility of the Government's program is an essential precondition for a
private sector led investment program to really take off.
18.         Very little is known about what establishes macroeconomic
credibility.  But a great deal is known about what will destroy it.  In
particular, inconsistency between on the one hand fiscal policy, solvency
constraints on debt issue and the resulting need for monetization, and on
the other hand announced inflation targets, possibly embedded in an
exchange rate rule, is at the core of many recent stabilization failures.
Fig. 2 summarizes the basic facts about fiscal deficits in Mexico.  It
slhows the primary and the operational surplus (a negative number indicates
a deficit) of the consolidated government, inclusive of all non-financial
state enterprises and the Bank of Mexico. The primary surplus is the most
fundamental indicator in that it measures the net transfer the GOM makes
with respect to all non-public agents in the economy. To arrive at the
operational surplus, one subtracts all interest paid on foreign debt and
real interest payments on domestic debt (shaded area).
19.         The figure highlights            Deficits ond Interest Payments
two important points.  First,                D in er ofP m)
Mexico's fiscal adjustment over
the past decade has been
extraordinary:  its primary
balance turned from a deficit of 7          o
percent of GDP into a surplus of
around 5 percent in the mid-
eighties.  This surplus was                w_v
further increased to between 7 and        -,    .    .               1
8 percent of GDP in the last                 .owt
couple of years.  The period over               r (a P - f Wqt, - Cu. &rpk
which the adjustment has been
sustained, is as impressive as its
extent.  The second point is the    Figure 2
extreme volatility of interest
payments on domestic debt. While
interest payments on foreign debt
have not varied much except for
the break caused by last year's debt deal, domestic interest payments have



gone from basically zero in real terms (1987) to around 6 percent of GDP
one or two years later, and back down to 2-3 percent of GDP in 1990.
20.          It is clear from Fig. 2 that Mexico's 'heterodox" stabilization
program was only the final phase of a long running, initially entirely
orthiodox effort to reduce inflation through fiscal restraint alone.
Success failed to arrive in response to the fiscal effort alone, however.
Therefore, when inflation in fact started to accelerate towards the end of
1987, the Facto with all its unorthodox components was put in place.  The
first question this experience suggests is, how much fiscal adjustment ic
enough? Mexico's adjustment has been substantial, but was it enough given
the ambitious goal of eventually reaching single digit inflation7
21.         A fiscal stance that does not conflict with sustained low
inflation, even in the event of unfavorable external developments and
continued high real interest rates, is clearly necessary, although possibly
not sufficient, to allay inflationary fears.  Only if the inflation rate
compatible with public finance requirements is compatible with the
inflation rate implied by the fixed exchange rate regime, is the latter
going to be sustainable. And this in turn is the cornerstone of the
Pacto/PECE. Thus medium term consistency requirements, when violated, give
a signal that will greatly complicate short term macromanagement. This
will require restrictions on both the overall deficit and its mode of
financing.
22.         The debt package lowered annual interest payments by about
US$1.2 billion per year, or approximately 0.5 percent of GDP.  This took
place through a combination of lower debt volumes and lover interest rates.
This reduction alone yields a reduction In the equilibrium inflation rate
(i.e. the rate for which no further fiscal adjustment would be necessary)
by 5 percentage points, from 25 to 20 percent based on 1989 fiscal policy
parameters. This is a significant reduction, but by no means as dramatic
as the impact of lower real interest rates on domestic debt. At an average
real interest rate of 10 percent instead of 30 percent, the fiscal balance
(which at the 10 percent real rate that did obtain for 1990 and inclusive
of the effects of the debt package will show an operational surplus of
around 2 percent of GDP) exerts no inflationary impulse at all: it can be
financed without any reliance on monetary financing. Thus Mexico's
dramatic fiscal adjustment is more than adequate for the inflation targets
stated, if the credibility problems underlying the extreme interest rates
of the past can be overcome in a lasting manner. The increase in inflation
observed in 1990 cannot be ascribed to lack of fiscal austerity. It is
due, instead, to a loosening of price controls and to adjustment of public
sector and controlled prices and thus has a "catch-up" component to it,
Some cautious optimism about future inflation is therefore justified, even
at continuation of current policies.
The Pacto and the Decline in Inflation since 1987
23.         The Pacto (rebaptized PECE late 1988) has been very successful
so far: inflation was more than halved (from 159 to 52 per cent) in 1988,
and more than halved once again in 1989, to around 20 percent. Some



- 8 -
reboutn(ling haq occurred in 19(O; inflation rose to 30 percent, bult the
program has clearly beetn a success.  It is in particular noteworthy that a
major recession has been avoided; iti fact this period has seen the
beginnings of a tecovery of economic gtowth.
24.         The early success of the Pacto demonstrates that a change of
policy can be made more credible, and strategic delays in price adjustments
offset, by using wage-price guidelines and a fixed exchange rate to signal
the new policy stance and snap a country out of a high Inflation
equilibrium.  But such measures lose their effectiveness if sustained for
too long.  Controls sustained for years on end signal not attainment of a
new, low inflation equilibrium, but rather the economy's failure to achieve
it.
25.         Since the inception of              Ratio of Electri.c price tndex
the Pacto/PECE, controlled prices                        over C 1.

public firms have been lagging             0.e 
considerably behind non-controlled         0.9
prices and prices of private firms
(see Fig. 3, where electricity
prices are used as a proxy for
controlled prices).  The figure             o;-
shows another pattern, one that is         -fi      lies     19      190
revealing about what the real                               W.
effect of the Pacto is by now.
Public prices, after lagging most
of 1989, were adjusted in big           Figure 3
discrete steps in December 1989 and
May 1990, and again around the most
recent extension of the PECE, in
November 1990 (for a period
extending to end 1991).  These adjustments clearly contributed to lower
relative price distortions; at the same time they triggered sharp increases
in recorded inflation, pushing 1990 inflation above the 1989 level in the
process.  By the same token, the failure to adjust earlier has reduced
recorded inflation below what it would have been under a more gradual
adjustment process. What the erratic adjustment pattern does is
artificially lower recorded inflation in one year, only to raise it in the
next as the necessary catch up adjustments are implemented.  Price controls
by now seem to have become a mechanism for temporarily postponing
inflation. Thius an end to price controls is desirable.
26.         The recent extensions of the Pacto have in fact implemented
reductions in price countrols:  currently only 25 percent of private sector
prices remain under control, down from effectively 100 percent in 1988.
Moreover, remaining controlled and public sector prices have been adjusted
considerably. Thus, progress has been made towards the reduction of
interference in private price setting behavior.  Another indicator of
successful stabilization and increased credibility of exchange rate policy
is the reduction in domestic interest rates.  Annual nominal interest rates
on public debt recently dropped to around 25 percent.  These rates are

matklt determined, indicating that private inflationary expectations are

Medium Term Finance for Growth
27.         Mexico's general program of economic reform is well designed,
skillfully implemented and clearly on track.  It is now reaching a crucial
phase as it starts to tackle what is by far the most distorted sector in
tlexico. agriculture.  Prior to the Gulf crisis, the program had a sound
medlium-term funding package, but a package with a tilt towards later years.
Because of the high cash outlays needed for thie recently implemented debt
package, and because of the time required to translate DFI applications
into actual projects, the early years were underfunded and the later ones
overfunded. For this reason, Bank strategy envisaged substantial
structural adjustment lending initially, but with a rapid phasing out
beyond FY91.
28.         The recent increase in oil prices has had a substantial impact
Otn the Mexican balance of payments. The gains in 1990, however, do not
translate into more leeway for Mexico:  under the 1990 program agreed with
the IMF, additional oil revenues are matched, with a small margin, by
tighter reserve targets.  As to the outlook for 1991, if the average price
of Mexican oil is indeed US$23 a barrel, as assumed in the projections
presented in this report, the windfall gain in 1991 would be between US$2.5
and US$3.3 billion (based on the pre-crisis projection of US$17.1 a barrel
for 1991).  The situation, however, is one of extreme uncertainty.  Oil
prices almost tripled between July and September, only to drop by 30
percent to about US$25 a barrel in a matter of days in October. The
average price of Mexican oil fell further to about US$18 a barrel in
January 1991. Mexico's CY91 financing gap is highly sensitive to the
assumption made about future oil prices--an average 1991 price of about
US$24 a barrel is required to close the financing gap in that year. The
stated announcement of fully using any windfall for debt reduction or
reserve accumulation is likely to be reflected in the economic program
about to be negotiated with the IMF under the existing EFF agreement.  Thus
one should not expect major windfall gains because of oil prices higher
than the $24 a barrel necessary to close the financing gap to translate
into much leeway for Mexico. The Bank's lending program has thus been
designed as a compromise, where adjustment lending is cut back
substantially to reflect the improved BoP situation, but not fully
eliminated in recognition of remaining rigidities and vulnerability because
of the volatility of the major sources of axternal funds.
29.          By cutting back adjustment lending but not eliminating it
entirely in FY91, Bank, strategy recognizes both the short-run uncertainty
surrounding the price of oil and the need to safeguard the economy from
future declines in the terms of trade.  Cutting back adjustment lending
would tend to reduce Bank exposure and increase its capacity to respond
flexibly in the event of future declines in the terms of trade. But
retaining some adjustment lending provides Mexico with a predictable source
of balance of payments support in the event that the 1991 price is lower
than currently projected. And, in the event that current projections are



- 10 _
realized, it enables GOM to use the oil windfall to further 'crisis proof'
its economy through a domestic debt retirement program tied to the oil
windfall. This would enhance the GOM's capacity to respond adequately in
the future should the terms of trade deteriorate once again. Domestic debt
reduction will also reduce the most volatile public expenditure item,
domestic interest payments.  The Bank's strategy for Mexico is discussed
further in Part III.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
30.         With the implementation of the commercial bank debt reduction
package in 1990, Mexico reduced the principal on its external debt by
US$6.5 billion through the issue of discount bonds.  In addition, US$22.8
billion was swapped for instruments carrying a fixed rate of 6.25Z.
Combined principal and interest debt relief totalled US$12.9 billion.
Finally, debt-equity swaps equivalent to US$2.7 billion have been auctioned
in 1990 carrying an average 522 discount. However, implementation of the
swaps is expected to take place primarily in 1991. Despite commercial debt
reduction, total gross external debt rose slightly in 1990 to US$97.6
billion. This increase was due mainly to additional multilateral and
bilateral lending in support of the debt reduction operation. Note that
the debt figure does not net out the US$7 billion in collateral assets
acquired by Mexico as part of the debt package.  In 1990 the Bank's share
of Mexico's long term debt and debt service increased to 11.9 percent and
13.3 percent, respectively. On the other hand, Mexico's share in the
Bank's total exposure rose to 11.3 percent. However, Mexico's total debt
service burden, which captures both principal and interest reduction,
decreased from 40 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services in
1989 to 32.5 percent in 1990, while the ratio of total debt to GDP dropped
from 47.6Z to 432 between the same years. Thus, provided that the current
domestic economic policies continue to be pursued, and the external
environment remains favorable for the execution of the policies, Mexico is
considered creditworthy for planned Bank lending.
PART II - THE SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. TRADE AND CUSTOMS REFORMS
Trade Liberalization Since 1985
31.         Industrialization through import substitution has been the
dominant development strategy in Latin America since the 1950s, and Mexico
was no exception. Trade restrictions, particularly tariffs and
quantitative controls on competing imports, have been used to promote
manufacturing production for the domestic market at the expense of
agricultural and export activities. Trade restrictions have been also used
to support extensive control of pricing and marketing of agricultural
goods. Trade policy has also been directed at achieving macroeconomic
goals. Periodic balance of payments crises led to tightening of import
restrictions; inflationary pressures led to reductions in restrictions,
particularly tariffs.



- 11 -
32.         The onset of the payments crisis in 1982 saw quantitative
control of practically all merchandise imports. After some initial
cautious import liberalization and export promotion efforts in 1983 and
1984, from mid-1985 Mexico has undertaken a fast and far-reaching
liberalization of the merchandise trading regime as part of a broader,
growth-oriented, stabilization and adjustment program. The aim has been to
expand the tradables sector, and open-up to international competition to
encourage efficiency in both exporting and import-substitution activities.
Mexico has moved from being a largely closed economy to being one of the
most open economies in Latin America. Mexico acceded to the GATT in 1986.
Some summary quantitative indicators of liberalization are shown in
Table IIA.l. The Bank maintained a close dialogue with the Government on
trade matters, and supported the adjustment process with policy-based
lending (Trade Policy Loan I in July 1986, Trade Policy Loan II in October,
1987 and Industrial Sector Policy Loan in June 1989) and project lending
for export financing (Export Development Project I in June 1983 and Export
Development Project II in January 1987).

33.         Progress in merchandise trade liberalization has been very
impressive. The coverage of import licensing in terms of competing
domestic production is 19.9 percent, which is nearly one-fifth of what it
was in June 1985. The coverage of export controls is 17.6 percent.
Official reference prices have been completely abolished on imports and
almost so on exports. The maximum tariff is 20 percent and the average
tariff is 12.5 percent which are respectively about one-fifth and one-half
of what they were in June 1985; almost all tariffs are now in the range of
10 to 20 percent. Importantly, trade liberalization has gone beyond the
Government's original schedule, GATT commitments, and targets agreed under
World Bank lending. Specifically, the import QR coverage is more than
three percentage points below the target agreed under the ISPL; and the
maximum tariff is ten percentage points below the target agreed under the



-12-
TPL II. In December 1989. the Government issued the National Program for
Modernizing Industry and Foreign Trade which will guide policy for the
remainder of the administtation, which unambiguously endorsed the trade
liberalization program.  The details of the merchandise trade regime by
measures, including import and export QRs and tariffs, and direct export
supports such as temporary admission schemes, and duty drawbacks are set
out in Annex IIA.1.
34.         From mid-1989, the Government embarked an a similarly radical
and complementary reform to modernize the customs process and improve
efficiency, which will ensure that the new trade policies are properly
implemented and tariffs collected. This important new progress is
described below.
35.         The Government has been an active participant in the Uruguay
multilateral trade negotiations. In June 1990, the Mexican and US
Governments agreed to begin talks on a free trade agreement (FTA) between
them. Canada has subsequently joined the talks (Canada and the US
implemented a free trade agreement in January 1989). More recently, the
Governments of Mexico and Chile have announced their intention of seeking a
free trade agreement between them.  There will likely be no further
unilateral changes in the trade regime pending resolution of these multi-
and bi-lateral initiatives.
36.         The liberalization so far has been focused on merchandise
trade. The Government has moved in some areas of services trade, for
example, relaxing foreign ownership limitations on brokerage houses and
insurance companies. Most importantly, the Government has announced its
intention to reprivatize the commercial banks, with some foreign
participation. Restraints to trade in services are also an important topic
in the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Government
intends to wait for resolution of the Uruguay round of negotiations before
formulating further policy on trade in services.
37.         This substantial opening up of the economy was achieved
quickly during a period when a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization
program was being implemented with successful results but some uncertainty.
The impressive progress on trade reform has been complemented by domestic
deregulation and privatization, albeit initially at a somewhat slower pace.
The Impact on Trade
38.         Trade reform, and structural reform in general, has been
geared toward restructuring the economy toward more efficient production of
tradables. Wlile it is still too early for the full impact to be felt and
there are other contributing factors, the initial results are promising.
Trade, measured as the share of total imports and exports of goods and non
factor services in GDP, has increased from 27 percent in 1984 to 31 percent
in 1989 (See Table IIA.2 and further detail in Annex IIA.2). The most
striking feature of the growth has been the strong expansion of
nonpetroleum merchandise exports, which more than doubled between 1984 and



- 13 -
1989. and m('re than compensated tor the huge revenue losses from oil over
the same period, leaving tht  share of expotts in GDP roughly constant.
Preliminary tigures for 1990 show continued strong growth of merchandise
exports, particularly of oil with the price increase, but also of non-oil
t(oo.  Impott gtowth as reflected in the import to GDP tatio, increased from
10 per<:ent in 1984 to 15 percent in 1989.  Preliminary figures for 1990
show merchandise imports growing more quickly than exports.
39.          There has also been significant restructuring of Mexico's
trade.  Non-factor service exports, boosted by growth in the maquiladora
and tourism sectors, have increased in share of total exports to 31 percent
in 1989, up from 20 percetnt in 1984.  During this period, the share of
maquila exports in total exports doubled, and the share of tourism receipts
in total exports increased by one half. The corresponding decline in the
share of merchandise exports is explained largely by the declining
importance of petroleum exports between 1985 and 1989.
40.          The growth in exports of manufactures has been particularly
pronounced.  Between 1984 and 1989, the share of manufactures exports in
total exports increased from 23 percent to about 40 percent. As noted in
the previous section, growth of manufactures exports slowed down in the
first semester of 1990, but then recovered in the second semester. Within
manufacturing, nearly every industry has experienced a growth in export
earnings since 1984, although textiles, machinery and some basic metals
industries have increased in importance.
41.          The growth of imports of goods and non-factor services has
been concentrated in capital and intermediate goods in absolute terms.
Capital goods imports, boosted by efforts to rebuild the capital stock,
increased in value by 85 percent during the 1984 to 1989 period, and the
value of intermediate goods imports increased by 93 percent; although their
shares have remained roughly constant. Consumer goods imports have more
than quadrupled in value since 1984 and doubled in share, they still
represent just over eleven percent of total imports of goods and non-factor
services.  Preliminary estimates for 1990 show the rate of growth of
capital goods imports increasing, but that of consumer goods slowing.
42.          The geograpthic distribution of Mexico's trade remains
concentrated in US markets. In recent years about two thirds of Mexico's
exports were destined for the US and about two thirds of Mexico's imports
were sourced from the US. The EEC and Japan are the next mos t important
trading partners. Mexico's imports from and exports to otner Latin
American countries remain small.

Customs Process Reform
43.         From mid-1989 a radical reform was begun to modernize and
improvi- etficfency of the customs process.  The excessive costs of clearing
customs wete effectively another barrier to trade, and the reforms can be
seen as a complementary phase of liberalization to ensure that the new
trade tegime is properly implemented and tariffs collected.  While the
removal of QRs and reduction in the range of tariffs since mid-1985 much
simplified customs requirements, customs procedures did not keep pace with
the trade reforms.  Customs procedures were highlly centralized and
antiquated, involving numerous, complex, time-consuming and non-transparent
sLeps.  Traders faced long processing delays and substantial undocumented
costs in clearing merchandise. The authorities had effectively lost.
control of the customs process and revenues, and the system had become
bogged down in a mire of bureaucracy, ad hocery and corruption.
44.         The Directorate General of Customs (DGC), located in the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) and reporting directly to the
Secretary, was totally and independently responsible for the entire customs
process, including day-to-day operations, making policy on operating
procedures, and supervision and evaluation of effectiveness. Coordination
with SECOFI which is responsible for trade controls and tariffs, and SHCP
which is responsible for tax collection and compliance was limited.
4J.         An enormous amount of legislation and ordinances apiplicable to
customs, spanning all levels from Articles of the Constitution to
Administrative Circulars had proliferated over the years.  This legislation
and operating practice of customs implied that every merchandise
transaction had to be inspected individually, and hundreds of regulations
applied in each case.  This was clearly impossible.  Enormous discretion
and negotiating power were given to customs officers, with the predictable
result that the authorities effectively lost control of the process.
46.         Importers used private customs brokers to find their way around
the myriad statutory obligations and provisions. Customs brokers were
generally considered to be major accomplices in customs irregularities.
Entry to the profession had been tightly controlled by means of licenses
and the number of customs brokers remained roughly constant at 500 for over
a decade. Customs brokers were permitted by law to charge a two-part fee
for their services; one part depended on the duty-paid value of merchandise
plus a fixed component for the service, and the other part was known as
"complementarios" or extras, depending on the additional undocumented
expenses the broker had to incur to release the merchandise.  This system
contained a built-in incentive to understate the value of the merchandise
and increase the undocumented complementario.
The New Process and Policies
47.         In mid-1989, the DGC was incorporated into the Undersecretariat
of Revenues (SSI) in SHCP. Some responsibilities were reassigned to other
areas of SSI, and now DGC is exclusively concerned with improving the



- 16 _
physical proce;qing of merchandise through the customs farilitv and
prevention of smuggling.  Top line staff ware reshuitled and some replaced
to collapse colluding cliques and encourage more professionalism.  The new
budget law containing the basic legal and institutional changes pertaLning
tto customs became ettective (on January 1. 1990.  Changes in process have
been formalized through Reglamentos (implementing regulations).
48.         Customs reform is part of an overhaul of the tax system, and
customs lhas now been integrated with general tax collection.  The Mexican
tax system operates on the basis of voluntary declaration of tax liability
by the taxpayer, and it is at SHCP's discretion to check compliance.  This
is now the philosophy for the collection of trade taxes.  The rights and
obligations of traders and customs have been widely published to enhance
transparency.  Tlhe special registry of importers and exporters for trade
tax colltction was albolished and traders are now required to use their
standard Federal Tax Registry numlers.  The aim is to have one account for
each taxpayer for all taxes, and thus improve collection of all taxes.
49.         Payment of tariffs is made in advance of proceeding to clear
mierchandise, in line with the new voluntary declaration of liabilities.
Traders no longer make payments of tariffs to customs officials but rather
to commercial banks which opened branches inside customs facilities.  The
commercial banks keep the funds for 48 hours before officially placing them
in the account of the national treasury, and are required to keep
computerized records of all transactions.
50.         A basic premise of the new system is that meaningful individual
inspection of each transaction is impossible. This was the major
bottleneck in dispatch of merchandise. A computer generated random
selection process now determines which trade transactions are inspected.
The intention is to regain control, tailoring inspections to match
capacity, and to remove discretion and negotiability. The authorities have
refined sampling techniques based on lessons learned from the information
being gathered -- for example, more frequent inspections where higher
irregularities are found. The number of steps in the customs process has
been reduced by two thirds, from roughly twelve (of which nine involved
some paperwork) to four. The reduction in processing time is a major
source of savings.
51.         Entry to the formerly tightly controlled customs brokers'
profession is being freed-up and the regulated fee structure will be phased
out so that fees will be market determined.  Brokers will be required to
present electronic data on a weekly basis containing all information
related to their clients' trade activities.
52.         The random inspection system is complemented by stiff fines and
penalties for all parties involved. including the loss of authorization to
operate as brokers, if irregularities are discovered during the inspection.
The new system therefore contains incentives for customs agents to ensure
that the contents and value of all traded merchandise are accurately

de Iat 'd.  Brokert- are pt*-inspetting some merchandise before completing
de, tat atins.
51.         Operations are decentralized, linked by an electronic data
c(,nmmuiuration network, and respoinsibility for information collection and
m'nitioring is shifted to the individual customs sites.  The responsibility
fut. ompttterizing the decentralized customs sites rests with SSI. which is
piroviding guidance to thie Central Infurmatics Units of Custvms.  Electronic
data is collected from commercial banks and customs agents, cross-checked
tor consistency at the decentralized customs site and with hard copies of
the declaration forms.
54.         The low salaries paid to cuqtoms officials under the public
sector salary structure and limited training are constraints to
implementation of the reform program. A system of incentives has been
introduced that augment the salaries of better performing officers and
supervisors.  The costs of trainiug are very high, and training, for
example in computing, can lead to defections to the private sector where
salaries are much higher.  The reforms have also reduced the workload of
customs employees as well as the possibility for graft.
55.         The new system was initially fully introduced at five key
customs facilities which account for about three quarters of imports and
exports -- Nuevo Laredo, Mexico City, Reynosa, Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana,
and then gradually introduced at the remaining customs sites throughout the
country during 1990. A close working relationship with the US Customs has
been re-established, with the ultimate aim of replicating the US-Canada
joint customs process based on electronic data transfer.
56.         The preliminary results at Nuevo Laredo, the main trucking
entry point from the US, were substantial.  Previously 800 operations were
hatndled daily at Nuevo Laredo; this increased to 1200. The normal
processing time per transaction was cut from around 3 days to 20 minutes,
or a maximum of three hours if selected for merchandise inspection. The
daily collections adjusted for trade have increased by 12 percent in the
first six montlhs of the program (and by 15 percent at Mexico City Airport).
57.         Simplifying and standardizing customs process will foster
increased transparency, reduce discretion of the customs employees, and
lessen opportunities for tax evasion. Traders will benefit from the
teduced costs, delays and uncertainties of a standardized, universally
applied, non-negotiable customs process. A conservative estimate based on
the assumption that the savings observed at Nuevo Laredo are representative
of the potential reduced processing times at other sites suggests that the
readily quantifiable, annualized cost savings are of more than US$2 billion
from the reform based on:  (i) interest "earned" because trade transactions
are now quicker; (ii) reduced transport and storage costs and (iii) reduced
undocumented expenses. The savings are about five percent of the value of
merchandise trade or close to one percent of GDP.  This estimate does not
include additional benefits such as efficiency gains from improved
competitiveness of the traded sector.

B.  BANCOMEXT:  FINANCIAL AND EXPORT PROMOTION ACTIVITIES
58.         Banco Nacional de Comercie Exterior, S.N.C. (Bancomext), was
estahlishsd in 1937 as a public sector development bank to finance Mexico's
primary product exports and to act as the Government's financial agent.  In
1q83. Bancomext replaced Banco de Mexico as trustee of the Fondo para el
Fomento de las Exportaciones de Productos Manufacturados (POMEX). a trust
fund which was established in 1962 to finance exports of manufactures, and
operated as a second-tier institution. On January 1, 1990 FOMEX was
financially and operationally incorporated into Bancomext.
59.         Bancomext's current organic law, issued in early 1986. states
its purposes as tinancing Mexico's foreign trade and promoting exports.
Bancomext is managed by a 13 member Board of Directors, 9 from the public
sector and 4 from the private sector, headed by the Minister of SHCP.  The
Director General is appointed by the President of the Republic through
SHCP.
60.         The Bank has financed two Export Development Projects (EDP)
through Bancomext32/ EDP I for US$350 million equivalent, approved in
June 1983, had as principal components: a) a revolving fund in foreign
exchange through Programa de Financiamento de Exportaciones en Divisas
(PROFIDE) for working capital sub-loans to finance imported inputs for
exports (US$275 million), b) medium and long term sub-loans through the
Programa de Financiamiento de Inversiones Fijas para Exportaciones (FIFE)
for financing fixed investments by enterprises to maintain or expand export
capacity (US$71 million), and c) technical assistance and studies (US$4
million).  In October 1986 the Bank approved EDP II for US$250 million
equivalent: US$175 million were allocated for PROFIDE, US$74.5 million for
FIFE and US$500,000 for technical assistance.  Both loans have been
committed and disbursed. In addition to Nacional Financiera SNC, Bancomext
is an executing agent for the ongoing Industrial Restructuring Project for
US$250 million equivalent, approved in April 1989, which provides financial
and technical assistance to companies for restructuring.  In carrying out
these projects Bancomext has demonstrated strong evaluation and
implementation capability for Bank-financed subloans. Bancomext has also
performed well as financial agent for the Government for several other Bank
loans, e.g. the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) approved in June
1989.
61.         As a part of the overall financial sector liberalization
program (which was supported by the FSAL), the Government has begun to
modernize the development banking system. The main elements of the program
are: a) consolidation through merger or liquidetion of redundant
development banks and trust funds, and redefinition of the roles of those
21 A project performance audit report on these projects (Report 8875 of
June 29, 1990) was submitted to the Board in July 1990. Its conclusions
were positive, overall, especially regarding Bancomext's effectiveness as
an export credit financing institution.



-19-
remaining:  o) concentiation tn second tier operations; C) reduction of
fitiancial subsidies and increased transparency; d) adjustmetnt of interest
rates in line with thie costs of funids; and e) reduction of unnecessary
regulation.
6z.         The ESL will support the transition of Bancomext towards
becoming a more efficient development bank in a market-oriented
environment, able to mobilize resources and operate profitably in a
competitive financial environment.  Bancomext's policy statement (see Annex
IIB.1) sets out the major elements of the transition and the timing of
implementation, consistent with the Government's overall development banks
and finaticial sector policy. Bancomext's medium term strategy will be
guided by the following basic principles: a) operate predominantly as a
second tier financial institution, b) offer trade financing at market-based
interest rates, c) focus on providing credit guarantees and increasingly
rely on other financial intermediaries to carry out both lending and export
promotional activities, d) receive no fiscal transfers, e) provide export
promotional support increasingly on a cost recovery basis, f) decentralize
activities, and g) operate profitably including maintaining equity in real
terms. A major goal of Bancomext's strategy is to build on its
institutional strengths to carry out lending and prontotional activities,
and rely less on Government guarantees and financing from multilateral
organizations.  The Bank particularly stressed the desirability of:  no
transfers or subsidies from the Government; concentration on second tier
lending; lending at market-based interest rates; increased market
orientation in funding, including the phaseout of the multilateral
development banks as a source: and profitability and financial viability.
63.         Bancomext has advanced significantly on the path towards being
an efficient self-supporting financial institution, especially vis-a-vis
the other development banks and trust funds in Mexico. It is already an
essentially second tier bank, has received no fiscal transfers since 1988,
has traditionally assumed the obligation of fully servicing Bank loans, and
has a history of financial viability.
Financial Activities
64.         Table IIB.1 summarizes Bancomext's financial operations for the
period 1985 to 1990, and more detail is available in Annex IIB.2, Tables 1
to 5. Total operations have expanded considerably since the mid-1980s,
reaching US$14.9 billion in 1989 compared to US$4.8 billion in 1985.
Preliminary figures for 1990 show operational growth continuing with a
total program of about US$16.6 billion. Bancomext operates as both a first
tier (direct loans) and second tier (rediscounts and commissions through
commercial banks) financial institution.  In 1990, direct loans represented
15 percent of its credit operations, and second tier transactions accounted
for 85 percent. Second tier transactions are heavily concentrated in
relatively few intermediaries; in 1990, the top three (out of 20)
comnercial banks accounted for over 75 percent of these resources.



- 20 -
65.         Expott financing reached US$11.0 billion in 199°. accounting
for 78 percent of Bancomext's total lending volume.  Bancomext's export
credit figures include transactions fitianced by the commertial banks under
the so-called Comite de Operaciones Ilternacionales (COI) scheme as well as
transactiotns financed with 5ancomext's own resoturces.  Under the COI scheme
Bancomext pays a cotmission to commercial banks to use their foreign
currency resources to provide export financing on Bancomext's terms. The
COI-generated resources have become increasingly important in recent years,
accounting for almost 60 percent of the total export financing program in
1990.  Pre-shipiient export credit amounted to US$5.4 billion, of which
US$2.6 billion were used to finance the purchase of domestic inputs and
US$1.8 billion were used to acquire imported iniputs. Working capital was
also provided to indirect exporters.  Post-shipment export credit amountfd
to US$5.6 billion, of which US$3.2 billion was seller's credit and US$2.4
billion was buyer's credit.  Post-shipment credits have traditionally been
denominated in US dollars, and pre-shipment credits increasingly so (even
for domestic inputs), suchi that since 1990 all export financing has been in
dollars.

66,         The share of Bancomext's programs in total financing of exports
is tnot known precisely, but in 1989 pre-shipment and post-shipment
tinanting wete each arounid 40 percent of exports of non-oil manufactures.
Tthis is plrobialbly a large share of total pre-shipment financing, but more
thian (one half of export sales are outside Bancomext's programs.  Some are
sold for cash; soime are financed offshore by parents, banks or customers;
and some self or other locally financed.
67.         Bancomext engages in various other trade-related financial
operations as well as export financing.  The Import Credit program finances
a vide range of imports. utilizing mainly official export credit agencies'
lines. In 1990, US$1.7 billion were disbursed under this category,
representing 12 percent of Bancomext's total lending. The Import
Substitution program used to finance the domestic production and sale of
goods and services which would otherwise be imported, including capital
goods sold mainly to parastatal enterprises and basic consumer goods such
as wheat and oil seeds. In 1990, this program was discontinued. Lastly,
the Industrial Equipment program provides long-term financing for upgrading
or expanding the productive capacity of export firms. A total of $0.6
billion were disbursed under this program in 1990, representing 4 percent
of total lending.
68.         Bancomext's projections show total financial operations
decreasing after reaching a peak of US$16.6 billion in 1990 to US$12.4
billion by 1994. The major change is the phaseout of the COI scheme by end
1991, which reduces the export financing program by about one half over the
peak of 1990. With the phaseout of the COI scheme and Mexico's expected
trade growth, this implies an increasing role for commercial bank's trade
financing and for Bancomext's guarantee operations. Table IIB.2 summarizes
the projected shifts in the structure of Bancomext's financial operations
over the period 1991 to 1994, and more detail is available in Annex IIB.2,
Tables 1 to 4. Other than the reduction on export financing, the major
change is the more than doubling in guarantee operations to 22 percent of
the total operations in 1994. The projections show increasing lending for
fixed asset formation, imports and financing projects abroad. Virtually
all lending will be in US dollars. At the same time, pre-shipment
financing will decrease as commercial banks become more active in the
field. In addition, Bancomext is undertaking a two-year program to
financially restructure otherwise viable export enterprises. Direct
lending operations will mainly take the form of participation in syndicated
loans. In addition, direct lending will also be used temporarily to
introduce new programs.

Bancomext's Interest Rate Policy
Current Policy
69.       The Government's general policy on development bank interest
rates is that new loans carry no interest rate subsidies, except those to
low income producers in agriculture and for low income housing. This
policy reform was supported by the FSAL approved in June, 1989. The FSAL
conditionality focussed on lending in Pesos and measured subsidies to final
borrowers against the average cost of funds to the commercial banking
system (CPP), in line with the General Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA) of
1984 between the Government and the Bank, and subsequent amendments. At
the request of authorities, the benchmark rate in the GIRA has been changed
from CPP to the marginal cost of borrowing by the Government, the rate on
Certificados de Tesoreria (Cetes).  In practice, many of the development
banks' rates are above the rate oni Cetes.
70.         Bancomext's general interest rate policy is based on two
principles:  to maintain a sound financial institution, and to offer



- 23 -
financing on competitive conditions according to international markets.
Bancomext's average return on its credit and investment portfolio is higher
than the average cost of its resources, including the new objective of
maintaining its capital in real Dollar terms, to ensure profitability.
71.         Bancomext administratively sets the interest rates for final
borrowers under its programs. The interest rates vary by program and
currency. For the major programs of pre- and post-shipment export
financing in Dollars (78 percent of lending itn 1990), the current rates are
10.5 Iercent p.a. for short-term financing of less than one year, and 13.5
percent p.a. for langer term financing of more than one year. These rates
are sometimes expressed in terms of an international benchmark rate plus a
margin, for example, for short-term export financing, an average US Prime
rate plus 0.5 percent. The setting of final lending rates has been the
subject of agreements between Mexico and the United States regarding
subsidies and countervailing duties. Bancomext's interest rates are
consistent with OECD/Bern Union rates.
72.         For importing operations using directly tied financing sources
(e.g. US EXIM bank lines), the interest rate for final borrowers is the
cost of funds plus an intermediation margin. For lending in Pesos (a minor
component of the loan portfolio), the benchmark is the Cetes rate, which is
tlhe Government's marginal cost of Peso funds, plus an intermediation
margin.
73.         For rediscounting of export financing operations using its own
resources (about 40 percent of Bancomext's export financing program in
1990), Bancomext allows commercial banks margins of 1.5 to 3 percent,
depending on the program and type of exporter, to cover intermediation
costs.
74.         Under the COI scheme, Bancomext pays a commission to the
commercial banks to use their foreign exchange funds to provide export
financing in Dollars on Bancomext's terms. The COI scheme is seen as
enlarging participation in export financing, particularly utilizing
offshore resources. Resources obtained through the COI scheme funded about
60 percent of Bancomext's export financing program in 1990, and the
commissions paid by Bancomext amounted to US$71 million. The COI scheme
commissions vary by program and type of exporter. Current commissions for
Dollar loans are in the 3 to 4.5 percent range. For export financing
transactions currently, the final rate for exporters is 10.5 percent p.a.
and commercial banks earn 13.5 to 15 percent p.a., including the
commission.
Bancomext in the Export Financing Market
75.         There is some segmentation of the market for export financing
in Dollars in Mexico by borrower and financing institution. The market as
of mid-1990 could be seen as being divided into three main groups:



-  2.4-
- export financing was available at international rates (f interest
of 9-10 percent p.a., for example, for subsidiaries of
multinationals in inter-firm transactions, or firms with foreign
collateral (multinationals may account for as much as a third of
exports of manufactures);
- many Mexican-owned firms and multinational subsidiaries borrowing
locally were being financed largely by Bancomext's progtams at a
rate of 10.5 percent p.a. (as noted above Bancomext's pre- and
post-shipment expott finan-ing programs were each about 40 per
cent of exports of manufactures in 1989);
- outside of Bancomext programs, export financing was available
locally at rates of 15-17 percent p.a. and upwards.
Bancomext's rate of interest for export financing falls within the market
range, but at this rate there is excess demand for Bancomext's financing,
which accordingly has to be rationed.  If Bancomext's programs were not
available currently, then prime firms would likely pay a market rate of
about 13-15 percent p.a., which is consistent with the total return to a
commercial bank of a COI scheme transaction.
Policy for the Transition
76.         As part of the transition to a more efficient role in a market-
oriented environment, Bancomext has begun to phase out the COI scheme by
program, and this will be completed by end-1991.  The phaseout of the COI
scheme will be reviewed by the Bank under the ESL no later than January 31,
1992 (see para. 120). After the phaseout of the COI scheme the commercial
banks will be free to provide export financing with their own resources at
market-determined terms and conditions. The Government has announced that
the commercial banks will be reprivatized.
77.          For export financing, Bancomext's interest rate policy will be
to reflect an average market rate of interest for export credits for firms
operating in Mexico. No later than July 31, 1992, after the market has
settled down after the abolition of the COI scheme, the Bank will review
the base short term export financing rate for final borrowers from
Bancomext's rediscounting operations to ensure that it fully reflects an
estimated average market reference cate (see para. 121).  That reference
rate will be an average of Dollar rates obtained by multinational exporters
in international markets, and Dollar rates obtained by Mexican exporters
from domestic commercial banks using their own resources, weighted by their
resp)ective importance in exports of non-oil manufactures (see Annex IIB.3
for details and examples).
78.         Phasing out the COI scheme and thus freeing the interest rates
of commercial banks using their own resources, and setting lending rates to
final borrowers under Bancomext's programs to average market rates would



- 25
impiove the efficiency of allocation of export financing, and increase
resources available both for Bancomext's rediscount'ng operations and from
outside of Bancomext for export financing.  The increased supply would come
from commercial banks that would find trade financing more attractive.
Credit Guarantees
79.         Bancomext has established an export production guarantee
facility, by which a guarantee is given to domestic financial institutions
covering them against the risk of non-payment of the export credits granted
to local firms. In 1990 Bancomext guaranteed export credit for US$0.8
billion, representing 6 percent of the bank's total lending and guarantee
operations and this is expected to rise to about US$2.8 billion in 1994
(see Annex IIB.2, Table 7).  Bancomext signed an agreement in 1987 with
Compania Mexicana de Seguros y Credito, S.A. (COMESEC), whereby the latter
administers on behalf of the former guarantees against political risks. As
a result of this agreement COMESEC, which only granted guarantees against
commercial risks, can now provide a single policy covering all exporters'
guarantee needs.
80.         A study of Bancomext's involvement in the field of guarantees
has been undertaken by an outside consultant as an input to the formulation
of a detailed future credit guarantee policy and program. Bancomext
intends to charge premiums sufficient to cover expected costs of the
guarantees. The detailed program will be reviewed by the Bank under the
ESL no later than January 31, 1992 (see para. 120). Initially, most
guarantee transactions would entail providing credit insurance to
comnercial banks on their working capital loans to exporters.
Promotional Activities
81.         Since 1986 Bancomext''s promotional activities have increased
considerably as a result of the Government's decision to dissolve IMCE and
transfer to Bancomext most of its functions. Promotion expenditures in
1989 were US$20 million and US$32 million in 1990 (see Annex IIB.2, Table
8). The operating expenses of the trade offices account for about 80
lercent of expenditures.  Bancomext's promotional efforts are aimed at
increasing and diversifying export products and markets, by offering
information and consulting services, training, organizing and participating
in promotional events and providing financial-promotional support. These
activities are carried out through its main office, 24 regional
representative offices and 38 representative offices worldwide.
82.         Bancomext's information service is oriented to the
identification of market opportunities and the development of export
projects, and has four main components: a) identifying firms with export
potential and promoting them abroad, b) detecting export opportunities,
c) distributing trade related publications, and d) a foreign trade
information center. Its cotnsulting services include assistance on



- 26 -
production, marketing and legal matters.  Bancomext's training activities
are channelled through its Foreign Trade Technical Institute and
representative offices abroad, which organize a variety of courses,
seminars and conferences.  Bancomext also organizes/participates in trade
fairs, expositions and missions, and provides financial support for
activities tthat promote Mexican exports, such as advertising and commercial
missions.
83.         Bancomext's promotional activities aim at providing potential
exporters with the support necessary to enter international markets.  The
institution is currently in the process of redefining its role in promoting
exports and re-structuring its internal organization to match. While this
support has been provided free of charge in the past, Bancomext recently
adopted a policy of gradually increasing cost recovery for such activities.
In order to have a basis for its charges and improve its efficiency in
delivering these services, Bancomext intends to set up cost centers for its
three major promotional activities:  information, training and technical
assistance. The details of the implementation of Bancomext's new policy of
cost recovery in export promotion activities will be reviewed by the Bank
under the ESL no later than January 31, 1992 (see para. 120).
Resource Mobilization
84.         Table IIB.3 summarizes Bancomext's financing sources for the
period 1985 to 1990. and more detail is available in Annex IIB.2, Table 6.
Bancomext obtains finances from both external markets and locally.
Externally it has obtained short term credit lines from commercial banks,
medium and long-term guaranteed credit lines from official financing
agencies, and long-term financing from the Bank. In addition, Bancomext
enters into compensated exckange and reciprocal credit agreements with
Latin American and Eastern European countries.  In 1989 Bancomext issued
US$100 million guaranteed notes in the Dutch market, which marked the
return of Mexico to capital markets after the crisis.  In 1990 Bancomext
issued another US$100 million notes in the German market. Bancomext is
also trying other new approaches to resource mobilization, for example,
securitizing export receivables.
85.         Bancomext's major int-ernal funding source is through the
amortization and interest payment receipts on its loan portfolio; other
sources include the issuance of paper in the local capital market and a
pre-payment mechanism, whereby importers pay cash for foreign purchases,
while Bancomext liquidates them upon maturity. In addition, until 1988
Bancomext received government transfers; current Government policy is to
provide no transfers to development banks.  Finally, the main local source
of funds for Bancomext programs in recent years has been the COI scheme.
Bancomext's equity is now of the order of US$1.3 billion (with the infusion
of FOMEX, which had equity of US$0.8 billion). As with many development
banks, this equity is effectively treated as an interest free loan because
the Government does not expect a dividend. From 1990 Bancomext has a new



-27-
objective of at least maintaining this equity in real US dollar terms. The
Government is considering whether development banks should pay dividends on
equity.

a/ Preliminary
86.         Bancomext's funding policy for 1991-1994 is based on:
a) consolidating and increasing the participation of Mexican commercial
banks in trade financing through various financial intermediation schemes;
b) increasing the use of available import credit lines for all types of
goods; c) obtaining credit insurance from foreign official agencies, so
that Mexican banks and importers can have direct access to resources from
abroad; d) increasing its access to international capital markets;
e) consolidating and increasing its guarantee operations, which require no
specific funding; f) decreasing the relative participation of its own
resources as a funding source; g) accessing the local capital markets only
for meeting temporary treasury needs; and h) reducing reliance on financial
support from multilateral organizations.
87.         Table IIB.4 summarizes the projected shifts in the structure of
Bancomext's financing sources over the period 1991 to 1994, and more detail



- 28 -
is available in Annex IIB.2. Table 6 and 6A.  The projections show the
phasing out of COI resources to fund operations from mid-1990 until end-
1991. They also show the financial support from multilateral organizations
remaining roughly constant over the next two years and then ceasing after
1993.  The proposed ESL would be the last Bank loan for genetal support of
Bancomext's trade financing activities. Bancomext's reliance on the
marketplace for funding increases commensurately.

88.         The increase in Bancomext's guarantee operations over the next
few years does not imply a commensurate increase in funding needs, since
fees adequate to cover expected outlays will be charged. However,
Bancomext will still require new funds, given the intended lengthening of

the average maturity of its loan portfolio, with increased emphasis on
export sales tinancing and fixed capital investment.

PART III - BANK STRATEGY
Government Strategy
91.         After a pro.tracted peritd of falling per capita income. Mexico
has resumed economic growth.  Successful dlebt restructuring arrangements
were finalized with the assistance of tthe Bank in 1990.  Having achieved
these goals, the Government's overriding objective in the remainder of its
six-year term (which ends in 1994) is to sustain economic growth and deepen
the country's modernization process.  To achieve these objectives, the
oingoing stabilization prtocess has to be consolidated successfully, external
capjital has to be attracted to spur investments, and structural reforms
must be kept on track.  Furthermore, the Government is fully aware of the
long term structural problems that could, if left neglected, derail any
medium term success.  It has therefore declared agricultural reform,
structural poverty alleviation and the environment as top priorities.
Government at the same time is implementing its plans for decentralization
to increase the fiscal authority and responsibilities of the states and
municipalities.
92.         The Government strategy is hased on the recovery of growth
through private sector investments, which would be complemented by
supporting public investment. To create a climate conducive to private
sector activity, the Government intends to continue its structural reform
program, which would help rationalize the incentive structure and further
reduce Government intervention in the economy. The Government is
procee0ing with the privatization of the telephone company and has
announced the privatization of the commercial banks. The opening of
negotiations with the USA and Canada for a free trade agreement is expected
to take place later in the year.  Privatization of the commercial banks is
likely to improve the efficiency of the financial system, help public
finances, and has already induced an increased return of flight capital.
Major new initiatives have also been launched to eliminate the remaining
anti-agricultural bias in the incentive and trade regime.
93.         Public sector investments complementing private sector activity
would be allocated for infrastructure to increase efficiency and service
levels (in irrigation, power, and transport); for poverty alleviation to
emphasize basic social sector programs (including health, nutrition, and
education) and safety net arrangements for the truly needy; and for the
environment (air pollution, deforestation) to improve the health and living
conditions of the country's people and economic growth.
94.         The sharp increases in the price of oil since the September oil
shock have altered Mexico's balance of payments outlook, but there is
substantial uncertainty regarding balance of payments prospects.  The
Government has been extremely cautious in calculating the potential
windfall benefits, and has for the time being decided to utilize any



- 31 -
increased oil generated '  eign exchange earnings to increase reserves and
decrpasp debt (see paras. 11 and 12).
Bank Assistance Strattey
95.         The Bank has greatly expanded its assistance program to Mexico
over the last five years.  In FY85 commitments for the year amounted to
US$598 milliotn, and gross disbursements were US$788 million.  Since then,
Bank annual commitments to Mexico have more than doubled, in support of the
Government's adjustment program and structural reforms. including support
for debt redurtion.  In FY90, gross disbursements reached an all time peak
of US$3.6 billion in FY90, and net transfers, a peak of US$2.5 billion.
96.         The Government's successful adoption of a comprehensive and
balanced economic programn and the conclusion of Mexico's Bank supported
debt restructuring exercise in early 1990, had begun to shift Bank lending
strategy, even before the oil price change, from an emphasis on quickly
disbursing adjustment operations to investment loans directed at
infrastructure institution building, the improvement of services in the
social sectors and the targeting of assistance to the poor.
97.         As noted in Part I, if a US$23 per barrel average price of oil
is sustained in 1991, then there would be a 'windfall gain" between US$2.5
and of US$3.3 billion for the year over what had been projected based on a
pre-crisis average price of US$17.1 per barrel.  However, the projections
for the price of oil are highly uncertain and Mexico's foreign exchange
earnings are very sensitive to changes in economic conditions in the United
States.  Some additional quickly disbursing adjustment lending for FY91 is
necessary to provide Mexico with a predictable source of balance of
payments support.  This would be done through the proposed US$400 million
Second AGSAL planned for later this year and the US$25 million adjustment
componenL of this Export Sector Loan -- as well as through IDB cofinancing
of US$450 million for the two loans.
98.         Provided there is no major change in Mexico's current balance
of payments prospects, the Bank strategy is to complete the shift from
adjustment to investment lending with this loan and the AGSAL II. The main
thrust of the Bank's assistance strategy would then be to finance
investment for physical and social infrastructure that would support
private sector led growth. This would be complemented by specific
operations to assist the poor and protect the environment. The strategy of
shifting emphasis from adjustment to investment project lending requires
strengthening the project pipeline.  The Bank and the Government are
working together to do this.
99.         As a result of the Bank's increased level of lending in Mexico
over the last several years, its exposure in Mexico rose to US$11.03
billion as of the end of FY90, which amounted to 11.33 percent of the



- 32 -
Bank's total exposure.  Mexico remains in need of substantial amounts of
lenlding to support the needs of its public sector investment program:
htowever, the pihasing down of adjustment loans will contribute to a gradual
(iPclitiw in Bank exposure. even with a continuation of substantial amounts
of investment lending.  The Bank strategy also contemplates continuing with
an extensive and well-focussed economic and sector work program which could
also ptovide a basis for proceeding with adjustment lending if conditions
warranted it.
Sector Strategy: Supporting Private Sector-led Growth
100.        Bank lending will emphasize infrastructure and human resource
development in support of the Government's efforts to revitalize private
sector led growth.  Infrastructure investment in the 1980s was reduced as
patt of the stabilization programs.  As a result of this and the increased
demand for iafrastructure associated with the resumption of economic
growth, expaanded infrastructure investment is required.  To meet these
needs, a major emphasis in the Bank's lending program will be to support
infrastructure itnvestment and Government policies to (i) reduce excessive
regulation and interference; (ii) decentralize administration and financing
of infrastructure to the local level; and (iii) utilize private sector
management skills and capital to expand infrastructure services. Human
resource development has also not kept pace with growth. During the sharp
economic downturn of the 1980s, the human resources sector, which includes
education, health, and nutrition, has suffered more than other sectors, and
is now hampering the recovery. The Bank's program of financial and
technical assistance is designed to support the Government's increased
efforts to strengthen Mexico's human capital base.  In particular, the Bank
program envisages assistance to basic education and health care as well as
in the area of vocational education and manpower training.
Sectoral Composition of Bank Lending
101.        As of December 31, 1990, Mexico had received 126 loans from the
Bank, amounting to US$16.73 billion, net of cancellations and terminations;
of these, 85 loans, totalling US$13.45 billion, were fully disbursed and
US$3.28 billion remained undisbursed. The Bank's exposure was US$11.03
billion on a cash basis.  The sectoral composition and policy content of
past lending, as well as the design of major new lending operations are
discussed below for key areas of the Mexican economy in which the Bank has
been active over the years.
Agriculture
102.        Because of the crucial importance of agriculture for the one-
third of the country's population living in rural areas, some 23% of the
Bank's past lending has supported agricultural development, and nine
operations are currently under supervision. The Bank's lending program in
agriculture is aimed at:  (a) helping correct the incentive regime in



- 33 -
agriculture through gradual reductions in input subsidies and export
controls; (b) promoting more efficient and rationale use of natural
resources supported by improved tecihniologies and services: (c) generating
employment-intensive investments in rural areas and effective assistance to
small farmers; and (d) creating an integral framework for sound rural
development. To support these goals, the Bank made a US$300 million AGSAL
in FY88. and, in FY90. made two loans, one for investments for agticultural
marketing and storage facilities, anti the other for forestry development.
Additional operations are planned tLi support further policy adjustment in
agriculture, decentralization and regional development, rehabilitation of
the irrigation infrastructure, including improved cost recovery and
maintenance operations, for food security and poverty alleviation, and for
agricultural technology.
Trade
103.        About 102 of past Bank lending has been for trade, and two
loans remain under supervision. Two trade policy loans of US$500 million
each were made in FY87 and FY88 in support of the Government's sweeping
trade reforms. The two operations supported the speedy reduction of non-
tariff barriers (quotas and official reference prices) and rationalization
of the tariff system (reduced levels and dispersion). The Bank supported
the development of non-oil exports through two export development
operations in FY83 and FY87. These export development loans were intended
to strengthen thie supply response by Mexican industry to the new trade
policy signals. A US$500 million ISPL in FY89 has supported additional
trade measures designed to liberalize imports and rationalize the incentive
regime in key subsectors.
Industry and Finance
104.        Some 21Z of the Bank's lending has supported industry, and
currently eleven projects are under supervision. The Bank's lending
strategy for industry, covering small- and medium-scale industry, mining,
industrial restructuring and technology development, is designed to
support: (a) trade policy reform; (b) strengthening a competitive
financial sector, including the provision of resources for restructuring
financial intermediaries; and (c) industrial restructuring, regulatory
reform, clarification of foreign investment rules, and export promotion to
assure a vigorous supply response to trade liberalization and increased
international competitiveness. The FY89 US$500 million ISPL and the FY89
US$500 million Parastatal Enterprise Reform Loans provide support for
policy reform in industry, and for the more efficient management and
privatization of public enterprises. The FY88 Fertilizer and Steel Sector
Loans and the FY89 Industrial Restructuring Loan provided support for
restructuring of the fertilizer, steel, automotive parts, textile, and
flower sectors, and other key private industrial subsectors in need of
restructuring. Another adjustment operation in FY89, the US$500 million
FSAL, has been providing support for the liberalization of the financial



- 34 -
sector, elimination of forced lending to the Government at subsidized
rates, increasing competition among banks and brokerage houses and
imptroving regulations in the banking sector.
Infrastructure
105.        Lending for transportation, power and water accounts for 202 of
the Bank's total in Mexico, with 8 projects currently under supervision.
Lending for infrastructure is focussing on regional development,
decentralization, more efficient public investment allocation, and improved
cost recovery. Recent Bank leans supported the highway, railways and port
sub-sectors.  Emphasis was placed on obtaining more realistic user fees and
deferring all but the highest-yielding investment projects so as to permit
a mininum of budgetary outlays for maintenance expenditures and protect the
existing capital stock.  Proposed loans would support the Government's
decentralization initiatives, cost-based pricing, and managerial
improvements. Loans are being considered to finance highway maintenance
and construction, railway rehabilitation, port development, electric power
energy development and water supply and sewerage system investment.
Housing and Others
106.        The Bank has lent some 132 of its total for tourism, urban
development, housing and vocational training. Currently three housing
loans are under supervision. Government housing programs are designed to
improve cost recovery. A Second Housing Finance loan under execution is
supporting graduated loan cost recovery linked to the income of final
borrowers, thus ensuring a reduced drain on the budget.  Further financing
in the housing sector is contemplated which would benefit low-income groups
and achieve further housing finance sector reform.
Poverty, the Social Sectors and the Environment
107.        While rapid, private sector-led growth is the most effective
means of securing sustained increases in the incomes of the poor, not all
will benefit from this process, or at least not quickly enough.  This
points to the need for special programs to assist the disadvantaged. The
Bank's strategy is to support efforts to design more cost-effective
programs for the provision of basic social services to the needy in the
four poorest states of Mexico. Provision of low-cost housing and efforts
to expand social safety nets to those outside the formal insurance programs
are also in process. The Bank is assisting the Government in redesigning
public health, education, and human resource programs to make them more
cost effective and targeted to meet the needs of the poor. A recently
approved health project, the Bank's first in the sector in Mexico, would
support decentralization measures, finance new primary health facilities,
and strengthen professional services. Similar initiatives are being
pursued in education and nutrition. A basic education project is planned
for next year and other operations are planned in the near future for



- 35 _
vocational education and manpower training. A pilot project has been
approved for improving the well-being of women in low-income areas. It
includes the provision of piped water, health and educational services,
training for productive activities, and credit for launching new
microenterprises.
108.        Bank strategy gives high priority to programs to safeguard the
envirotunent.  The Bank is preparing an air pollution operation in the
Federal District, which would tackle pollution caused by urban transport,
and the Board has approved an amendment of an ongoing urban transport
operation to support immediate relief measures requiring investments, A
loan to support the Governmetnt's environmental ministry is under
preparation. The loan would provide institutional assistance to the
ministry, finance sectoral policy studies, prepare proposals for investment
projects and help support monitoring and pollution control activities.  To
increase external resources, the Bank is promoting cofinancing of
environmental investments, particularly with Japan.
Collaboration with IFC
109.        IFC has been kept fully informed throughout the preparation of
the ESL. In FY89 and FY90, IFO provided three lines of credit, totalling
US$140 million, to commercial banks for industrial financing emphasizing
export-oriented projects. Under these operations, commercial banks are
onlending to final beneficiaries at prevailing market conditions. The
proposed ESL and IFC's lending operations are complementary in focus and
consistent in supporting the Government's industrial and financial sector
policies.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED LOAN
Loan History
110.        The Bank has had close involvement with Mexico's trade and
financial sector programs during the 1980s. The ESL is a natural follow-on
to the TPL I and II supporting the implementation of trade liberalization
and customs reforms; and to the EDP I and II providing financing for
exporting and transition for Bancomext. The support for the transition for
Bancomext is also a follow-on to the financial liberalization supported by
the FSAL. Support for reforms of customs and other public administration
of trade have been part of technical assistance and actions to be taken
under earlier lending (EDP I and II, TPL I and the ISPL). although reform
on the scale implemented was not envisaged. The ESL will be cofinanced by
the IDB in the amount of US$250 million as a fast disbursing sector
adjustment operation. The ESL has also been identified as a potential
candidate for the EXCEL program of cofinancing by OECD Export Credit
Agencies and discussions are proceeding.



_ 36 -
Loan Objectives
lll.        The ESL is part of a program to assist the Government in
achieving its objectives of promoting efficient private sector development
and increasing the effectiveness of public sector institutions so as to
enable the resumption of economic growth.  The loan would support:  (i} the
implementation of trade and customs reforms aimed at encouraging
efficiency and expanding the tradeables sector; the reforms are described
in Part IIA; and (iil the transition of Bancomext to perform a more
efficient role in trade financing in a more competitive financial system,
and it would ptovide financing for that role.  The transition is described
in Part IIB, and Bancomext's policy statement contained in Annex IIB.l
outlines the major elements and the timing of implementation, consistent
with the Government's overall development bank and financial sector
policies. Bancomext's medium term strategy will be guided by the following
basic principles: a) operate predominantly as a second tier financial
institution, b) offer trade financing at market-based interest rates,
c) focus more on providing credit guarantees and increasingly rely on other
financial intermediaries to carry out both lending and export promotional
activities, d) receive no fiscal transfers, e) provide export promotional
support increasingly on a cost recovery basis, f) decentralize activities,
and g) operate profitably including maintaining equity in real terms. As
part of the transition, Bancomext has begun to phase out the COI scheme by
program, and this will be completed by end-1991. After the phase out of
the COI scheme the commercial banks are expected to provide export
financing with their own resources and at market-determined terms and
conditions. An export sector program matrix is contained in Annex 1.5.
The Borrower, the Guarantor and Project Implementation
112.        The Government has designated Bancomext as the borrower of the
ESL. The loan would be guaranteed by the Mexican Government and Bancomext
would be responsible for project implementation. Bancomext would onlend
$275 million equivalent of the loan proceeds to exporters, mainly by means
of rediscount operations with first-tier commercial banks. The other $25
million equivalent would be transferred to the Government.
Loan Components and Disbursement
113.        The proposed US$300 million loan would support implementation
of policy changes (through Component A of US$25 million), and trade-related
credit (through Component B of US$275 million). Component A would
facilitate cofinancing of the ESL by the IDB in the amount of US$250
million as a fast disbursing sector adjustment loan. Resources available
under Components A and B would be made available in three equal portions.
Component A and US$75 million of Component B would become available upon
loan effectiveness. The remainder of Component B would be available in two
equal amounts of US$100 million only after satisfactory completion of two



-37-
policy reviews (see paras. 120 and 121).   The schematic breakdown of the
ESL would be as follows:
Credit           Policy
Component B      Component A       Total
Effectiveness    75              25                100
Review 1        100                                100
Review 2        100                                100
To allow implementation of the credit component, the closing date of the
ESL would be December 31, 1993.
114.        The loan proceeds would be relent on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, and will be used under:
I.     Component A
to reimburse 100 percent of the foreign cost of eligible imports
(on the basis of the standard negative list) up to US$25 million;
and
II.     Component B
to reimburse 100 percent of the amounts of subloans based on
satisfactory documentation up to US$275 million.
US$30 million will be made available for retroactive financing of
expenditures incurred six months prior to signing of the Loan Agreement.
115.        To avoid concentration of Bank funds, the total that could be
lent to any one project or company under Component B would be limited to
US$15 million. Subloans below US$10 million would not require any ex-ante
approval by the Bank. The free limit for Bancomext investment subloans not
requiring Bank approval under the Industrial Restructuring Project (Loan
3047-ME) approved in May 1989 was US$7 million, based on Bancomext's
extensive experience in the evaluation and implementation of Bank-financed
subloans, and the good quality of sub-loan proposals prepared by Bancomext
so far (see para. 60). Under the ESL, the Bank would neither define the
range of eligible subborrowers nor concern itself with ex-ante review and
approval of subloan proposals below US$10 million. Subloans for pre-
shipment export financing, including acquisition of inputs, fixed capital
investment, and associated working capital, would be eligible, but without
any ex-ante allocation of the Bank funds for these uses. The Bank would
conduct on a sample basis ex-post reviews of subloans below US$10 million
as a part of regular project supervision, with particular emphasis on the
quality of large sub-loan proposals.



- 38 -
Procurement
116.        Under Component A individual contracts estimated to cost less
than US$5 million equivalent each would be awarded on the basis of the
normal procurement practices of the purchasers, which have been reviewed
and are acceptable to the Bank.  Individual contracts estimated to cost
US$5 million equivalent or more may be procured on the basis of simplified
ICB procedures, following Bank guidelines. Applications for withdrawal
will be consolidated and submitted in amounts of not less than US$2 million
equivalent and the minimum value of each import transaction would not be
less than US$10,00o equivalent.
117.        Under Component B contracts for goods and works (other than
computers and office equipment) estimated to cost US$5 million equivalent
or more shall be procured under international competitive bidding
procedures in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. A preference margin,
in accordance with Bank guidelines, may be granted to local producers under
ICB contracts for goods. Contracts for goods (other than computers and
office equipment) and works estimated to cost US$2 million equivalent or
more but less than US$5 million equivalent, may be procured through
international shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank, requiring at
least three responsive price quotations from eligible suppliers. Contracts
for goods (other than computers and office equipment) and works estimated
to cost less than US$2 million equivalent may be awarded on the basis of
established commercial procurement practices acceptable to the Bank. With
regard to computers and office equipment, contracts estimated to cost more
than US$500,000 equivalent may be procured under limited international
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Contracts estimated to
cost US$500,000 equivalent or less may be procured on the basis of
international shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank requiring at least
three responsive price quotations from eligible suppliers. Procurement
documentation for all ICB contracts for goods and works (other than
computers and office equipment) will be subject to the Bank's prior review.
Also, procurement documentation for the first two contracts for computers
and office equipment estimated to cost more than US$500,000 equivalent and
the first two contracts for goods and works (other than computers and
office equipment) estimated to cost $2 million equivalent or more but less
than US$5 million equivalent under international shopping, will be subject
to the Bank's prior review.
118.        Bancomext would be responsible for maintaining loan accounts
and for the preparation and submission of withdrawal applications.
Disbursements with regard to Component A would be made on the basis of
statements of expenditure for contracts under US$5 million equivalent each
and full documentation for contracts over US$5 million equivalent from
Banco de Mexico detailing individual import transactions in each relevant
period, and their eligibility under the ESL. For Component B a special
account would be established in Banco de Mexico or any other bank
acceptable to the Bank to finance subloans, thus helping to facilitate



- 39 -
project execution.  The initial disbursement into this account would he
US$20 million equivalent. Withdrawal application towards replenishment of
the special account would include a certification that the agreed
procurement procedures have been followed.
Loan Administration and Auditing
119.        Audits of the accounts of Bancomext, including those kept for
the purposes of the project, the Special Account and the supporting
documentation for statements of expenditure used for disbursement would be
carried out annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The
audit reports will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of
the fiscal year.  In addition, a procurement verification process to be
carried out, under conditions and terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, would apply to all expenditures financed under Component A. The
terms of reference would provide clear instructions as to the verification
requirements namely, the eligibility of the imports in terms of the
negative list, source of origin and financing of the goods, the adequacy of
the procurement procedures followed, completeness of procurement
documentation including evidence of customs clearance upon arrival.
Loan Reviews
120.        The first review, not later than January 31, 1992 after
commitment of the first US$100 million of the loan and before any further
commitment of funds under the loan would be permitted, would confirm the
phaseout of the COI scheme and determine that the details of Bancomext's
credit guarantee and export promotion policies and programs are
satisfactory (see paras. 76, 80 and 83).
121.        The second, not later than July 31, 1992 after commitment of
US$200 million of the loan and before any further commitment of funds under
the loan would be permitted, would review the base rate for final borrowers
from Bancomext's rediscounting operations to ensure that it fully reflects
an average market reference rate (see para. 77).  That reference rate would
be a weighted average of Dollar rates obtained by multinational exporters
in international markets, and Dollar rates obtained by Mexican exporters
from domestic commercial banks using their own resources (see Annex IIB.3
for details).
122.        The Bank will continue to monitor the macroeconomic framework
in Mexico, and if there are changes in that framework that would materially
affect the execution of the project, the Bank may suspend disbursements.
Poverty Impact
123.        The Government's programs of trade and financial sector
liberalization are aimed at improving the efficiency of resource allocation
and stimulating growth, and thus in the longer term would contribute to



po'vertv alleviation.  The evidence from a large Bank cross-country study
sugxests that opening up the economy has little negative impact on overall
emplolyment antd the diistribution of income. To the degree that
libepralization causes shott term dislocation in particular industries which
might aggravate the situation of some poor, this would be best addressed by
carefully targeted direct support.
Envirornmental Impact
124.         Bancomext has demonstrated project evaluation and preparation
Capabilities, including environmental impact assessment.  Ba-ncomext is
tequited to consider Lthe environmental imipact of all lending, and
particularly lending for fixed capital which is generally for upgrading or
expanding the productive capacity of export firms.  Bancomext is enhancing
its environmental assessment capabilities through further training of staff
anid retainiing outside expertise.  The ex-post reviews of a sample of
subloants in the Bank supervision of the ESLJ will pay particular attention
to the quality of this work.
Benefits and Risks
125.         Implementation of th- trade reforms and the customs reforms,
will further improve incentives for efficient private sector led growth.
Customs reform of itself will uiprove tax administration and enhance
revenue collections. Definiing a more efficient role for Bancomext and
providing financing for this role during the transition, will further
enhanice financing of trade. Importantly in each of these areas the
improvements in policy and practice are ongoing, and earlier stages have
been supported by Bank lending. The Goverrnment has already exceeded
previous conditionalities in the area of trade reform.  The strength of the
ongoitig programs and the impressive record of past implementatioti in these
areas provide the rationale for continiued Bank support of the Government's
program of export sector adjustment. The small fast-disbursing component
will facilitate the cofinancing of the ESL by the IDB in the amount of
US$250 million as a fast-disbursing sector adjustment operation.
126.         There are few risks to this program.  The Government has
resolutely carried through its program of trade and financial
liberalization as a part of the broader program of stabilization and
structural reform over the past five years.  This program enjoys strong
lpublic suppiort. Policy reversals which would endanger the program are
piossible but considered unlikely.  Even if either for external or internal
reasons Mexico were unable to stay the course of broader economic reforms,
the programs that thie ESL would support irn customs reform and Bancomext's
transition, would have a good chanice of stayinig in place and yielding
substantial benefits to the economy.  In a broader sense, the prospects of
Mexico's traded sector are always tied to the health of the world economy,
but this is independent of the program.



Compliance with the Financial Sector Operations Report
127.        The proposed US$275 million credit line component of the ESL
follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Financial Sector
operations Report. The proposed loan would support Bancomext's transition
from being a traditional Government-delendent development bank to a
financial institution more able to withstand the test of the market.
Bancomext's medium term transition strategy and a timetable for
implementation are in line with the Government's global policy for Mexico's
development banks and financial sector, oriented towards fostering a
competitive market based financial system.
128.        The Bank emphasized the following "ground rules' for supporting
Bancomext's transition strategy to ensure Bancomext becomes an efficient
financial institution: a) no transfer or subsidies from the Government;
b) maintaining concentration on second tier lending; c) lending rates in
line with market rates: d) greater market orientation in funding and cost
recovery; including phase out of multilateral development banks as a
funding source; and e) financial projections that demonstrate profitability
and sound financial structure.
129.        Bancomext specializes in providing trade related financing, for
which it is a major source. The principal reason why other financial
institutions have not participated to a greater degree in trade financing
is Mexico's limited access to foreign funds, a result of macroeconomic
uncertainties, associated in part with its large external debt. The
Government's stabilization program implemented during the last few years
has improved Mexico's credit-worthiness, which has received an additional
boost from foreign debt restructuring. Access to foreign sources of
financing is likely to improve in the future. The Government has advanced
on the liberalization of the financial system, including the development
banking system. These developments and the policy changes supported by the
ESL will lead to the increased participation of commercial banks in trade
financing and the corresponding decline in Bancomext's relative importance.

PART V - COLLABORATION WITH THE I?
130.        Bank/IMF collaboration has been close over the years,
especially since 1982, when the Fund began to assist the Government in
addressing the underlying causes of the economic crisis. Since that time,
the Government has benefitted from an extended arrangement for SDRs 3.4
billion, a special emergency drawing for SDRs 291 million after the 1985
earthquake, a stand-by for SDRs 1.4 billion in 1986 and, in 1989, for an
SDRe 2.8 billion extended arrangement through 1992 and a drawing of SDRs
453 million under the compensatory facility.
131.        Consultations between Fund and Bank staff concerning Mexico's
current economic situation and prospects have led to a mutual understanding
about the measures needed to bring the stabilization program to a
successful conclusion, strengthen the balance of payments, and restore
sustainable growth. Further consultations on macroeconomic performance
will take place between our two institutions during the implementation
period of our ongoing operations.
PART VI - RECOHMENDATION
132.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

(a)    The first review, later than January 31, 1992 after commitment of
the first US$100 million of the loan and before any further commitment of
funds under the loan would be permitted, would confirm the phaseout of the
COI scheme and determine that the details of Bancomext's credit guarantee
and export promotion policies and programs were satisfactory.
(b)    The second, not later than July 31, 1992 after commitment of US$200

Annex IIA.1
MERCHANDISE TRADE REGIME
1.          Import policy -- QRs and tariffs.  As of February 1990, some
240 tariff items remain subject to quantitative import licensing.
accounting for about two percent of total items, but covering 19.9 percent
of tradeables production (1986 weights). The sectoral make-up of the
remaining import QRs is shown in Table 1 (see also Table 5).

Source: Bank estimates using SECOFI data.
2.          The February 1990 QR coverage figure is more than three
percentage points below the target of 23.3 percent agreed under the ISPL.
The remaining QRs in the agriculture and agroindustry sectors apply
largely to products subject to price controls and marketing agreements.
These trade controls are being looked at in the broader context of
agricultural pricing and marketing, to be supported by a proposed second
AGSAL. In the manufacturing sector, QRs apply to mainly sectoral programs
("Programas de Rama") for pharmaceuticals, autos and auto-parts,
pharmaceuticals and microcomputers. Action plans for elimination of import
controls in these sectors were prepared in the context of the ISPL. The
remaining QRs on pharmaceutical tariff items will be eliminated gradually
over the period to 1993. Removal of import controls in the automotive
sector started in mid-1990 with light trucks and buses, and then from 1991
foreign automakers located in Mexico wiil1 be able to import cars not made
in Mexico subject to certain performance requirements. Domestic content
requirements were also reduced.  The gradual liberalization of QRs in the
microcomputer sector was completed in mid-1990. Mexico is a major exporter
of oil and derivatives and the control of competing imports is required
under the Constitution. These QRs will remain.



- 52 _
3.          The tariff range is 0-20 percent, and the production weighted
average is 12.5 percent.  (Mexico introduced the Harmonized System of
tariff classification in July 1988.) The maximum tariff is 10 percentage
points below the target agreed under TPL I}. From January 1989, the
minimum tariff for most goods was raised to 10 percent. Fine-tuning of
tariffs has been going on since then, but no further changes in the basic
structure are planned. Only some 300 tariff items (out of a total of
11.949) were subject to the 0 and 5 percent rates, but they account for
nearly one quarter of imports. Mexico's tariffs are bound with GATT
partners at 50 percent, but at this stage, the authorities have indicated
that they would be unwilling to bind the existing maximum tariff without
multi- and bi-lateral negotiation. Binding at 20 percent would give
unmistakable credibility to the permanence of the tariff reform, but the
authorities consider binding an important bargaining to be used in
negotiations.
4.           Export policy -- QRs and taxes.  Export regulation has
traditionally been less binding than import restrictions (and information
is scarcer). Only about 370 items are subject to export licensing,
accounting for about 17.6 percent of tradeaoles production (1986 weights).
QRs are high in agriculture and agroindustry. The sectoral breakdown of
export controls is shown in Table 2 (see also Table 6).

Controls 2       Total Coverage a/
Agriculture, Livestock & Fishery              36.7                  6.4

at Production of tradeables, 1986 weights.
5.          There has been considerable progress in removing export
controls recently -- for example, with the collapse of the International
Coffee Agreement, quantitative restrictions, reference prices and taxes on
coffee exports were lifted. The overall production coverage of export
controls has been red4ced by about one-quarter since mid-1988. There were
no targets for of export controls agreed under previous Bank lending. The
remaining export controls in agriculture and agroindustry are being looked
at in the broader context of agricultural pricing and marketing, to be
supported by the proposed second AGSAL. The remaining export controls in
manufacturing are mainly "involuntary", resulting from industrial
countries' trade restraints, particularly in steel and textiles.
6.          Export policy -- direct measures.  Mexico like many other Latin
American countries has also introduced various schemes to directly support



- 53 -
exporting, even while still restricting imports and in effect taxing
exports. The liberalization program since mid-1985 has done more to reduce
the bias against exporting from the trade regime than these schemes.
7.          Exporters have access to duty free imported inputs through
various schemes:  (i) the scheme for the maquiladora industry, discussed in
the next section; (ii) a temporary import scheme based on three-year export
agreements, which provides duty-free imported inputs and machinery; and
(iii) a duty-drawback scheme for infrequent exporters which reimburses
duties paid. The general lowering and simplification of tariffs since mid-
1985, has reduced the need for such schemes and at the same time eased
their implementation. The introduction in January 1989 of the minimum
tariff of 10 percent has increased the demand for the schemes. Large
exporting firms also have ALTEX (Empresas Altamente ExPortadoras) status
which confers benefits, including special attention from the public sector
in processing export related documents, easier access to credit and import
permits, and faster tax reimbursements.
8.          The Temporary Import Regime (PITEX) which is contained within
the Customs Law) was introduced in 1985 and was modified in 1986 and 1988
to expand benefits and coverage. Domestic companies which have ongoing,
predictable exports of manufactured goods are eligible for PITEX for three
years at a time, as long as exports reach agreed-upon shares of sales.
Exporters which directly or indirectly place either a minimum of 10 percent
of their annual sales in the international market, or export the equivalent
of US$500,000 a year, can import without duties: raw materials and inputs,
packaging, fuels, lubricants, adhesives, spare parts and other materials
for use in exports. In addition, companies which export at least 30
percent of their sales, may also temporarily import machinery, equipment
and related spare parts as well as tools needed for research, industrial
security, quality control, and training of personnel. Temporary imports
are also Value Added Tax (VAT) free.and exporters are reimbursed for any
VAT paid on inputs.
9.          The temporary import scheme has grown to import about US$1.4
billion for an export total of US$7.2 billion in 1989 (Table 3). The
halving of tariffs in December 1987 is the most likely explanation for the
decrease in programs in 1988. Temporary imports under PITEX grew more
quickly than total imports in 1989. The increase in PITEX activity likely
resulted from the recent increase in the minimum tariff.

10.         The Duty Drawback scheme was introduced in 1985 and modified in
1987 to expand coverage. Users of this scheme are infrequent exporters and
indirect exporters which can not plan their future operations as required
for PITEX. The scheme provides reimbursement of tariffs paid on raw
materials, parts and components, packaging, fuels, lubricants and other
materials incorporated into exports.  The amount reimbursed is calculated
based on the prevailing exchange rate at the time of import to eliminate
the exchange risk for the exporter. Within the duty drawback scheme
requests were approved accounting for a total of US$2.5 million for exports
of about US$528 million in 1989. Activity under the Duty Drawback scheme
decreased during 1989.

11.         While exporters report that these schemes work reasonably well,
they suffer the typical difficulties of all such schemes -- repayments

have been delayed (sometimes as long as six months); procedures tend to be
overly centralized in Mexico City and overly bureaucratic; indirect, small,
and distant exporters sre less well covered; administrative costs are high;
and there are leakages to the domestic market.
12.         The Government is continuing to monitor the experience with the
schemes and has implemented some important changest (a) for the PITEX
scheme, decentralization from Mexico City. supported under the ISPL, of
about half of related administrative procedures, as well as improvements in
application procedures and export verification; (b) for the Duty Drawback
scheme, further reduction of duty rebate waiting period to less than one
month; and (c) for export-related VAT measures: (i) further reduction of
VAT rebate period to two months; (ii) maquila suppliers exempt from
charging the VAT on maquila inputs; (iii) exporters able to deduct the VAT
paid on their products from any tax they owe.
Maguiladora sector policy
13.         The in-bond assembly or maguiladora industry has been operating
in Mexico since the late 1960s and today is a major source of foreign
exchange. Firms import duty-free plant, equipment and components for
processing from, and re-export the assembled product to, mostly the United
States, whqre duty is paid on the value added only.
14.         The maquiladora industry was the result of joint US and Mexican
efforts to alleviate Mexican unemployment along the border. Accordingly,
the first maquiladoras were located along the US border. Today
maquiladoras can be set up anywhere in the country except Mexico City,
Monterrey and Guadalajara. Most of the maquila output is produced by
foreign subsidiaries of US companies. There are about 1800 operating
maquila plants the great bulk of which are located in the northern border
cities. Their development in areas far from the US border has been slow
apparently due to high cost and unreliability of transport. However, this
situation may be improving with recent deregulation.
15.         The share of domestic inputs to total inputs in the maquiladora
industry at around 1.7 percent today and has not changed much in the last
ten years. The relatively small use of local inputs is a common feature of
export processing zones -- for example, in Philippines and Malaysia the
share is six percent and four percent respectively. A disincentive to the
use of local inputs is the US treatment of imports of the Mexican maquila
industry, which in.effect provides protection for US production of
intermediates. Under items 9802.00.60 and 9802.00.80 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States. US imports (Mexican exports) from the
maquila are subject to duty on the value of the imported product minus the
value of the components fabricated in the US. Almost all maquila exports
are US dutiable 9802.00.60 and 9802.00.80 imports. Relaxing this treatment
would encourage higher local content, but discourage maquila operations in
general. Also, most Mexican industrial production is in central Mexico,
which means high transport costs and logistical difficulties to get local
inputs to the border zore.



- S6 _
16.         The maquiladora program was regulated by the August 15, 1983,
Decree for the Development and Operation of the Maquiladora Industry. In
general, the Law exempts maquiladoras from majority Mexican ownership
requirements. Foreign exchange proceeds from the maquiladora industry are
converted at the controlled exchange rate, to pay only for domestic
expenses such as wages, administrative costs, and leasing. A new
"reglamento' for the maquiladora industry was published in December 1989.
The new decree contains a series of important measures, all in the right
direction to: remove regulations inhibiting procedures for starting and
renewing operations; facilitate integration with national industry; enhance
pollution control; and promote the industry abroad.
17.         The Government recognizes that the maquiladora industry is one
of the fastest growing, dynamic sectors of the Mexican economy and
considers it as a priority promotional/investment sector for Mexico's
economic development. The maquiladora industry has become a large and
growing source of foreign exchange for Mexico and a first step to
attracting foreign investment in Mexico. The Government is concerned with
promoting rather than regulating the sector. Inadequate industrial and
social infrastructure are acknowledged as continuing constraints to the
maquiladora development.
Public Administration of Trade
18.         Two institutional changes during 1989 supported continuation of
the reform process. .The previously inactive Tariff Commission began
operations again in a streamlined form, based on a decree of June 8, 1989.
It meets at the Director-General level twice a month, and at the Secretary
level bi-monthly. The Tariff Commission has been looking at medium-term
trade policy strategy, and reviewing remaining QRs and tariffs. The Tariff
Commission also looks at anti-dumping cases.
19.         An Export Commission was established by a decree of July 27,
1989 to promote export activity through a consultative process (building on
the successful Pacto/PECE approach) working at both national and regional
levels and involving equal numbers of representatives from the private
sector and key ministries. The national body meets monthly at the
Secretary level, and quarterly with the President. The Commission gives a
clear signal that exports are top priority, and provides an expedient and
efficient forum for airing and resolving exporters' complaints.

Annex 1IB.1
Bancomext's Policy Letter
(English Translation of Spanish Original Letter)
Dear Mr. Conable:
1.          The purpose of this document is to set forth the major
guidelines that are to govern the operations of the National Foreign Trade
Bank (taneo Nacional de Comercio Exterior--BANCONEXT) during the next five
years.
2.          BANCOMEXT is the development bank responsible for financing and
promoting Mexico's foreign trade of non-oil goods and services. Bancomext
has the credit resources, facilities and infrastructure previously
allocated to three institutions: BANCOMEXT itself, the Manufacturing
Exports Development Fund (Fondo para el Fomento de las Exportaciones de
Productos Manufactureros--FOMEX), and the Mexican Foreign Trade Institute
(Instituto Mexicano de Comercio Exterior).
3.          BANCOMEXT's basic objectives are to:
-      lmaximize foreign exchange earnings from the marketing of non-
oil goods and services;
-     promote the rational utilization of external sources to finance
Mexico's priority import needs;
-     facilitate and promote the participation of the various
economic agents in Mexico's foreign trade.
4.          The frame of reference for BANCOMEXT's operations is contained
in the 1989-94 National Development Plan (Plan National de Desarrollo--
PND), the National Industrial and Foreign Trade Modernization Program
(Programa Nacional de Modernizaci6n Industrial y del Comercio Exterior--
PNMICE) and the National Development Financing Program (Programs Nacional
de Finananciamento al Desarrollo--PRONAFIDE). Some of the most relevant
aspects are:
The openness of the economy will be maintained and
consolidated, and the external sector will be promoted as
Mexico's main engine of growth.
Non-oil exports will grow faster than GDP, within the range of
10-12 percent a year.
Public and private investment will grow in real terms by 8-10
percent a year.



- 66 -
-     Foreign investment and medium- and long-term resource
mobilization will behave in line with the success of the
economic measures, many of which are already in effect.
-     A financial system will be needed that is able to compete
adequately with international banks and to meet the growing
needs posed by higher economic activity.
-     The Government will strengthen the role and operation of the
development banking system as an effective economic policy
instruments.
5.          In the context of the economic policy guidelines established by
the present Administration, BANCOMEXT has a fundamental role to play.  It
will therefoLe be important to count on the financial and technical support
of the multilateral financing agencies to help accomplish the transition to
a more efficient developmnent bank in an increasingly market-oriented
setting.
6.          BANCOMEXT's development over the next five years will be guided
by the following basic ptinciples:
(a)   BANCOMEXT will maintain a profitable and financial self-
sufficiency witlhout detriment to its activities of promoting
Mexico's foreign trade. It will aim to operate without fiscal
transfers and maintain its net capital in dollar terms.
(b)   It will encourage and expand the use of credit insurance as an
operational instrument.
(c}   The necessary conditions will be created to give BANCOMEXT
greater access to market financing in order to reduce the
importance of the internationial financial agencies as financing
sources.
(d)   Cost centers will be established in the Bank's promotional
activities in order to evaluate their effectiveness and self-
sufficiency.
(e)   BANCOMEXT's operations will be geared basically to
rediscounting. Its relationship with the financial
intermediaries will call for joint actions to develop and
strengthen the capacities of the commercial banks to operate
according to international conditions.
(f)   BANCOMEXT will retain the possibility of acting as first-tier
bank in cases where its intervention is necessary, such as
(a) to demonstrate the viability of credit programs, (b) in the
case of large projects, in which it will seek to develop
cofinancing with other financial institutions, and (c) in the
case of projects which, although they have been shown to be



- 67
viable and to have a favorable impact on foreign trade, are
not catered for by the commercial banks.
(g)   The resource mobilization effort will allow BANCOMEXT to grant
financial assistance on competitive terms according to the
market.
hI)   It will seek to use the financial intermediaries'
infrastructure for lending operations and for supporting the
promotion of non-oil foreign trade through training. marketing,
informational, technical assistance, legal assistance and other
activities.
(i)   Recognizing that one of its basic goals is to increase export
value as well as volume, BANCOMEXT will develop schemes for
expanding the export of proJucts with higher value added, more
closely liniked with the needs of the final purchasers of
Mexican goods and services.
(j)   Schemes will be developed for fostering decentralization of
operations in order to enhance the efficiency of both lending
and promotional activities.
7.          Recently the need for BANCOMEXT to support primary-sector
activities such as fishing, farming and stockraising and mining, as well as
tertiary activities such as tourism, gradually raising the value added of
those activities has been recognized. To that end BANCOHEXT will expand
its lending in those sectors, without neglecting the manufacturing sector,
which will continue to receive major support.
8.          In view of the type of financial needs to which BANCOMEXT's
suppott is geared, it is proposed to reduce working capital financing and
increase fixed investment lending to export enterprises.  Similarly, it
will increase its support for imports and the financing of medium- and
long-term projects abroad. BANCOMEXT's share of activities in support of
import substitution will be gradually transferred to other institutions.
9.          BANCOMEXT does not aim to offer financial support for all non-
oil foreign trade transactions. In its financial strategy, therefore, it
will seek to develop greater complementation with the commercial banks,
encouraging the creation and development of area and sectoral programs and
focusing its activity on thie following enterprises and operations:
(a)   Exports
large multinational enterprises
Mexican enterprises with recurrent export activity
small and medium-sized exporters
foreign trade consortia



-68-
-     suppliers to exporters
-     large export projects
(b)   Iports
-     capital goods and services
-     bulk volumes of raw materials
-     widely-used raw materials
-     basic products
(c)   Financial agency activities
-     federal Government
-     large infrastructure projects or industrial projects with
foreign participation
10.         In implementing its programs BANCOMEXT will pay due regard to
the differences that exist between the operations and the participants
indicated in paragraph 9.
11.         BANCOMEXT's first-tier credit activity has changed from a
maximum of 50 percent of the total program in 1984 to 11.3 percent in 1989,
and its goal will be to reduce its first-tier operations to 10 percent in
1994; the latter include an increase in participation in syndicated loans.
12.         BANCOHEXT's interest rate policy is guided by the following
basic principles: maintaining a sound financial institution, and
furnishing financial support on competitive terms according to the
international market conditions.
13.         BANCOMEXT's interest rate for end-users of short-term export
credit programs (pre-export and sales) will be in line with the prevailing
market terms for dollar financing of operations of this kind. As of July
1992 BANCOMEXT will review its interest rate to keep it as an average
market rate. The rate will be around a weighted average reflecting the
cost of external financing for export operations of multinational
enterprises, and the interest rates at which Mexican commercial banks lend
dollar resources to finance export operations.
14.         In medium- and long-term lending to finance export sales,
BANCOtlEXT's policy is to adjust to the conditions established by the 'OECD
Consensus."
15.         The interest rates on investment loans will pay due regard to
international medium-term financing conditions and also the degree of
credit risk involved in long-term lending.



- 69 -
16,         The intertpt ratps charged on import financing will be kept in
line with the conditions set by the sources of funds with respect both to
capital goods and servites imports (at medium and long term) and to basic
pLoducts.  The interest tates for these programs will therefore be
preferential so far as funditng conditions permit.
17.         BANCOMFXT will maintain its capacity to carry out its financial
operations profitably. The average yield of its loan and investment
portfolios will exceed the average cost of its resources.
18.         Experience with credit insurance has been limited.  BANCOMEXT
is therefore conducting an Expiort Credit and Guarantee Insurance study with
the aim of setting up by Decenmber 1991 an action program allowing it to
develop export credit and guarantee insurance as an important support
instrument. Its credit insurance programs would distinguish risk by
country and term of operation. Premiums would be based on actuarial
calculations and international practices that fully reflect the possible
risks borne by BANCOMEXT.
19.         During the next five years BANCOMEXT will tend to raise the
share of its credit insurance and funding programs more than that of direct
ciedit so that the domestic financial system directly finances the
production and export of Mexican products.  In that way these activities
would receive the automatic and willing support of the domestic and
international money and capital markets.  This will depend in large measure
on the favorable evolution of the economic policy measures undertaken by
the Government.
20.         BANCOMEXT's main sources of funds will be portfolio recovery
and rotation, foreign loans (mostly commercial), money markets and
international capital. Domestic markets will be used only to cover
temporary cash-flow needs.
21.         BANCOMEXT will seek at all times to obtain resources at longer
maturities than that of its lending operations; however, current prospects
appear to point to the development of term, currency and interest rate
packages and mixes. As a result, fiaancial administration in implementing
coverage mechanisms for financial intermediaries and enterprises becomes a
relevant activity.
22.         On the basis of its foreign trade operations BANCOMEXT has
developed a technical capacity to structure non-conventional funding
mechanisms. That source of funds will receive special attention within the
overall resource mobilization effort.
23.         BANCOMEXT is obtaining guaranteed and commercial lines to be
used by Mexican conmercial banks, particularly those that lack the
necessary infrastructtre to for direct access to international markets.
24.         The legal merger of FOMEX with BANCOMEXT substantially enhances
BANCOMEXT's ability to raise funds and meet the challenge posed by its
transition process. The merger provides the basis for a more solid



- 70 -
financial structure that will help obtain funds from commercial and
international capital market lines.
25.         BANCOMEXT will adhere to its present policy of not receiving
fiscal transfers from the Government or resorting to subsidized central
bank rediscounting for the performance of its financing operations.
26.         BANCOMEXT's development, particularly in Mexico's non-oil
external sector, will depend on the adequacy, timeliness and
competltiveness of the resources available to it to support the expansion
of export capacity and trade activity.
27.         In the context of its transition toward a more efficient
development bank and of its efforts to boost the resources available to
exporters, BANCOMEXT intends to set up a program to phase out the COI
scheme. In particular, it proposes to eliminate the COI over a maximum
period of 18 months after July 1990, in accordance with the following
timetable:
Max. COI volume
Year        Period           (millions of US$)
1991        Jan-Jun                3,396
Jul-Dec               2,236
1992        Jan-Dec                 -0-
1993        Jan-Dec                 -0-
1994        Jan-Dec                 -0-
28.         BANCOMEXT will continue to assign great importance to the
flexibility and ease of operation that its relatively small size allows.
To that end it has set a target of 10 percent staff growth during the
period 1990-94, chiefly in the regional offices of the interior and in the
Bank's technical and financial areas. Decentralization will be the chief
engine of growth of staff. The basic emphasis will be on human resource
quality.
29.         Similarly, BANCOMEXT will follow an appropriate policy of
strengthening its organizational and management structure to enable it to
meet the challenge posed by the transition process.
30.         BANCOMEXT's present policy in promotional activities reflects
its strategy of gradual recovery of the maximum possible portion of the
cost of support activities of this kind. A promotional cost recovery
strategy will be in place by the end of 1991.
31.         BANCOMEXT has commercial advisory offices in various parts of
the world which perform a series of promotional activities.  In order to
strengthen their importance and meet the challenge of enhancing the Bank's
efficiency, a review of their functions was initiated in 1990 with the



71 -
olbiect of adjusting the work they do in three types of services:
secretarial, intelligence, and marketing.
32.         Once the advisory offices have been suitably structured,
BANCOMEXT will proceed to identify and implement a cost recovery system in
those services where such a policy is possible and desirable.
33.         BANCOMEXT's financial and promotional support services for the
development of foreign trade are offered for the most part through its
offices in the Federal District; however, most foreign trade activity is
conducted by enterprises located in the interior of Mexico. To resolve
this problem BANCOMEXT will seek to strengthen its presence in the interior
tly decentralizing and deconcentrating some of its functions as well as its
human and physical resources.
34.         Decentralization is being carried out in two stages:
(i) strengthening of the seven regional directorates and the existing seven
promotion offices (1989-90), and (ii) creation of eleven promotion offices
(1940-91).
35.         BANCOMEXT's functions and activities in a more competitive
economic environment require that it be able to respond promptly and
flexibly to calls on its administrative capacity.  Bancomext is a federal
public administration entity, subject to the norms and general rules of the
Federal Government. However, under the new "Law of Credit Institutions"
(July 1990) the Board of Directors is strengthened with "non-delegable"
powers and attributions such as the approval of the operative and financial
programs, general expense and investment budgets, the approval of
acquisition annual programs, leasing and transfer of real estate,
implementation of works and services, the basic organic structure, levels
of employment and basis for the elaboration of salary tables and the
establishment, relocation and closing of branches and offices.
36.         Creative thinking, timely decision-taking and capacity to
evaluate domestic and international economic phenomena are the fundamental
basis through which BANCOMEXT will undertake dynamic adjustment of its
organization and operation in order to achieve its objectives of providing
comprehensive support for Mexico's non-oil foreign trade.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. Humberto Soto Rodriguez
Director General

Annex IIB.3
Illustrative Example Of The Average Market Reference Interest Rate
This annex provides illustrative examples of the calculation of
the average reference rate of interest to be used in the second review
under the ESL. The estimate of the reference rate would be obtained from
the results of a survey of interest rates obtained for export financing,
which would be undertaken no later than July 31, 1992, after the market had
settled down after the COI scheme has been phased out. The average market
reference interest rate for export financing will be defined in terms of
the Dollar rates obtained by two groupings of exporters, weighted by their
respective importance in exports of non-oil manufactures. The two rates
are:
(i) the international rates of interest obtained by subsidiaries of
multinational firms; an indicator of these would be the rates
on Bankers Acceptances in New York plus 12; and
(ii) the rates obtained by prime Mexican-owned firms from Mexican
commercial banks; an indicator of these would be the average
rate charged by the three largest commercial banks (Banamex,
Bancomer, and Serfin) for pre- and post-shipment financing in
dollars.
The weights will be the approximate non-oil manufactures export values for
the two exporter groupings for the most recently available semester, viz:
(i) for multinational firms, which would be obtained from a listing
of exports by firm; and
(ii) for Mexican-owned firms, which would be obtiined from the
commercial banks.
To reflect the confidence interval in the estimate and to allow Bancomext
some flexibility in setting rates, adjustment of the base rate would only
be required if the reference rate was outside the range of Bancomext's
base rate for fipal borrowers plus or minus 0.5%.
An illustrative example set out in the table below roughly
reflects mid-1990 market rates with 1989 export weights. Multinational
firms have been assumed to account for 352 of export of non-oil
manufactures or about US$4.5 billion. and to obtain finance at a rate of
about 9.5Z. Mexican-owned firms have been assumed to account for the
amount of exports financed by commercial banks under the COI scheme or
about US$4.0 billion. and to obtain finance at a rate of 13:, about the
total return to a commercial bank of a COl transaction. This gives a
weighted market average of 11.12.

Total/average                $8.5 bn.            11.1Z
If this calculation were to apply in mid-1992 and Bancomext's
base rate were still 10.5?, then the average market reference rate would be
greater than Bancomext's base rate plus the flexibility margin of 0.5?.
Thus the agreement would require Bancomext to raise the rate for final
borrowers on its rediscounts to the reference rate of 11.1? pa.
In a second illustrative example, the dollar rate obtained by
the Mexican-owned firms from commercial banks is assumed to be 12.02. lower
than the COI transaction total rate. All other data remain the same. Then
the average market reference rate of interest would be 10.7? 'p.a.

Total/average                $8.5 bn.            10.72
If this calculation were to apply in mid-1992 and Bancomext's
base rate were still 10.52, then the average market reference rate would be
less than Bancomext's base rate plus the flexibility margin of 0.52. Thus
the agreement would allow Bancomext to maintain the rate for final
borrowers on its rediscounts of 10.52 pa.
