SECOllD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 2310-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This overview is based on the Project Completion Report for
Thailand's Second Agricultural Credit Project, for which a loan of US$70
million (Loan 2310-TH), was  approved  on  June 9,  1983.  The project was
cofinanced by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),
which provided a loan of SDR 18.75 million (US$20.2 million). The project
was completed on December 31, 1985 and both loans were closed on July 31,
1986. The Bank loan was fully disbursed on February 26, 1986, but IFAD
loan disbursements continued through July 31, 1986. The Bank loan was made
direct to the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC)
with the Government acting as  guarantor.    The  IFAD loan was made to the
Government for onlending to BMC on the same terms and conditions. The
Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by BAAC. The PCR Evaluation
Summary, Basic Data Sheet and Overview were prepared by Country Depart-
ment II in the Asia Region.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not  audited  by  OED  staff.   Final comments oa these
documents were received from BAAC in its letter of November 9, 1988,
annexed to the PCR (see Attachment I) and from the Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives in its letter dated November 21, 1988 (Attachment II).

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 2310-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.       The main objectives of the Second Agricultural Credit Pr'4ect were
to: (a) improve the financial viability of the Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) and reduce its dependence on subsidies;
(b) increase BAAC's incentive to mobilize rural savings; and (c) improve
BAAC's role in providing credit to small farmers who could not qualify for
commercial bank loans.
Project Costs, Financing and Disbursements
2.       IBRD Loan 2310-TH for US$70 million, approved on June 9, 1983, and
IFAD Loan 125-TH for SDR 18.75 million (US$20.2 million equivalent) were
expected to finance about .6Z of the project, the remainder to be financed by
BAAC. Actual costs rose slightly from appraisal estimates, from US$160 mil-
lion to US$165 millions the cost in Baht rose from B 3,680 billion to B 4,027
billion, largely attributable to the November 1984 devaluation of the Baht.
With its foreign loans denominated in US dollars and SDRs, BAAC was able to
finance a larger volume of activities than anticipated at appraisal. Dis-
bursements were ahead of appraisal estimates throughout the project period.
Both the IFAD and IBRD loans were fully disbursed and closed on July 31, 1986.
Implementation
3.       At appraisal, it was intended that the Bank loan finance medium- and
long-term subloans throughout the country, with about 17Z (B 274 million)
targeted to reach small farmers in the North and Northeast. IFAD funds (B 458
million) were to be used to finance short-term and medium-/long-term loans to
farmers in only the North and Northeast. The medium-/long-term lending was to
finance mainly draft animals. livestock, land improvements and farm equipment.
The short-term lending would meet the credit needs of small farmers partici-
pating in the BAACtDepartment of Agricultural Extension (DAE) pilot project
scheme to improve credit services and technical advice to small farmers by
coordinating BAAC and DAE activities. Because it considered medium- and long-
term loans to small farmers to be of high risk in the absence of adequate
supporting technical services, BAAC was willing to make term loans to small
farmers only in those areas where extra services couild be provided. Also,
BAAC was committed to using alternative sources of funds for term credit from
the Japanese OECF to finance farmers in the North and Northeast. For these
reasons, the project targets for such lending in the North and Northeast were
only partially met (B 364 million actually lent, compared with an appraisal
target of B 978 million). The balance of the aforementioned funds were real-
located to finance short-term crop production loans.



- iv -
4.       BAAC's overall financial performance remained sound during the proj-
ect period. BAAC's total assets increased to B 29.4 billion as of March 31,
1986. and its total equity from B 2.5 billion to B 2.7 billion over the same
period (after accounting for the B 547 million of foreign exchange losses on
foreign currency-denominated loans). At the end of the period, BAAC's debt-
equity ratio was 10:1, well within its statutory limit. Loan disbursements
increased from B 11.8 billion in FY92 to B 17.4 billion in FY85, which is in
line with the appraisal projection of B 17.6 billion.
Project Impact
5.       To pursue the objective of becoming a financially self-sustaining
institution, BAAC required an adequate spread between its lending rate and the
interest payable on domestic savings. The ratchet principle set forth in the
Loan Agreement, which fixed BAAC's lending rate in relation to its deposit
rate, enabled BAMC to maintain lending rates closer to commercial bank rates,
despite political pressures to lower them. As a result, BAAC was able to
maintain its lending rate unchanged at 14Z throughout the project period when
market rates declined, resulting in both a narrowing of the lending rate gap
between BAAC and the commercial banks from 31 to 1.5Z, and an increase in the
margin between BAAC's lending rate and its deposit rate from 1.51 to 31. This
situation encouraged BAAC to make special efforts to mobilize rural savings,
resulting in a rise in deposits from the general public by 671, from B 3.3
billion in FY82 to B 5.5 billion in FY85. Total income rose from B 2.7 bil-
lion in FY82 to B 3.5 billion in FY85, due to an increase in the volume of
lending and the lending rate of 14S. With the increase in direct lending to
Individual farmers, lending to farmers' associations which had a poor repay-
ment record continued to decline sharply from B 57 billion in FY82 to B 26
billion in FY85.
6.       The project helped to strengthen the links between research, exten-
sion and credit. BAAC's studies have revealed that: (a) its clients are
using increasing quantities as well as improved formulas of chemical fertili-
zers; (b) more clients are using improved seed varieties; and (c) where irri-
gation facilities are ava'iiable, clients are taking loans for land leveling in
order to switch from the transplanting method to the more cost-effective
broadcasting method oe paddy planting. The appraisal report calculated finan-
cial rates of return for five selected investment models, ranging from 162 to
26Z. The PCR has recalculated the rates of return on two major individual
activities, which showed 291 for livestock raising and 28Z for power tillers.
Lessons Learned
7.       (a) In reaching new high-risk segments of the market, it is essential
that 'mstitutions like BAAC first design and implement a pilot project which,
if successful, can be replicated more broadly.  (b) The foreign exchange risk
on foreign borrowings can be a serious burden on an institution like BMAC,
which is not allowed to charge commercial rates for its lending operations.
In this regard, BAAC considers that it is incurring heavy foreign exchange
losses because of this project and that is the main reason that, despite a
very satisfactory working relationship, BMAC has thus far been unwilling to
consider further borrowing from the World Bank.



THAILAND
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 2310-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
Introduction
1.       The Bank was involved in lending for agricultural credit in Thailand
since 1980. The first Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1816-TH), signed in
April 1980, aimed to improve BAAC's term lending capability and to strengthen
the weak farmer cooperative system. Under the first project, BAAC made loans
mostly to small farmers in the North and Northeast for shrimp culture, on-farm
development, and giant prawn projects. The first project was completed in
December 1984; a PCR was submirted in January 1986; and the World Bank Opera-
tions Evaluation Department issued a Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 7354) on June 30, 1988. The Second Agricultural Credit Project (Loan
2310-TH, signed in July 1983) was originally designed as an apex operation
with funds passing through the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to a broad range of
financial intermediaries in support of agricultural and nonagricultural lend-
ing. However, Government rejected this approach and requested that the proj-
ect be limited instead to financing a two-year time slice of PAAC's activi-
ties. As such, the project's major objectives were to: (a) improve BAAC's
financial viability and reduce its dependence on subsidies; (b) increase its
incentive to mobilize rural savings; and (c) improve BAAC's role in providing
credit to small farmers who could not qualify for commercial bank loans. IFAD
loan funds were to be used whollv fcc providing credit to small-scale farmers
in the North and Northeast regions.
Project Costs, Financing and Disbursements
2.       The table below compares actual project costs and financing with
appraisal estimates. A small increase in total project costs (from US$160
million to US$165 million) was largely attributable to the November 1984
devaluation of the Baht. BAAC. with its foreign loans denominated iA US dol-
lars (70 million) and SDRs (18.75 million), was able to finance a larger
volume of activities than anticipated at appraisal.

3.       At appraisal, the Bank loan was intended to finance medium- and long-
term subloans throughout the country, with about 17? (B 274 million) targeted
to reach small farmers in the North and Northeast. IFAD funds (B 458 million)
were to be used to finance both short-term (B 184 million) and medium-/long-
term (B 274 million) subloans, but restricted to small farmers in the North
and Northeast. The term lending under both Bank and IFAD loans was expected
to finance mainly draft animals, livestock, land improvements 'and farm equip-



-3-
ment. The short-term lending was to meet the credit needs of small farmers
participating in the BAAC/Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) pilot
project scheme. The overall objective of the pilot scheme was to improve
credit services and technical advice to small farmers by coordinating BAAC and
DAE activities.
4.       In practice, although both loans were fully disbursed, the turgets
set for increased medium- and long-term lending to small farmers in the North
and Northeast were only partially achieved. Because it considered medium- and
long-term loans to small farmers to be of high risk in the absence of adequate
supporting technical services, BAAC was willing to make loans to small farmers
only in those areas where extra services could be provided. Also, BMAC was
committed to using alternative sources of funds for term c.redit from the
Japanese OECF to finance farmers in the North and Northeast. For these rea-
sons, about 652 of the Bank allocation for term lending to small farmers in
the North and Northeast was reallocated to finance term lending nationwide.
Likewise, in the case of IFAD funds, about 622 of the original term lending
allocation was reallocated to finance short-term crop production loans. In
line with Government policy, technical assistance was financed wholly with
cheaper IFAD funds. With timely reallocation of funds among categories, dis-
bursements were ahead of appraisal estimates throughout the project period.
The Closing Date was extended to enable IFAD loan disbursements against con-
sultancy services to continue until July 31, 1986.
Technical Assistance
5.       BAAC benefitted from the services of two research and evaluation
specialists who worked with the Research and Evaluation Division in the
Planning Department (paras. 3.08-3.10 of PCR. Their main contribution was to
assist BAAC to design and implement the BAAC/DAE pilot project, including
follow-up monitoring and evaluation procedures. The performance of the two
consultants was satisfactory.
Institutional Performance
6.       BMC's overall financial performance remained sound during the
project period: its total assets increased to B 29.4 billion as of March 31,
1986 (FY85) and total equity from B 2.5 billion to B 2.7 billion from FY82 to
FY85, after taking into account exchange losses (B 548 million) on foreign
currency denominated loans. At the end of the period, the debt-equity ratio
was 10:1, which is well within BAAC's statutory limit. Loan disbursements
increased from B 11.8 billion in FY82 to B 17.4 billion in FY85, which is in
line with the appraisal projection of B 17.6 billion. With the increase in
direct lending to farmers, especially through BAAC's innovative joint
liability group system, lending to farmers' associations which had a poor
repayment record declined sharply from B 57 billion in FY82 to B 26 billion in
FY85. Deposits from the general public rose from B 3.3 billion at March 31,
1983 to B 5.5 billion at March 31, 1986.
7.       The total income rose from B 2.7 billion in FY82 to B 3.5 billion in
FY85 due to an increased volume of lending and a lending rate of 14?,
maintained in conformity with the Loan Agreement ratchet principle covenant,
under which BAAC's lending rate was fixed in relation to its deposit rates

1 to less than 2 year
Time Deposit Rate (D)                        Lending Rate (L)
(i)  when D is less than 72                       L = D + 5Z
(ii)  when D is between 7 and 10                  L = at least 132
(iii)  when D is between 10 and 14?                 L - at 1east 142
(iv)  when D is 14Z or sore                        L - at least D
With less dependence on subsidized funds from Bank of Thailand (BOT) and
increased borrowings from foreign sources, BAAC's interest expenses more than
doubled (B 204 million in FY82 and B 496 million in FY85) during the project
period. Administrative expenses and provisions for bad and doubtful
debts/foreign exchange losses also rose. However, the interest spread derived
from the operation of the ratchet principle was sufficient to cover these
costs and produce a surplus each fiscal year. While there was no significant
increase in the overall repayment rates for loans to individual farmers (which
fluctuated between 71-73Z), repayment performance by farmers financed under
the Bank and IFAD loans was impressive, with rates of 82Z and 85Z
respectively.
Project Impact
8.       The long-term objective of BAkC is to become a financially self-
sustaining institution capable of mobilizing domestic savings to adequately
meet the credit needs of its borrowers. To pursue this objective, BAAC
required a suitable spread between its lending and interest payable on
domestic savings. The ratchet principle included in the loan agreement
financial covenant described in para. 7 was the first positive step taken
towards this in the context of constant political pressure to reduce BAAC's
lending rates. By strictly adhering to the Loan Agreement covenant, BAAC was
able to maintain its lending rate unchanged at 142 throughout the project
period, even when market rates declined. As a result, by August 1985 the
lending rate gap between BAAC and the commercial banks (which stood previously
at 3Z) narrowed to 1-112Z, while the margin between BMC's lending rate and
its deposit rate increased from 1-1/2? to 3?. This encouraged BAAC to make
special efforts to mobilize rural savings. Consequently, deposits from the
general public rose by 67? from B 3.3 billion in FY82 to B 5.5 billion in
FY85.
9.       The project increased the flow of credit to small farmers engaged in
food production in the North and Northeast and also strengthened to some
extent the links between research, extension and credit. The entire IFAD loan
amount (B 470 million), except for the small amount allocated for technical
assistance, was utilized wholly for onlending to small farmers in the North
and Northeast. Only 35Z of the original Bank loan allocated for the ';orth and
Northeast, amounting to B 95 million, was used for medium and long-term
lending to small farmers in those Regions (para. 4). The pilot project
initiated in the North and Northeast with IFAD funds played an important
catalytic role in strengthening the links between research, extension and
short-term credit for small farmers in poverty areas. The PCi points out that
although the cooperation between BMAC and DAE officers at the village level



was often inadequate, the degree of contact did increase and the concept and
procedures of the pilot project have been accepted by BAAC as a basis for an
expanded program to assist small farmers. BAAC's studies have revealed that:
(a) BAMC clients are using increasing quantities and an improved formula of
chemical fertilizers; (b) more clients are using improved seed varieties; and
lc) where irrigation facilities are available, clients are taking term loanr
for land levelling to switch from the transplanting method of planting paddy
to the more cost-effective broadcasting method.
10.      In the staff appraisal report, financial rates of return were
calculated for five selected investment models, which ranged from 16Z to 26z.
The PCR has recalculated rates of return on two major individual activities,
which show 292 for livestock raising and 282 for power tillers. The
recalculated rates of return are estimates and not actuals, based on a survey
which BAAC carried out with some of its client farmers. Of these two types of
investments, the SAR estimated a rate of return for draft animals only. The
survey findings in respect of this type of investment, the extent to which
they varied from appraisal assumptions and the effect of the variations on the
recalculated rate of return are dealt with in detail in paras. 4.20-4.24 of
the PCR. Investments in draft animals/cattle raising and agricultural
machinery account for about 402 of the luan portfolio (PCR Tables 12-15). The
other four SAR models for whic'h BAAC did not recalculate rates of return (pig
breeding/fattening, duck egg production and hen egg production) account for
less than 52 of the loan portfolio.
11.      Finally, in assessing purely the direct financial cost/benefit to
BAAC of the Bank loan per se, the following d&aa (as of November 1987)
concerning the impact of the foreign exchange risk on BAAC are relevant:
(US$ million)
(a)  Loan amount                            -        70.0
(b)  Withdrawals (fully drawn)              -        70.0
(c) Principal outstanding (in current
US dollars                           -       104.6
Id)  Half yearly interest                   -         4.22
(e)  Effective interest (d)  as 2 of (b)   -         12.12
It will be observed from the foregoing that the effective interest on the Bank
loan works out to 12.12, which is less than BAAC's lending rate. Since the
project was co-financed with soft loan funds from IFAD, the effective rate on
the total borrowing for the project would be lower than 12.1Z. As regards the
principal, the contingent liability arising from the weakening of the US
dollar is currently estimated at US$34.6 million, although the extent to which
this will become an actual liability will depend on how the US dollar fares
against other major currencies, especially the yen, Deutsche mark and the
Swiss franc, over the period through 1997.



-6-
Bank Performance
12.      As under the first Agricultural Credit Project, the Bank enjoyed a
good relationship and maintained a frank dialogue with the Government and
BAAC. Furthermore, the Loan Agreement interest covenant (para. 10) and Bank
presence helped BAAC to withstand political pressures to reduce lending rates
and expand credit facilities to cooperatives with poor repayment reco.ds.
Performance of the Borrower
13.      BAAC demonstrated once again that it was capable of adjusting its
lending program as necessary to meet changing conditions while still pursuing
basic project objectives. The timely reallocation of loan funds in response
to market demand for credit resulted in the disbursement of both Bank and IFAD
loans as originally scheduled. The pilot project in the North and Northeast
to strengthen research, extension and credit linkages and technical packages,
carried out jointly with DAE, was implemented successfullly and produced
satisfactory results with important implications for future BAAC operations.
Lessons Learned
14.      In trying to reach new high risk borrowers, it is essential that a
credit institution first design and implement a pilot project. The pilot
project initiated under the IFAD loan for making short-term loans to small
farmers in the North and Northeast was successful and enabled BAAC to assess
the replicability of the concept and procedures before undertaking the
subsequent EEC-funded BAACIDAE Poor Farmers' Recruitment Program.
15.      The foreign exchange risk on foreign borrowings can be a serious
burden on an institution like BMC, which is not allowed to charge commercial
rates for its lending operations. Either such an institution should be free
to set its own interest rate formula, or the foreign exchange risk should be
born by the Government as an explicit subsidy. In this regard, BAAC
considers that it is incurring heavy foreign exchange losses because of this
project (para. 11) and that is the main reason that, despite a very
satisfactory working relationship. BMC has thus far been unwilling to
consider further borrowing from the World Bank.

1. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
1.01     The   Ministry of Finance  on  behalf of the  Royal Thai
Government sought financial assistance from the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) amounting   to  19
million  US$ under the loan agreement 1816-TH , dated April  30,
1980.   The  said  amount  was allocated  to  varic-s  government
agencies, namely the Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD),
Office   of Agriculture  Economics  (OAE),  Cooperative  Auditing
Department   (CAD),   and    the   Bank   for   Agriculture   and
Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC).  The  major   portion  of loan,
about 16.01 million USS, was allocated to BAAC for lending to
Client farmers with the objective of raising their income and
standard of living.. BAAC channeled loans to inidividual farmers
in the North and Northeast with  its normal  lending   terms  and
special projects such as shrimp culture, on-farm development and
giant prawn project. The first IBRD loan was successful as shown
in the Project Completion'Report of IBRD 1816-TH .
1.02     In  order  to  expand BAAC's  financial   resources  for
farmers in poverty areas as stated in the Appraisal Report, the
Royal  Thai Government requested finance from two major   sources
as a co-financiers for the Second Agricultural Credit Project :
the IBRD, amounting to US. 70 million or about 1,613 million
Baht under loan agreement IBRD 2310-TH, dated July 14, 1983;



-10-
and   the International  Fund for Agricultural  Development(IFAD)
amounting  to  SDR  18.75 million  or about  458   million  Baht,
under   loan  agreement IFAD 125-TH,  dated July 27, 1983.   This
project was to run for two years with the main objective of
enhancing the quality and performance of agricultural production
and upgrading  household   income   of  small-scale   farmers  in
rural   areas nationwide.   In addition,  the loan  package   was
to support the growth of BAAC's lending activities and improve
the functioning of rural financial markets.
1.03     As  stated  in the  Appraisal  Report(March  1983),  the
project was intended to:   improve  BAAC's  financial   viability
so as to lessen its dependence on subsidies; encourage BAAC to
mobilize  rural   savings ;    improve   BAAC's        developmental
role  of  providing   credit   to    needy   farmers  who  cannot
qualify for commercial bank loans ; and  strengthen agricultural
intensification bs linking agricultural research, extension and
credit.

- 11 -
were to be used to finance medium-term and long -term subloans
to  small  farmers  in  the  North  and   Northeast regions   and
other  farmers countrywide,  with mainly investment  in   draught
animals, farm-supplies, farm   buildings  and  land  improvements
for agriculture, excluding the purchase of land or housing,
poppy cultivation and refinancing old debts. Besides, medium-
term subloans were also to  finance   Cooperatives  with  a  good
performance record.  It was indicated that   40%  of   medium and
long   term  subloans   were  to  be  provided  in  the.North and
Northeast, 30%  in  the   Central  region  and  30% in the South.
Average loan size of medium-term and long-term loans were about
S 900  (20,700  Baht)  and $ 1,300  (29,900   Baht)  respectively
(1US$ ^ 23.00 Baht at appraisal). However it was stressed that
not less than 50% of the total loans should be paid to small
farmers.
2.03     The  SDR 18.75 million or US$ 20 million of  IFAD  funds
were to be used to finance subloans to small farmers in the
North and Northeast for the purpose of food production and tree
crop production as a measure   of crop diversification.  The size
of  each  subloan  was to be  not over US$  4,543   or    100,000
Baht. These loans were intended mainly for the production of
rice, maize  and  livestock  in these regions   and also  cassava
in the Northeast.
2.04     Interest  rates  charged for  subloans  made  under  the



- 12 -
project were normal BAAC rates for respective loan categories and
amounts.
Technical assistance
2.05     The IBRD fund was to  finance  short-term  training  and
-advance degree   training  for   selected  staff of BAAC  and  an
expert's services    for    workshop   training    on  monitoring
and  evaluation . IFAD   funds for technical azsistance were  for
studying BAAC's policies and criteria concerning lending to small
farmers.
3.IMPLEMENTATION
Reallocation of Funds
3.01     Several  reallocations  of funds were made in  order  to
maintain the agreed disbursement schedule.
3.02     Most of the IBRD fund were originally used  for  medium-
term and  long-term loans  to  farmers, medium-term and long-term
loans to small farmers in the North and Northeast, equivalent to
67 % and 14 % of   total  amount  respectively . Later  on, some
portion  of the amounts allocated for medium-term  and  long-term
loans  to  small farmers,  deposits in special account  and   the
unallocated component were used to support medium-term and long-
term  loans to farmers nationwide.   In connection with the  Thai
Cabinet's approval on 24th May, 1983, the training component of



- 13 -
USS 0.20 million(4.60 million Baht) was completely transferred to
medium-term  and long-term loans to general farmers.   The reason
for   this  transfer  was  that  BAAC's  in-house  training   was
proceeding satisfactorily and the cost of funds under this loan
were rather high, thus it was considered preferable to use these
amounts for on-lending to farmers.   Consequently,  the amount of
medium-term   and long-term  loans  to general farmers  accounted
for  USS  61.35 million or 88% of t?e total  fund.   The  revised
allocation of IBRD fund is shown in Tablc 2.
3. 03    Initially the IFAD fund was mainly intended for  medium-
term and long-term loans amounting to SDR 7.43 million and short-
term    loan  for  SDR  10.67  million   or  40  and  57  percent
respectively. This was because BAAC was committed to using
other sources of borrowed funds to finance 'armers in the same
poverty areas. Subsequently, the amounts for medium-term and
long-term loans were transferred to short-term loans and SDR
0.59 million (1.269 million Baht) of the technical assistance
component was used for short-term loans.   Therefore,  the short-
term loan component amounted to SDR 14.46 mllion or 77% of the
total while the medium-term and long-term loans made up only 22
percent.    The      final  allocation  of  IFAD  125-TH  loan  by
categories is shown in Table 3.

Project Financing
3.04      The financing plan included IBRD and IFAD loans  of US$
70 million  and  SDR  18.75   million,  respectively.    together
with   BAAC's  own  fund,   for  disbursement   over   the    two
implementation years.
3.05      The  project  utilized  USS  70   million    (1,714.851
million Baht) from  the  IBRD together with    BAAC's  own  funds
of US$ 57.28  million (1,408.86 million Baht),  a  total of   USS
127.28  million or 3,123.71 million Baht.   The IBRD financing is
shown in Table 4.
3.06      IFAD's. contribution  of SDR 18.75  million  or  473.23
million Baht wias added to BAAC's contribution of SDR 13.167
million or 332 million Baht for a total of SDR 31.918 million
or 805.238 million Baht. The IFAD financing is shown in Table 5.
3.07     The proJect  financing  as  summarised here  refers only
to  funds  provided  by  IBRD, IFAD,  and BAAC.   The farmers'own
contribution  are  excluded  because  this  information  is   not
available.
Technical Assistance
____________________
3.08     Two  research and evaluation specialists were hired  for
a total of 49 man-months to provide technical assistance in
relation to the IBRD and IFAD components of the project, and in



- 15 -
relation   to  some  of  BAAC's  other  needs  for  institutional
development.   As  agreed with the IBRD and IFAD the  specialists
worked in the Planning Department, mainly with the Research and
Evaluation Division.
3.09     An  important component of the consultants' work was  to
help implement and oversee the BAAC/DAE "pilot project", a
project which BAi:  regarded as an important component of its plan
to  increase  lending to small-scale  farmers.   The  consultants
assisted  in the initial design of the project,  the training  of
the BAAC and DAE officers involved, the design and implementation
of  monitoring  procedures and the   design,  implementation  and
reporting  of the follow-up evaluation study.   The report of the
evaluation study has been sent to both the IBRD and IFAD.
3.10      Other  work  carried  out by  the  consultants  can  be
summarised as followed:
Studies
3.10.1 The consultants assisted the Research Division in
conducting a number of studies, the most important of which
concerned:
(i)  access  to  BAAC  credit  services  among   small-scale
farmers;
(ii) the performance of small-scale farmers who have become
BAAC clients; and



- 16 -
(iii) rural savings mobilization.
Copies of the reports. on these studies have been sent to
IFAD and IBRD.
Training
3.10.2 The consultants provided on-the-job training and
formal courses on a number of topics for the benefit of the staff
of the Planning Department. The topics covered in the formal
courses were:
(i) research methods and basic statistical analysis;
(ii) an introduction to the use of the SPSS statistical
analysis package; and
(iii)    an    introduction   to   the   use    of    micro-
computers,     including   word-processing,       spreadsheet   and
relational-database packages; and
(iv) linear programming applications for BAAC.
Other activities
3.10.3 The consultants also assisted BAAC in:
(i) designing a part of the new management information
system which will allows the bank to monitor the characteristics
of its clients and the developmental effects of its loans;
(ii) the preparation of loan proposals, seminar papers and
reports. including  the  Px Ject Compl-tion Report for the  first



- 17 -
IBRD loan to the bank and the bank's corporate plan;
(iii) liaising with farm-credit institutions in other Asian
and Pacific countries through the Asia and Pacific Regional
Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA) ; and
(iv) up-grading and reorganising the Research and Evaluaion
Division to be more in accordance with the bank's needs.
Accounts and Audit
____ _____________
3.11    In accordance with Loan Agreement 2310-TH t BAAC did not
maintain  seperate  project  accounts   concerning  IBRD   funds.
However the banking accounts and financial statement were audited
annually by the Office of the  Auditor  General  of   Thailand in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Certified
copies of the auditors' reports including a separate opinion by
the   said auditor  were submittti  to  IBRD  annually.
Disbursements
3.12      At  appraisal  the intention was that the IERD and IFAD
loans would be disbursed over two and a half years. In practice,
the  TBRD  fund was  completely disbursed    within   the  period
during   April 1, 1983 - October 31, 1985, and  the   IFAD   fund
during November 1983 - July 1986.
3.13      In   the  IBRD loan agreement   it was said  that   the
subloans   disbursed   during  April 1-July 13,  1983  could   be



- 18 -
retroactively   reimbursed  from the IBRD fund.  Therefore    the
amount   of   161.11 million Baht or USS 6.99 million  equivalent
were disbursed.  Subloans  were  made   to   farmers for 3,119.68
million Baht which could be classified into medium-term loans
amounting  to   1,284.55  million Baht and  long-term  loans  for
1,835.13  million  Baht.   The  BAAC  loan   for   IBRD   finance
classified by term-loans, by years is given in Table 6.
..4 Subloans were made to f -mers under IFAD finance totaling
801.88   million   Baht  which   could   be  classified  into   3
categories: short-term loans for 614.33 million Baht, medium-term
loans for 79.15 million Baht and long-term loans for 108.40
million Baht. Details of loans disbursed under IFAD financing
are shown in Table 7.
3.15     During the implementation period BAAC provided  subloans
to   farmers  as  quickly  as  possible  in  order  to   minimize
commitment  charged  on  the  IBRD loan.   The total   IERD  loan
was disbursed ahead of the planned schedule while the IFAD loan
was    finished    in    July 1986  as  planned  .  The  lending
component of IFAD funds was totally disbursed  by December   1985
and the technical assistance finished in July 1986.
Withdrawal
3.16     At  appraisa'l it was stipulated that the  reimbursements



- 19 -
from IFAD funds would be 75% of short-term subloans disbuised
under the project and 55% of medium-term aad long-term loans to
small farmers in  the North and Northeast.   Reimbursements  from
IBRD funds would be 55 percent of the value of medium and long-
term  subloans for farmers outside the IFAD target groups.   Once
IFAD funds were exhausted, reimbursements could be made from IBRD
funds for subloans to small-scale farmers in the North and
Northeast regions, also at the rate of 55 % of the value of the
subloans.
3.17     Reimbursements  from  IBRD  funds  amounted  to 24 %  of
the total in Fy 1983, 50 % in Fy 1984 and 26 % in Fy 1985, with
reimbursement completed by March 31, 1986 as scheduled.   Table 8
shows the amounts withdrawn from the IBRD fund.
3.18     While  the IBRD  contribution was reimbursed on  time
the closing date for IFAD reimbursements was extended to July 31,
1986 from the original closing date of March 31, 1986. However,
the on-lending component was almost completely withdrawn by
December  31,  1985  ahead  of  schedule,  while   the  technical
assistance component  was  completely   withdrawn   by  September
198G, following the terms of the contract between BAAC and the
consultants hired under this project. BAAC could withdraw 100%
of the total cost incurred on this component. In addition, the
reimbursed amount of IFAD-financed short-term loans was reduced
from  75%  to  50 %  of the  value  of the subloans.   Table    9



-20-
summarises the withdrawals of the IFAD financed loan.
Subloan Beneficiaries
---------------------
3.19     At the  completion  of  loan   disbursements  the  total
amount of IBRD finance was 3,119.68 million Baht including
1,284.55  million   Baht  for  medium-term   loans  and  1,835.14
million   Babt  for long-term loans to 95,003 and 101,483  farmer
beneficiaries  respectively.   The  average  sizes of medium-term
and   long-term   subloans   were       13,443  and  15,098   Baht,
compared   to  S900  (20,700   Baht)  and  S1.300 129,900   Baht)
respectively expected at appraisal(the exchange rate at appraisal
wgas 1USS _ 23.00 Baht).
3.20     Out of the total of 3,119.68  million  Baht  only 747.30
million Baht or 25 percent was allocated to 73,361 small farmers,
with  an average loan size of 8,413 Baht.   This amount was  less
than  anticipated at  appraisal.   The  subloans  distributed  in
the  Northeast  region   amounted to  287.28 million  Baht  or  9
percent of the total fund,  but 51 percent  of this   amount  was
given  to  small farmers.   Subloans in the East totalled  552.73
million Baht, but of this only 49.19 'illion Baht could be
channelled to small farmers. This is because most farmers in the
East are large scale farmers while those in the Northeast are
mostly   small farmers.   Branch Managers considered it  was  too
risky to make medium and long-term loans for poor farmers in the



- 21 -
Northeast.
3.21    Under IFAD-finance a total of 801.88 million Baht was on-
lent to small farmers as normal BAAC lending throughout the North
and  Northeast.   Of this amount 614.33 million Baht was used for
short term subloans with an average loan size of 7,709   Baht.  A
further 187.56 million Baht was used for medium-term and long-
term  loans  with  an  average loan  size  of  12,892  Baht.   As
mentioned earlier, short-term subloans accounted for 76 percent'
of the total disbursed under IFAD financing.
3.22     A  tot&l of 217,094 and 94,237 farmer  clients  received
subloans  from  IBRD -and  IFAD,  respectively,   although  these
figures include some double counting as they include "repeater"
loans. Subloans disbursed to farmers under IBRD and IFAD finance
classified by regions and by loan duration are shown in Table 10
and Table 11.
3.23     Table  12 shows medium-term subloans supported  by  IBRD
funds,  classified by product and region.   Subloans in the South
accounted for 41 percent of the total, with about 15 percent for
each of the Central, Northern and Eastern regions. 26 percent of
the  subloans went to small farmers.   Forty-one  percent of  the
total amount  was used for rice production. followed  by  draught
animals  (19X)  par& rubber (12%),  tree crops (6%)  and    other
categories which accounted for less than 5 percent each. For
subloans   to  general  farmers land improvements represented 30%



-22-
of the total investment, followed by breeding stock(22%), draught
animals  (21%) and farm buildings (11%).   For subloans to  small
farmers investments in breeding stock accounted for 29 percent
of the total investment, followed by draught animals (27%), land
improvement (22%) and farm   buildings  (10%).  Medium-term loans
classified by purpose using IBRD fund are detailed in Table 13.
3.24    Long-term loans classified by product and by region using
IBRD  funds are shown in Table 14.   The  long-tew.m  loans  using
rBRD funds amounted to 1,835.14 million Baht of which 22 percent
was allocated  to small farmers.  The loans were distributed   to
farmers mainly in the South,. East and West each with about 20%
of the total amount, with the North, Central and Northeast
accounting   for 15,14 and 9 percent,  respectively.   In  almost
every   region the loans  were mostly invested in rice production
and   draught animals  purchasing,  except  in  the  East   where
cassava production was the main use.
3.25     Table 15 indicates long-term loan investment for various
purposes  under  IBRD 2310-TH.   Land improvement  was  the  most
important single use accounting for 32 % of the total. Subloans
for breeding stock (17%) and machinery for land preparation
accounting  for   15%   were also important. Among  small farmers
subloans for breeding stock were the most important category,
followed by land improvement and machinery for land preparation
purposes.



                               - 23-
3.26     Table 16 summarises  medium-term  and  long-term   loans
classified  by purpose  and by region using  IFAD  funds.   About
37% of all loans were disbursed for draught animal purchasing
and  22%  were for breeding stocks.   Other  categories of  loans
were machinery for land preparation (17%) and land improvement
(10%). Approximately 60% of total loans were disbursed in
.the North where draught animal purchasing accounted for 34%   and
and machinery for land preparation 23 percent. Similarly, in
the Northeast the disbursed amount for draught animals and
breeding stocks were 43 and 29 percent, respectively.
3.27     Table 17 gives the allocation of medium-term and   long-
term loans by product.   It shows that 63% of the medium-term and
long-term loans were used to promote rice production and 21% were
for  purchasing draught animals.   Subloans for various  products
such as maize, tobacco, tree crops and pig breeding were
disbursed  in  relatively small amounts.   Rice  production   and
draught animals were the most important products of IFAD subloans
in both the North and Northeast.
3.28     Table 18  summarises   the  distribution  of  short-term
loans   by   product.  The  largest  portion  of the loans   were
utilized for rice production (43%), maize (24%), cassava (12%)
and  draught animals (6%).   Rice was the largest single category
in  both  regions  with  54 and 29 percent  in   the  North   and
Northeast, respectively, while maize and cassava accounted for



- 24 -
26 and 28 percent in the respective regions.
Subloans Repayment Performance
3.29     The principal amount of 691.58 million  Baht (53.84 % of
total medium-term loans disbursed) and 549.41 million Baht
(29.94%  of total long-term  loans  disbursed)   matured in  1985
since   the  IBRD-financed  fund  had  been  utilised  in   1983.
Principal repayment was impressive with the rate of 82.44 and
81.58 percent for medium-term and long-term lcans respectively,
which was greater than the average repayment of 57.65  and  64.52
percent of general lending of BAAC on these types of loans during
the same period.   Subloan borrowers in the Central Region repaid
their long-term loans at the highest rate and those in the South
at the lowest rate whereas subloan borrowers in the Northeast
repaid at the lowest  rate  for medium-term  loans.   The   small
farmers   could  repaid  the term-loans  at  the  rate  of  81.75
percent, almost at the same level with other subloan borrowers.
However, the rate of repayment varied among the regions. The
small farmers in the North repaid the loans at 91.54 percent
compared to 63.50 percent in the South.   Table 19 elaborates the
repayment performance of IBRD finance.
3.30     Subloan   repayment  performance  of  the small  farmers
was remarkably good at 85.28 percent of the matured amount.
Ninety percent  of repayment could be attained in the   Northeast



- 25 -
in which repayment for short-term loans was recorded at 92.27
percent.   In the North   the rate of overall repayment was 81.43
percent, 84.46 percent for short-term loan and 61.27 percent for
the term-loans.   The small farmers in the Northeast repaid their
loans at a higher rate than those in the North and well above-the
76.24   percent for short-term loan repayments of normal  clients
of  BAAC.  Repayment performance for IFAD-financed   subloans  is
shown in Table 20.
4. Benefits and Justifications
4.01       Paddy  and  maize  were  the  two  principal  products
supported by the short-term loans provided under the IFAD
component of the Project.   These two products together accounted
for 68 percent of all short-term loans supported by IFAD funds,
68 percent of IFAD medium and long-term loans and 37 percent of
all loans supported by IBRD funds.
4.02       Identifying and measuring the effects of  BAAC  short-
term loans is difficult because of the problem of fungibility of
funds within the household economy of the small farmer and
because changes in farming technology are occurring continually
in Thailand for a variety of reasons related to pressures on land
resources, the relative prices of farm inputs and outputs and the
effectiveness of extension advice as well as the availability of
BAAC credit.    Some of these problems are illustrated in  BAAC's



- 26 -
evaluation of ..e BAAC/DAE Pilot Project which was funded as part
of the IFAD component of this project (see paragraphs 5.16-5.21)
4.03      Nevertheless BAAC's studies have revealed the following
key points concerning paddy production:
- BAAC clients are using increasing quantities and more
suitable formulae of chemical fertilizers.   Farm surveys
show that in some areas in the Northeastern region the
increase in the amount of fertilizer used for paddy was
46 percent during 1983-1985.
- more BAAC clients are using improved varieties of
seeds.    In  the  Upper  Northeast,   one  of  the  most
technologically  backward  parts  of  the  country,   the
proportion  of clients'paddy land   planted  to  improved
varieties increased from about 41 percent in 1983-1984
to 52 percent in 1985-1986.
- where irrigation facilities are available clients are
taking  medium and long-term loans to level their  fields
so  as  to  use the  pre-germinated   seeds  broadcasting
method  of  planting their paddy.    With this method the
labour  required  for planting is about 50  percent  less
than in the case of transplanted paddy,   enabling client
farmers to save substantial amounts in wage payments.
- the   returns  from  using  chemical  fertilizers   are.
substantial.    The  average increase in yield  for  each



- 27 -
kilogram of fertilizer used by a sample of 600 client
farmers  was 6.14 kgs of paddy.    At current prices this
gives a return of 2.79 Baht for each 1 Baht spent on
fertilizers.
4.04      Two  separate surveys were carried out to  measure  the
impact  of  the  Project.    One survey was  conducted  in  maize
growing area of Loei province to-measure the impact of the IFAD
component and a second survey was conducted in Udorn Thani
province to measure the impact of the IBRD component.
SURVEY TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THE IFAD COMPONENT, LOEI PROVINCE
4.05      The  survey  was  conducted in September  1986  in  the
village of Ban Pak Mak,  Muang District.    The village is 30 kms
from Loei city.   There is no commercial bank nearby and BAAC was
the first financial institution to provide services there,
prompted by the IFAD funds.
4.06      Maize  production  is  the  main  commercial  activity,
supplemented  by soybeans.    Some households produce  paddy  but
only for their own consumption and paddy sales are negligible.
4.07.     A total of 54 farmers were interviewed for this survey,
including 28 who had received IFAD loans and a further 26 to
serve as a control group.    The farmers were selected by  random
sampling   methods and interviewed with a standard questionnaire.



-28-
4.08       Table 21 and 22 summarise the basic characteristics of
the two groups of farmers.    Those who received IFAD  loans were
generally  older than the control group,   had greater  household
labour resources and operated larger farms.   The two groups grew
the same range of crops although more of the control group
produced paddy while the IFAD group was more oriented towards
commercial crops, particularly maize and soybeans.
4.09      The  loans provided under the Project were intended  to
raise farmers'incomes by improving the level of technology used
for maize production and by reducing dependence on high-interest
loans  from  the  informal  credit  market.    These  loans  were
provided for the first time in the 1984-1985 cropping year;
consequently a comparison of farming activities in 1983-1984 with
1984-1985 will show any changes which were made which could be
considered as effects of the loans.    Table 23 shows the changes
which occured for the IFAD farmers.
4.10     Total production increased by 25.7 percent.  from 6.6 to
8.3 tons per farmer.      However most of this increase was due to
an  extension  of the area planted to maize,   from 24.6 to  29.3
rai,  an increase of 19.1 percent.   The area harvested increased
by  23.3  percent,   indicating that pre-harvested losses due  to
natural hazards were less in 1984-1985 than in  1983-1984.    The
yield per rai increased irom 279.9 to 286.2 kgs or 2.25 percent.
4.11      The  increased yield per rai may be attributed  to  the



-29-
increase in the number of farmers using improved seed varieties
from 9 to 15, and in the number using chemical fertilizer from 1
to  5.    Both  these changes may be regarded as effects  of  the
loans which these farmers received from BAAC, and particularly of
the- BAAC's credit-in-kind programme under which both approved
seeds and chemical fertilizers are provided directly to the
farmers by the bank.
4.12      Nevertheless  the  level of technology  used  by  these
farmers remains low.   There are two principal reasens for this:
- the continued availability of land for expanding the
farmed area means that there has been little pressure
on the farmers to adopt new methods in order to increase
production; and
- the soils in this area are naturally fertile so the
farmers see little need to invest in chemical fertilizers.
It may be added that the level of technology used for upland
c.rops in the Northeastern Region is generally very low.
*4.13     Table 24 compares incomes and expenditures for the  IFAD
farmers and the control group before and after the first year of
the project.    Among the IFAD farmers the total household income
net of production costs increased by 39.5 percent compared to an
increase  of 32.5 percent among the control group  farmers.    In
both cases most of the increase accrued from higher non-farm



-30-
earnings and incomes from farming increased only marginally.
Non-farm income increased from 12 to 35 percent of total
household  income  among the IFAD farmers,   and  from 27  to  42
percent among the control group.
4.14      Table 25 shows the distribution of the IFAD farmers  by
income category.   71.5 percent of them remained below the 10,000
Baht limit of eligibility for the IFAD loans; the remaining 28.5
percent had increased their incomes above this limit, in two
cases to over 50,000 Baht.
4.15      Table  26  shows patterns of borrowing   for   the  two
groups of farmers before the Project and in 1984-85.   Before the
Project no farmer in either group was able to borrow from
institutional  sources;   11  of the IFAD farmers and 16  of  the
control  group  borrowed  informally.        Amounts  borrowed  were
generally very small, commonly as little as 100 Baht and with a
maximum  of  6,000 Baht.    These loans were generally  used  for
consumption purposes though in some cases they were used to hire
farm  labourers.    Most  of  the loans were  from  relatives  or
neighbours and were nominally free of interest though in some
cases the borrowers had to provide services or goods as payment
in kind for their loans.   Where money was borrowed from a money-
lender the standard interest rate was 6 percent per month or 72
percent on an annual basis.
4.16      These  figures  indicate  that  the  principal  problem
regarding farm credit before the Project was the amount of credit



- 31 -
available  ;  in general the villagers were not deeply  indebted
and only a small number of them were paying the very high
interest rates typical of the informal market.
4.17     The main benefit of the IFAD Project in this village was
greatly  to  increase  the am6unts of credit  available  for  the
participating  farmers,    and  almost to eliminate the  need  to
borrow  informally.    In 1984-1985 only one of the IFAD  farmers
still borrowed from a source other than the BAAC.   Their average
loan  size for the IFAD farmers was 10,680 Baht.    Meanwhile  11
control group farmers continued to borrow informally.
IMPACT OF THE IBERD COMPONENT: LIVESTOCK RAISING IN UDORN THANI
--------------------------------------------------------------
4.18      A survey was carried out with 29 BAAC clients  who  had
borrowed medium and long-term loans based on IBRD funds in 1983-
1984.    The  loans  were used for raising cattle for  draft  and
breeding purposes as a supplement to their main paddy production
activities.
4.19     The principal characteristics of the sampled farmers are
summarised  as mean valued in Table 27.    Generally the  farming
operations covered in the survey are ots a scale somewhat above
the average for the Northeastern Region,    with both their  farm
sizes and farm incomes approximately twice the regional mean.
4.20      BAAC's  survey  of  clients who took  loans  for  draft
animals shows that their operations vary in some respects from



- 32 -
the assumptions in the Appraisal Report. Table 28 summarises the
main variations.
4.21      The calving rate was about 50 percent,   as was assumed
in the Appraisal Report.   Both the buying and selling prices  of
the animals were generally lower than those assumed at Appraimal.
Typically farmers bought adult animals at price ranging from
5,000 to 10,000 Baht each,   averagirng 7,000 Baht.   Calves  were
sold at about 4,000 Baht per head, starting in the first year of
the investment in cases where the purchased animal was already
pregnant  or,    more  commonly,   in  the  second  year.    Cash
operating costs were minimal, primarily for the purchase of rope
for  tethering the animals.    The animals consumed hay from  the
previous  paddy  harvest  and grazed freely  as  is  the   normal
practice,  at  no cash cost.   Farmers typically derived  350-400
Baht per animal per year from rentals for draft purposes,
starting in the first year of the investment.
4.22      Two  additional variations from the Appraisal  report's
assumptions were:
- They tend to buy and sell animals each year is. a
somewhat unpredictable way,   more in relation   to their
immediate financial needs than to a plan to maximise
profits. In some cases no animals had been sold from the
investment in 1983 to the survey late in 1986 while in
other cases the entire breeding stock and calves were



- 33 
sold off within two years.
- Livestock  farmers  commonly  raise,    use  and   sell
stock for both breeding and draft purposes, making these
two   kinds  of  operations  very  difficult  to  analyse
separately.
4.23      The cash-flow shown in Table 29 follows the  format  of
the  Appraisal  Report  to allow for a  direct  comparison.   The
investment is for 2 adult animals 3-5 years old and the cash flow
pattern can be regarded as typical for this area.
4.24     This cash flow analysis indicates that livestock raising
is a viable economic activity in this part of the Northeastern
Region.   With  an  initial  investment of 14,000  Baht  the  net
present  value of the project is 12,876 Baht,   the  benefit-cost
ratio is 1.4 and the financial internal rate of return is 29.44%.
This FIRR can be compared to 23% estimated at Appraisal.
MACHINERY FOR LAND PREPARATION
______________________________
4.25      A  large number of loans under both the IFAD  and  IBRD
components of the loan were used for purchasing machinery for
land  preparation.   Two-wheeled  tractors  also known  as  power
tillers accounted for most of the loans within this category.
4.26     According to BAAC's analyses of loans for power  tillers
the principal advantage of these machines is that they enable



- 34 -
farmers to prepare their land more quickly than they could by
using  their  buffalo.    As a result the farmers can extend  the
total area which they plant.    Power tillers have no significant
effect on yield per rai.
4.27     Table 30 shows a financial analysis of the use of  power
tiller based on a sample of 100 farmers in Khon Kaen province,
Northeastern Thailand.   Typically the biggest change  associated
with the use of the power tillers was an extension of the upland
area  farmed.   The farmers also derived income from renting  out
their machines to their neighbours.
4.28      BAAC's  financial  analysis  indicates  that  with   an
investment of about 28,000 Baht in a power tiller the net present
value of the investment is 15,400 Baht, benefit:cost ratio 3.11
and financial internal rate of return 27.57 percent.
5. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Position
5.01    BAAC was created in 1966 to continue and extend the  work
of   the    Bank for Agricultural Cooperatives.  During  its   19
years of operations BAAC has provided credit services to both
individual farmers and farmers'institutions.  BAAC provides about
31 percent of  the  institutional   credit  for   agriculture  in
Thailand while the commercial banks provide 69 percent.



- 35 -
5.02     By  the  end of the fiscal year 1985 BAAC   had  created
68 Branch Offices and 580 Field Offices nationwide. A total
of 17,350  million  Baht   was  disbursed in loans to 2.4 million
farm families, 42 percent of the total of 5.3 million farm
families.
5.03      Table  31  shows  Statistical  Highlights   of   BAAC's
Operations for 1981-1985.   The  2.4 million farm families served
by BAAC include 1,381,851 individual farmers, 788,665 members of
agricultural      cooperatives    and   132,208       members      of
farmers' groups.   Amounts lent to these three groups were 14,143
million Baht (82%), 3,181 million Baht (18%) and 26 million Baht
(0.1%) respectively. The loans given to farmers'groups decreased
at an annual rate of 23  %   during the past five years owing  to
their inability to correct their internal management problems
and their inability to comply with BAAC's regulations.
5.04     The source of  BAAC's  working capital relies heavily on
the  compulsory  deposits  from   the   commercial   banks    and
promissory  notes rediscounted  with the Bank of Thailand   which
provided   36  percent  and  12  percent of total operating funds
during   fiscal year 1985.   However the combined contribution of
these  two sources  declined  by  10  percentage  points   during
1981-1985.   Borrowings  from the external and internal   sources
provided steadily increasing proportions of the operatirg fund,
reaching 22 percent in 1985.



- 36 -
5.05      In 1985,  the  BAAC's  own  capital fund increased  by
326  million Baht or 14 percent compared to that of the previous
year.  This  was  mainly  because BAAC received a grant  of  182
million Baht from the European Economic Community (EEC) for
the cassava  replacement  project.   However   the  contribution
of BAAC's own capital to the operating fund decreased each year
from 1981 to 1985 relative to other sources. Deposits from the
general public increased at the rate of 16 to 19 percent during
1981-1985. BAAC has continued to mobilize savings from the
general public in rural areas, particularly through the newly
created "savings certificates " valued at 500 Baht which are
available for purchase and redemption at the field office level.
This initiative  was popular among client farmers in rural areas
and    the   amounts  received   were    satisfactory.   Details
of BAAC's savings mobilization   and  " savings   certificate  "
are  given  below.   Table  32  elaborates  BAAC's  sources   of
operating funds.
5.06     Table 33 summarises  BAAC's  repayment   performance and
shows that there was no significant difference in short-term
loan repayment  rates   for individual farmers during  1981-1985,
which was about 76-78 X.   Repayment rates for medium-term  loans
decreased   from  61 to 57 percent and long-term loans fluctuated
between 61-66 percent.
5.07      BAAC requires the farmer inntitutions to   repay  loans
w



- 37 -
to  BAAC  at a rate not less than 80% of total amount repaid   to
the institutions by their members. This rate has been surpassed
each   year  since 1982.   However  farmer-members  repaid  their
respective agricultural institutions at very low rates, compared
to individual  farmers' repayments  to BAAC.   The  repayment  of
members to agricultural cooperatives was at the rate of 44 %
while  short-term   loan  repayment  of  individual  farmers   to
BAAC was 76 percent. Members of farmer associations could repay
to the institution at the rate of 52 percent in 1985, the
hiihest rate since 1981.
5.08     The  BAAC's income  statements  and   balance  sheet for
the   financial years 1981/1982 to 1985/1986 are shown in  Tables
34 and 35. It can be seen that the bank's total equity increased
at  an  annual  rate of 4 % from 2,314 million  Baht   to   2,657
million  Baht.   Liabilities increased at 11 % per year to 26,702
million   Baht  compared  to 17,868 million  Baht  in  1981/1982.
Total  assets  increased at 10 % per year from   20,182   million
Baht to 29,359 million Baht.
Interest Spread and Profitability
---------------------------------
5.09     Interest  earned on loans increaaed at an average annual
growth   rate  of  3.15 since 1981,   but it  increased only 1.05
between  1984  and  1985.   The  slower pace  of  growth  on  the
relationships   between  interest earned on loans and total loans

contributing to a lower overall earning performance with negative

funds compensated somewhat for losses of earnings and halted the
decline  in   the  spread  which had occured for  each of the two
previous  years.    In  1985 operating costs increased by 1.01  %
over 1984 and the net profit therefore decreased by 7.35 percent
on the year.
5.10     BAAC's profitability  largely depends on costs of  funds
and operating costs of which the former is beyond BAAC's direct
control.   In  order  to  maintain  its financial  viability BAAC
considers its operating costs to be the main controllable factor
and is taking all possible steps to minimize them.
Savings Mobilization
5.11     Since BAAC was formed in 1966   it has concentrated  its
attention mainly  on   lending   activities  and  has  given less
importance to its operating fund. The largest portion of BAAC's
operating  fund   came   from   promissory  notes  of   the  Bank
of Thailand, compulsory   deposits  from  commercial   banks  and
external  borrowings.   In recent years,  there have been limita-
tions on these sources: the commercial banks became more likely
to expand their agricultural credit directly rather than by
depositing funds with BAAC; foreign borrowing is rather more
expensive      and  involves  restrictions imposed  on  on-lending



- 40 -
terms : and domestic sources have  diminished.  Thus  there is a"
need to mobilise savings on a large scale as an alternative
source of funds.
5.12     In  1982  in order to maintain  the  country's  economic
strength   the government initiated a  policy designed to   limit
or reduce external borrowings and mobilize domestic savings to a
level equal to at least 29 percent of the gross domestic product.
Similarly since 1985 BAAC has taken very positive steps to raise
a higher proportion of its operating funds through deposits from
the general public.   Savings mobilisation has become an integral
part of the Branch Offices' activities.   Many schemes  have been
introduced to  encourage    savings activity   including a    new
form  of   "savings certificate" launched  by the credit officers
at the field office levels, and a deposit mobilisation campaign,
supported  by   a  vigorous  publicity   programme  and  improved
customer services.
5.13    Since the policy came into force the volume of savings at
BAAC branch offices have increased at an average growth rate of
26.39  %  annually  including an   increase   from   1,503.78  to
4,034.75  million  Baht  in 1985.   Cross-tabulating  figures  hv
regions  indicates that each region exceeded its average   annual
growth rate  target.  The highest growth rate was in   the   East
while the lowest  was  in  the  Central Region.  The    Northeast
was most successful in terms of volume of savings even though it



- 41 -
is the poorest region in the country.   Table 36 described BAAC's
savings performance.
5.14      In the past,  field offices at the district level  were
not authorised to handle cash, which meant that the farmer
clients had to travel to the provincial branch offices for
cash  transactions including  deposit   and  withdrawal from BAAC
savings  accounts.   Because   of   this   weakness,   "Savings
Certificates"  were  launchei in 1985 as  a new  procedure   to
mobilise savings of the rural people especially BAAC client
farmers. The vital part of the scheme is that saving certificates
worth 500 Baht each, redeemable by the purchaser on demand,
are being sold'by the field offices making this the first time
that cash transaction have been possible at this level.   As  the
programme is still at an early stage, it is limited to the field
offices in the districts where branch offices of the Government
Saving Bank or the commercial banks can be used for overnight
storage of cash.
5.15     At the end of fiscal year 1985   337 field offices  were
engaged in the scheme in which 139.24 million Baht worth of
savings certificates have been distributed so far.   This  amount
of   savings  represented  3.45  percent  of  all  rural  savings
mobilised by BAAC's branches.

The  percentage  of saving    through  the  "savings certificate"
scheme varied among the regions. The North and the East achieved
higher percentage than the others while the lowest percentage was
in  the Central Region.   Remarkably,  in the regions  which  are
classified as poverty areas like the North, the Northeast and
the   South, the  "savings  certificate"  became  popular   among
the  rural poor.   The scheme  has  shown  that  a cordvenient and
simple system is effective in attracing savings from the people
especially the rural poor.

Pilot Pro.ject
5.16      The    pilot  project was initiated in  1984  with  the
objective  of  making  loans  available  to  small  farmers   and
improving   their existing  agricultural  practices.  A   linkage
between   the   extension  service  ar.d  the  credit service  was
established is a tool to help increase the output and income of
small farmers.  BAAC   and Department of  Agricultural  Extension
field officers cooperated at the village  level  to design   farm
plans  and  associated  loan contracts for each participant.
5.17      The  project  was implemented  for  two  years  between
1984/1985 and 1985/1986. 2,000 small farmers in 28 villages in 5
provinces in the Northeast (MaIAsarakham, Nakhon Phanom, Ubon
Ratchathanee, Srisaket and Nakhon Ratchasima) and 2 provinces in
the   North  (Phrae and Nakhon Sawan) were expected to  join  the
project.   To be eligible for participation farmers had to have a
net household income of not more than 10,000 Baht per year.
5.18     In 1984/1985,  3.88 million Baht was lent to  813 farmer
beneficiaries with an average loan size of 4,755 Baht and a rate
of repayment of 88 % of the total loan disbursed. In 1984/1985
1.029 farmers borrowed 7.44 million Baht with an  average    loan
size of 7,232 Baht. The rate of repayment in the second year of
implementation   was  74  percent.    Table  37  summarises   the
performance of the BAAC/DAE "pilot project".



- 44 -
5.19      The evaluation re'port of the pilot project showed  that
the project was in some respects not completely successful. The
main problems were that not all the parti ipants were genuinely
poor farmers; and cooperation between BAAC and DAE officers at
the  village    level   was  often  inadequate.    The   detailed
evaluation  study  of   the pilot  project  and   recommendations
conducted   by  research and evaluation specialists  was  already
submitted to IBRD and IFAD.
5.20      Although  the project  was  not wholly  successful,  it
was satisfactory in some respects.   The level of contact between
BAAC and DAE officers increased; and the concept and procedures
of the pilot project have been accepted by BAAC as a 0ood basis
for an expanded programme for providing assistance to small-scale
farmers.   Consequently the " BAAC/DAE Poor Farmers Recruitment
and Servicing Programme " using EEC funds is based on lessons
learned from the pilot project.
5.21     Improvements  have  been made as a,result of  the  pilot
project; in particular the understanding and cooperation between
BAAC  and DAE officers will be taken more  seriously.   The  work
plans of two agencies will be integrated to a greater extent than
in the past and participating farmers will be informed of new
farming practices more fully.

products since 1984 under the supervision of Agri-business
Promotion  Division.    The  Division  is  authorised  to  be  an
intermediary  between   farmers  and  buyers  for  collecting and
processing   farm   produce,  as well as   promotion  of  quality
control  at  the  farm level.   All of these activities   aim  to
alleviate  marketing  obstacles  by  introducing   fair treatment
between the farm producers and buyers as well as improving the
repayment performance of the client farmers.
5.23    To achieve this goal.  BAAC working in coordination  with
*government  agencies  or  private  companies  has launched   crop
marketing schemes such as the Paddy Storaging and Pledging Scheme
in 1984, followed the Maize Pledging Scheme and Onion Pledging
Scheme in 1985. The BAAC constructed its own 2500 tons warehouse
at Kamnan Song Central Rice Market at Nakhon Sawan for the Paddy
Warehouse Scheme.   In an effort to upgrade the quality  of   farm
produce,   BAAC   and  the  Department  of  Agriculture  with  the
financial and technical assistance from the British Government
launched the Thai-British Project for the Control of Aflatoxin in
Maize in order to improve the quality of Thai maize for export.
This project is to be implemented, with BAAC's  client    farmers,
in Saraburi, Lopburi, Nakhon Sawan and Phetchabun in the cropping
year .986/1987.

additional   income  for  low-income  farmers  under   p-evailing
production conditions and marketing opportunities. Therefore new
programmes  have  bsn introduced to intqgrate the  provision  of
farm  inputs,    technical  advice,    institutional  credit  and
marketing agre pments.
5.25    Participating farmers   will  be given a complete package
of   services  from  BAAC  and - the  private  company  concerned
including  seed,  fertilizer,  extension  servi.e  of new farming
techniques and  guaranteed   purchase  by  the  company at a  set
minimum price.   BAAC  will usually take  part   in  every   step
during implementation, providing credit at the initial stage,
coordinating with the private company for technical assistance
and  marketing  services,  recovering of loans after   harvesting
and extending credit for the next cropping season.
5.26    Presently, BAAC has implemented about  20 Integrated Crop
Development Projects, reaching 7,138 farmers in an area of
R1,024 rai   with  total  disbursement  amounting  43.49  million
Baht countryawide.
Credit-in-kind Service
______________________
5.27    BAAC  initiated its credit-in-kind activities in 1980  by
requesting the reliable local and central dealers and producers
to be legally registered as BAAC's farm supply distributors. The
objective of this service is to provide clients farmers with good



- 47 -
quality farm supplies at fair price and to ensure that loans were
appropriately   utilised  for  tW.e  purpose  stated  in  the loan
agreements.   During 1980-1985,  an   annual  average  of 512,387
client   farmers  utilised   the  credit-in-kind service,  buying
supplies  worth  1,690  million  Baht.   These  figures represent
37% of all BAAC's individual farmer clients and 12 percent oS all
loans  disbursed.   The  credit-in-kind  activities and provision
during the fiscal year 1981-1985 can be   seen from Table 38.
6.CONCLUSIONS
-------------
6.01     This Project was undertaken during the period 1983-1986.,
a period which saw further important developments in the BAAC's
operations.   Several  of these changes were directly related  to
the Project .jointly financed by the IBRD and IFAD.
6.02     At the beginning of the period the narrow spread between
the costs of funds and the interest rates which the bank was
allowed to charge gave rise to concern about the bank's long-term
financial viability.   In agreeing to participate in the  Project
the IBRD very strongly encouraged to BAAC to take steps to lessen
its dependence on subsidies and become more self-sufficient
financially,   particularly  by  making more effort  to  mobilise
rural savings.
6.03      At  the same time the Project strongly  encouraged  the
BAAC  to  increase  its  developmental  role.    Under  the  IBRD



- 48 -
component the bank was to extend its term-lending programme,
aiming permanently to increase the productive capacity of sub-
borrowers  through  on-farm  investments.    The  IFAD  component
required the bank to lend in "poverty areas" to needy farmers who
would not normally qualify for institutional credit,  and to link
credit more directly with agricultural research and extension by
cooperating more closely with the DAE.
6.04      There  are  obvious conflicts  in  these  business  and
developmental goals because both the term lending programme and
recruiting and extending loans to small-scale farmers involve
higher costs than normal BAAC lending operations.    These higher
costs result more from the increased burden of administration
than from adverse repayment rates from among the target groups of.
farmers.    Because the political climate has not been favourable
to an increase in interest rates charged these higher costs would
inevitably reduce the BAAC's profitability.
6.05     These difficulties have been compounded pressures result
for the bank to play a larger role in aspects of the Government's
rural  development  programme.   These  pressures  result  from a
general view that the BAAC is one of the most efficient state
agencies in-olved in rural development.    However new activities
such  as the Paddy Pledging Programme have taken up a great  deal
of the bank's resources without any direct financial pay-off.
6.06      The  net  result of BAAC's attempts  to  resolve  these



-49-
conflicts has been at least a partial success wit.a respect to all
of the Project's objectives:
- The bank has been able to mobilise greater amounts of
saving and therefore to rely somewhat less on its
traditionally most important sources of funds.
- The bank's operating costs were lower at the end of the
Project than they were at the beginning.
- Unler the IFAD Pilot Project new procedures have been
developed for lending more to small-scale farmers.
- Small-scale farmers have proved their creditworthiness
by repaying their loans at satisfactory rates.
- The term-lending programme has continued to develop;
mainly   outside  of  the  context  of  Special  Projects
involving  cooperation  with other  Government  Agencies,
with  ucceptable rates of return for the farmer  clients'
investments.
- The bank has remained profitable throughout the period.

Dear Sir,
Subject: THAILAND - Second Agricultural Credit Project
(LLn. 2310-TI) Project Completion Report
In reply to your letter of 4 October, we would like to make the
following comments on the  OED's review -f the PCR  submitted by the BAAC
to the World Bank in relation to the Second Agricultural Credit Project.
Regarding the question of risk involved in lending to small-scale
farmers for medium- and long-term loans, and the failure to reach project
targets:
a)    BAAC was committed to using alternative sources of funds for
term credit from the Japanese OECF to finance farmers in the same poverty
areas (p.13 of PCR). Thus the additional funding provided by the IBRD loan
could not be absorbed as quickly as anticipated.
b)    Term loans to small-scale farmers are risky in the absence
of adequate supporting technical services. BkAC can and does successfully
lend for investment purposes to small farmers in Special Project Areas
where extra services are provided.

Finally, we would like to stress the point that BAAC incurred
very heavy foreign exchange losses under the Project. This remains the
maia reason for our inability to consider further IBRD loans at the
present time.
n  ncerely your
Susan  Traipol
