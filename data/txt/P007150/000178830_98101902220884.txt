INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECCNSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMIENT
REPORT AND RECOI;ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$17.0 million to the Republic of El Salvador
to help finance a second education project. The loan would have a tenn
of 3u years, including lCU years of grace, with interest at 7 1/4 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Recent Economic Development and Prospects
of El Salvador" is being distributed to the Executive Directors concurrently
with this report. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        As discussed in the economic memorandum, the economy expanded
rapidly in the 196&-67 period but slowed considerably during 1967-72. The
country's principal asset, a group of dynamic entrepreneurs and a labor
force with a demonstrated ability to acquire ski"lls rapidly, enabled Jhe
economy to expand its production of manufactures for the Central American
Common Miarket (CACM) and of cotton exports. GDP grew by about 6.5 percent annu-
ally in real terms between 1960 and 1967. Its human resources along wLth a
satisfactory transport network and electric power grid gave El Salvador's
industry a head start within the CACM. The contribution of manufacturing to
the gross domestic product increased from 1lh percent to almost l per:cent during
the sixties.  Nevertheless, the economy continued to depend heavily on coffee
and cotton as the m?jor sources of domestic production and export earnings.
In 1967-69, Ps cotton prices fell and volume was reduced to half its I1I965
peak level (because of disease and abandonment of marginal landF), growth
of export earnings fell to only 1-2 percent annually. The ccnflict wi.th
Honduras in 1,69 represented another setback for the economy. Exports to
the Common Market declined as the border with Honduras was shut off, and
expensive a1ternative arrangements had to be undertaken for shipments to
Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Continued low export growth and the CAGM problems
led to sharp declines in domestic saving and private investment, and real
GDP growth averaged only about 4.l percent annually during 1967-1972, which
is only slightly higher than the annual population growth rate of 3.5 percent.
4.       El Salvador already has one of the highest population densit:ies in tEe
world, and rapid population growth is a basic obstacle to a more satisfactory
rate and pattern of development. The 1974 population of 3.8 million is expected to



double by 1990 unless the present growth rate can be lowered. Even aasuming
a continued large migration to urban centers, the per capita availability
of cultivable land for the rural population would fall further from the pres-
ent 0.3 hectare. Moreover, the resource endowment is meager; known mineral
resources are scant and fiahing in the Pacific is limited to the narrow con-
tinental slielf.
5.        L.t the same time the benefits of economic growth have remained un-
evenly distributed. Eatimates for 1965-67 indicate that the top 10 percent
of income recipienta received 42 percent of total income; 2 percent of land-
owners hold almost two-thirds of agricultural land; and, at the other end of the
scale, about 90 percent of farms are smaller than 2 hectares. Over half of
the labor potential in the peasant sector (which accounts for 60 percent of
the working-age population) remains unemployed   for a large part of the year,
while the a,bundant labor supply has kept agricultural wages at a subsistence
level over a long period. Most rural incomes are below $50 per capita per
annum compared with the national average of $320. Poor education, health,
nutrition and housing conditions further accentuate the difficult situation
in the peasant sector and have stimulated migration to urban centers where
living conditions are marginally better. According to FAO, the average per
capita calorie and protein intake is among the lowest in Latin America. The
literacy rate of the adult population is almost 80 percent in the cities but
only 40 percent in the rural areas0 It is clear that the long-term viabil-
ity of the economy will depend on well-designed population policies, a more
equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and better edu-
cation, health, nutritional and living standards for most of the population.
6.       The outlook for progress in tackling the country's main social
and economic problems has improved during the last three years. The Govern-
ment's policies through the sixties were geared almost exclusively to main-
taining price and balance-of-payments stability. The financial stability,
of course, permitted the private sector to take advantage of the opportuni-
ties offered by the creation of the Common Market and the cotton boonai. But
a low level of tax effort (about 10 percent of GDP) and weak project pre-
paration limited severely the use of long-term foreign financing, and public
investment remained low.    Supported by a large majority in Congress, the
Administration which took office in July 1972 has introduced a number of
reforms and started implementing the 1973-77 National Development Plan.    To
strengthen the institutional base necessary to implement the 1973-77 Plan,
the Government in 1973: (1) created the Agricultural Development Bank (whose
main functian will be to improve the availability of credit for small farmers)
and a Housing Fund; (2) strengthened the Rural Colonization Institute's capacity
to support the settlement of landless farmers; and (3) placed directl!y under
the Office of the President the Community Development Organization (liOCCO). The
Government also approved a new forestry law which provides mechanism, to carry
out reforestation and soil conservation programs on public and private lands,
and is expected to approve this year an Export Development Law to promote exports
of non-traditional products to countries outside the CACM. In addition, some
public and private institutions have started to encourage family planning and
to provide advisory services in clinics. Also during 1973, a combination of
higher export prices and improved tax administration resulted in an increase in
Central Government revenues by an unprecedented 23 percent, or more than twice
the rate of growth of GDP.  The improved revenue situation facilitated an increase
in capital expenditures, which rose from 2.3 percent to 3.6 percent of GDP
between 1971 and 1973; moreover, the level of capital expenditures achieved



in 1973 was in line with the investment targets of the Development Plan.
7.       The medium-term outlook is for an improvement in real economic growth
from a 4.1 percent annual average in 1967-72 to at least 6.5 percent in 1974-76.
This gain will come mainly from the secondary effects on the economy of the
expected continuation of high international prices for the traditional export
crops -- coffee, cotton, sugar and meat. Expanding exports of non-traditional
products to markets outside the CACM remain ocritical issue because of its
dual importance for introducing a new outward-oriented industrial straAegy and
as a source of new jobs to alleviate the serious unemployment problem. In
the longer term, scarcity of land and absence of other natural resources may
limit the growth potential, while prices for the major agricultural exports
are expected to be somewhat less favorable. Nonetheless, there is scope for
considerable strengthening of the economy by developing industry and non-
traditional agriculture aimed at world markets. The recent rise in fuel prices
is expected to raise the share of petroleum in total imports from four to seven
percent in the coming years. However, as long as export prices remain high,
the projected resource gap should remain within manageable limits over the
next two to three years.
O.       To achieve the main objectives of the 1973-77 Development Plan of
expanding and diversifying the economy while providing a more even distri-
bution of bernefits will require a sharp increase in the level of public expen-
ditures. Ceritral Government investment is expected to increase from 3 percent
of GDP in 196b-72 to about 6 percent in the late seventies. Total public
invesciient expenditures are projected to more than double from 1960-72 to
1973-77. Agriculture (including irrigation schemes, marketing, credit pro-
grams and better extension services aimed at small and medium farmers) accounts
for one-fifth of planned public investment expenditures; power, transport and
telecommunicctions absorb an additional 37 percent of the total.
9.       To finance such a program, Central Government current revenues
would have to rise substantially from current levels. While the measures
mentioned in paragraph 6 above should enable the Government to achieve program
targets through 1974, additional revenue measures are expected to be necessary
during the 1975-76 period. Recognizing this, the Govelnment is considering
the introduction of new tax measures such as export duties on cotton and
sugar, on a progressive basis to vary according to the price on the interna-
tional market, a sales tax that could eventually replace the present stamp tax,
and higher taxes on imported luxury goods.
External financing
10.       The public external debt repayable in foreign currency amounted to
US$194 million at the end of 1973, or US$113 million excluding undisbursed
commitments. El SalvadorsB traditionally low debt-service ratio gives the
Government some margin for borrowing abroad on conventional terms. Even assum-
ing that a portion of its external borrowing is obtained on such terms, the
debt-service ratio would remain below three percent through 1976. In view,
however, of El Salvador's poverty and low per capita GNP (US$320 in 1971), the
serious imbalance between natural resources and population, and the uncertain
long-term prospects of its main exports, it will be desirable for El Salvador
to obtain most of the external financing required for the 1973-77 Development
Plan on soft terms.  For the same reasorsit will be desirable for El Salvador
to obtain financing for a large share of the costs of individual projects.
Local currency financing is also justified, on the grounds that El Salvador is
making reasonable efforts to mobilize local resources in support of its develop-
ment program but requires external assistance in excess of the foreign exchange
component of development projects suitable for international financing.



11.       Apart from the Bank, external financing has been principally pro-
vided by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). IDB and CABEI funds have
carried very soft terms and contained large components repayable in local
currency. The IDB has made loans for housing, water and sewerage, ports,
highways, agricultural credit, industry, higher education and municipal
markets. TISAID has financed health centers, basic education, housirg and
industry. CABEI has financed industry and also highway and telecomrrmunica-
tions projects of importance for the Central American network. The past
lending of these agencies through the end of 1973 is summarized below:

Includes US$38.1 million for a power loan for which the Borrower has
the option to repay in local or foreign currency.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       £1 Salvador has to date received eleven Bank loans and two IDA
credits, totalling US$108.3 million net of cancellations. The last opera-
tion, a loan for a sixth power project, amounting to US$27.3 million, was
signed in April 1973. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 19Th and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
13.       Bank Group disbursements as a percentage of total disbursements on
the public external debt of El Salvador are expected to peak at abouit 28
percent in 1980 as compared with 24 percent in 1973. The Bank Group's share
of total debt service is projected to decline slightly during the next two
years and then to rise again to a level of about 27 percent by 1980 -- the
same as that prevailing in 1973.
16.       In the past, the Bank Group assisted El Salvador in those areas
where it had special competence or where financing on softer terms from



other deveLopment agencies was unavailable. Thus, the Bank Group financed
infrastrucc-ure investment such as power, roads and telecommunications and,
to a lesser extent, education. Together with IDB and CABEI the Bank assisted
the develoJment of El Salvador's arterial highway system. A close relation-
ship between the Bank and El Salvador's public power agency (CEL) helped the
latter to 1evelop into one of the most efficient power companies in Central
America. 'The Bank's efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
national telecommunications agency (ANTEL) has facilitated the rapidt expan-
sion of that company's operations in the past three years.
15.       The Bank Group is planning to give increased emphasis in its
lending to El Salvador to high-priority fields in which other agencies are
not equipped or willing to operate, such as education, sites and services
for very low income housing and family planning. In addition, the Bank
Group would help in meeting the growing resource requirements in power and
telecommunications, possibly in joint operations with other agencies, and
in strengthening institutions, particularly ANTEL. The possibility of Bank
assistance to agriculture will be examined after completion of a sectoral
analysis planned for later this year as part of a joint IBRD, IDB and AID
agricultural and rural survey of the five Central American countries. The
Bank is also exploring the possibility of lending for manufacturing industry
and tourism through the Central American Bank for Economic Integration
(CAdEI). Given El Salvador's level of per capita income, it is intended to
continue to provide some IDA financing, although the bulk of Bank GJroup lend-
ing would be on IBRD terms.
16.       Aside from the proposed education project, the project whose prep-
aration is most advanced is a sites and services project for very low income
housing which is planned to be presented to the Executive Directors in early
FY1975.
17.       IFC has made two investments i El Salvador.  The first, a $14o,000
loan in 1959 to Industrial Textiles, S.A., has been completely repaid. The
second, a $233,000 equity investment and a $600,000 loan to Hoteles de Centro
America, S.A., in 1969, was for a hotel project that was completed in September
1972.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Education System
18.       The formal education system comprises nine years of basic educa-
tion, three years of secondary education, and courses varying in length from
two to seven years at the higher level.
19.       The Ministry of Education has the major responsibility for formu-
lating policy for and administering all formal and nonformal public educa-
tion institutions except the Autonomous National University. Recent:Ly, the
Ministry of Education has been reorganized and strengthened through the
establishment of the Office of Planning and Organization (ODEPOR), wlhich is
responsible for the planning, programming and budgeting of the Minisiry's
activities in coordination with the National Planning Council. School
supervision is organized in ten zones of ten circuits each and is effectively
carried out by supervisors based in every circuit.



-6-
Education Reform
20.       ln 1967 the Government undertook a dynamic and far-reaching Educa-
tion Reform aimed at improving the structure, staffing, administration and
technology of the education system in order to enhance its responsiveness
to the countryts overall development needs. The Reform was based on the
premise that El Salvador's lack of natural resources requires an active
policy of human resource development and that only a modern, well-organized
education system can fulfill this task. The first phase of the Reform was
implemented through the 1968-1972 Education Development Plan, and most of
the Plan's targets have been achieved. An instructional television (ITV)
program has been adopted and fully implemented in grades 7-9. With the
help of the first Bank education loan, secondary education has been expanded
and improved and its curriculum modified to provide a more vocational orien-
tation. Teacher training has been consolidated and an intensive program of
in-service teacher training implemented.
21.       Despite these achievements several problems remain, the principal
one being the persistence of inequality in educational opportunities between
urban and rural areas. Schools are strongly concentrated in the cities, and
many rural communities have little or no access to schooling of any ksind.
Early dropout from the first six grades is a serious problem, particularly
in the rural areas, and the main cause is the inadequacy of school capacity.
Many rural schools have only one classroom offering the first two grades,
which effectively precludes the students from further schooling. Moreover,
distances to the rural schools are long and, because of the prevailing mal-
nutrition, often prohibitive. Furthermore, the curriculum of basic educa-
tion is still too much oriented towards preparation for the next higher
stage of learning and is not adequately adapted to the basic needs of the
rural youth. Although ITV has been successfully introduced, its coverage
needs to be further extended to make it cost effective. Nonformal educa-
tion and training is offered on a limited scale and does not meet the urgent
training needs of the sizeable rural population.
22.       Ihe present Education Developnent Plan covers the years 1973-1977
and gives the highest priority to the extension of education and training
opportunities for youths and adults in rural areas. School capacity in rural
areas is to be expanded, rural schools are to be utilized as community learn-
ing centers, and nonformal education and training are to be strengthened and
expanded. The Plan also stresses the need for further quality improvements
and proposes several cost-reducing measures to offset the resulting increase
of per-student costs. One of the most important of these measures is the
planned replacement of classrooms which are rented or in poor condition and
which are too small, leading to uneconomically low pupil-teacher ratios.
Basic Education
23.        Basic education, covering ages 7-15, is provided free in public
schools for 72 percent of the 623,000 attending students; the remaining 28
percent attend private schools. Basic education is organized into three
cycles: the first two comprising grades 1-6 are equivalent to primary
education, while the third cycle -- grades 7-9 -- represents the lower
secondary level. In 1971 total enrollment in formal basic education (in-
cluding over-aged students) was the equivalent of 70 percent of the school-



- 7 -
age populaLion (91 percent in the first two cycles, and 21 percent in the
third cycli,). The equivalent participation in the first two cycles had reached
132 percenr in the cities but only 62 percent in the rural areas. The 1973-77
Educationa). Development Plan aims at halving the gap between urban and rural
participation rates and at providing all children with at least the four
years of basic education required to es-tablish literacy on a permanent basis.
In order tc, accomplish the latter objecive, the Government has decided that
all small rural communities where no eduicational facilities exist and which
have 160 or more children of school age will be provided with a two-classroom
school to offer the first four grades of basic education.
9 .        The rural basic education schools will be expanded in function
to serve as community centers, particularly in the smaller communities.
They are expected to serve as gathering points for community action and
as centers for essential rural services, such as health and agricultural
extension, provided by other governmental agencies. In their function
as community learning centers, these schools will provide a range of oppor-
tunities in basic education and in nonformal education/training (e.g.,
accelerated basic education, literacy courses and work-oriented training)
for out-of-school youths and adults. The programs will be supported by
IT-, which is expected to function fully for grades h-6 by 1977 and for
all nine giades of basic education by 1)81.   Access to higher grades of
basic education will be provided in centrally located six- and nine-grade
schools.
95.      IBasic education is conceived as the common preparatory basis for
further lecrning and productive life.   The Government is aware that a shift
towards a nore-balanced curriculum is necessary to meet the basic needs of
the majority of the rural children for whom basic education is in fact
terminal ecucation. Thus, the Ministry of Education has revised the curri-
culum to irclude practical activities and some basic training in techlnical
fields, gi;ing a student the option, when leaving school, of finding a job
or of continuing his education.
Secondary Education
26.       EnrolLment in secondary education (grades 10-12) in 1971 was
2i,Lpl(0 or 13.5 percent of the 16-18 age group.  Through the First Educa-
tion Project (Loan No. 609-ES of 1969), the Bank is supporting the Govern-
ment's plans for expanding secondary education and broadening its curri-
culum with industrial, agricultural and commercial options. The loan
provides for the construction and equipment of seventeen new secondary
schools, equipment for two technical institutions and related technical
assistance. Almost all construction and equipnent procurement under the
first project has been completed, and all new project schools are now in
operation and employing the revised, diversified curriculum. The com-
pletion of the major secondary education expansion supported by the first
project has facilitated the shift in Government priorities towards the
rural basic education program to be assisted by the proposed loan.



Teacher Training
27.       As part of the 1''67 Education Reform, the Government has conso-
lidated all teacher training into one institution, Ciudad Normal, which
trains new teachers for basic and secondary education and offers a variety
of upgrading courses. There are no separate programs for urban and rural
basic education teachers, but all teachers are appointed to rural schools
for at least three years of their career. The training program for teachers
of grades 1-6 has been modified to include preparation for the teaching of
practical subjects and to orient the teachers for their role in cormunity
developmenl in the rural community schools. Also, training for basic and
secondary education will now be expanded and will include the training of
instructors in industrial arts and home economics for grades 7-9 of basic
education. In addition, Ciudad Normal will continue to offer in-service
training courses for teachers and supervisors through sunmer courses and
ITV programs.  The training of teachers for secondary education in Ciudad
Normal will be limited to humanities and science. Secondary teachers in
other subjects will be trained in universities and other post-secondary
institutions.
Nonformal Education and Training
2&        Although the Education Reform of 1967 is comprehensive in its
goals, the actual implementation has thus far been limited to formal educa-
tion. Until recently, nonformal education programs consisted only of
evening courses, equivalent to formal education programs, and literacy
training. Meanwhile a new program, PEO (Programa de Educaci6n Orientada),
has been developed to offer an accelerated form of basic education for
out-of-school youths and adults. PEO consists of flexible courses with
TTV lessons, written materials and regional counseling offices replacing
the regular classroom teacher. Such courses are now being implemented
only for the equivalent of the third cycle of basic education (grades 7-9)
where ITV is fully implemented. Similar courses for the lower cycles will
start once the use of ITV is further extended.
29.       Nonformal work-oriented training is limited to a small vocational
training center in the Ministry of Labor.   A new program of nonformal rural
training, however, is about to be launched as part of a community develop-
ment project which comprises the first step of a Government effort to begin
addressing the problems of the rural population in an integrated fashion.
This new rural training program will be executed by the Ministry of Educa-
tion in cocperation with FOCCO, the Government agency responsible for com-
munity development, the Ministry of Agriculture and other institutions
concerned with rural development.   The main thrust of the Government's
rural trair.ing strategy is to overcome the peasants' resistance to change
by organizing programs designed to facilitate the diversification of the
village ecc.nomy and to improve rural living standards. The program will
consist of work-oriented courses for rural out-of-school youths and adults
which will take place in the rural community schools. Instructors will
move f'rom community to community giving a variety of short courses in



- 9 -
such fields as small-scale agriculture, cottage industries, rural con-
struction, home economics, formation of cooperatives and use of institu-
tional credit. The first three-year phase of the progran will be carried
out in the Departments of San Miguel and Morazan. After a close evaLuation,
a second phase would involve a gradual expansion to cover the entire
country. When in full operation, there will be 4,000 courses per year
attending the needs of approximately 80,000 peasants and their families.
Education Finance
30 .       Public education in El Salvador is financed almost entirely by the
Central Government. Public basic education is free and tuition fees for
public secondary and higher education are low. To equalize opportun-ities,
a system of loans financed by a fund in the Central Bank has recently been
initiated.  These loans enable low-income students in secondary and higher
education tD finance living expenses.
31.       in I"71 total expenditures (current plus capital) for education
in El Salvador amounted to 109 million, or 4.0 percent of GDP. Of this
amount, the Central Government contribul;ed about 80 percent, equivalent to
a high 27 percent of its total budget. Expenditures for basic education
represent the bulk of total education expenditures (62 percent). The major
source of external assistance for the education sector since 1967 has been
USAID, supporting mainly ITV, curricular and administrative improvements,
and the construction of basic education schools. USAID intends to limit
future activities to technical assistance. The Bank's first project con-
centrates on secondary education; IDB has made a loan for the autono.mous
university; and UNDP has provided technical assistance for the whole educa-
tion sec-tor.
32.       Government authorities are faced with the difficult problem of
expanding education opportunities and improving the quality and relevance
of the system at a time when a high proportion of the Government budget is
already being spent on education. The 1973-77 Education Development Plan,
therefore, gives emphasis to efficiency and unit-cost reductions. School
facilities are to be increasingly operated on a double-shift basis. The
teacher workload, which is now only 25 periods per week, is being increased
with additional hours being paid at half the regular hourly rate. This
measure is being implemented on a voluntary basis. Its implementation is
facilitated by ITV which releases teachers from part of their active teach-
ing tasks. It is considered attractive by many rural teachers who do not
have alternative employment possibilities after school hours. As described
in paragraph 22 above, unnecessary recurrent expenditures on teacher salaries
and rents will be avoided with the selective replacement of unsuitab'Le
school facilities.
33.       C-iven the cost savings expected to arise from these measures, the
financial impact of the overall education program is relatively mode,t.
While El Salvador's public education expenditures rose from 2.5 percent of
GDP in 1963 to an estimated 3.2 percent of GDP in 1971, they are expected
to increase to about 3.7 percent in 1981. As Government revenues, even
without new tax measures, are expected to rise more rapidly than GDP. the
education sector will require a slightly declining share of these revenues.
The education program supported by the project, under these circumstances,
should not give rise to budgetary problems or serious corflicts with other
expenditur programs.

PART IV - THE PROJJECT
34.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project in
El Salvador" (No. 380a-ES , dated  May 15,1974) is being distributed sepa-
rately. The main features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex
III. Initial sector work in connection with the proposed project was carried
out by a UNESCO mission in February 1972. The project was prepared by the
Ministry of Education, with occasional assistance by Bank Staff, and ap-
praised in September-October 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington
in April 1974. The Republic of El Salvador was represented by Dr. R. Sanchez,
Minister of Education; Arq. A. Zuniga, Deputy Minister of Education; Ing. JO
Jnteriano, Director, Planning Office, Ministry of Education; Lic. A. Cruzman,
National Planning Office; and Lic. R. Jimenez, Economic Counselor, Embassy
of El Salvador, Washington.
35e.     The main objective of the project is to assist El Salvador in expand-
ing basic education and training opportunities in rural areas by establishinz
rural community schools offering a variety of education/training activrities
for youths and adults and by initiating a mobile, nonformal rural training
scheme. The project will serve both social and economic ends by reaching
population groups which have hit,herto been neglected. It will make it
possible for these groups to participate in further work-oriented training,
to diversify their economic activities, and to increase their incomes.   A
second objective of the project would be to bring about quality improvement
in basic education facilities for selected urban areas. The project would
include: (a) the establishr,ent of 143 new rural community schools, the
replacement of 299 unsuitable schools, the extension of 121 existing schools,
the equipping of 146 workshops in rural and urban schools and the provision of
teacher housing in rural communities where existing accommodations are inade-
quate; (b) expansion and upgrading of teacher training; (c) the implementation
of the pilot phase of a nonformal rural training scheme; and (d) the provision
of related technical assistance. The total enrollment expansion in basic edu-
cation made possible by the proposed loan would be 67,400 of which 56,000 would
be in the first six grades and 11,400 in grades 7-9.
36.       The Bank Group's financing of primary education and nonformal rural
training has grown steadily in recent years and projects in Spain, Lebanon
and some African countries include important components of such education and
training. The proposed project would be the first one exclusively for primary
and nonformal education. It is increasingly accepted that a successful socio-
economic development of rural areas and urban ghettos has, as one of the pre-
requisites, an education and training system with some components particularly
designed to meet the needs of the underpriviliged population groups. A country-
wide distribttion of institutions would generally be required which wou.ld offer
the desirable learning opportunities to those groups. The formal or nonformal
education and training programs of these institutions would prepare the partic-
ipant -children or adolescents and often adults- to form an integral part of
the local community. The proposed education project in El Salvador would meet
these requirements and represent an important development of the primary school
concept.



Basic Education
37.       a.  New schools
One hundred forty-three new schools would be established in small
rural communities where no educational facilities exist at present. Of
these schools, 130 would contain two classrooms offering the first four
grades of basic education on a double-shift basis. Access to the higher
grades of basic education would be extended through the provision of 13
centrally located rural schools which would also offer grades 5-9.
380       b. Replacement schools
The proposed replacement of 299 schools which are rented or in
bad condition would include the construction, equipment and furnishing of
19I two-classroom schools for grades 1-4 in the smallest rural communities
and 89 centrally located schools offering grades 1-6 or 1-9. Another 16
schools would be replaced in urban areas, with six of them to serve the
beneficiaries of the proposed Bank Group-financed sites and services pro-
ject.  In addition to the savings in operating costs that the replace.nent
would permit, they would provide a greatly improved environment for learn-
ing: they would be less crowded  and of better quality, with improved illu-
mination and ventilation.
39.       c. Expansion of existing schools
Additional classrooms would be provided for 40 existing ruiral
schools to increase opportunities in grades 5 through 9. Thirty-nine rural
and 60 urban schools would be extended through the addition of a workcshop
and laboratory.
40.       d. Workshop equipment
Equipment would be provided for workshops to be constructed, by
the Government in 66 rural and 80 urban schools which already contain a
laboratory. These schools together with the 125 schools which will con-
tain workshops and laboratories constructed under the project, would be
the first to implement the revised, more balanced curriculum which einpha-
sizes the teaching of practical subjects and science in all nine grades.
41.       The size and location of each school have been determined on the
basis of a school map which provides complete information on population
spread and on the location and size of existing schools. During project
implementation, however, new developments may occur, such as migration and
new roads, which may change the size of population and accessibility within
the catchment areas. Thus, a final decision on the location and size of
project schools should not be made long before the start of construction.
Criteria have been established (in Schedule 6 to the draft Loan Agreement)
for possible modifications of the location and size of new schools ald ex-
tensions. The criteria are designed to assure that the total number of



- 12 -
classrooms, workshops and laboratories is maintained at the level described in
this report and that the predominantly rural distribution will be maintained.
The local community would be asked to donate the site. In cases wherel a con-
venient site cannot be donated by the community, the cost of site acquisition
will be borne by the Government. Participation by the community in wcirks such
as site development is being explored and promoted by the Ministry of Educa-
tion in cooperation with FOCCO. Savings through community participation would
accrue to the particular community in the form of additional related works,
such as teacher housing and additional equipment and furniture for community
activities.
42.       In many of the smaller rural communities teacher accommodations are
unsatisfactory, which hampers participation of the teacher in community develop-
ment. The Government does not normally provide teacher housing, but it has
indicated that it would begin to do so in the smaller communities provided it
can be demonstrated that by building such houses, teachers can be induced to
remain in the communities beyond school hours and to become actively involved
in community development. Thirty teacher houses, therefore, would be con-
structed under the project on an experimental basis. An evaluation, satis-
factory to the Bank, of the results of providing these houses would be carried
out during 1975 and 1976, while the first 300 new schools and school replace-
ments are being constructed. The construction of the remaining 142 new schools
and replacements would await completion of the evaluation. To the extient justi-
fied by the findings of the evaluation, additional teacher houses would be
corn~ructed under the project in rural areas where adequate housing is not
available.  Should the evaluation establish that additional teacher housing
is not warranted,the loan funds which have been allocated for this purpose would
be either reallocated for other expenditures under the project or cancelled.
Teacher Training
43 .       The project provides for the addition of 6 classrooms, 4 labora-
tories and 4 workshops to the Government's teacher training school (Ciudad
Normal) to increase its capacity from 1,300 to 1,800 student places and to
improve the quality of training. This expansion would help insure an ade-
quate output of teachers for basic education and academic streams of *iec-
ondary education. The project would also include operating costs during
the project implementation period for a special in-service training pro-
gramo Quality improvements would come about through improved science teach-
ing, through the training of teachers for grades 1-6 to deal competently
with new practical subjects, and through the orientation of these teachers
for their role in community development.
Nonformal Rural Training
44.        The project includes the equipment, vehicles and related technical
assistance for the nonformal rural training program of the Ministry ol Educa-
tion, and start-up expenses for the pilot phase. As described in paragraph
29 above, the pilot program would be operated in the Departmentrof San. Miguel
and Morazan.  With each of 52 community schools to be visited about l' times
annually, there would be a total of 780 courses per year lasting ole week
each and serving 15,000 peasants.



- 13 -
Technical Assistance
45.       The project would include 1i; man years of expert services and
11½ man years of fellowships to insure the proper implementation of the
revised basic education curriculum and the nonformal rural training scheme.
The experts would train Salvadorean counterparts and assist the Government
in curriculum development and school administration, science and practical
subject-teaching in basic education, organization of techniques of nonformal
rural training, and evaluation techniques. The loan would also include
US$220,000 for expenditures in preparation of a possible third education
project.
Costs and Financing
46.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$2h.2 million,
of which US$11.8 million, or 49 percent, represents the foreign exchange
costso Construction costs make up 54 percent of the total cost; furniture
and equipment, 15 percent; technical assistance, teacher training, nonformal
rural training and project administration, 9.5 percent; and physical and
price contingencies, 21.5 percent. With the proposed loan amount of US$17.0
million, the Bank would finance 70 percent of total project costs (US$1108
million of foreign exchange and US$5.2 million equivalent of local costs).
The balance of the project costs will be borne by the Government. Basic
cost estimates are in prices of January 1t974 and include the estimated
effects of petroleum price increases. The justification for some local
expenditure financing in El Salvador is referred to in paragraph 10 above.
ProJect Entity
47.       Direccion Arquitectura Educativa (DAE), the School Construction
Agency of the Education Ministry, has been responsible for the generally
satisfactory implementation of the First Education Project. DAE would be
responsible for the construction, equipment and furniture under the proposed
project. Oficina de Planeamiento y Organizacion (ODEPOR),the Ministry of
Education's Planning and Organization Office, would be responsible for im-
plementing the technical assistance component and the teacher and nonformal
rural training programs, and for coordinating the inputs of other entities
of the Ministry of Education. Recently, DAE was expanded to include a chief
procurement officer and a senior educator,with the latter to be seconded
by the Technical-Pedagogical Service of the Ministry of Education. In
addition, the position of a project coordinator has been established in
ODEPOR. Appointments to these new positions as well as to the currently
vacant position of chief architect would be a condition of loan disburse-
ment for civil works and project administration (Section 2.02(b) of the Loan
Agreement). Also, assurances have been obtained from the G<overnment that the
posts of DAE's key personnel will continue to be filled by suitable staff
during project execution and that new appointments to these posts would be
made in consultation with the Bank (Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
Procurement and Disbursement
h?6      Contracts for civil works,equipment and furniture would be awarded
under international competitive bidding in ace-ordance with Bank guidelines.
However, El Salvador has a competitive local construction industry and
foreign contractors are unlikely to participate. Invitations for civil
works bids would, therefore only be advertised locally, but embassies would
be notified so that foreign bidders could participate if they wished. Fur-
niture and equipment would be grouped to form sizeable packages for bulk
purchasing. Items that cannot be grouped in packages of at least US$5,000
and would not in the aggregate exceed the equivalent of US$300,000 (corre,
sponcding to 5 percent of the total costs of equipment and furniture) would
be procured in accordance with the Borrower's regular procurement proce-
dures. In accordance with the Central American Agreement, suppliers from
Central American Common Market (CACM) countries would receive a margin of
preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f* base price or 50 percent of the
tariff payable by non-CACM manufacturers,whichever is lower. DAE would be
responsible for preparing and issuing tenders, evaluating bids, ancl awarding
contracts.
49.       The loan would be disbursed in four years to meet: (i) the c.i.f.
cost of directly imported furniture and equipment and 85 percent of local
costs of furniture and equipment; (ii) 62 percent of the total costs of
civil works, teacher training, nonformal rural training and project adminis-
tration; and (iii) 85 percent of the total costs of technical assistance.
An amount of up to US$200,000would be disbursed retroactively for expendi-
ture incurred after May 1, 19i'4 for equipment required to begin implementa-
tion of the pilot stage of the nonformal rural training scheme and for tech-
nical assistance. The disbursement schedule for the proposed loan is indi-
cated in Annex III.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50,       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of El Salvador and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section X
(iii)  of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution ap-
proving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern of
loans for education projects.
51,       I an satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Ar   les of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan/credit No.
Ln. 60Y     Education Project:   US$4.9 million of June 11, 1969.
Closing Date: July 31, 197h.
The status of this project is described in para-
graph 26 of this Report.
Ln. 811     Second Telecommunications Project: US$9.5 million of
April 17, 1972. Closing Date: December 31, 19716.
After some initial delays in procurement of project goods
which might delay final completion of the project by 6 to
12 months, substantial progress is now being made and
significant benefits will begin to be realized in early
1975 with the commissioning of 4,000 local automatic ex-
change lines. All long distance equipment should be in-
stalled by November 1975. The project is expected to be
completed between June and December of 1976.
Ln. 889     Sixth Power Project:   US$27.3 million of April 12,
1973.  Closing Date: -December 31, 1976.
Initial progress in construction of the two principal
works, the Ahuachapan geothermal plant and the Cerr6n
Grande hydroelectric facility, has been satisfactory.
However, difficulties in completion of the canal for
geothermal effluent from the Ahuachapan plant may de-
lay its initial operation by six months and increase
its cost. Because of the effluent canal difficulties
and higher-than-expected construction costs of Cerr6n
Grande, the project is now estimated to cost about
8 percent more than its appraisal estimate of US$97.7
million. The Borrower's request for approval of com-
mercial borrowing to cover the cost overrun is being
reviewed within the Bank. The Government-appointed
Relocation Commission has begun to determine policy
concerning relocation and employment of the popuLa-
tion affected by the Cerr6n Grande reservoir.
L/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:  Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture
would be awarded under international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. How-
ever, El Salvador has a competitive loca'L con-
struction industry and foreign contractors are
unlikely to participate. Invitations for civil
works bids would therefore only be advertised
locally, but embassies would be notified so that
foreign bidders could participate if they wished.
Furniture and equipnent would be grouped to form
sizable packages for bulk purchasing.   If,ems
that cannot be grouped in packages of at least
US$5,000 and would not in the aggregate exceed
the equivalent of US$300,000 (corresponding to
5 percent of the total costs of equipmen-, and
furniture) would be procured in accordance with
the Borrower's regular procurement procediures.
In accordance with the Central American Agreement,
suppliers from Central American Common Market
(CACM) countries would receive a margin of pref-
erence of 15 percent of the c.i.f. base price or
50 percent of the tariff payable by non-('ACM
manufacturers, whichever is lower.
