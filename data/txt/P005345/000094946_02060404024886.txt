,.u    SCOPE AND PURPOSE
TFlc proposed project is to rehabilitate the existing Hbahnc landfill, in Hbaline village, caza of Jbeil,
N4ohafazet of Mount Lebanon, and to construct a new sanitary landfill for landfilling the solid waste
resulting from the caza of Jbeil.
A gcoteclnical investigation was therefore performed at the site of Hbaline landfill in order to explore
thc subsurface conditions at the site.
This report presents the findings of the site works and a summary of laboratory test results.
The site investigation program comprised drilling of three boreholes, and excavation of four test pits,
in addition to some tests in-situ and in the laboratory.
Thc drilling operation started on the 13' of July 2001 and was completed on the 13t' of August 2001
and laboratory work was then carried out.
2.0    SITE WORK
The drilling program consisted of drilling three boreholes with a depth of 36 m, 64.5 m and 66 m
below the current surface. Boreholes were drilled using rotary rig of type ACKER.
Hollow stem auger system was utilized for drilling and boring, with soil samples continuously
retrieved to the surface using the split-barrel sampler.
TeIC samples obtained were placed in boxes, and were visually and manually inspected on site and
described. All samples were transported i.o the soil laboratory for tests.
At completion of borehole N°2, a standpipe PVC slotted piezometer, was lowered inside the borehole.
No water table was identified in the boreholes.
Boreholes N° I and 3 were closed with a mixture of ciment/water.
On the other hand, four test pits were excavated and were visually and manually inspected on site and
described. Samples were transported to the soil laboratory for tests
3.0    DRILLING RESULTS
The results of drilling of the boreholes and excavating the pits are presented in the logs in Appendix
B.
4.0    LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
The laboratory-testing program was performed on some soil samples obtained from the test pits
mainly for classification and measurement of strength characteristics purposes.
Onc sample obtained from borehole N° I was tested to obtain the unconfirmed compressive strength
ind the Young Modulus.
.n site permeability test (Lugeon) were peiformed in borehole BH-3 at 3 differents depths (2.7m,45m
und 63m).
lie laboratory and in-site test results are presented in Appendix C.
.0    INTERPRETATION         OF    THE    RESULTS      OF    THE    GEOTECHNICAL
INVESTIGATION.
'he interpretation of the results of the geotechnical investigation is shown in Appendix E.

Interpretation of the Results of the
Geotechnical Investigation



Naturc du sol et du sous-sol
I Aspect g6n&ral
En se basant sur une etude de geologie de surface en se referant sur une carte
g6ologique au 1/50000 de la region et appuyee sur une etude approfondie de notre
expert en geologie, il apparait que la succession de couches geologiques de la
d6charge de Hbaline situee dans le cours d'eau de Wadi se pr6sente comme suit:
-  Une mince couche alluvionnaire d'6paisseur inf6rieure a 3m forme le lit
mineur de Wadi avec une suite lithologique qui se presente de haut en bas,
a partir du fond de la vallee, comme suit.
-  Une suite de marno-calcaire et calcaire brun-creme relativement dur
finement stratifie. Cenomanien terminal base turonienne.
-  Calcaire grossierement stratifie, calcaire de Iite cenomanien superieur.
2     Description litliologique des reconnaissances par carottage continu
a) Situation des sondages
Sondage N         X             Y            Z        profondeur
1I_       - 32011:4       469          235          36m
2          -319926        446          232          64.5m
3          - 320267        354         224           66m
b) trois sondages de reconnaissance par carottage continu ont ete execute le long du
cours d'eau montrent qu'il s'agit de calcaire et calcaire - marneux durs, fortement
fissures et fractures, de couleur brun- creme A passage de calcaire tres compact, dur,
de tres bon carottage de couleur grise.
3     Permeabilite des formations
L'execution du sondage No 3 a montre une perte totale d'eau A partir de 10 m, les
autres ne presentent cette particularite.
Les essais lugeons ont donne un coefficient de perm6abilite moyenne de 5.104 m/s a
des profondeurs superieures A 45 rnktres, cette permeabilite est consideree comme une
valeur moyenne entre les mat6riaux. etanches et les plus permeables. Elle necessite un
traitement supplementaire pour garantir lPtkanch6it6 du site contre toute infiltration de
lixiviats. Le traitement consisterait en une couche d'argile de 50 a 60 cm, une
g6omembrane, avec les protections geotextile necessaires. L'installations d'une
double geomembrane (au lieu d'une) nous parait excessif en 6gard a la mise d'une
couche d'argile d'epaisseur suffisante et au fait, qu'A ce jour  et sans aucune
protection aucun cheminement de lixiviats n'a pu atteindre le nappe depuis une
vingtaine d'annees
