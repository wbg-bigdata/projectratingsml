PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 892-PAK)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Fourth Education
Project (Primary I) in Pakistan, for which a World Bank Credit was extended
to the Islamic Republic  of  Pakistan  in April  1979.   The Credit became
effective in October 1979.   The  estimated  total  cost of the project was
US$17.2 million of which US$10 million was covered by the Credit. The
Credit Account was closed on January 7, 1986 and the undisbursed balance of
US$2.9 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by a Unesco mission for the Government of
Pakistan under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement and reviewed by the
South Asia Regional Office.    The mission  held working meetings with the
appropriate authorities at the Federal and Provincial levels and visited
sample project institutions in all four provinces.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government--particularly
by the Federal and Project Implementation Units staff--toward the prepara-
tion of the Report is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the OperationE Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies fcr comment in March 1987.  Comments received
from the Government have been taken into account in finalizing the report
and are reproduced as Attachments I-III.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 892-PAK)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
This project was originally identified and prepared in 1977 by the
Government and USAID, but was subsequently transferred to IDA when USAID
activities in Pakistan were reduced.    It was  appraised by IDA in August
1978, and a credit of US$10.0 million aquivalent was approved in March 1979
to finance 100% of the foreign and 39% of the local costs. The project was
estimated to cost US$17.2 million equivalent and to be completed by
September 1984 (para. 2.08).
Obiectives and Prolect Content
The Fourth Education Project formed the first phase of an overall
strategy to improve primary education (para. 2.6 and Annex 1). The goal of
this first phase was to determine the relative contribution of selected
inputs to improving quality and access, and therefore, the project was
intended to be experimental in size, scope and design (para. 2.10).
Major project objectives weres    i)  increasing access to primary
schools, especially for girls and rural poor; ii) reducing wastage, princi-
pally dropout and repetition; iii) improving educational quality; and iv)
reducing costs and increasing the internal efficiency of the system with
regard to wastage, class and school size and lower teacher costs (para.
2.9). The project financed: i) salaries of a new category of assistant
teacher and improvements to in-service teacher training; ii) salaries of
two new supervisory posts (supervisor and learning coordinator), enabling
extension of supervision to the district level and belows iii) textbooks,
teachers' guides library books and equipment for project schools and tech-
nical assistance and training to develop additional material for trial in
schools; and iv) construction and furniture for additional *lassrooms,
residences for female teachers and teacher education X 3ource centers
(paras. 2.11-2.19). Since creating the conditions for improved teacher and
supervisor performance was a key element in the overall strategy, the proj-
ect contained an extensive staff training program, as well aa experimenta-
tion into the contribution of selected inputs into achievement of project
objectives (para. 2.20-2.23). The project also sought to build a permanent
implementation capacity within the primary education subsector by strength-
ening the federal and provinclal educational planning offices responsible
for project management.



- vii -
Implementation Experience and Results
The project was closed in June 1985, in accordance with Appraisal
estimates. Disbursements continued for an additional six months, and an
undisbursed balance of nearly US$3.0 million, or 30% of the original credit
amount, was cancelled in  January  1986.    Total project cost was US$11.7,
which was an underrun of 32% in US dollars and 9% in local currency (paras.
5.1-5.5)
Project implementation was beset by severe managerial problems.
Persistent staffing gaps at all levels of project administration resulted
in poor coordination and supervision of project activities, particularly
notable in the implementation of civil works and the in-service teacher
training components (paras. 3.3-3.4).    The  federal  project unit did not
prepare experimental, low cost designs with UNESCO assistance as intended
at appraisal, but allowed provincial public works authorities to undertake
design work without adequate technical oversight. Poor designs and delayed
construction of questionable quality resulted (paras. 4.4-4.14). Given the
poor quality of existing schools, and the variable quality of additional
facilities, it was impossible to test relationships between provision of
new classrooms, enrollment growth and student costs, as had been intended
at appraisal (paras.  2.2,  6.2,  6.19-6.21).    No comprehensive record of
facilities constructed or equipped was maintained (despite the fact that
the civil works component absorbed over 50% of the credit) but dissatisfac-
tion with tht outcome was uniform (paras. 3.5 and 4.9-4.14)
The in-service teacher training program, among the most important
to achievement of project objectives, was also among the least successful.
While nearly 11,000 individuals received in-service training in a phased
program as envisaged, the program was a failure for a number of reasons:
i) selection of trainees was poor, ii) initial training for the group of
master trainers was irrelevant, iii) subsequent course direction and
sequencing was inadequate and iv) teaching methods were antiquated. Insuf-
ficient monitoring and evaluation by federal and provincial project units
precluded adjustments during implementation (paras. 3.7-3.9 and 6.3-6.7).
Implementation of the remaining components was more efficient, and
outcomes generally better.   The  recruitment  of learning coordinators and
supervisors was very successful. The creation of a five-step career ladder
in the primary system not only improved the morale and professional profile
of teachers, but also increased supervision which reduced teacher absentee-
ism, improved  cmzm.unications  among  administrators,  teachers and parents
and, most importantly, improved the quality of teaching (paras. 2.16, 3.10-
3.15 and 6.8-6.13). The educational materials purchased did not relate to
the experimental program and were often linguisitically inappropriate, and
no trial materials were developed for testing. Nevertheless, the distribu-
tion of free textbooks to children who could not otherwise afford them,
coupled with the impact of enhance supervision, contributed significantly
to increased enrollment and reduced wastage (paras. 3.16-3.18 and 6.14-



- viii -
6.18). Project efforts to enhance teacher services and increase the supply
of femalo teachers were mixed.    While  provision of staff housing did not
contribute significantly to the recruitment of female teachers, provision
of boundary walls and hostels (both unforeseen at appraisal) did, as did
the recruitment of female assistant teachers (paras. 6.2, 6.22-6.25 and
8.21).
Sustainability
The continued viability of project activities must be evaluated
within the context of the essentially experimental nature of the project,
which placed gteater emphasis on eliciting useful conclusions about a wide
range of education inputs than on generating specific sustainable outcomes.
Consequently, activities having little or no impact on quality or access
(e.g., staff housing for female teachers) should be discontinued. Nonethe-
less, whatever combination of inputs ultimately emerges will need sustained
support, and there is little evidence that crucial policy decisions affect-
ing financing and administration have  been  taken.   Budgets for upkeep of
physical infrastructure are wholly inadequate, responsibility for undertak-
ing maintenance activities is diffuse and technical skills necessary for
effecting repairs are lacking (paras. 4.18-4.20). Organizational struc-
tures governing the administration of primary education and the relation-
ship between supervisory categories created under the project and the
existing District Education Officers need further definition and clarifica-
tion if gains made under the project are to be sustained (paras. 7.4 and
7.7).
Findings and Lessons
Project content was broad and the design very complex, belying its
experimental purpose. Project scope, which included civil works for 4,000
scattered and remote school sites, training for 11,000 education staff and
testing of innovative educational inputs, was clearly too ambitious given
the Borrower's implementation capabilities.    This has been underscored by
the experience with earlier education projects, which were also character-
ized by inadequate technical supervision (of both hardware and software
components), weak leadership at the federal level and an absence of record
keeping (paras. 7.5, 7.15 and 8.3-8.5).1/   An overambitious design notwith-
standing, the situation was further aggravated by severe staffing problems
attributable to the tenuous position of project staff within the civil
service structure. Without a radical change to employment policies affect-
ing project officials the situation is unlikely to improve (paras. 8.1-
8.2).

Despite the problematic implementation and variable outcomes,
evaluation studies carried out during implementation indicated that the
project was uuccessful in: i) increasing enrollment, reducing wastage and
repetition rates, improving pupil-teacher ratios and raising student
achievements; ii) providing the Government with a wealth of information
useful in refining the long-term strategy for primary education develop-
ment; and iii) introducing action-oriented research practices during imple-
mentation (paras. 3.19-3.21, 6.1, 7.1-7.2). These findings have been taken
into consideration in the design of the Primary Education Development and
Expansion Project (Cr. 1602-PAK) (para. 7.11).
Other points of interest include:
(a)   the need to provide  project units responsible for implementing
civil works components with adequate technical expertise to
oversee design and construction work (paras. 8.9-8.10);
(b)   the importance of  including  on-going evaluation activities in
experimental components, so that lessons learned can be incor-
porated during implementation (paras. 8.11-8.12);
(c)   the need, where  technical  assistance  provisions are sizeable
and crucial tolachievement of project objectives, for thorough
preparation at the appraisal stage, including clearly defined
terms of reference (paras. 8.13-8.17); and
(d)   the  importance  of   linkages   between  project  implementing
agencies and existing administrative structures to the effec-
tive coordination of project implementation and to the ultimate
achievement of project objectives (paras. 8.23-8.25).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 892-PAl)
CHAPTER I
SIlARY. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LUAE
Phystcal Implementation
1.1    The civil works component totalled 1,000 classrooms, 280 teachers'
residences and 10 in-service training centres and absorbed just over fifty per
cent of the Credit. Nevertheless, the design was defective and implementation
was inefficient.  The final impact was general dissatisfaction with the
constructed facilities by all concerned, including PIUs, government officers and
education staff (para. 4.1).
1.2    Project Implementation Units did not exercise any practical control on
planning, design, supervision or certification of physical facilities.  These
operations were handed over (together with funds) to the respective Rural Works
Division of LGD, or Local Union Councils, or the building unit in MOE as in the
case of the Sind. This arrangement Indirectly contributed to the delay in
implementation by 17 months (27%) over Appraisal estimate of 63 months.
Specific contributing delay factors were: (a) Inaccessibility of schools in the
NWFP and price negotiations with contractors; (b) cost overruns for boundary
walls; (c) late release of funds in the Punjab; and (d) retendering in the Sind due
to high costs in remote areas (paras. 4.1 to 4.3).
Afdeqa  and Utization of B_uidps and E   m
1.3    Construction units modified existing plans and therefore did not
introduce any innovation in classroorn design, appropriate to the experimental
nature of the rest of the project (para. 4.10).
1.4    The quality of construction and materials range from below average to
average, compared to existing schools, the highest level being In the Sind, then
the Punjab and the NWFF; Baluchistan had the poorest. Pit latrine, were not
provided in all of the toilet rooms. Furniture and equipment were in general
appropriate and of acceptable standards. However, bureaucratic hinderance
caused undue aelays in procuring vehicles and motorcycles which later suffered
from the lack of spare parts locally (paras. 4.12 to 4.14 and 4.16).
1.S    Classrooms, Resource Centers and the hostel have been fully utilized.
Female residences were not popular partly due to socio-cultural constraints, a
large number being still unoccupied. Boundary walls proved very useful as
security and safety for girls' schools and should be encouraged also for boys'
schools. With the exception of duplicating machines and slide projectors!', all
equipment has been properly used.
1/    The shortage of proper type and quantity of paper and the lack of slides
limited their use. Paper for duplicating machine caused a budgetary
strain.

Cost and Financing of the Project
1.6    The total estimated cost for the project including contingencies and
excluding taxes at Appraisal was US$17.2 million (PRs 170.3 million). The Bank's
financing of US$10 million was expected to cover 58 per cent of the total
estimated costs including contingencies. As implemented, the final cost of the
project was USS11.7 million (PRs 154.68 million), being 32 per cent lower than
Appraisal estimate in US dollars and about 9 per cent lower in local currency.
The Bank therefore, financed 60 per cent of the actual total costs with the
Government covering the remainder (see Table 5.1).
1.7    As compared with appraisal estimates including contingencies, three
categories (civil works, furniture and salaries) had cost overruns in terms of local
currency by 4.6 per cent, 15.0 per cent and 15.0 per cent, respectively (see Table
5.1). Project accounts closed on 7 January 1986 although credit remained
underspent by 30 per cent (see Annex 14).  This was due to (a) technical
assistance, as a result of rescinding a consultant' at contract (US$1.35 million);
(b) salaries under-spent by US$0.89 million; (c) unallocated funds of US$0.5
million; (d) devaluation of the Pakistan Rupee from 9.9 to 15.6 over project
implementation period; (e) absence of adequate provision to spend Credit funds
In the Government's ADP and PC-1 over about 18 months at the end of the
project. Therefore, out of a credit of US$10 million, only US$7,036,237.38 were
disbursed and the balance of US$2,963,762.17 was cancelled (para. 5.5).
Project Manigement
1.8    The establishment of a competent managerial group for the project was
a formidable problem  which was not completely  solved during project
implementation. As a result major staffing gaps in the FCU adversely affected
its efficiency and limited its coordination and support to PIUs in the field.
Frequent changes in senior management staff (especially PIU directors, e.g. -
seven in the Punjab, three in the Sind) resulted in some set backss, lack of
continuity of management and long-term planning, and inadequate project
monitoring (paras. 3.3 and 3.4).

Experimentation and Evaluation
Attainment of Proiect Objectives
1.9    The results of the Demographic and Achievement Studies of 1985
confirmed the findings of those studies undertaken in 1984 in regard to the
achievement of project objectives. This confirmation provides greater reliability
of outcomes. It can therefore be said with confidence that the project has
achieved its objectives in terms of increased enrolment, decrease in wastage,
reduced repetition, increased pupil-teacher ratios and achievement score, as
shown in the following table:

Details of variation in outcomes among provinces are shown in the

project design, but the Government later decided that it would become a
part of the educational ladder, and therefore included it in the
experiment.

Answers to the Five EErmental Qgestions (para. 2.22)
1.10   i.    In general the provision of female teacher residences did not
contribute significantly to the recruitment of female teachers. Socio-cultural
factors were the chief constraints.  However, there was more success in
Baluchistan (where all residences were occupied by married couples, rather than
unmarried teachers) than in the other three provinces. On the other hand, the
establishment of assistant teachers made a major contribution to the
recruitment of female teachers. These assistant teachers were from the local
villages, and had the confidence of the villagers and did not require separate
housing (and thus reducing costs) and were paid less than trained teachers
(para. 6.2 (v)).
ii.    According to the findings of Mr. Mubarak Shah's study on
"Management and Supervision" at the PIU in the North-West Frontier Province,
the increased training of teachers by Supervisors and Learning Coordinators
resulted in improved teaching and consequently improved pupil achievement in
project schools, which although low, was higher than in other schools.



- 4 -
iil.    Mr. Shah's study also showed that improved supervision by
Supervisors and Learning Coordinators reduced significantly teacher
absenteeism. A school was visited at least once a week as compared with once or
twice a year under the existing system. Teachers, therefore, attended school
regularly. Some parents even became voluntary "watchdogs" for teachers'
attendance.
iv.    Increased contact between parents and teachers resulted in
greater enrolment and less drop-outs, but the degree varied from province to
provinces as much  depended  upon the  individual teacher.   "Parent and
Community Relations" was a subject which was listed In the C-Level training
content (para. 2.15) but was not covered during training. Learning Coordinators
and Supervisors were also effective in convincing parents to send their girls to
school and let them remain there. The mission was told that in some small
schools enrolment increased by 100 per cent.
v.     Quantifiable data were not available to justify that student costs
had been reduced through the use of assistant teachers, but It can be assumed
that costs were reduced, because these teachers cost less in salaryl/ and
required no special housing. On the other hand, redv'ing costs by moving
towards larger class and school size is even more difficult to verilfy. This is
because the Project had assumed that the addition of classrooms to existing
structures would Increase their capacity and cut the cost per student. In reality,
many existing classroom facilities at the beginning of the project were In acute
disrepair or unfit for use, and the existing infrastructure did not meet the needs
of the then current enrolment. It is obvious, therefore, that students would be
transferred to new facilities, even without the pressure of additional enrolment.
However, it cannot be ruled out that new classrqoms did attract more students
and provided for larger class size (para. 6.2 (v)). _'
Teacher Service
1.11   This component, considered the most important of the project, was
carried out at three levels, as envisaged at Appraisal.  Although the target
number in each category (36 level A, 373 level B, 10,000 level C) was generally
attained, the content, methodology and quality left much to be desired (including
the omission of the experimental aspect) and points to the need for a radical
change in approach to the teacher training programme for the follow-on project
(para. 6.3).
1.12   The three-level training programme got off to a bad start at the first
level and the poor outcome filtered down to the third-level. Some reasons for
unfavorable results include: (a) irrelevance of the A Level training programme
abroad; (b) non-availability of A Level tralners upon return to Pakistan to train
B Level; (c) improper identification of B Level participants; (d) too wide an area
of study was attempted to be covered in the short 3-week duration (at the
expense of quality); and (e) inability to innovate and inadequate preparation. At
the C Level:  (f) poor pedagogy and preparation; and (g) lack of course
development from one phase to the other - repetition of the same content to the
same group (para. 6.4 to 6.7). 3/

-5 -
1.13   Research showed that not more than 25% of the project teachers trained
at C Level had an adequate grasp of the math and science curriculum. In fact,
most of the content for the training of C Level listed at Appraisal was omitted
in the training programme (para. 2.15).
Supervision
1.14   Supervision was considered the second most important element in the
project. The experiment with project Supervisors and Learning Coordinators was
the most successful item of the project and the outcome was far beyond the
expectation of everyone. Although there is yet much room for improvement,
close supervision promises to be an answer to what the schools, the teachers, and
the children need and is likely to become an integral part of the professional
ladder. Improvement measures needed include: (a) professional development;
(b) clearer definition of their respective roles; (c) proper job-descriptions and
operational manuals; (d) adequate logistical support, and (e) salaries and
emoluments commesurate with their responsibilities (paras. 6.9 and 6.10).
Instructional Materias and Curricula
1.15   The overall impact of this component is not clearly identifiable.
Curricula were not modified in relation to the local conditions, instructional
materials were not adapted to curricula, and some textbooks were considered too
difficult. However, the textbooks and some teaching aids contributed to student
achievement, although there were some obstacles to effective learning. A major
draw-back was that the Arabic style of writing posed difficulties for students
who were more familiar with the Persian style of writing. Therefore teachers
had to translate the textbook materials into the local language in order for the
childen to understand.  Nevertheless, providing free textbooks encouraged
parents to send their children to school and did increase enrolment (paras. 6.15
to 6.17).
Physical Facilities
1.16   (a)    Classrooms
At the time of the experiment, at least 35 per cent of buildings
used for schools were substandard. Because students were transferred to the
new classrooms from the existing 'acilities, it is difficult to assess the full
impact of the additional buildings. Classrooms are a necessary condition for
increasing enrolment, but such increase can be better seen when existing
enrolment is located in acceptable school buildings.  Correlation between
enrolment increases and the provision of classrooms demonstrate that "although
enrolment Increases are associated with the provision of classrooms, the greater
increases achieveJ in project schools can only be attributed to other factors
additional to the provision of classrooms" (para. 6.21).
(b)    Female Residences
These residences were not popular, primarily due to local
customs. SingJe females do not usually live alone; they could not take their
relatives with them, and night guards were not provided for their protection and
security. Consequently, most of the residences were unoccupied (para. 6.22).



-6 -
(c)    Bouny Waals
The provision of boundary walls for girls' schools was successful.
They provided the feeling of security that parents wanted before sending girls to
school. Enclosed schools gave privacy and defined the extent of land over whlch
a school had total control to make environmental improvements (such as
planting) and keep the school grounds clean. For these reasons, the provision of
boundary walls should be encouraged also for boys' schools (para. 6.23).
(d)    Hostels
Two hostels were not foreseen in the Appraisal Report, but were
later added by the Government. Only one was built due to the lack of funds and
was fully occupied, thus increasing girls enrolment (para. 6.24; Map).
(e)    Resource Centres
The Resource Centres served well their purposet being places
where the professional development of Supervisors, LCs, and teachers occurred
through organized workshops and the development of suitable learning materials
As a result, the skills of primary teachers in the project districts were improved
significantly. These Centres have been linked to existing institutions which can
provide advice and additional resources. Their location in the urban context has
also allowed higher standards of construction to prevail compared to rural areas
(para.6.25).
Conclusions
1.17   The project achieved its primary objectives in terms of increased
enrolment, decrease in wastage, reduced repetition, increased pupil-teacher
ratios and achievement scores (para. 1.9). The experiment with selected inputs
to achievement of project objectives provided the Government of Pakistan with
a wealth of valuable information from which it determined which experimental
inputs would be more cost-effective on methods and approach for the
development of a long-term effective strategy for primary educational
development. The outputs indicateQ what Input mix seeris to be the key to
overcoming some of the chronic problems in primary education In Pakistan.
Consequently, a report entitled "A Comprehensive Report on Primary Education
- Strategy for the Development of Primary Education in Pakistan" was prepared
as the basis and justification for a follow-on project. That was the ultimate goal
of this exoerimental project (Phase 1).
Lessons Leared (Chapter VIII)
The Govenment
1.18   The efficient implementation of a project depends greatly upon a
permanent, dedicated, competent and secured staff.  Close collaboration
between the FCU and PIUs is indispensable to successful project implementation,
and the FCU should exercise greate: responsibilities for leadership, guidance,
and effective monitoring of the project.
1.19   Adequate logistical support when provided at the proper time increases
the efficiency of field staff and eventually the reliability of project outputs.

The Bank
1.20   Project design should be inf luenced by Borrower's environment and
therefore, should be designed in accordance with the latter's manageriM.,
technical and financial capabilities. A convergence of the project with the
environment should be as close as possible.
1.21   Firmer measures should be taken in order to persuade the Government to
comply fully with Credit Agreement Covenants to ensure timely achievement of
all project objectives at acceptable standards (e.g. the Punjab Audit Report was
still outstanding at the time of the Mission).
1.22   The involvement of Bank Resident Mission Personnel in monitoring the
project between Bank missions was an effective measure and should be continued
and strengthened.
The Bank and the Government
The Design and ImDlementation of Civil Works
Design
1.23   A major handicap to efficient Implementation of civil works was that
school sites were scattered among many districts in remote and sometimes
inaccessible areas. This posed logistical problems and led to substantial increase
in construction costs. The lesson to be learned is that follow-on projects should
concentrate at the district level with all schools operating within that district.
Two or more adjacent districts could be combined; contractors would then be
more willing to bid, transportation would be less costly, retendering and price
renegotiation should not be necessary, and supervision would be more convenient
and eifective.  Thus the quality of the constructed facilities should be of
acceptable standards.
Implementation
1.24   The FCU and PiUs had no technical expertise and therefore had no
influence over the physical facilities inputs. This was a serious error which
should have been corrected at t-he early stage of Implementation. Yet the Bank
was not fully aware of the situation and di-d not seek alternative approaches to
solving the problem.  In this connection, construction supervision by the
Provincial Public Works Departments was inadequate due to the large number of
scattered sites and the shortage of technicai staff (para. 4.i 4), low construction
capabilities of local builders; and other logistical' difficulties.
1.25   As a result of the above conditions, many of the facilities constructed
are of poor quality (para. 4.1) and unsuitable for the specific educational
requirements. The lesson here Is that If design and implementation of a follow-
on project will be under the same arrangement, then the FCU and PlUs must
have capable technical personnel to provide the expertise needed for all phases
of the development and construction of physical facilities. On the other hand,
consideration could be given to engaging the services of a construction firm to
manage all civil works, In view of the large size of the follow-on project.

Imortance of Evaluation
1.26   The importance of evaluation in an experimental project cannot be over
emphaslzed. In this respect, the mid-stream evaluatlon of the programme was
timely and proved to have been the greatest contribution to the success of the
project In that the Bank's consultant redesigned the project and focussed upon its
needs in the light of what actually happened as the project unfolded, rather than
upon the technical aspects of data collectlon.  Close and careful project
monitoring throughout the life of the project Is very important and provides
opportunities for maklng appropriate and tlmely adjustments by focusing upon
and lmprovir.g the inputs that have potentials for greater cost-effectiveness.
Use of Consultants
1.27   The implementation of an ongolng research prvject was new to the FCU
and a challenge to those who were Involved wlth It. Therefore, the strengthening
of the research capacity of the FCU through the use of local and international
expert services proved useful, desplte problems encountered. It is evident that a
balanced team of expatriate and national speclalist services enhances the
success of a project, and greatly contrlbutes to institutional building of
permanent expertise for future use.  There is also an acute need for the
appointed foreign consultants to work closely with nationals with the view to
ensuring that the latter are capable of taking over a follow-on project.
Importance of Linkaes
1.28   More attention needs to be given to the linkages between all inputs of an
experimental project and its objectives: physical facillties, staff improvement,
and student social development with the view to producing the quality of citizens
needed for national development.

CHAPTER 1
THE PRO3ECT AND THE LOAN AGREEMENT
Socio-Economic Se§g1
2.1    The total populationl! of Pakistan was estimated in mid-1985 to be 96.2
million as against 69 million (1975) estimate at the time of Appraisal in 1979.
Total area is 803,943 square kilometers with a population density of 104 per km2,
with about 75 per cent unskilled and living In rural areas. Annual growth rate is
about 3 per cent, and total labour force number is 28.6 million.
2.2    Pakistan is divided administratively Into four provinces: the Punjab, the
Sind, the North West Frontier, and Baluchitan - plus the state of Azad Kashmir
and several centrally administered tribal areas located in the north-west.
2.3    The national language, Urdu, is spoken by about 10 per cent of the
population; this has led to complications in communication and education.
Punjabi and Sindhi are spoken by 65 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, and
the other 14 per cent of the population communicate in more than ten other
languages. English iS widely used for commercial, legal and other official
purposes.
2.4    The literacy rate in 1981 was estimated at 26.2 per cent: the rurai areas
26.2% for males and 7.3% for females as compared to 53.3% for males in urban
areas and 37.3% for females/.
2.5    The Gross National Product (GNP) in 1982/83 was US$31.50 billion with
an annual growth rate of 7.3 per cent. GNP per capita in 1983 was US$390,
compared with US$137 in 1975, at constant prices.
Education Develot and Stlat     saues
2.6    The major issues in Primary Education at Appraisal were (a) unequal
opportunity, (b) wastage, (c) low quality and (d) high costs. The causes of these
issues involved multiple economic, social and educational factors which were
interrelated. Economically, parents couldn't afford the cost of textbooks and
other related costs; soclo-culturally, there was a lack of parental support for
primary education - especially for girls; educationally, low quality stemmed
partly from a lack of teachers in rural areas and Inadequate supplies of teaching
materials, among other limitations. Since the causes were complex, a complex
strategy to overcome them had to be developed by the Government, while also
bearing in mind the local conditions of the geographical divisions of the country.

2.7    The detailed proposed complex strategies to address the above four
issues are given In Annex 1. In order to keep this experimental project to a
manageable size, only certain inputs (included under project components) were
selected from the strategies. The purpose of these strategies was to Improve
and expand primary education without creating expenditures that could not be
met by the federal and provincial autihorities.
Origin of the Project
2.8    This project was originally identified and prepared by the Government of
Pakistan and USAID in 1977, but was later transferred in a partially developed
status to IDA in April 1?78, following a reduction in USAID activities in
Pakistan. The IDA pre-appraisal mission was sent in March and an Appraisal
follow-up mission in November 1978. Negotiations were held in February 1979,
Board approval was In March 1979 and the project became effective on 23
October 1979. The estimated total cost of the project was US$17 million of
which US$10 was covered by the Bank Credit.
Description of the Proiect
ObLecives
2.9    As specified in the Appraisal Report, the project was experimental (first
phase) with the aim to determine the best way of overcoming the major problems
in primary education in Pakistan, particularly unequal opportunity, wastage, low
quality and high costs, and therefore pursued four major objectives:
-      Increased access to primary schools especially for girls and for
rural poverty groups;
-     Reduced wastage principally by reducing dropout and rep *tition;
-      Improved quality of instruction to attain higher and more lasting
pupil achievemert; and
-      Reduced costs by reducing wastage inherent In dropout,
introducing lower cost teachers, and moving towards larger class
and school sizes.
Cantent. Scope and 5eque
2.10   In order to attain the above stated objectives, the project provided
assistance to the central and provincial governments in four components to: (a)
strengthen the teacher service; (b) expand supervision; (c) improve instructional
materials; and (d) provide physical facilities. The experiment covered 26 school
districts, including some 4,000 schools (Annex 2), 9,900 existing teachers, 340
assistant teachers and was divided into three stages within the five-year period
1979/1980 - 1984/1985.

Project Components
Teacher Service
2.11   The project attempted to strengthen the teacher sevvice by adding a new
category of assistant teacher and providing a new pattern oi in-service teacher
training considered most crucial to achieving project objectives.
2.12   Assistant Teachers were to be recruited from among unemployed persons
who lived in the rural areas, had the equivalent of an 8-grade education, and
could teach in or near their homes, thereby not requiring special housing, and
also costing less in salary.
2.13   In-Service  Teacher Training  involved  two  major improvements:
(a) pattern: more frequent training and (b) content: more attention to teachlng
methods, classroom management and parent and community relations. The
distribution of these two categories of teachers among the provinces was as
follows:
Table 2.1
Numbers of Teachers
Punjab   Sind         Baluchistan    NWFP   TotalFemale
Existing
Teachers      4,500   1,200            1,200       3,000   9,900  31

Teachers        100    100              100           40    340  56
2.14   Due to the inadequacy of the pre- and in-service teacher training
programme at the time of appraisal, the following new pattern of training was
proposed during the four project years:
(a)    AnnuaUly: Each teacher and assistant teacher would receive 2-3
weeks each year of intensive resident training on general topics,
conducted by project trainers;
(b)    Alternative Months: Each teacher and assistant teacher would
receive 2-3 days of training on common teaching problems
organized by locally based supervisors.
2.15   The training content was to include subjects important to learning but
which were being neglected in the then existing pre-service training, includ}ng:
(a) practical methods of teaching each major subject; (b) understanding of the
ways children learn; (c) effective management of multigrade class s; (d) parent
and community reJationships; and (e) ways to adapt the curriculum to the social
and physical environment of the pupil. The training was tr include ways to
instruct without resorting to harsh discipline and ways to dr;al effectively with
parents and community leaders.



- 12 -
Supervision
2.16   This component was considered the second most important In the
project, next to teacher training, At Appraisal, supervision for primary schools
below the district level was considered inadequate resulting in low teacher
morale and performance and a high level of abstenteeism. Therefore the project
created two new lower level posts: supervisor and learning coordinator.
Consequently, these two new posts coupled with the positlon of assistant teacher
created a five-step career ladder in primary education: assistant teacher,
teacher, headmaster, learning coordinator and supervisor.  A  total of 51
supervisors and 466 learning coordinators were to be appointed and trained In
counselling techniques, personnel leadership, teacher in-service training and
parent -.d community relationships w fh ratios of new supervisor staff to schools
varying as an experimental input as sh, n below:

Instrucional Materials and Curricula
2.17   The project provided financing for textbooks, teachers' guides, library
books, and school and classroom equipment for project schools as follows
Books: (for all provinces)                     Apgroximate Number

This component also included technical assistance and training to develop new
and additional materials for trial in schools. It was envisaged that attention
would also be given to modification of curricula in accord with local and
provincial needs and culture.
Physical Facilities
2.18   According to the Appraisal Report, the project financed construction and
furniture for classrooms, residences for female teachers, and small resource
centres for in-service teacher education, as follows:

2.19   Most classroom  construction was to be additions to existing schools
rather than creation of new schools to achieve larger school size. These project
facilities were to vary within each province to permit testing of enrollment,
dropout and learning achievements under different conditions. The general
impact of the construction component was to be assessed by the effect of
improved facilities on pupil enrollment, retention and achievement; on teacher
attendance, performance and job satisfaction; and on community pride in schools
under the experimentation programme.



- 14 -
Staff Development and Research
2.20   Training.    At appraisal it was believed  that the  successful
implementation of the four project components described above would depend
largely on training received by project personnel.  Therefore an extensive
training programme was developed to cover eight categories of personnel
numbering some II 1130 of which 3,478 would be females (Annex 3).
Training Method and Duration
2.21   The training programme as designed comprised three segments: "A"
Level for training about 40 selected persons overseas; suitable composition of
this group was deemed critical to the success of the training and therefore to the
project. "B" Level of about 260 persons at provincial and district levels for local
training, and about 11,000 "C" Level teachers at district and below levels
(Annex 4) to be trained in two stages - Cl and C2.
Experimentation and Evaluation
2.22   The central purpose of the project was experimentation into the
contribution of selected inputs to achievement of project objectives.  Of
particular importance were solutions to persistent problems in primary education
in five areas: recruitment and retention of female teachers in rural areas;
teacher absenteeism; teaching effectiveness; school, parent and community
relations; and recurrent costs. The project permitted experimentation in each of
these areas to answer the following five questions:
(a)    whether (i) provision  of female  teacher residences, and
(ii) establishment of assistant teachers car, aid recruitment of
female teachers;
(b)    whether increased training of teachers results in improved pupil
achievement;
(c)    whether improved supervision reduces teacher absenteeism;
(d)    whether increased contact between parents and teachers results
in greater enrollment and less dropout (especially of girls); and
(e)    whether per student costs can be reduced through use of teacher
assistants and movement toward larger class and school sizes.
2.23   The project was divided into three periods:
(a)    Preparatory. A period of about 20 months devoted primarily to
selection and training of personnel, construction of physical
facilities, and design of experiments.
(b)    Experimental School Years.  Three school years beginning in
March of 1981, 1982 and 1983 in which the impact of the project
components would be measured and evaluated.



- 15-
(c)    Analysis of Results. A follow-up period of six to nine months in
which final experimental results would be analyzed and
conclusions reached.
Amendments
2.24   The following amendments to the Credit Agreement (dated 18 April
1979) were confirmed on II January 1982 by the World Bank:
1.    Schedule I
Categories (5) and (6) to the table of paragraph 1 shall read as follows:
"(5)   Training                             1,500,000     90%
(6)   Salaries under Part A, allowances
under Parts A and B of the Project and
operating costs under Part E of the
Project                              2,800,000      90%"
2.    Schedule 3
The aggregate expenditures for items procured in accordance with Part C,
paragraph 4 to Schedule 3, shall not exceed the equivalent of US$500,000.
Covenants of the Credit Agreement
2.25   In general, the Government fulfilled the conditions of the Credit
Agreement, with some delays and difficulties (Annex 16).

CHAPTER Mli
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.1    Each province formed a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), drawn from
Ministerial staff. The four PIUs were coordinated by the Federal Coordinating
Unit (FCU) based in the Ministry of Education In Islamabad. The PIUs continue
to be in operation. Implementation of the building programmes was effected by
the Political Councils In the Punjab and Baluchistan, the Public Works
Department (PDW) in NWFP and a civil works unit established within the
Ministry of Education in the Sind. Implementation of civil works was divorced
from the activities of the FCU and the PlUs. They all lacked the services of
technical staff members.
Credit Effectiveness
3.2    The Credit Agreement was signed on 18 April 1979 and declared
effective on 23 October 1979.
PEoiect Management
3.3    The establishment of a competent managerial group for the project was
a formidable problem which was not completely solved during project
implementation. In this connection, there have been considerable changes in
Project Directors (PD) in the various PIUs (e.g. In the Punjab, PDs changed seven
times, in the Sind three times, with a new appointment in NWFP, while in
Baluchistan the position has been vacant since before July 198S). The position of
Deputy Chief of the FCU changed twice during 1983. The duties of Chief of the
FCU include those associated with the project as well as a number of other
projects, and activities outside the FCU. PIU directors were also assigned
additional responsibilities (e.g. the PIU Punjab was entrusted with tne
management of Mosque Schools, taking up some 80 per cent of the PD's time in
1983).
3.4    Frequent changes in senior management staff resulted in a lack of
continuity of management and long-term planning, while major staffing gaps in
the FCU meant that only limited support was given to the PIUs in the field. The
latter was significant in the management structure implementation (Annex 5)
where the District Education Officer (DEO) had over-riding influence in the
field. The lack of long-term planning was also expressed In a slackened project
activity between 1984 and 198S as the project was nearing completion.
3.5    On completion of the project there were no architectural plans of
classrooms, residences or other facilities available from the Punjab and
Baluchistan (although a full set of plans were made available in the Sind and
there were also plans of standard classrooms and residences in NWFP). Moreover,
there is no comprehensive record in the FCU nor in any of the PIUs, of project
schools, number of existing classrooms and additions, areas of buildings and sites
enrolment, etc. Record keeping, an essential aspect of administration, is almost
totally absent.



- 17 -
Technical Assistance
3.6    Technical Assistance  (consultant services) for physical facilities
(para. 4.21) was not used. The Appraisal Report estimated TA for two other
project elements:  (a) planning   and organizing  of training, and (b)
experimentation and evaluation. Altogether the technical asistance iricluded: (a)
about 12 man-years of expatriate services and (b) about 50 man-years of local
consultant services. However, the Credit Agreement provided for about 12 man-
years of consultant services in general, out of which about 3.2 man-years of
expatriate consultant services and 4 man-years of local consultant services,
recruited by the FCU, were used.
Proj     p menation
Teacher Service
3.7   "A" Level. A group of 35 "A" Level trainees were sent to five foreign
countries to observe and learn a wide range of approaches in various fields of
education for a 3-month period. They were divided into four sections and each
section made a 2 to 3 day study tour in a third-world country, followed by a
training programme in a developed one. These persons were expected to serve as
key personnel (master teachers) for conducting the training programme at the
national level to "B" Level trainees. Thei6- province-wise distribution and areas
and places of studies are given in Annex 6, page 1.
3.8   "B" Level.  A total of 373 district education officers, sub-district
education officers, supervisors and instructors of Primary Teacher Training
Institutes were trained for three weeks by some of the "tA" Level master
teachers at four locations in the teaching of maths, science and social studies,
and educational management. According to the project proposal, participants
were to be drawn only from the rank of existing primary teacher training
Institutions, but the training authorities decided to include some secondary
school teachers. This was the only training course given and therefore a very
wide area of subject matter was attempted in each subject, at the expense of
quality. Moreover, teaching was done mostly by teacher-centered lecture
method in the absence of reading materials and self-study and self-preparation
by the participants. The Innovative and problem-solving approaches envisaged at
Appraisal were not attempted. The distribution of participants by province and
sex is given in Annex 6, page 2.
3.9   "C" Level. The "B" Level trainees trained this group of teachers. The
low quality of training received as described under B filtered down to the "C"
Level teachers. There were 3 phases of training (1981, 1982 and 1983) attended
by the same teachers, but the courses did not vary In content nor method. A
total of 10,475 teachers were trained within a 3-week period in each of the three
years (Annex 6, page 2). In many cases the administrators of the training
institutions were unaware of the nature of the training programme taking place
at their institutions and therefore were unable to provide useful guidance and
monitoring. Unfortunately, most of the training content spelled out at Appraisal
(para. 2.15) was not included in the programme (except in NWFP) and therefore
the teachers were not properly qualified for the experimental nature of the
project; quality seemed to have been lacking even in the training given.



- 18 -
Supervision
3.10   Although the Appraisal Report allocated 13 supervisors for NWFP, at the
negotiations it was decided to eliminate them due to the fact that the
supervisory system was considered already efficient. Originally Baluchistan was
not given supervisors as part of the experiment. This meant 30 for the Punjab
and. 8 for the Sind, giving a total of 38 rather than 51. The relationships among
schools, supervisors, and Learning Coordinators, by sex and province, are given in
Table 2.2 (para. 2.16).
3.11   Supervisors: Supervisors were responsible for the overall professional
development of LCs and primary teachers. They visited about two schools a day
each month and consulted with LCs and headmistresses regarding academic
problems. They also visited parents and encouraged mothers to send their
children (especially girls) to school and solicited community participation in and
contribution to school development. Supervisors also conducted a monthly one-
day (2 - 3 hours) workshop for LCs during which problems encountered were
discussed and possible solutions were suggested. These meetings were held at
Central Schoolsi/ in the Punjab and at Resource Centers in the Sind. Supervisors
also up-graded assistant teachers, although not on the 2 - 3 day alternate
monthly schedule as foreseen at Appraisal (para. 2.14). Monthly reports were
sent to the DEOs for submission to the PIUs.
3.12   Learning Coordinators: Learning coordinators were directly responsible
for the professional improvement of primary teachers. Each LC therefore
visited a school at least once a week during which they observed teachers In
action in the classrooms, inspected lesson plans, observed the use of teaching
materials, and held post observation meetings with teachers and pointed out
their strengths and weaknesses; at time_ they taught a class as a demonstration
of good teaching. Their daily observations were recorded and sent to the
Supervisor who in turn sent them to the DEO for monthly transmission to the
PlUs. There was no evidence that PlUs acted upon recommendations made by
the LCs. A review of the outlines of some teachers' lesson plans and reports of
the LCs by the mission showed that they were professionally comprehensive,
although the latter could be significantly improved by being categorized and
using a three-scale rating format instead of the present "yes" and "no" answer,
thus providing for comparison among teachers' performances.
3.13   The mission was informed that the LCs also checked teachers' and
childrens' attendance and punctuality, encouraged parents to send their children
to school (especially girls), and persuaded communities to become involved in the
development and support of their schools. The degree of success in these
endeavors varied.
3.14   However, certain constraints adversely affected the performance of
Supervisors and LCs: (i) arrival of transport facilities one year after the
appointment and training these personnel (para.4.6); (ii) insufficient per diem and
its late payment; (iii) wide distribution of schools in Baluchistan; (iv) shortage of
15 female LCs in Baluchistan; (v) too many schools to cover in NWFP; (vi) their
teaching at schools without assigned teachers and becoming substitute teachers
when regular teachers were absent; and (vii) deprivation of vehicles to female
Supervisors in the Punjab (para. 4.7).
1/    A Centre School is a school where the project added one or more
classrooms and is centrally located thereby making it convenient for
teachers to assemble.



- 19 -
3.15   The training of Supervisors and LCs needs much upgrading; a clearer
understanding of their role supported by appropriate job descriptions and
guidelines should remove all conflicts and signs of hostility between them and
the traditional supervisory staff and enable the project Supervisory group to
make a more significant contribution to the professional development of
teachers who in turn would raise the standard of education for the children who
are the real beneficiaries of the programme.
Insrtional Materials and Curricula
3.16   Educational materials were purchased off the shelf and distributed as
stipulated, but in Baluchistan, apart from textbooks, there was a shortage of
classroom materials such as slates, takhti,l/ and pens, ink, and inkpots. In the
NWFP maps and educational charts were specially prepared relating to the
curriculum.  This is the only evidence of some compliance with appraisal
expectations (para. 2.17).
3.17   With the exception of duplicating machines and slide projectors, all the
equipment was reported to have been used. The shortage of the proper type and
quantity of paper and the lack of slides, limited the use of these two pieces of
equipment.
3.18   In addition to the above supplies, agricultural kits, sport kits, flower
seeds and pots were provided to all project schools. The mission saw some of
these items and how they had been used properly. A typical list of materials and
equipment is given in Annex 7.
Experimentation and Evaluation
3.19   The implementation of the first cycle of the evaluation studies was
carried out as scientific research studies until mid-1981. This approach was
changed to prescriptive diagnostic studies in September 1981 upon the advice of
the Bank's evaluator-consultant who identified the inadequacies of the research
design and pointed out that the former approach would not provide the kinds of
information that were necessary for an action-oriented proposal as was required
under the Development Credit Agreement (Section 3.09 (d)).
3.20  The Experimental Studies had major weaknesses as shown in Annex 8
and summarized here: (a) achievement studies did not incorporate control
schools;  (b) attitudinal studies were not appropriate to the predominantly
illiterate rural area of Pakistan; (c) demographlc studies were over-ambitious
and required information which did not relate to the project; and (d) qualitative
studies were inappropriate necessitating the training of researchers for
illuminative studies (Annex 9).
3.21   Consequently, the research component was strengthened and redlrected
by the addition of a local senior educational planner and an experienced
expatriate methodologist, both becoming responsible for the work. Appropriate
workshops for training field researchers were held, mechanisms for carrying out
1/    Rush mats spread on the floor for sitting on instead of chairs or benches
(para. 4.9).



- 20 -
interprovincial studies were established, and research cells were created in each
provincial PIU. These activities delayed implementation and therefore reduced
the effective experimental period from three years (1981 to 1983) to about one
prior to drafting the Comprehensive Report, the basis for the proposal for the
follow-on project. Even within this limited span of time, project activities
declined because personnel (LCs especially) became preoccupied with collecting
other data required for the drafting of the follow-on proposal, just about mid-
way through the experimentation period.

CHAPTER IV
PHYSICAL INIPLEMENTATION
Civil Works
4.1    The civil works component totalled 1,000 classrooms, 280 teachers'
residences and 10 in-service training centres and absorbed just over fifty per
cent of the Credit. Nevertheless, the design was defective and implementation
was inefficient.  The final impact was general dissatisfaction with the
constructed facilities by all concerned, including PIUs* government officers and
education staff.
Design
4.2    The design of civil works was overambitious for rural Pakistan and
therefore had major defects which adversely affected project implementation
and outcomes. These defects included: (i) a lack of ft " consideration of cultural
and traditional constraints; (iJ) widely scattered sL Jol sites in remote and
inaccessible locations; (iii) low base cost estimates; (iv) over-provision of
physical inputs; and (v) a lack of consideration given to the condition of existing
facilities.
4a3    Consequently, these short-comings necessitated retendering on about 80
sites in the Sind Province, price renegotiation with contractors in NWFP, and a
general reduction of the Civil Works Programme. All of these and other
constraining elements should be carefully considered in the design of a follow-on
project.
Implementation
4.4   Implementation was characterized by formidable problems, some of
which were not fully overcome. The two major problems were technical and
financial.
4.5    The technical problems were due to the fact that the FCU and the PIUs
did not have any technical personnel and therefore delegated all responsibilities,
funds, and authority to other technical agencies in the respective provinces.
Therefore PlUs did not exercise aniy practical control over planning, design,
supervision of construction nor quality of construction, or certification of
physical facilities, with the exception of Sind where design and implementation
were undertaken by a physical works unit in the Ministry of Education, although,
again, the PIU was not directly involved. These operations were carried out
inefficiently by technical divisions in each province as explained in paragraph
4.14. Even the Bank did not initiate any corrective measures in this respect until
near completion of the physical works when a consultant-architect was included
in the supervision mission. Consequently, inadequate supervision of construction
resulted in buildings with serious cracks in walls in the Punjab; exposure of
reinforcement steel bars through the concrete slabs in ceilings in NWFP; leaking
classroom roofs and verandas in Baluchistan, and inappropriate building
orientation in the Sind.



- 22 -
4.6   In general, buildings vary in design and quality of construction and
include defects such as poor ventilation, badly fitting doors and windows, and
poorly executed finishes, all leading to accelerated maintenance problems for
the communities.
4.7    Financial problems stemmed from two causes. Firstly, the Government
PC-1 form did not always provide sufficient funds and sometimes allocated funds
were released later than expected. Secondly, delays in funding and technical
implementation problems led to cost overruns due to inflation. In Baluchistan
one in-service training centre was not built due to lack of funds.
Sites
4.8    Criteria for the selection of project schools were detveloped during
appraisal, utilizing school mapping procedure.%  Further refinements were
carried out to determine intra-provincial classroom distribution. However, the
criteria for selecting project schooLs and sites for new classroom provision took
little account of the conditions of existing facilities and infrastructure
(para. 4.2). Moreover, although classroom units were standardized In the
Appraisal, in reality a wide range of combinations were created (e.g. In the Sind,
existing schools with various numbers of classrooms received units from one to
four new classrooms; in other provinces, new classrooms were provided on school
sites where no buildings existed before). Therefore, it has been difficult to
gauge accurately the impact of classroom provision on enrolment and
achievement.
Architectural Deslin Studies
4.9    According to the Appraisal Report, the Government was to prepare
several experimental, low-cost designs for the project (some with Unesco
assistance) and there were plans for constructing pilot project schools based on
these designs. Although the Appraisal Report recognized the limitations in these
designs (e.g. of necessity most constructions were to be minor extensions,
dictated by existing schools) it recommended the FCU to request Unesco's
regional office personnel from Bangkok to assist in further developing the
experimental designs. Use was also to be made of local design consultants and
funds were allocated. Unfortunately, none of the above proposed measures were
pursued.
4.10   In reality, each PWD (and in the case of the Sind, the construction unit In
the MOE), modified existing plans for project implementation and no account
was taken of available guidelines (such as Unesco's). No attempt was made by
the PIUs to set out a formal briefing exercise, or user requirement study, or
standard of acceptability. Moreover, an architectural analysis, specific to the
conditions in each Province would have assisted in developing appropriate
standards. Consequently, an opportuntity was missed in introducing innovation,
particularly in classroom design, appropriate to the experimental nature of the
rest of the project.
Architecttral Desig
4.11   There is evidence of inappropriate planning, bad design and orientation,
leading to ventilation and heating problems (e.g. in the Sind twin residential
quarters  alternate  north  and  south).   Project classroom  sizes  vary



- 23 -
from 300 sq. ft. to S00 sq. ft. (gross) and buildings differ in architectural design
and quality of construction, with apparant deterioration due to lack of
maintenance. The low standard of provision of facilities for primary schools in
Pakistan (until recently) has created an acceptance of substandard teaching
accommodation by the FCU and PlUs. Female teacher residences were not
popular, partly due to bad design, particularly in the Sind, where out of the 50
residences provided, 26 remain vacant.
Corstruction
4.12   The limited number of Project buildings visited by the Mission ranged in
construction quality and materials from below average to average, compared to
existing schools. The highest levels of construction were found in the Sind, then
in the Punjab and NWFP. The poorest quality of construction was found in
Baluchistan (see Appendix).
4.13   Some schools were constructed In places where water and electricity
were available, but were not connected, either due to inadequate budget
allocations, or bad management and coordination. None of the project buildings
visited by the Completion Mission (with the exception of one residential property
In Baluchistan, near Quetta) had provided a pit latrine in any of the toilet rooms
facilities allocated.
4.14   Considerable delays occurred during implementation resulting in time
overrun by 17 months. Delays in the cc struction programme were due to a
number of reasons. In NWFP, delays were due to the inaccessibility of schools in
some areas (e.g. Abbottabad Tahsil) and price renegotiations with contractors.
There were also delays to boundary wall construction due to cost overruns which
absorbed the whole budget allocation in 1981. Although there were excessive
increases in materials costs between 1978 - 1980, the Civil Works Department
did not recognize any requests for unit cost price increases (in 1981 increases
had risen to 65 per cent of 1979 figures). In the Punjab, civil works delays were
due to late release of provincial funds in the fiscal year (i.e. 24 November 1980,
instead of I July 1980).  In the Sind retendering was necessary because
contractors failed to demonstrate a desire to undertake the work (due to high
costs in remote locations), resulting In delays of up to 12 months. The civil
works in Baluchistan was completed within the limit of available funds, except
for one in-service training centre which was not started due to the lack of funds.
Furniture and Equigmt
4.15   The PlUs followed local procurement procedures for furniture and
equipment. Some changes were made to the furniture lists to suit local
conditions (e.g. In the Sind where climate can be damp and where traditionally
teaching is not carried out in the open, simple benches have been used In place of
rush mats). The rush mats used for pupils to sit on were regularly utilised in the
three other provinces, although many did not last the project period.
4.16   The procurement of vehicles and motorcycles, through ICB, was carried
out unsatisfactorily, with unnecessary delays due to cash flow problems and
bureaucratic hindrance. Consequently the vehicles did not arrive until October
1982, although the female Learning Co':rdinators (for whose use they were
purchased) were appointed in 1981.



- 24 -
4.17   The project vehicles have been useful in transporting female supervisors
and learning coordinators. The transport arrangements worked well in NWFP and
the Sind, but were seriously hampered in Baluchistan and the Punjab mainly due
to bureaucratic interventions. In one district in Baluchistan, the female learning
coordinators were not provided with free access to project jeeps. In the Punjab,
6 of the vehicles provided continue to be employed in non-project work. The
Divisional Directors of Education have taken over 2 of the 10 jeeps and others
have been taken by the Deputy Commissioner and Education Department. In
addition, two motor-cycles have been taken over by the Secretariat. Although
these represent only 3 per cent of a total 167 vehicles, the transfer of project
vehicles to non-project work in the Punjab has severely curtailed the mobility of
female supervision staff In at least 4 project districts.
Maintenance of Facilities
4.18   The maintenance of school buildings falls under four categories. One
deals with minor repairs, such as replacing broken window panes; another deals
with annual repairs, such as painting and decorating; another still deals with
minor works such as addition or alteration to building structures not exceeding
PRs 50,000; there are also special repairs as for roofs and other structural
defects. In reality only the last category receives some attention, with the
result that the physical facilities provided for the project have deteriorated
since construction in 1982/83, particularly, the female residences where neglect
is immediately apparent.
4.19   In some cases, minor repairs to school buildings have been undertaken by
the communities. In general, however, those sites situated within village
communities (or where schools are directly linked to female residences) are
better utilized and maintained. Conversely, isolated school sites and female
residences are neglected and poorly maintained.
4.20   There are no facilities for repairing rush mats and these have
deteriorated rapidly. More significantly, field staff are dissatisfied with the
mounting repair and maintenance bills of motor cycles and vans and PIUs have
difficulties in meeting costs. There is also a lack of local mechanics with
experience in servicing the particular makes of vehicles and the unavailability of
spare parts locally worsens the situation.
Technical Assistance
4.21   As stated in paragraph 3.6 no consultant services (technical assistance)
was used for physical facilities. For other aspects of the project, in general,
technical assistance was carried out unsatisfactorily and only about half of the
12 man-years was utilized. The initial contract for about 9 man-years was
cancelled due to: (i) conflicts over the nature of the contract; (ii) lack of clarity
about the actual needs for TA; (lii) late arrival of some consultants most of
whom had not been sufficiently briefed about the project; and (iv) dissatisfaction
by GOP with the initial output of some of the consultants. However, one
expatriate evaluator has been at the FCU under contract with Unesco as the
executing agency since September 1982 up to the time of the CM, after several
three-month extensions by the government. The two local evaluation specialists
provided 4 man-years of services. but were not retained throughout the life of
the project, even though funds were available. Theref,ore their expertise has
been



- 25 -
lost for the follow-on project. With hindsight, It appears that the quality of the
outputs of the various studies of the experiment would have been higher had
expatriate and local technical assistance been used throughout the life of the
project (para. 3.21). Close monitoring, supervisior, and guidance would have been
given to the researchers in data analysis and interpretation, two major
weaknesses of Cell Researchers.
World Bank Performance
4.22   During the five years of project execution, there were 10 supervision
missions. In spite of acute difficulties, the Bank's interventions in sustairing
momentum in this experimrental project in primary education was particuiti-ly
appropriate. However, due to the wide dispersion of the school sites, it became
difficult to supervise all aspects of the project.
4.23   In May 1979, the first supervision mission incl'zded an architect. The
mission listed 22 activities (including civil works) to be completed prior to the
next mission in September 1979, and recommended that an architect be included
on the mission. Although it was later known that the provision of civil works was
divorced from the activities of the FCU and PlUs, it was not until September
1982 that the Bank mission included an architect-consultant. By this time, most
of the civil works had been completed and there were few opportunities for
proposing basic improvements.
4.24   Through the Bank's intervention the conflict over the TA contract was
resolved and a new contract was agreed upon; unfortunately, it was later
rescinded.
4.25   At the early stage of implementation the Bank identified the weaknesses
in project management including vacant posts and urged GOP to complete
appointments and PIUs to improve their efficiency, but to no avail.
4.26   Although it identified weaknesses in the system for data collection and
project monitoring, the Bank couldn't exert sufficient pressure upon GOP to take
immediate corrective actions. The Bank should have been firmer in demanding
Audit Reportsl/, (that of the Punjab had not been accepted by the Bank at the
time of the Completion Mission).
4.27   In September 1981 the Ba,.k sent a consultant-evaluator upon whose
recommendatioiu the approach of the evaluation studies was changed from a
theoretical scientific research to a prescriptive one which provided the kinds of
information needed for an action-oriented proposal. Had this mission been
undertaken earlier, the research studies would have covered a longer period of
time and findings might have been more meaningful. In brief, formative
evaluation, a critical aspect of any experimental project, appeared absent or
inadequate before September 1981, mid-way through the experiment.
I/    In its 1982 September Supervision Report, Lhe mission said: "Since the
lack of project audit is a common probJem in Pakistan, senior
management may wish to make a general approach to the authorities
with a view to improving the audit situation". There was no evidence
that any action was taken in this respect.
aff_SNIMMM



- 26 -
4.28   The above change in approach required an experienced evaluator and In
1982 the Bank approved the recruitment of o.le with Unesco as the executing
agency, after the incumbent had made a study of the situation In Pakistan with
appropriate recommendations. This action provided guidance and directlon to
the research and evaluation aspects of the project, thereby producing useful
information for solutions to some of the fundamental problems of primary
education in Pakistan. This information, although tentative, was used as the
basis and justification for the proposal of the follow-on project (Phase II).

CHAPTER V
PRO3ECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Costs and Financing
5.1     A comparison of appraisal estimates and actual capitai costs for physical
facilities, furniture, equipment, professional services and technical assistance in
US dollars is shown In Annex 11. Total estimated cost for the project Including
contingencies and excluding taxes at appraisal were US$17.2 million or the
equivalent of PRs 170.3 million. The Bank's financing of US$10 million was
expected to cover 58 per cent of the total estimated costs including
contingencies. As implemented, the final cost of the project was US$11.7
million (PRs 154.68 million), about 9 per cent lower than the appraisal estimate
in local currency and 32 per cent lower in US dollars. The Bank, therefore,
financed 60 per cent of the actual costs with the Government covering the
remaindet.
5.2     A  detailed  comparison  of appraisal estimates and  actual costs by
categories and items expressed in local currency and in US dollars is shown in the

5.3    As compared with appraisal estimates, including contingencies, three
categories (civil works, furniture and salaries) had cost overruns in terms of local
currency by 4.6 per cent, 15.0 per cent and 15.0 per cent, respectively. Project
accounts closed on 7 January 1986, although credit remained underspent by 30
per cent. This was due to (a) technical assistance, as a result of rescinding a
contract worth US$1.35 million; (b) salaries underspent by US$0.89 million; (c)
unallocated funds of US$0.5 million; (d) devaluation of the Pakistan Rupee from
9.9 to 15.6 over the project implementation period; and (el absence of adequate
provision to spend Credit funds in the ADP and PC-1 over about 18 months at the
end of project.
Areas and Cost per Student Place
5.4    Areas per student place appear to have decreased, although no reliable
figures were made available to the mission.  Based on observations and
discussions with local government officials, areas per student decreased by some
20 per cent. In Baluchistan the area per student corresponds to a reduction of 28
per cent in order to reduce costs. In terms of local currency there is a cost
reduction per square foot for each province except for NWFP. Details on the
above are provided in Annex 13.
Disbursement
5.. ~ Final disbursement was made and the books closed on 7 January 1986.
US$7,036,237.83 were disbursed out of a Credit of US$10 million.  The
undisbursed balance of US$2,963,762.17 was cancelled, equivalent to about 30
per cent of the Credit. A comparison of the original estiriation and actual
disbursement of the Credit proceeds is shown in the key Project Data Table
(page (i)) and illustrated in the disbursement chart in Annex 14.

CHAPTER VI
PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOMES
Experimentation and Evaluation
6.1    Attainment of Project Objectives
The results of the Demographic and Achievement Studies of 1985
confirmed the findings of those studies undertaken in 1984 in regards to the
achievement of project objectives. This confirmation provides greater reliability
of outcomes. It can therefore be said with confidence that the project has
achieved its objectives in terms of increased enrolment, decrease in wastage,
reduced repetition, increased pupil-teacher ratios and achievement score, as
shown in the following table:
Project      Non-Project

Details of variation in outcomes among provinces are shown in the

project design, but the Government later decided that it would become a
part of the educational ladder, and therefore included it in the
experiment.

6.2    Answers to the Five Eperimental Questlons (para. 2.22) are as fo}lows
I.    In general the provision of female teacher residences did not
contribute significantly to the recruitment of female teachers. Socio cultural
factors were the chief constraints.  However, there was more success in
Baluchistan (where all residences were occupied by married couples, rather then
unmarried teachers) than in the other three provinces. On the other hand, the
establishment of assistant teachers made a major contribution to recruitment of
female teachers. These assistant teachers were from the local villages, and had
the confidence of the villagers and did not require separate housing (thus
reducing costs) and were paid less in salary.
ii.    According to the findings of Mr. Mubarak Shah's study on
"Management and Supervision" at the PIU in the North-West Frontier Province,
increased training of teachers by Supervisors and Learning Coordinators resulted
in improved teaching and consequently improved pupil achievement in project
schools, although low, but higher than in other schools.
ii.    Mr. Shah's study also showed that improved supervision by
Su'pervisors  and  Learning  Coordinators  reduced  significantly  teacher
absenteeism. A school was visited at least once a week as compared with once or
twice a year under the existing system. Teachers, therefore, attended school
regularly.  Some parents even became voluntary "watchdogs" for teachers'
attendance.
!v.    Increased contact between parents and teachers resulted in
greater enrolment and less drop-outs but the degree varied in provinces as much
depended upon the individual teacher. "Parent and Community Relations" was a
subject which was listed in the C-Level training content (para. 2.15) but was not
covered during training.  Learning Coordinators and Supervisors were also
effective in convincing parents to send their girls to school and let them remain
there. The mission was told that in some small schools enrolment increased by
100 per cent.
v.    Data to quantify that student costs had been reduced through the
use of assistant teachers were not available, but it can be assumed that costs
were reduced, because these teachers cost less in salary.L and required no
special housing. On the other hand, reducing costs by moving towards larger
class and school sizes is even more difficult to verify. This is because the
Project had assumed that the addition of classrooms to existing structures would
increase their capacity and cut the per student costs. In reality, many existing
classroom facilities at the beginning of the project were in acute disrepair or
unfit for use, and the existing infrastructure did not meet the needs of the then
current enrolment. It is obvious, therefore, that students would be transferred
to new facilities, even without pressure by additional enrolment. However, it
cannot be ruled out that new classrooms did attract more students and provided
for larger class size.
1/    According to information obtained from  the FCU, trained Primary
Teachers (PTCs) receive 700 Rupees monthly, whereas Assistant
Teachers receive a fixed salary of 300 Rupees.

Teachr Services
6.3    This component was considered the most important element in the
project.  Intensive and recurrent in-service training was to be provided
throughout the project period based on the hypothesis that more frequent and
more practical training would improve teaching effectiveness. Training was
provided at three levels: A, B, and C.  Unfortunately the outcome of this
component is far below expectation and points out the need for a radical change
in the programme structure including teacher trainers, monitoring during
training and follow-up. Each level had its peculiar problems.
A Level Problems:
6.4   (i) The 3S A level participantsl/ who studied abroad undertook a
programme which was not relevant to the particular problems faced in Pakistan.
(ii) Upon their return, most were non-available for training B and C level
trainees, especially in the Sind Province, where the group almost severed its
links with the programme after the Group B training. This situation was partly
due to the fact that the A level participants were attached to other institutions.
The situation was better in NWFP in that most of them were available for
training both groups.
B Level Problems:
6.5    The four problems which affected  this level of training were:
(i) improper identification of trainees. The initial project proposed that trainees
from existing primary teacher training Institutions be recruited for training.
however, some trainees were drawn from among secondary teachers; their
performance was unsatisfactory; (ii) course direction: too wide an area was
attempted within the three-week training period, due to the fact that there was
no second round of training for this group; (iiV traditional stereotype training:
there was little innovation in planning and design; and (iv) no development
sequence: since there was only one B course training, the recurrent training
which took place annually should have been built on each previous course, as a
supplement. This was not the case; the same original B course was in essence
repeated. This error dampened the enthusiam of the trainees and demonstrates
the lack of sufficient monitoring of the programme by the FCU and the PlUs.
C Level Problems:
6.6    The inadequencies of the first two level training programmes culminated
at this level in three aspects: (i Pedagogy and preparation (if any) were poor.
Master trainers (Group B) lectured to the trainees with very little reference to
teacher guides activities for trainees, and without any designed teaching,
learning package, as was the case at the B level. In fact four of the five subject
areas (para. 2.15) were omitted. This was the case especially In three provinces,
excluding NWFP which organized a more structured and relevant training
programme; (lV Lack of development from one phase to the other: The three-
phase training, although attended by the same teachers, provided no variation
40 estimated at Appraisal.

and therefore no sequential supplement to the previous course, and
(iii) inappropriate course direction. The heads of institutions where courses were
taught were not oriented to project and course purposes, therefore they were
unable to monitor the training programme and give valuable suggestions for
modification and improvement in organization and conduct.
6.7   In regards to meeting the target number of trainees, the actual numbers
of teachers and assistant teachers trained at the C level surpassed the Appraisal
Estimate by about 4 per cent with variations among provinces, as shown in the
table below. More new schools were opened in Baluchistan and therefore they
trained the new teachers. On the other hand, they did not need four assistant
teachers, because of the low density of students. However, as has been indicated
above, the content and quality of training did not attain the level expected. The
records do not distinguish between males and females teachers which were
expected to be 31% of existing teachers and 56% of assistant teachers.

Supervision
6.8    This component was considered the second most important element in
the project, next to teacher training. The success of the experiment with
project Supervisors and Learning Coordinators is far beyond the expectation of
everyone. Although there is yet much room for improvement, close supervision
promises to be an answer to what the schools, the teachers, and the children
need and should become an integral part of the professional ladder.
6.9    Based upon the research on "Management and Supervision" at the PIU of
the NWFP by Professor M. Shah, and confirmed by the mission's findings in the
field, it can be said that close supervision: (i reduced significantly teacher
absenteeism; (ii) catered in part for teacher absence or for teacherless schools;
(iii) increased the professional profile and aspirations of the primary teachers;
(iv) provided a better communication network from management to school;
(v) divorced professional advice from administrative authority; (vi) ensured a
facility for teachers to share their problems; (vii) provided in some cases



- 33 -
improved models of teaching in classroom; (viii) occasionally generated
community interventionh/ and support for the school; (ix) increased enrolment in
some schools with a range from 10 per cent in small schools to 50 per cent in
medium sized schools and reduced drop-out; and (x) established firmly a two step
supervisory ladder below the district level in primary education as shown below:

Assistant Education Officer        Assistant Education Officer

Of the 466 LCs envisaged at Appraisal 451 were trained; Baluchistan could not
find 15 suitable candidates of the 23 females allocated to it.
6.10   In his Illuminative Study2/ in 1983, Professor H. Shah interviewed 56
primary teachers in the Urdu language in order to ensure clear communication.
The 25 questions related to the impact of Learning Coordinators upon primary
education, as seen by the teachers. The evaluation of their responses showed
that most of the teachers had seen positive results from the work of the LCs, as
indicated In the table below:

The response of departmental supervisors (non project) was also over 85 per cent
positive.

the attendance of teachers; funds were also provided in some
communities for items such as fans and hand pumps.

6.11   Despite these overall successes, supervision requires much more
improvement and development so as to maximize its alreedy positive impact
upon primary education in Pakistan. The outcomes must be interpreted with a
degree of caution since there are a number of variables not specifically
accounted for such as the low-level performance by some LCs and early negative
reactions of some teachers.
6.12   Furthermore, there is no study which compared the outcomes of the
relationships with ratios of new supervisory staff to schools as given In para 2.16
and Table 2.2. Questions as to which input mix was more successful and why;
which level of input should be adapted in the future, and what were the
limitations of the less successful combinations are left unattended.
6.13   It is observed that in the densely populated Punjab and Sind where
schools are at closer proximity to another, male LCs had less schools to cover,
whereas in thinly populated and difficult Baluchistan they had more (Sind 10
male, 10 female; Punjab 6 male, 6 female; Baluchistan 12 male, 7 female) (Table
2..' The rationale is unclear to the mission although this was done for
experimental purposes, the results of which have not yet been analysed.
Educational Materials and Curricula
6.14   The mission inspected some of the educational materials, and discussed
their usefulness with some teachers but due to the fact that most schools were
closed it did not observe them in use. It would appear, however, that most of the
materials had been purchased directly off the shelf and therefore in some cases
did not relate to the experimental programme. Nor was there evidence that
additional trial materials, as foreseen at Appraisal, had been developed with the
technical assistance provided. This might have been due to the Borrowerse
reluctance to use TA and the already over-burdened local personnel, even if the
local expertise was available.
6.15   The most important inputs from the childrens' point of view are the
textbooks and charts. The free distribution of textbooks encouraged parents to
send their children to schooL The previously high cost of textbooks could not be
afforded by most parents, especially in rural areas. Free books coupled with the
social awareness of education among parents, encouraged by teachers,
Supervisors, and Learning Coordinators contributed to increase enrolment and
less drop-out.
6.16   However, a major problem confronted by the teachers and students was
that some of the textbooks were written in Arabic style (Nasakh) and others
were in Persian style (Nastaleeg). The latter was larger in script and easier to
write and read, and were used In more schools. This difficulty of writing and
reading in the Arabic style was compounded by the fact that some of the books
were above the level of the students. Therefore teachers had to summarize the
lessons and often translate them into the local language in order for the children
to understand. These findings by the research study on "School in the Socio-
Economic Context" in Baluchistan were verified by the mission in its discussions
with administrators during a review of the two styles of textbooks.
6.17   This situation is evidence of the fact that the learning materials were
not directly related to the experimental programme and indicates the need to
evaluate the learning materials and their possible contribution to the children's
MVk'- '*"T-M

learning achievement. In many schools, according to research conducted in the
Sind, '*... materials supplied by the IV Education Project were kept under lock and
key. The maps and charts, with sufficient dust on them, also provide sufficient
proof that the same were hardly being used ...".
6.18   Nevertheless, learning materials are major potential motivators in
primary schools and with proper training of teachers in their use, student
achievement can be enhanced. Teachers should not be expected to teach what
they do not know. The weak training programme at the C Level has been
reflected in the classrooms especially in remote and isolated schools.
Physical Facilties
6.19   The project financed  construction  and furniture for classrooms,
residences for female teachers and small resource centres for in-service teacher
education.  Physical facilities proposed at Appraisal and actually built by
province are given in the following table.

Classrooms
6.20   In the Punjab an additional 199 classrooms were built to the 30n in
Appraisal, but within the allocated budget. However, it was not clear whether
the additional classrooms were built to the same standards as the 300. Moreover,
it was claimed that communities assisted in the construction of the additional
199, but the extent of community involvement was not clear. For these reasons
these 199 additional classrooms have been omitted from calculations in this
report.

6.21   The impact of an additional 1,000 classrooms in an experimental area
that had only about 35% of buildings used for schools of a quality that could be
called a school, is difficult to assess. The then existing enrolment was so poorly
housed that it was logical that students would be transferred to new facilities.
Classrooms are a necessary condition  for increasing enrolment, but such
increase can be better seen when existing enrolment is located in acceptable
school buildings. Correlation between enrolment increases and provision of
classrooms demonstrate that "although enrolment increases are associated with
the provision of classrooms, the greater increases achieved in project schools can
only be attributed to other factors additional to the provision of classrooms".
New classroom, acted as a catalyst in persuading the community to contribute to
and support the school. However, the very wide variation in physical inputs
make it difficult to truly assess their impact, especially when it seemed that in
some cases, they were not provided where the need was greatest, and the timing
was piece-meal.
Female Residences
6.22   The Government added 50 residences in its budget allocation for these
units, which were not popular, primarily due to cultural constraints.  Single
females do not usually live alone; they could not take their relatives with them,
and night guards were not provided for their protection and security.
Consequently, most of the residences were unoccupied. There was greater
success in Baluchistan where mostly married teaching couples occupied the
residences.
Bounda Walls
6.23   The importance of boundary walls was not foreseen at Appraisal, but was
later added by Government, being fully aware of the reluctance of mothers to
send their daughters to unprotected schools. In Baluchistan only 8 out of 32. were
built because all the remaining 24 schools chosen already had boundary walls.
The provision of boundary walls for girls' schools was successful. They provided
the security that parents wanted before sending girls to school. Schools being
enclosed gave privacy and defined the extent of land over which a school had
total control to make environmental improvements (such as planting) and keep
the school grounds clean. For these reasons, the provision of boundary walls
should be encouraged also for boys' schools. Some communities were stimulated
and provided some boundary walls.
Hostels
6.24   Two hostels were not foreseen in the Appraisal Report, but were later
added by the Government. Only one was built due to the lack of funds and that
was fully occupied, thus increasing girls enrolment.
Resource Centres
6.25   The Resource Centres in Sind worked well. They were places for the
professional growth of Supervisors, LCs and teachers. The development of
suitable learning materials took place there. The skills of primary teachers in
the project districts were improved significantly. These Centres have been
liaked to existing institutions which can provide advice and additional resources.
Their location in the urban context has also allowed higher standards of
construction to prevail compared to rural areas.

CHAPTER VU
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Attainment of Project Objectives
7.1    Based upon the results of the Demographic and Achievement Studies
undertaken in 1984 and 1985, one can conclude with a degree of reliability that
the Project has achieved its four primary objectives in terms of increased
enrolment, decreased wastage, reduced repetition, increased pupil-teacher ratios
and achievement scores (para. 6.1).
7.2    The experiment with selected inputs to find answers to the five critical
questions provided the Government of Pakistan with a wealth of valuable
information from which it determined what experimental inputs would be more
cost-effective in terms of methods and approach for the development of a long-
term effective strategy for primary education development.  The outputs
indicated what input mix seems to be the key to overcoming some of the chronic
problems in primary education in Pakistan. The implications of these outputs
and the results of the demographic and achievement studies were the focus of
the report entitled "A Comprehensive Report on Primary Education -Strategy for
the Development of Primary Education in Pakistan". This Report was the
ultimate goal of the Project (Phase I).
7.3    The administrators of the Project at Federal and Provincial levels faced
a new challenge - conducting action research as an integral part of project
implementation. This was a new philosophy and approach which made new
demands upon the administration and field staff. Although initially they were
unprepared for this new venture, yet they made serious efforts to respond to its
challenge.
Administration of Primary Education
7.4    Higher Education is administered by the Director of Higher Education;
District Education Officers (by their job description) are chiefly concerned with
secondary education and therefore give very little attention to Primary
Education. Based upon the Government's recent pronuncements (March 1985) to
give the development of Primary Education top priority, it seems equally
important that the administration of this sub-sector be entrusted to a special
administrative machinery even if this might require a change in administrative
policy. The urgency for this decision is more pressing in view of the implications
of Phase II of this and future projects.
ProLect Mgffsement
7.5    Project Management at both the FCU and PIU levels requires substantial
strengthening. The frequent changes that took place in senior management staff
in the PIU's resulted in inadequate long term planning and a slackened project
activity, particularly as the project neared completion. There are still major
staffing gaps in FCU which make it difficult to provide appropriate support to
PIUs in the field and sustain momentum for project development. All posts



- 38 -
stipulated in the Credit Agreement should be filled with qualified and capable
persons on a permanent or long-term basis. This is particularly significant in
view of the status of PlUs within the Provincial Education system and the
central importance of the District Education Officer In each case. An absence
of technical support In civil works implementation, within the FCU aind PlUs
resulted in a lack of control of the design and quality of building construction. A
radical change in employment policy of PEP employees Is needed with the view
to guaranteeing permanent job security. This may mean absorbing project
personnel into the mainstream of the civil service or providing them with job
security and all earned emoluments during their secondment with the PEP. The
existing job uncertainty among personnel resulting in their desire and efforts to
move from the PEP as quickly as possible (especially the FCU and PIUs) should
be halted. Measures should be taken to ensure that the FCU provides greater
guidance to PlUs, monitors project implementation and collection of data more
closely to ensure quality control, and facilitates regular provincial meetings for
exchange of experiences and for appropriate formative evaluation.  The
importance of stability and increased efficiency of staff and quality control of
project implementation cannot be over-emphasized.
Teacher Service
7.6    The dismal faiturek/ of the approach used warrants a radical change for
a follow-on project. Consideration should therefore be given to institutionalizing
teacher service.  At teacher training institutions there is usually a more
permanent and reliable staff; facilities are more appropriate and can be
augmented as necessary; curriculum development as a continuous process
facilitates experimentation through the development of relevant educational and
learning materials; suitable contents and methodology can be provided,
innovative approaches developed, all under professional guidance and monitoring
to ensure quality control. Most of these elements were lacking in the training
programme provided under Primary 1, Phase t; in essence, the experimental
aspect was lacking. Furthermore, participants should be recruited from the field
through DEOs guided by improved selection criteria. Because of the constant
mobility characterizing officials, this group should be avoided, thereby ensuring
a greater degree of permanence and multiplying effect in teacher training
programmes.
Supevis
7.7    Although close supervislon has the potential of becoming the cornerstone
of the professional growth of the teacher, it requires much improvement in
content, (emphasing the processes of communication and good leadership),
methods and duration of training. The functions of project supervisors and
learning coordinators need to be clearly defined in relation to regular
mainstream supervisors and DEOs, operational manuals should be developed, and
satisfactory working conditions (salaries commensurate with job, per diem,
travel, status recognition, etc.) provided with the view to attracting capable
persons and motivating them to remain and grow professionally in the system.
The establishment of self-evaluation procedures for supervisors and LCs as a
means of helping them to grow in skill and competency is worthy of
consideration.
I/    NWFP programmes for B and C levels proved more successful due to the
PIU's leadership; appropriate revisions were made as a result of close
supervision and analysis of outcomes of each training programme.



- 39-
7.8    The real impact of supervision as an experimental input mix should be
further explored.  This would require a comparative investigation of the
influence of the various ratik.s of Learning Coordinators to schools in the kJur
provinces and Supervisors to LCs in Punjab and Sind provinces (para. 2.16). The
outcome as to which mix was mnore effective and upon which element (para. 2.22)
was the influence greatest could have profond Implications for a follow-on
project. This aspect of the experiment has not yet been analysed.
Instructional Materials and Curricula
7.9    Curricula modification accordinig to local and provincial needs and
culture was generally neglected in Primary 1. This activity should be effected
and new and additional materials developed in relation to curricula, Improved
supervision, the in-service training of teachers and effective teaching in the
classroom. Activities for stimulating student self-learning, problem-solving, and
confidence building should be Incorporated. Textbook language and style of
script should be in harmony with general language used in the respective
provinces. This may require bilingual textbooks (Urdu plus predominant local
language) or supplementary materials in the specific local language in order to
facilitate student learning.
7.10   The utilization of Resource Centers can be increased by also using them
as educational production centres. This would require equipping them with the
pre-requisites for effective functioning.
Experientatin and Evaluation
7.11   The administrators of the project at the Federal and Provincial levels
faced a new challenge - conducting action research during the implementation of
a project. Thjis was a new experience for which they were unprepared, but
serious efforts were made to respond to the demands of the experiment.
Consequently, the mixed outcomes enabled the Government to select the more
promising elements for further improvement in a follow-on project (Phase IU).
7.12   However, there are some major constraints which should be addressed
for greater future effectiveness. Research Cells are weak in data analyses,
interpretation and drawing implications for decision-making. Two alternative
approaches would be to: (a) assign two experienced researchers, one each to two
PIUs, on a full-time rotation basis (exchange of information and experience
would be healthy) and one at the FCU. At the Provincial Levels they would up-
grade the Research Cells and provide guidance and continuity. The one at the
FCU would coordinate the field activities and provide quality control; or
(b) abandon the Research Cells and contract the activities to a university or
research institute as was done in the Punjab and the Sind, and strengthen their
research capabilities which seem to need additional professional inputs.
Whichever of the above might be chosen, an outside consultant or agency should
evaluate the project on a regular built-in schedule thereby providing greater
objectivity.
7.13  In addition, record-keeping procedures of all aspects of the project
appeared to be inadequate and could be substantially improved and strengthened
by being standardized throughout all four provinces and submitted regularly to
the FCU for review and compilation.



- 40 -
7.14   When national research capability is deficient, a balanced mix of
competent expatriate and national specialists services should be pursued with the
view to ensuring outputs of internationally acceptable quality and proviaiilg a
wealth of expertise for use in follow-on projects.
Phyilcal Facilities
7.15   Choice of Schools. There should be a common aim to upgrade project
schools to a certain standard based on a cost effective combination for a
moderate size school. Priorities should be set, from the point of view of choosing
appropriate project schools/sites, which take account of the provision of civil
wtorks as well as teaching requirements. Consideration should also be given to
making repairs to existing classrooms when contemplating the addition of
classrooms. From the outset, there should be a clear policy as to the use of
additional buildings (i.e. as classrooms or some other use). This will have an
impact on the capacity of the school and on the per capita cost. The provision of
infrastructure (such as water, electricity or pit latrines) should be considered
during project implementation. The project shows that once implementation of
civil works is complete, rarely are infrastructure services provided.
7.16   Architectural Design:  Architectural Designs should take account of
studies already undertaken by various international agencies and private and
public organizations in Pakistan. Innovation in design could also make
considerable difference to the utilization of facilities and the cost effectiveness
of buildings. The provision of boundary walls for all project schools (with
assistance from the communities) has an impact on enrolment in girls' schools
and contributes to the environmental improvement of the school. In all matters
relating to the provision of civil works, the FCU and PIUs should have the
technical capability to take part in the decision making process. Such a
capability would also assist the FCU and PIUs in assessing the need for
continuous maintenance and upkeep and also provide an inventory of the
facilities available and their level of utilisation in each school.

CHAPTER Vm
LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
The Government
8.1    The shortage of senior staff at the FCU and the frequent changes of PIU
directors adversely affected project implementation. The FCU could not provide
the required leadership, guidance and monitoring of the project. Neither could
the PIUs execute fully their responsibilities. These constraints to effective
project implementation should not be permitted in a follow-on project. Since
efficient project implementation depends upon a permanent, dedicated and
competent staff, with guaranteed job security, all efforts should be made to
recruit and retain such a staff. The fulfillment of the convenants of the Credit
Agreement would contribute largely to achieving project objectives. Therefore,
the Borrower should make serious efforts to fulfill them. Also a greater level of
support is required to the PlUs from the FCU in the field to achieve objectives.
This can only be realised by close collaboration between the FCU and PIUs both
in the field for efficient implementation and the central unit for effective
control as well as informative comparisons between the various regional units.
8.2    Field staff, especially Supervisors and Learning Coordinators, were
delayed in the execution of their duties due to the late arrival of transportation.
Realizing the importance of providing required inputs on time in an experimental
project, such delays should not be allowed in a follow-on project. Staff efficiency
and the reliability of data depends upon the project inputs being administered at
the appropriate time.
The Bank
8.3    Project design should be influenced by the Borrower's environment and
therefore, should be designed in accordance with the latter's managerial,
technical and financial capabilities. A convergence of the Project with the
environment should be as close as possible. Also appropriate measures should be
taken to ensure that project conceptualization is clearly understood by all those
involved with the project, and flexible built-in evaluation is included in the
implementation schedule.  In a large experimental project of this kind
incremental design should be considered with the view to ensuring maximum
project success as implementation and formative evaluation take place.
8.4    Bearing in mind that frequent changes in project management resulted in
a lack of continuity of strong management and effective co-ordination,
appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this situation in a follow-on
project. This would necessitate an effective dialogue with the Borrower with the
purpose of having the latter comply fully with Credit Agreement Covenants in a
timely manner.  This would enhance timely project implementation and
contribute to successful outcomes.

8.5    Project monitoring became slack after the withdrawal of all but one of
the consultants in evaluation. The Borrower did not have the manpower to
provide the needed service. Therefore, the involvement of the Bank Resident
Mission personnel in project monitoring was an effective measure and should be
continued and strengthened. In particular, greater emphasis on supervision is
required for the implementation of physical works at an early stage of the
project to ensure appropriate design and construction standards.
The Bank and the Government
The Design and Implementation of Civil Works
Design
8.6    A major handicap to efficient implementation of Civil Works was that
school sites were scattered among many districts in remote and sometimes
inaccessible areas. This posed logistical problems and led to substantial increase
in construction costs. The lesson to be learned is that follow-on projects should
concentrate at the district level with all schools operating within that district.
Two or more adjacent districts could be combined; contractors would then be
more willing to bid, transportation would be less costly, retendering and price
renegotiation should not be necessary, and supervision would be more convenient
and effective.  Thus the quality of the constructed facilities should be of
acceptable standards.
8.7    The experience with this project should have provided the Borrower and
IDA with more knowledge of the prevailing conditions in remote areas of the
country (especially Baluchistan) and a better understanding of the culture,
tradition and attitudes of the rural populace to education development, as
evidenced by their level of participation In this project. This information
coupled with recent demographic data should influence the design of the follow-
on project, including more accurate estimates of project base costs and realistic
needs for physical inputs.
8.8    The addition of classrooms in Primary I to existing schools was designed
in an attempt to reduce the inequality (Appraisal para. 2.01) in the distribution
of physical facilities in rural areas in Pakistan. The outcome, however, was
disasterous in that the quality of the classrooms was inferior in design, low in
quality, and costly (para. 4.12).   The follow-on project should restrict
construction of additional facilities to schools which have adequate enrolment
and teaching staff, where the impact can be felt and evaluated and adjustments
made accordingly. The design of these facilities should incorporate regional
design experiences from Unesco's Bangkok Office and other studies carried o4't
by UNICEF, USAID and public and private organizations in Pakistan (see
Appendix, page 40). Innovations appropriate to the needs of each province should
be incorporated. Since the FCU took no steps to enforce this requirement the
Bank should have been firmer in demanding compliance with it especially since
funds had been allocated for such studies to be undertaken.
Implementation
8.9    The FCU and PIUs had no technical expertise and therefore had no
influence over the physical facilities inputs. This was a serious error which
should have been corrected at the early stage of implementation. Yet the Bank
was not fully aware of the situation and did not seek alternative approaches to



- 43 -
solve the problem. In this connection, construction supervision by the Provincial
Public Works Departments was inadequate due to the large number of scattered
sites and the shortage of technical staff (para. 4.14), low construction
capabilities of local builders; and other logistlcal difficulties.
8.10   As a result of the above conditions, many of the facilities constructed
are of poor quality and unsuitable to the specific educational requirements. The
lesson here is that if design and implementation of a follow-on project will be
under the same arrangement, then the FCU and PlUs must have capable
technical personnel to provide the expertise needed for all phases of the
development and construction of physical facilities.  On the other hand,
consideration could be given to engaging the servlces of a construction firm to
manage all civil works, in view of the large size of the follow-on project.
Im ra e of Evaluation
8.11   The importance of evaluation in an experimental project cannot be over
emphasized. According to Mr. P. A. Schwarz, the Bank Consultant, two major
functions are served by studying the progress element in a programme
evaluation. Firstly, it provides the opportunity to try to determine why a certain
component is not producing the expected results with a view to fixing it.
Secondly, the elements that are important to the success of the components thlat
do seem to be working are identified, with the view to ensuring that these
features are retained as the programme is expanded. In this respect, the mid-
stream evaluation of the programme was timely and proved to have been the
greatest contribution to the success of the project in that the Bank's consultant
redesigned the project and focussed upon its needs in the light of what actually
happened as the project unfolded, rather than upon the technical aspects of data
collection.
8.12   This meant that elements such as weak administration, ineffectlve
management and implementaticn and lack of formative evaluation were clearly
Identified and became "vehicles for learning" for continuous project
Improvement. In brief, the past activities and their "outcomes precipitated a
reconceptualization, both of the nature of educational research and evaluation,
and of the objective of the project". The lesson learned is the necessity.to
weave project deslgn and evaluation planning together from the outset. Timing
the evaluation process with the implementation plan is an essential element in an
experimental project. This entails the working together of the project managers
and evaluators from the beginning of project implementation. This was a major
limitation of the PEP as originally designed.
Use of Consultants
R.i3   The implementation of an ongoing research project was new to the FCU
and a challenge to those who were involved with it. Therefore, the strengthening
of the research capacity of the FCU and the PlUs through the use of local and
international expert services became necessary. In this respect, the Credit
Agreement provided for 12 man-years of expatriate services and about 50 man-
years of local consultancy services (para. 3.6). The former was contracted with
a bilateral agency to provide the services. Unfortunately, Insurmontable
problems arose between the Government and this agency regarding the nature of
the technical assistance contract and procedures of cooperation (para. 4.21).



- 44 -
8.14   The major issues of conflict were: (i) the Government was not clear on
the actual needs for technical assistance and was quite concerned about its
quality and nature, since the contract was in such general terms that no one was
able to fully understand what It really Implied; (ii) some consultants arrived late
and had not been properly briefed and therefore did not understand the nature of
the project; (iii) the initlal outputs of some of the consultants were less than
useful (e.g. the research design instrument), disorganized, nnd not coordinated
with the activities of the PlUs; (iv) over 40 per cent of the man-years were to be
spent abroad; and (v) there was no flexibility in the contract for periodic revision
of activities in accordance with the needs of the project during implementation.
Although the Bank Intervened to reconcile the two sides, the contract was finally
cancelled after only 3.2 man-years had been used.
8.1S   In the meantime, the same agency planned and carried out the overseas
training programmesof the A level trainers, conducted workshops for Research
Cells personnel, designed the original research instrument and supervised early
research activities, all in collaboration with the local consultants.
8.16   It seems clear therefore that the overall performance of the consultants
provided sufficient evidence to warrant the encourugement to use a balanced
team of expatriate and national consultants in a follow-on project, but under
clearly defined conditions This would entail a clear di-alogue and mutual
understanding between both parties with the view to avoiding all e onstraining
elements as those (and any other) confronted in this project, as listed in
para. 8.14.
8.17   This team  would be expected to work as colleagues endeavoring to
understand and solve common problems. The final outcome would be not only an
evaluation report of internationally acceptable standard, but equally Important
would be the development of the research and evaluation capabilities of the FCU
and Research Cells, and the research capability of institutions connected with
the project would be strengthened. Therefore, a national wealth of research and
evaluation expertise would be available for use in follow-on projects, provided
that the national consultants remain with the Ministry of Education durlng and
after project implementation. All efforts to keep them as permanent members
should be made. This was not done in the case of this project. 1/
Usefulness of Negative Outcomes
8.18   Although  two  major project inputs produced outcomes less than
expected, yet these outcomes can be useful guides for future project design.
Effective Teacher Train!ng - was critical to ultimate project success. Therefore
the recruitment of suitable master teachers was considered the linchpin to the
success of the teacher training programme. If a similar pattern of training is to
be followed, then master teachers should be well qualified and experienced and
fully available for conducting the lower level training programmes. They should
be carefully selected from the field and not from ministries of education and
other institutions as was done with this project. Participants at the other two
levels should be from among primary teacher training institutions and from the
field.
8.19   However, since the FCU  does not provide the needed learning
environment nor adequate training facilities, establishing this programme at
selected colleges of education could prove to be a good guarantee for
implementing a productive programme (para. 7.6).
The Government through its Ministry of Education has emphasixed that tho underutl-
lization of crodit funds for technical assitance of about 42% has wider Implica-
tions than sow2 difference of opinions between tho Goverromnt and one *goncy
roegrding the implementation of a particular contract--.e., different peropee-
tives on the noeds and role of expotriate technical asesltonce between the
Governmant end the World Sank (soo Attachcmet I).



- 45 -
8.20   Curriculum content could include the five subject areas proposed In
Primary I programme (para, 2.15) with appropriate revisions and additional needs
of project teachers as identified by the teachers themselves as well as by
Learning Coordinators and Supervisors.  A proper balance between subject
matter and methodology should be maintained.
8.21   Female Teachers' Residences - did not attract as many teachers as had
been envisaged at AppraisaJ due principally to cultural constraints and the lack
of basic services such as water and electricity. However, there was total
occupancy in Baluchistan by married teaching couples, who, themselves,
connected nearby electricity and made suitable modifications to the buildings
(appendix page 32). It should be further noted that residences should be built
where the need is greatest as identified by a study. In view of the total
occupancy achieved in Baluchistan, the provision of female residences in a
follow-on project should not be excluded outright. Rather, decision should be
made on a provincial basis, based upon locality (district) needs in each province.
At the same time other possible accommodation, such as providing existing
housing within the communities or giving teachers a housing allowance and
allowing them to find their own housing, should be considered (see Appendix,
page 52).
Influence of Contextual Factors
8.22   Contextual factors (factors outside the project) should be considered in
the design of a follow-on project. Two such factors are the expansion of mosque
schools during project implementation and the emphasis upon wider use of
"teaching kits" prepared by UNICEF. The impact of these two elements upon the
educational system  merit attention  ir} an expanded  follow-on  project.
Additionally, the changing rural pattern/ has assisted in creating a greater
social awareness among parents and contributed to the demand for primary
education. Schwarz emphasizes that these contextual factors tend to
complement and strengthen the follow-on project.
Importance of Linkages
8.23   The PEP being experimental, the designer and project managers could
not clearly foresee all the necessary linkages among the various aspects of the
project. Therefore, physical inputs were piece-meal and not suitably designed
for the curricula experimental inputs; PIUs and Public Works Departments had
practically no connection (except in the Sind); DEOs were mostly involved In
transmitting reports to PlUs; the Provincial Departments of Education, the PIUs
and the FCU had minimal contact. Annex 5 of this report Illustrates the
provincial implementation structure.
8.24   The lessons learned from this project is that there should be strong
linkages among the many tacets of a follow-on project. PIUs should have closer
links with Provincial Departments of Education and DEOs and the latter should
be involved more fully in project design, selection of trainees and staff
development, and implementation of all professional aspects. The linkages of the
structure in Annex 5 should be strengthened and expanded as appropriate, even
during project implementation.

8.25   In particular, an effective framework linking parents, teachers, LCs,
Supervisors, and Communities, am,ong others (e.g. decision-makers and other
researchers/organizations) should be established with clear lines of
communication and a mechanism for the exchange of Information with a view to
enhancing project performance and outcomes. The ultimate benefit of this
exercise would be the production of capable citizens for national development.

EducatLon DweomXot ad Stzatea  Issues
The major issues in Primary Education at Appraisal were (a) unequal
opportunity, (b) wastage, (c) low quality and (d) high costs. The causes of these
issues involved multiple economic, social and educational factors which were
Interrelated. Economically, parents couldn't afford the cost of textbooks and
other related costs; socio-culturally, there was a lack of parental support for
primary education - especially girls; educationally, low quality stemmed partly
from lack of teachers in rural areas and Inadequate supplies of teaching
materials, among other limitations. Since the causes were complex, a complex
strategy to overcome them had to be developed by the Government, while also
bearing in mind the local conditions of the geographical divisions of the country.
The strategy was developed in terms of s
Eal  opity   To improve enrolment coverage at feasible cost in
rural aress pwticularly or Sind, the Government endeavored to:
(a)    undertake a programme to Increase the supply of teachers in
rural areas through such measures as:
(V    adjusting salary scales for teachers In rural areas;
(ii)   introducing allowances for "hardship" or transportation;
(iiV    modifying the career system  to give experienced
teachers opportunities for supervisory jobs;
(iv)   recruiting less qualified village women as teacher
assistants In areas without teachers, and providing in-
service training; and
(v)    providing housing accommodations for females;
(b)    provide school facilities at appropriate locations determined
through systematic school mapping, and Involve local
communities in school building and maintenance.
!etuv.  To increase at feasible costs the proportion of grade 5
completion among students who enroll initially in grade 1, the Government
endeavored to:
(a)   introduce additional supervision at the local level;
(b)    encourage parental involvement in school management;
(c)    adapt the school calendar to cropping patterns;
(d)    experiment with providing direct incentives for attendance, such
as free textbooks and meal; and
(e)   introduce education and orientation programmes for parents to
reduce the discontinuity between school and home.

Qualiy. To improve the attainment of basic education skills at feasible
costs, the Government endeavored to:
(a)    provide systematic professional support for teachers, Including
regular in-service training and supervision;
(b)    provide effective administrative control to reduce absenteeism
of teachers and pupils;
(c)    increase the supply of teaching materials for students and
experiment with self-instructional materials;
(d)    introduce simple formative evaluation of student progress;
(e)    develop a bilingual curriculum using the local language as the
medium of instruction during the first three grades; and
(f)    adapt curricula to local environments, by developing programmes
of a more practical nature that emphasize local needs and use
local resources.

Maior Problems EDncotered Durf   Fir Cycle of
Implementation f Rearch Studis
A.    Project  D
1.    The original experimental design for achievement studies dld not
incorporate control schools. Therefore the data on achievement testing
collected during 1981 and 1982 had only limited validity for drawlng any
worthwhile conclusion; 1983 became the year for benchmark data for
camparison with 1984.
2.    The design attitudinal studies was for a literate community and
therefore was not relevant for the rural areas of Pakistan and had to be
changed In late 1982.
3.    Demographic  studies design  was over-ambitlous and  asked  for
information which didn't relate to the project, coupled with errors made
during the stage of data entry, made the results of 1981 studies useless;
data for 1982 became the baseline for the study that had been reduced
by one third In order to make it manageable within the limited time
remaining.
4.    Qualitative studies as originally conceived were deemed inapproprlate
and therefore a training programme for researchers to undertake
relevant qualitative studies was given in 1983.
B.    Technical
1.    Lack of clear communications  between the Government and the
technical assistance agency under contract for monitoring and
evaluation, led to cancellation of the original contract with effect from
7 February 1980.
2.    Lack of coherence in the evaluation plans In the provinces.
3.    Late arrivals of technical advisors for training programmes.
4.    lack of record-keeping procedures about the project inputs at the early
stage.
5.    Shortage of 15 female LCs in Baluchistan.
6.    Late provision of transport facilities thereby reducing effective
supervision.

Illuminative Evaluationr/
Illuminative Evaluation is primarily concerned with problem-solving - not
intellectual curiosity - through description and Interpretation of data collected
from those directly Involved with a situation - teachers, parents, students,
community leaders, and tries to understand the situation through their eyes. This
approach does not use a scientific model, Involving tests, instrument and random
samples. It is not concerned with a large-scale survey of the scene, but with a
small-scale examination of detail. It tries to get close to the ground. The major
aim of lUluminative evaluation is to study the Innovatory programme: how It
operates; how it is influenced by the various educational situations in which it is
applied. In short, it seeks to address and Uluminate a complex array of
questions.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 892-PAK)
A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE PROVISION OF PHYSICAL FACILITIES:
T!;q study is based on the findings of the Completion Mission
of the First Primary Education Project in Pakistan, undertaken
between 6th and 27th March 1986. The study has been carried out by
Jim Antoniou, Consultant Architect to the Mission and is based on
field trips undertaken in the four Provinces of Punjab, Sind,
Baluchistan and NWFP. During the Mission a total of eight project
schools were visited, as well as five female teacher residential units
and one resource centre.
The purpose of the study is co record the findings of the field
trips in a systematic way and to mcke a comparative analysis of the
facilities provided. From this brief comparison, tentative recommenda-
tions are made for future projects.
The study is in two parts, the first part provides a descriptive
analysis of each project site visited under the headings of physical
implementation; space provision and utilisation; construction; and
construction supervision and maintenance. It also includes sketches
and plans of the sites and buildings visited at a common scale for
easy comparison. All site plans are drawn at a scale of 1:200, while
building plans are laid out at 1:100, showing furniture and equipment
at the time of the mission. Scales are provided both, in imperial
and metric dimensions. In the second part a comparison is made between
the various project sites in the four provinces, in terms of areas
and costs; sites; space provision and design; construction;
implementation; furniture and equipment; utilisation and maintenance.
Finally, recommendations are made for future projects in terms of
site and school allocation; the provision of classroomn; environmental
enhancement; the supply of boundary walls; residential accommodation;
centre schools; the introduction of an inventory of schools and studies
for future consideration.

Physical Implementation: The school site is located within the
village, adjoining the boys school and separated by a high wall.
The site accommodates a block of three classrooms built in the
1950's, with an additional project classroom and adjoining twin
residence for female teachers (constructed in 1981). The residence
has its own courtyard and is accessible from the narrow street side.
The school grounds and the residence are well maintained and land-
scaped. The school is accessible through the school gate. Electrical
wiring has been provided, although connections (ie with meters) to
the village network have not been made. However, electricity is
available from an adjoining house. Both, the school and the



-78-                                  6/52
residence have access to water, with two pumps on site. There is
no provision for sewage disposal.
Space Provision and Utilisation: The existing school block of
three rooms was built to accommodate two classes in each classroom.
Hovever, only one of the three rooms is actually used as a classroom
(with desks). Of the remaining two, one has been in need of
structural repair for the last six years and is used as a store
room. The third is used by the staff. At the time of the mission's
visit to the school (during examinations), classes were held outside
in the open air (see plan of school). According to the head teacher,
classes are held in the open air for some 3 to 4 months of the
academic year (see sketch).
The new project classroom (see plan and sketch) is primarily used
as a meeting room for the school, as well as a base of a centre
school, equipped for in-service teacher training and parent
meetings and other adult groups under the direction of the
learning coordinators. These facilities are provided for this
school, as well as the surrounding five other schools. Although
it is claimed "hat this room is also used as a classroom, the
layout of furniture and equipment makes it unlikely that regular
classes can be undertaken in this space.
Construction: The roof consists of bricks on metal 'T' joists,
supported on cast iron beams. Walls are of brickwork, plastered
and painted. The floor is cement finished. Metal doors and
wir.dows with shutters are used throughout.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The classrooms and
residential unit were planned and supervised by the Local Government.
Department of Planning (LGDP). The project unit was not consulted as
to the siting of buildings, neither as to the accommodation provided.
The project buildings are well maintained, with assistance from
the community. In particular, the classroom was recently decorated.



T/52
However, the lack of maintenance and continued deterioration to
the existing block of classrooms (and the use of the project classroom
as a centre school base) mean that very little teaching space
has been added to the school. Of the four classrooms, available
to the school, only one can function regularly for teaching.
The twin residential accommodation for female teachers provides two
adjoining rooms sharing a common covered verandah, with store and
kitchen. There is also a courtyard with a WC to one side. However, a
pit latrine has not been provided and the space is currently
used as a store. The residential unit is fully occupied and
is kept neat and tidy.

site (see site plan). A water pump is provided to one corner of the
site, adjoining the road. The school is without any other services.
A made up road provides access to the school.
Space Provision and Utilisation: The classroom (without a verandah)
was built in 1981 and does not appear to have been used for regular
classes at any time (see plan lay out). Essentially, it is a store
room, where mats and equipment are kept. No attempt has been made to
store and contain materials and equipment in any systematic way.
Construction: The roof consists of precast reinforced concrete panels.
The brick floor is covered with layers of compact earth. Wells are of
brickwork, plastered internally. Window openings contain metal grills.
The double door is also of metal.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The classroom was planned
and supervised by the LGDP, with PIU playing no part in implementation.
The quality of construction is poor, with cracks in the walls,
particularly those leading from window openings. The building does
not appear to have received any maintenance since it was constructed
in 1981.

PUNJAB: Dhillanwali Primary School for Boys
Enrolment: 184 pupils
Number of Teachers: 3
Approx. School Fite Area: 25,830 sq ft (2,400 sq m). The site is
only clearly defined on two sides and the extent of the plot was

Classroom       216      20                      26,000    2,626
Physical Implementation: The school site is in an open area,
located at the edge of the village. There is an existing block
of five classrooms with a verandah. Adjacent to this block, a
project classroom has been built. Some 20 ft (6 m) further away, a
new block of four classrooms is under construction. With the
exception of a few mature trees,the site is barren, with large pools
of stagnant water and heaps of waste matter to the west of the site
(see sketch). Without a boundary wall, the extent of the school site
is not clearly defined, except for a low wall behind the buildings.
The site is without electricity and toilet facilities for staff
or puiils (see plan of school).
Space Provision and Utilisation: The school is to be upgraded to
a Middle School when the new block of four classrooms is built.
Classes were held in classrooms, with the exception of a pre-school
group of children (supervised by other pupils) at the rear of the school
building (see sketch). The project classroom was used as a
clasaroom (with riwts provided by the project). A notice painted on
the wall in Urdu declared that the room was in fact a meeting hall

(see sketch). The headmaster's desk was located on the verandah, which
he used as an office in order to save space.
Construction: The roof consists of precast reinforced concrete panels.
The floor finish is of brick paving. Walls are of fairfaced brickwork,
internally plastered. Window openings contain metal grills, while the
door is also of metal.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The classroom was planned
and supervised by LGDP, with the project unit playing no part in
implementation. The quality of construction was average for. the
district. The existing buildings are in a poor state of repair. In one
existing classroom, part of a wall was knocked down to provide a
doorway to the rear of the school. At the time of the mission's visit,
considerable building activity was in progress to provide four new
classrooms. However, no attempt was made to maintain the existing
structures.

and meetings.
Physical Implementation: The school site is compact and rectangular,
located adjacent to the boys school, facing the street (see sitt
plan). It is clearly defined by a high boundary wall and entered
through a school gate. The female residence (occupied by a single
family) is contained within the school compound, with its own
boundary wall, entered through the playground. Within the residence,
there is a small planted courtyard and a room for a WC (currently
used for storage). The existing school block consists of three
classrocms and a covered verandah with brick arches. Adjoining the
school block is the project classroom. The playground contains a
number of mature trees (see sketches) and there is also a water pump
on the south-east corner of the compound. A small open drain runs
across the site, along the outer edge of the residential compound.
No other services have been provided to the school.



-89-
17/52
Space Provision and Utilisation: The project classroom is used as
a room for the head mistress, as an office and a store, as well as
for teaching. The residential unit, although originally designed
to accor,imodate two female teachers was occupied, by one teacher
and her family (see plan layout).
Construction: The roof consists of bricks on metal 'T' joists
supported on RSJ. Walls are of brickwork, plastered internally.
The florr is cement finished. Metal doors and windows with shutters
are used throughout in the project buildings.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The project buildings were
planned and supervised by LGDP. Again, the PIU was not consulted.
The school compound (including the resdential unit) is kept
particularly neat and tidy. However, there is a need for funds to
be made available for the upkeep and maintenance of the building.
In particular, the metal window shutters and the exposed metal
'T' joists need cleaning and painting to avoid further rust and
corrosion.

Resource centre 1,800    167                      228,069  23,037
Phybical Implementation: The resource centre site is located within
the compound of an existing high school for girls, close to the
entrance. No specific boundary has been allocated to the building
(see sketch), so that it is part of the overall compound, although
its proximity to the main entrance of the compound makes access to
the centre convenient and freely available. The area around the
building is well landscaped with mature trees in the vicinity. The
building has access to services on the site, including water,
electricity and sewage disposal.
Space Provision and Utilisation: The facilities provided include
an office for the supervisor, and shared office for learning
coordinators, a library (mainly used as a meeting room and work
shop) and a lecture room for in-service courses (see plan layout). The
library (where in fact only one locked cupboard is provided with
books) is actually 'sed as a meeting room and a workshop.
There is also a toilet and washroom for the permanent tstaff.
Generally, the centre is adequately furnished for its purpose.



-92-

(2) according to PIU, the cost of the boundary walls was
inclusive at PRs (US$11) per foot run (PRs354, orUS$36
per mn run).
Physical Implementation: The school site is located on the edge
of the village. The north and east side walls of the building mark
the edge of the small rectangular site, while on the west'and south
side the boundary is defined by a high wall (see sketch). On the north
west corner, a smalliroom is provided for a WC which is
used as a store. The small garden is well planted and is kept neat and
tidy (see site plan). The school is not provided with water,
electricity or any other service.
Space-provision and Utilisation: Pri~or to the building of the school
in 1981, a house in the village was used to hold classes for children,
The project school consists of a standard two classroom block with a
covered verandah. Only one of the classrooms is used for teaching, where
all five classes are held (classes often spill out on to the
verandah). The other classroom is used as a meeting room for the women

of the village and provides facilities for making handicrafts and
household items.
The pupils are provideid with low benches, measuring 1.5 ft wide, 5 ft
long and about 10 inches high (0.46 m wide, 1.5 m long and about 250 mm
high) to sit on which are informally arranged in the classroom. The
assistant teacher is provided with a desk and there are also cupboards
to store equipment. The adjoining meeting room and workshop for women
contains furniture and equipment provided by thecommunity, including
a table and chairs, cupboards and sewing machines.
Construction: The roof consists of brick tiles on metal 'T'
supports with a 4 in (100 mm) earth filling. The floor is of cement
finish and walls are of 13.5 in (335 mm) brickwork. The rooms are
plastered and painted internally.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The building is in need of
repair and upkeep. In particular, the roof is leaking and there are
a number of cracks in the walls. The metal work is also in poor condition,
leading to rust and in need of brushing and painting. Since maintenance
is unlikely through official channels, the village (under a dynamic
leader) is considering improving conditions through the assistance of
tie community. According to the village leader, the supervision of
construction was inadequate and the building was not adequately finished
by the contractors.

Physical Implementation: The site is located along a narrow street
within the village in an area where a nunber of community buildings
are being built, including a mosque and a guest house. The overall site
is divided into three parts; an enclosed courtyard (with a water source),
lead±ng to the girls school through an iron gate (see plan layout).
There is also access to one of the two residences (the other residence
is entered from the south side of the street block). Thi school itself
contains a small courtyard which has been symmetrically planted. With
the exception of the water source in the common courtyard (see sketch),
no other services are provided (with the exception of electrical power
to one of the residencesfrom an adjoining building).



-99-
27/52
Space Provision and Utilisation: The two classroom unit (see
sketch) is used well. Pupils sit on standard benches and there are desks
and chairs for the teachers. The female resident unit was built at a
time (1981) when local teachers were not available. Since that time,
teachers have been trained from the village who prefer to stay with
their own (extended) families. At the same time, the housing
accommodation is considered too small and inadequate by the teachers.
Consequent'y, both residential units remain empty.
In fact, the design of the residential unit has a number of basic
defects. The two rooms face opposite directions, thus making at least
one orientation inappropriate. Moreover, although the two rooms are
adjacent for common safety and security, they are separate to the extent
that one occupant to reach the other has to walk around the street block.
The courtyards are too small (particularly in a rural society where
the keeping of animals is a priority). For these reasons, together with
prevailing local customs, the residential accommodation provided has
not been popular with teachers.
Construction: The block of two classrooms is standard to those provided
by the project in Sind Province. It is well constructed with a 7.5 ft
(2.3 m) high boundary wall. The residential unit is of similar
construction and quality. The common courtyard is enclosed by a 6 ft
(1.8 m) high mud earth wall.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The two classroom unit has
been recently painted and is well maintained by the comuunity-The
residential unit has been neglected and remains unkept and empty.

Physical Implementation: The school site is a small rectangular
walled area along the main street of the village. A number of buildings
are cramped within the compound (see plan layout). To the east of
the entrance is a block of two classrooms constructed in 1985 of mud
walls, with a traditional timber roof and dirt floor. These rooms
are used to hold classes. To the north of this block is a unit of
two classrooms with a verandah (see sketch). The project classroom
(built in 1981) is adjacent to this block. A new block of two
classrooms is being built on the north west corner of the site. There
is some planting around the main block of classrooms, and a water
pump in the open area. The buildings within the plot are badly sited,
leaving odd and inadequate spaces between structures. The remaining
open space is inappropriate for the 527 pupils. There are no services
available to the school.
Space Provision and Utilisation: The two mud wall rooms (without windows
and doors) provide onlyshelter and are inadquate as classrooms (when
not in use, equipment is stored in the project classroom). The main
block of two classrooms can accommodate up to 30 pupils in each room



-102-                                  30/52
(with desks and chairs in one room and mats in the other). Each room
is provided with a built in fireplace. The rooms are small and cramped
with furniture and equipment. The project classroom also accommodates
about 30 pupils and contains a fireplace. The room is poorly designed
being badly lit from only one window on the northside. When the shool
is not in use (for a period of 3 months) during winter, this room stores
equipment and furniture. A mobile water storage tank was provided by
PIU for the school, but due to leaking has not been used since 1981,
because no one can be found responsible for repairs.
Construction: Roof construction is of reinforced concrete with the
ceiling painted. The floor is of cement finish and walls are of ioad
bearing brickwork. Doors and windows are of timber. The main block is
reasonably well constructed while the project classroom has a leaking
roof and verandah. A new block of two classroms was nearing completion
at the time of the mission.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The buildings are designed
and sited outside the control of PIU. The supervision of construction
remains inadequate. Responsibility for the supervision of construction
of the new block of classrooms was entrusted to the head of school.
Considering the chronic lack of maintenance the school has survived
reasonably well. However, in relation to the scale of (growing) enrolment
on a heavily restricted site area, and the variety of building units,
there is a clear needfor adequate supervision and maintenance.

(1) This figure does not include additions and modifications
made by the tenant
Physical Implementation: The site is located at the rear of a
middle school for girls and is esatered through this school. It consists
of a rectangular courtyard (with a WC in one corner). The rest of the
site is occupied by the building (see plan layout). Electricity is
provided but water has to be carried to the site over a distance of
some 300 yards (approx 300 m).
Space Provision and Utilisation: The building is occupied by a
headmistress, her husbano (wh( is also a teacher) ard one child. She
appears to be a resourceful woman who has succeeded in adapting the
buildin8 to her family needs. The building consists of three simple
rooms and a covered verandah with a kitchen on one side and a store
on Fhe other. Since the family moved in after 1981, when the building
was constructed, the verandah has been enclosed, creating a hall/
corridor giving access to the rooms. The central room is used as a
living room and is well furnished. The two other rooms are used as
bedrooms (the single bedroom is also used to store a large motorbike).
The small kitchen and the store are both well laid out. Of all the
primary schools and residences visited by the mission, this is the
only building which hasa functJ.oning WC. The tenants have taken the
initiative in providing a pit latrine for the WC.

Construction: The roof is of reinforced concrete. The floor is cement
finished and walls are of load bearing brickwork. The building is well
constructed and looked after. Additional walls enclosing the verandah
and other improvements have greatly enhanced the quality of the building.
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The building has been planned
and supervised by the LGPD. All additions have been provided by the
occupants at their own expense. The occupants have also undertaken the
maintenance and upkeep of the bui'ding.

(1) Estimated from discussions on site
Physical Implementation: The school site is located about 0.6 mile
(1 km) outside the village on high flat ground, close to the main coad.
The land has been provided by the community with possibilities fo: future
expansion. The site is defined by a high boundary wall. Within the site,
a standard unit of two classrooms has been provided with a shared
verandah (see site plan). To one corner of the site (close to the entrance)
a WC room is located but no provision is made for a pit latrine. The
building is without water, nor electricity.
Space Provision and Utilisation: The two classrooms are more than
adequate for the purpose of the project. At the timeof the mission,
both rooms were empty with classes conducted in four separate groups
in the open air. One of the classrooms was used to store materials and
mats (see plan layout). The teacher's desk and chair were also in the
open air. According to the teachers, during half the academic year,
the pupils are taught outside (see sketch).



-109-

Construction: The roof is of reinforced concrete, with 4 in (100 mm)
mud earth. The floor is of cement finish and walls are of load bearing
brickwork. The building is surrounded by a 3 ft (0.91 m) wide concrete
plinth. Doors and windows are of timber. The building is well constructed
(with the exception of a number of cracks which appear to be as a result
of settlement).
Construction Supervision and Maintenance: The building iE planned and
supervised by the Communications and Works Department. Construction
was assigned to a local contractor. The school is well looked after.
It was recently painted with funds made available by the community.

Residence
(1) Estimated from discussions in the field with a District
Superyisor from the Communications and Works Department.
Physical Implementation: The site is located some distance from the
school along a main road, facing a ditch/canal. Although there are other
houses in the vicinity, the residence is in a rural setting (see sketch).
A small room for a WC has been provided but no attempt has been made
to provide a pit latrine. Electricity is provided through connections
with an adjoining house. Water is carriedfrom adjoining properties.
The residence is located in a poor and unkept area with heaps of refuse
outside the building.
Space Provision and Utilisation: The residence is occupied by one family
of three and consists of two rooms: one is used as a bedroom and the
other as a living room (see plan layout). There is a covered entrance
which leads to a passage, giving access to rooms and the courtyard,
leading to the kitchen, bathroom and WC (both the bathroom and WC are
used for storage).
Construction: The roof is of reinforced concrete slabs, with 1.5 in
(38 mm) thick brick tiles. The floor is cement finished and walls are
of load bearing brickwork. Windows and doors are of timber. The overall



-112-                                  40/52
design is adequate for one family, although a larger courtyard would
be more appropriate. However the building is poorly constructed and
badly kept and maintained.
Construct4on Supervision and Maintenance: The building is planned and
supervised by the Communications and Works Department. The entire
building is badly in need of repair and refurbishment. There are serious
cracks in a number of places, reinforcement bars show through the
concrete slabs in the ceiling, broken glass and cracked window frames
are apparent, in many of the openings. The building has been neglected
since its construction in 1980.

Although the range and number of schools is small, the figures provide
an indication of project implementation. Average site area for boys
schools is larger than that for girls, while the reverse applies for
area of project classroom. As is to be expected, the larger the enrolment
the lower the cost per pupil. This is in accordance with assumptions
in the Appraisal Report, where it is assumed that the addition of
classrooms increases capacity and reduces per capita costs.
In examining the units of additional classrooms (with the exception
of Punjab, where information was not made available), on average, about
half of allproject classrooms were in groups of two, although in
Baluchistan, some 87 per cent of all classrooms were provided as single
rooms (see table below).

In particular, Baluchistan is sparsely populated and schools are few
and far between, while enrolment ratios are very low. It would seem,
therefore, that the original concept in the Appraisal Report of adding
classrooms to an existing school with appropriate infrastructure in
order to increase capacity and reduce the per capita cost has not been
strictly followed. In Punjab, for example, of the four project schools
visited, one classroom was used as a resource centre (despite the poor
conditions of the existing classroom), another was used as a store,
another was used as a classroom (although a notice outside described
it as a meeting room) and another still was partly used as classroom
and partly as an office and store. In Sind, of the two schools visited
with groups of two classrooms, one such classroom was utilised as a
workshep for local women, while the other classroom contained the entire
school (i.e five classes). In Baluchistan, the project classroom visited
was appropriately used. In NWFP, classes were held in the open air,
while the two project classrooms remained empty.
Sites: Generally, school sites which were situated within the village
and/or combined with residential accommodation for female teachers
(although restricted in extent in terms of future expansion) appeared
to be better utilised and were better maintained. Conversely, isolated
school sites and residences were neglected and poorly maintained.
Landscaping is left to local community, or teachers to provide. Girls'
schools were better landscaped than boys', partly due to the definition
of the enclosure and the provision of the boundary wall. Services which
are not provided at the time of construction are unlikely to be installed
once the buildings are occupied. This applies particularly to pit
latrines and meter connections to electricity supply.
Space Provision and Design: Areas and classroom shapes do not correspond
to current guidelines (UNESCO). Plans have been merely adapted from
existing facilities at the time of the early stages of project
implementation by the relevant provincial authorities. In Baluchistan,
classrooms were to be of a standard size, 20 x 20 ft (6 x 6 m). But
due to price escalation the size of many classrooms had to be reduced.



-118-                                 46/52
Project clazsrooms varied greatly from about 200 sq ft (18.5 sq m) to
over 400 sq ft (37 sq m) in net areas and between 300 sq ft (28 sq m)
to over 500 sq ft (46.5 sq m) in gross areas. Moreover, buildings vary
in design and quality of construction, from sound to sub-standard works.
High levels of construction were found in Sind (than Punjab and NWFP).
The poorest quality of construction was found in Baluchistan. Rates
varied from district to district due to transportation costs in remote
areas. Moreover, standard residences in Sind are badly designed.
Construction: There is an absence of local construction capabilities
in many isolated locations. The provincial Communications and Works
Departments are unable to supervise scattered schoolsites, resulting
in the construction of classrooms which are of low quality, inferior
design, high costs and increased maintenance liability. The limited
number of buildings visited by the mission ranged in quality from below
average to average, compared to existing schools. Where the standard
of building was average, compared to existing schools at the time of
construction, due to a chronic lack of maintenance, there was rapid
deterioration (with the exception of some renovation undertaken by local
communities).
Implementation of Civil Works: In Sind, because the PIU and the construction
unit were both under the same ministry (i.e. MOE), there was a certain
amount of exchange of information regarding the civil works. Conversely,
because both units were under the MOE, the PIU relied heavily on the
advice of the construction unit. The civil works provided were therefore
based on the standards adopted by the MOE.
In general, the quality of construction was higher in Sind than in the
other three provinces. Documentation was also better carried out in
Sind than other provinces in terms of availability of standard plans,
cost analysis and range of facilities provided. However, in tvie project
schools visited, supervision of construction varied from one area to
the next, with sites in remote areas being least successful.
Both schools visited in Sind were on new sites, without existing
facilities. In terms of design, the facilities provided were adequate
with the exception of female residence. These were small and badly



-119-
47/52
combined in twin units (e.g. at least one residence was wrongly
orientated as a result of a rigid design). However, the resource centre
was particularly well planned and constructed; with the minimum need
for mainter.ance.
In contrast, all civil works in Punjab were planned and supervised
by the provincial LGDP with very little liaison between this unit and
PIU. The quality of construction varied from average for the province
to below average, particularly in the case of schools built in isolated
areas.
Documentation of civil works in Punjab was the least satisfactory of
all provinces, without any record of plans of accommodation provided,
or the grouping of units of additional classrooms ma4- available in
schools. Similarly, there were no systematic records as to the cost
of construction. During the field trips, figures were mainly estimated
from discussions and meetings. In part, the failures of the PIU can
be attributed to the high rate of change in the leadership.
In Baluchistan, site planning and organisation of the facilities provided
for the schools visited were outside the control of the PIU. The crammed
layout of the groups of buildings, together with varied construction
standards resulted in poor implementation of additional facilities.
Construction supervision was clearly inadequate: this task was entrusted
to the local head teacher.
Part of the failure in the level of implementation can be attributed
to poor leadership in the PIU. Consequently, the status of the PIU in
the provincial education hierarchy remained low, throughout the project imple-
mentation period. The situation was further compounded by a lack of
technical assistance to the PIU by the FCU in respect of civil works.
The PIU had few records of the physical works provided, in terms of
plans and space allocation. However, the LGPD office responsible for
design, tendering and supervision of construction was able to provide
some simplified information on costs and method of tendering from its
own records.



-120-                                48/52
In NWFP, design and supervision of construction was entrusted to the
Communications and Works Department (CWD). Discussions were held with
CWD and with the PIU. The latter played little part in implementation.
However, it was clear that there was a closer relationship between CWD
and PIU than in the other two provinces where design and supervision
of construction was entrusted to a separate unit. Part of the success
of this collaboration can be attributed to the strong leadership in
the PIU. The PIU was able to obtain standard plans and space allocations
for the mission, although costs of facilities were estimated from
discussions on site. Moreover, the standard of construction and
maintenance varied from adequate, in the case of the school visited
to poor, in the case of the residence.
In conclusion, the implementation of civil works undertaken in Sind
province was superior to that of the other three provinces. This was
because the Sind PIU worked closely with the construction unit within
the MOE. The design and construction raethods used were based on MOE
requirements which were appropriate to the PIU. The construction unit
therefore worked in the interest of the PIU's needs. Moreover, better
records were kept in Sind as a result of the interest expressed by the
MOE. This collaboration between PIU and the construction unit
inherent in Sind did not exist in the other three provinces.
Furniture and Equipment: Some changes were made to the equipment
list, to suit local conditions (eg in Sind, where the climate may be
damp and where the pupils all sit on benches, rush mats were not used
and benches were bought instead).
Utilisation: In Punjab, most of the 300 classrooms built are used to
provide meeting facilities as "centre schools" furnished with table
and chairs. Centre schools serve as collection and distribution points
for information to and from teachers. The Learning Coordinators also
hold monthly meetings with teachers within the cluster schools. About
25 per cent of classrooms are distributed among schools without any
existing buildings. In Sind, a large number of two-room schools have
been provided (often at sites that already have two classrooms). In
many cases, the situation in Sind was such that existing facilities
were either absent or in a dilapidated state. Consequently, the decision



-121-
49/52
was taken to provide classrooms to act as a catalyst in persuading the
community to contribute and support the school.
Over 75 per cent of all female residences were provided in Punjab. In
Sind, more than 50 per cent of all female residences provided remain
empty, due to lack of security (eg a watchman); and inadequate
designs of residences. In Baluchistan all residences have been fully
occupied, mainly because PIU has taken the trouble to accommodate
appropriate female teachers (eg those married to other teachers) and
have been allowed to make modifications to the plans.
Maintenance: There are four categories of maintenance, namely, minor
repairs such as replacing broken windows, or repairs costing up to PRs
500 (US$50.50); annual maintenance, such as painting and decorating;
major repairs, such as additions and alterations up to PRs 50,000
(US$55OJA)  The first two categories are very rarely adhered to as a
result. of a lack of resources and funds, thus concentrating mainly on
major repairs. The most neglected buildings are the female teacher
residences. Once buildings are handed over to the occupants, little
attempt is made to inspect and maintain these buildings.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS
Site and School Allocations: Construction should be encouraged to the
expansion of schools that have adequate enrolments and teaching staff.
There should be a common aim to upgrade project schools to a certain
standard. Field studies suggest the most cost effective combination
for a moderate size school to be as follows:
i)   3 sound classrooms with verandahs
ii) Staff of a minimum of 3 teachers
iii) The ability to provide other amenities (preferably through community
participation) such as a storage room, water supply/storage
latrines)
iv) A boundary wall (essential for girls' and preferable for boys'
schools).
Priorities from the point of view of choosing project school/sites should
be developed and expanded as follows:
F:rst priority: existing classrooms requiring minimum maintenance and
having adequate area for expansion
Second priority: existing classroom requiring repairs
Third priority: provision of two classrooms on an appropriate site,
without any existing buildings, but sufficient space
for future expansion and an appropriate enrolment.
Provision of Classrooms: Greater emphasis should be given to studies
and projects already carried out by such agencies as UNESCO, UNICEF,
USAID and public and private Pakistani organisations. Future projects
should incorporate innovation in the design of classrooms appropriate
to the needs and financial means of each province. For example, in Punjab
where there is a tradition of teaching in the open air, many classrooms
ivo.iip: w- ~-

have been used as storage space and teaching continues in the open air.
With the cost of onv classroom, it may be possible to design a structure
which provides cover (but not total enclosure) for two and possibly
three classroom areas. At a later date, when funds may be available,
it may be possible to provide walls and windows to enclose classrooms*
In Sind, where there is a tradition of teaching in an enclosed room,
it is possible to provide a space larger than a single classroom, so
that separate classes can be held simultaneously. Later, as earolment
grows, a partition can be erected to separate classrooms. In all cases,
however, selected schools for additional crassrooms should be given
financial assistance for repa'lrs to existing facilities.
Environmental Enhancement: In view of the extensive use of external
space for teaching, the overall environmental quality of the facilities
provided within the site is particularly important. When considering
the provision of additional spaces, attention should be given to the
upgrading of existing buildings. Where existing structures have been
neglected and have deteriorated beyond repair, constituting a health
hazard, demolishing and rebuilding should be considered.
Careful consideration should also be given to the location of buildings,
the landscaping of sites and the provision of basic services, sut as
pit latrines and electricity supply connections. All such amenities
should be considered collectively within clearly defined site boundaries.
Thus, the overall environmental quality of the school site should be
considered as a whole and implemented simultaneously within the basic
framework of teaching accommodation.
Boundary Walls: The provision of boundary walls to girls' schole is
recognised as being essential to increasing enrolment as well as to
defining the extent of the school site and improving conditions within
the area. It is recommended that boundary walls -should be provided to
boys' schools in order to improve the environment of the school within
the site.
Residential Accommodation: Various alternatives should be considered
appropriate to local cultural requirements and the availability of local
teachers. The most appropriate method is to uzilise and train local



-124-                             52/52
teachers, thus avoiding the need to construct new residential premises,
Alternatively, a local house may be purchased to provide accommodation
for teachers from outside the cooiUunity.Lastly, it may also be possible
to design new residential accommodation based on the needs and
requirements of teachers. To achieve the latter, greater collaboration
is needed between PIU and designers.
Centre Schools: Such centres serve as a base for learning coordinators
and can be established by building an additional classroom to a school
with 3 or more sound classrooms.
Community Participation: Local communities should be encouraged as far
as possible to provide land, erect boundary walls and where practical
to rehabilitate existing classrooms. Community leaders should be
encouraged to take part in implementation and they should be kept
informed of project progress. The range of practical inputs for community
involvement should be explored by PIUs.
Development of an Inventory: Individual PIUs should be encouraged
by FCU to develop systematic records which would include such information
as site areas, net and gross floor areas of classrooms provided, overall
school accommodation, type of constructj.Jn and building materials, costs,
availability of services, enrolment and numbers of teachers. In view
of the large populations involved, such an inventory should be undertaken
at the district level, under the guidance of the DEOs and with the
support of the PIUs.
Studies to be Considered: FCU should initiate and conduct a comparative
study with PIU assistance, of the different strategies taken towards
classroom expansion, stressing their respective strengths and weaknesses
in a variety of settings. Such a study should also examine the
implications in adding to or creating new schools with two, three, four
or even five classrooms as in the case of Sind. Other studies may also
be undertaken to assess the utilisation of classrooms and assist in
arriving towards more appropriate solutions for the future.

ATTAC}HENT I
2.  PR~7B~T COMPLUflO.
241       Fara   1.2  of  the  roport  suggests  that  the
arrangmaonts whereby practical control of the planning design
supervision and certification of physAcal facilitieg wag
handed over to respective Rural Works Divisions of LOD or
Local Union Councils contributed indirectly to the delay of
implementation of 17 months over the appraical estimate of 63
montha. Similarly Ptra 4.14 under 'ConstructionO reads
OConsiderable delays occurred during
implementation, resulting In tinm
overrun by 17 months"
This is not so. Under Key Project Data Page (ILL)
the Report indicates that the actual date of ampleatinn nf
physical elements was 12.31.84, whclb coincides with tho
criginal appraisal estimate.,
2.2       Similarly the implication in Para 7 of 'Highlights"
that the Project implementation delay of 17 months was due
also  in  some  measure  to  major  staffing  gaps  in  also
inaccarat.e    The  actual closing  date of the project was
6.30,85 whicb also coincides with the appraisal estimate (Key
Project Data - Page (Iii)).
2.3       The World Bank Supervision  4iasion Aide-Memoire Ju1i
85 Para 3 states.
" There is no need for any extension becathere is
little work r*m.n;A';uq to be copleted under the project,'
The Staff Appraisal Report for the Third Primary
Iducation Project Marach, 1987 Para 2.15 points out that,
unlike previous projects.

'The Fourth Education Project (Cr.892-PAX) of 1979
for US $ 10.00 million was completed on time 1985."
2.4       It was agreed between the Government of Pakistan and
the World bank that, given the under utilization of funds
under  Cr.$92-PAR,  financing  could  be  continued  to  enable
Supervisors Learning Co-ordinators and P.I.U Staff to reain
active in the field during the bridging periods leading to the
date of effectiveness of the new project (Second Primary
Sducation  Cr.1602-Pak,  Bffective  Jan.1986)    It  was  this
agreement alone which led to the delay in the date of
completion of Cr#892-Pak.
3. TSJMIBSALTANC3
3.1       The record upon the use of consultants in paras 8.13
and 8.14 of the report io inaccurateo  Only 47 man-months of
the 12 mian-years of expatriates services provided by the
project was contracted to a bilateral agency to provide these
services.    The  initial contract was cancelled before any
implementation and not before 3.2 man - year. had been used
(Para 8.14) A second contract was negotiated with the same
bilateral agency for a similar number of 47 man-month., of
which 41 man-months, were eventually utilised.  This second
contract was not cancelled    either  by  the  Government of
Pakistan or by the Bilateral Agenqy.
3.2       Any  implication  that  the  under-utilisation  of
Foreign Technical Assistance was due in sme measure to the
cancellation of a contract with the bilateral agency concerned
would  be  inappropriate  and  misleading.    The  problem  of
Expatriate Technical Assistance in World Bank assisted
projects is far more fundamental, It arises from wholly
WMZMZMO,_MM.M. _

(page 4 of 6)
different perspectives of need on the parts of the Government
of  Pakistan  and  the World  Bank  respectivelyo    To  date,
moreover, little attempt has been made to reconcile these
different perspectives or to identify the reasons for them.
3.3       The  original   credit   allocation   to  Technical
Assistance and Consultant 8Services represented 35% of the
total project allocation of US$10 million, Salaries (280)
Civil Works (171) and Equipment (14%) being the other major
components.     Underspending  on  the  Technical  Assistance
allocation was 42.91, none of which could be accounted for by
the depreciation of the Rupee from 9.9 to 15.9 per US$
throughout the Project period. Underspanding on the remainder
of the project allocations was 16.7%, much of which could be
attributed to the depreciation of the Rupee.   These figures,
perhaps, fairly represent the different perspectives of need
identified above.
4.   UNIT C2BT
4.1       One of the 4 major objectives of the project was to
reduce unit costs by the reduction of wastage inherent in drop
out, low teacher pupil ratios and uneconomical school size.
Additionally low cost teachers (assistant teachers) were to be
introduced (Para 2.9). In discussing the degree to which this
objective was achieved (Para 1.10 sub sector v) the report
makes no mention of the study undertaken by an expatriate
consultant focussed on a cost analysis of the projeot, (Cost
Analysis Report - British Council 1984) which demonstrated a
reduction in unit coats as a result of project intervention of
15.9% Although a member of a World Bank mission, in verbal
discussion, subsequently expressed reservations related to the
methodology of the study, no contrary interpretation of the
project statistics has been suggested.

In addition to the reasons offered in Para 1.12 for
the limited effectiveness of the training programme which are
fair and accurate three more perhaps should b mentioned.
5.1       The lack of any interrelationship between the three
project   components   supervison,   learning   materials   and
training.
5.2       The non-recurrent nature of the Level A and Level B
cycles.  Only level C was planned on a recurrent annual basis,
which resulted in a lack of dialogue and feedback both from
the PIU to the field and from the field to the FlU.
5.3       A lack of concern  for  the  ianovative  reform  of
curriculum aimst, objectives, and contents, already present and
emergent at the Federal Level.
6.   DISTRISMUTILN LIST~
It is suggested that the distribution list of the
World Bank Resident Mission related to Credit 892-Patk should
include institutional counterparts in the PWFP, Baluchistan
and Sind equivalent to those identified for the Punjab in the
distribution list for the Project Completion Report.(Mission
letter March 9, 1987).

The Project Completion Report of Credit 892 Pak in
an extension of the Draft Comprehensive Report (1983) of the
Government of Pakistan, and largely confirms the earlier
findings. The conclusions and recomendationas, explicit and
othewise# found In both reports are reflected in many ways in
the design and proposals of the follov-on project Credit

the worthwhileneaa of Credit 892 PAR.

posts have already been filled in till to-d   exoept two posts of Supervisory staff
whioh is being prooessed presently. As regards pue quality of oivil worCk, the
Pederal Goveerment has already appointed MIS NIAP to undertake  the civil works
under the existing projeot to ensure quality work. Besides the Provincial GovtS
also ensure that the staff at the PIU level will, not be trnsmferred to other
offioes of the sduoation Depertment.
. Under2 the Pximanry Education Projeot-?. the dation oit$w.
training was only three wee1s which was in-suffioient to have a good trained
teaoher. The main reason is that there in nO pre-sorvice training in 3aluohiatan
due to shortage of matriculate and the number of personnel who adopts the teaohing
profession.
The training of Master Trainers is also as important as that ir
case of teachers. These Master Trainers also need training on a standard basie.

Comments of the Government NWFP, PeshMwr
on the Draft Completion Report -
Fourth Education Prolect/Primary Education Prolect II (1979-85)
The Primary Education Project (experimental phase) was launched in
July 1979 and concluded in September 1985. The UNESCO mission for
the Government of Pakistan visited NWFP from March 9th to 11th, 1986
in connection with visit of sites and discussion with the project
staff. The comments on the Report are as under:-
Assistant Teachers
It is mentioned in the report that assistant teachers were paid
Rs 300/- P.M.
Comments
Assistant teachers were not paid Rs 300 - P.M. But were paid the
initial of the pay scale prescribed for primary school teachers.
Training
The report points out that the service of group 'A' were not
utilized in group 'B' and 'C' training program. Identification of
Group 'B' was not proper.   Vast  content areas were taught within a
short period of 3-weeks at the cost of quality.
Comments
Selection of group 'A' and 'B' personnel was made according to the
norms prescribed by the World Bank in its training plan. Out of 8
group 'A' services of 7 were utilized for group 'B' and of 6 for
group 'C' training program. The group 'B' personnel were identified
as under:
Administration                               16
Supervision                                  14
Master Training ISL AMIYAT                   13
Master Training URDU                         13
Master Trainer Social Studies                14
Master Trainer Mathematics                   14
Master Trainer Science                       12
and their services along with group 'A' were utilized in group
'C' cycle I and  II  training  Program.    A selective content in
which the teachers were  found  deficient  was identified and was
made the curriculum of the training program for group 'C'. It

(page 3 of 3)
was not far wide to be covered within a per4.od of 3-weeks. The
2nd cycle of group 'C' training program was not a repetition of
Cycle-I, because this was designed on the basis of the finding of
the reports received from learning coordination and analysis of
t1't achievement tests administered in the project and non-project
schools. The report also mentioned that no training materials
were developed.
Comments
Training material in the form of two hand books, one for the
primary school teacher and the other for learning coordinators
were developed.
Supervision
The report recognizes that the result of the inputs was beyond
their  expectations,  however   they   have  recommended  certain
measures for further improvement which were partly taken care of
and will be acted upon in the follow-on project.
Coments
Were acted upon to a great extent.
Instructional Material and Curriculum
The report says that curricula were not modified according to
local condition.
Comments
It is the responsibility of the curriculum wing of the Ministry
of Education, Government of Pakistan. However the instructional
material developed by the project was used in the schools.
Physical Facilities
The report says that the construction of class rooms, female
residences and boundary walls were not satisfactory.
Comments
The mission visited only one school and one Female residence and
on the Basis of a very small sample generalization is not
possible.
General Comment
The mission has recognized that the project has achieved the
desired objectives.
