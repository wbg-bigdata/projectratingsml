1. OVERVIEW OF THE PRIMARY EDUCATION SYSTEM
Structure and Distinguishing Characteristics
1.01      Education in Pakistan differs from that of most other developing
nations in many ways, the most important of which are:
(a) separate schools are operated for males and females, with
a significant disparity between the sexes in enrollment ratios:
73% for males and 33% for females at the primary level;
(b) educational administration and financing are divided between
federal and provincial governments; together the two levels of
government allocate less than 2% of GNP to education (compared to
3-5% in other developing nations); and
(c) limited opportunities for basic education, coupled with low demand
among parts of the society, result in low literacy rates (24%
overall, male 36% and female 11%); unlike most other developing
nations, the literacy rate is remaining roughly constant.
1.02      The formal education system is comprised of the following levels:
Primary:                    - Grades 1-5        Ages 5-9 (nominally)
Secondary:  Middle          - Grades 6-8        Ages 10-12t
High            - Grades 9-10      Ages 13-14
Intermediate                - Grades 11-12    Ages 15-16
Degree and Postgraduate    - Grades 13-14+   Ages 17-18+
Overall, enrollments are increasing slightly faster than the population
growth rate, and primary enrollment ratios increased from 50% to 53% between
1972 and 1977. Access is imbalanced with significantly lower enrollment
of girls generally and of both sexes in rural areas. Less than 4% of primary
and secondary pupils attend private schools. Educational content has a
strongly academic and theoretical bias with little relevance to life and
work, even in the technical and vocational courses. Rigid, memory-based
teaching is the rule and is reinforced by the examination system.  Teachers
and other educators are frequently absent from their duties, and difficulties
with assignment of staff are common at all levels. Multiple languages impede
learning: in 90% of the homes a regional language is spoken but education is
conducted entirely in Urdu (or English) after the early primary grades.
Problems result from the division of administrative responsibility: the
provincial governments have responsibility for building and maintaining
schools, and employing personnel, but they share responsibility for general
policy, curriculum, development of teaching materials, and planning and
finance with the federal government. Education remains seriously underfinanced,
especially at the primary level.
Education Finance
1.03      Education financing in Pakistan is characterized by:
- the low share of education in total developmental resources;



-2-
- a particularly low share of the budget allocated to the primary level;
- the division of responsibility between the federal government
(development costs) and provincial governments (recurrent costs); and
- the insignificant local community and private contributions to the
school system.
In Pakistan, public educational financing falls below the averages for LDCs
on three key indicators: (a) government revenues represent only 14-15% of
GNP compared to 16-17% in most LDCs; (b) less than 8% of public expenditures
is allocated to education (roughly 20% in other LDCs); and (c) resulting
education budgets are less than 2% of GNP (compared with 3-5% in other LDCs).
Primary education receives a lower share of the education budget than the
postsecondary level (34% vs. 38%), and improvement of the lower level has
been hampered in the past by curtailment of primary allocations in response
to budgetary pressure. A persistent problem in the sector has been the
imbalance between federal and provincial expenditures, i.e., the high ratio
of capital (30-35%) to recurrent expenditures (65-70%), which has led to
inadequate use (and hence wastage) of facilities built with federal funds.
Recurrent costs per student are especially low at the primary and secondary
levels and contribute to the low quality of the system.
1.04      Since recurrent expenditures constitute the bulk of education
expenditures, the potential for raising the level of recurrent expenditures
determines the scope for expansion and improvement of the education sector.
The Fifth Five-Year Plan sets the target for recurrent expenditures on
primary education at 70% of total primary allocations. However, recurrent
expenditures are provided solely by provincial governments; they already
constitute a significant proportion (roughly 30%) of total provincial
revenue expenditures, and increases in the provincial budgets are severely
limited. The provincial budgets have reported yearly deficits throughout
the 1970s, and the recent (since 1975/76) increase in federal transfers
reflects their worsening budgetary situation and increased reliance on
federal funds at a time when the federal budget itself is under considerable
strain.
Primary Education /1
1.05      Primary education serves a total enrollment of more than 5 million,
about half of the relevant age group (Table 1.1), 73% for boys and 33% for
girls (Table 2.1). Sixty percent of total enrollment is located in Punjab
(Table 1.2) while Baluchistan has only about 2%. In the five grades, girls
comprise less than 30% of total enrollment, and in Baluchistan and NWFP the
corresponding figure is only 17%. National enrollment declines from over
1.8 million in grade 1 to 0.7 million in grade 5. Primary schools are small;
there are over 52,000 (one-third for girls) and the typical school has
100-110 students and 2-3 teachers. Eighty-five percent of schools are rural.
Over 130,000 teachers are assigned to primary schools (Table 1.3). Two
other types of primary education continue on a limited scale: Mosque schools
/1   Other levels and types of education are described in a current Education
Sector Memo, December 12, 1978.

where the Imam teaches children Islamic studies and the Holy Quran and
Mohallah Schools where literate women in the local area teach girls the Holy
Quran, Islamic studies and skills of home management. These schools which
also serve out-of-school youth and adults, have been designated for added
emphasis in an interim educational plan published in October 1978 (para 1.13).

1.06      The primary school curriculum covers seven subjects in a 6 day, 26-
hour school week: language, 8 hours; mathematics, science and Islamic studies,
4 hours each; and social studies, health and physical education, and art, 2-3
hours each. The curriculum does not sufficiently emphasize basic language and
numeracy skills, which account for less than half of the total time, while the
time devoted to health, physical education and arts roughly equals the time
allocated to language. In practice, science and art are often neglected or
eliminated because materials are in short supply and teachers are unable to
teach the subject. There are many official and unofficial holidays, and the
number of actual school days per year ranges between 120-130 compared to
150-180 days in other developing nations. Schools are often closed during
inclement weather, or the many children in grades 1 and 2 are excused and
their accommodations used by the few students in the upper grades.
1.07      Textbooks for each grade for four major subjects (Urdu, mathematics,
social science and science) are developed and authorized by provincial text-
book boards under general guidance from the federal authorities and purchased
by pupils at prices ranging from PR 1 to PRs 4 per book. The costs of texts
are borne by the pupil's family, except in Baluchistan where some free or
subsidized textbooks are provided. On a given school day, about half the
students are without textbooks, particularly serious in a system where instruc-
tion is based on the textbook and where there are no other instructional
materials. The content of texts has recently been revised, but in general
texts do not make sufficient use of local or regional examples. No information
is available on the educational achievement of those who do complete primary
school.

1.08      Management and supervision of primary education is provided by
provincial education organizations through delegation of functions to division
and district levels. In fact, the primary and secondary levels (grades 1-10)
are linked under the term "school education" and are managed together. This
results in overemphasis of grades 6-10 to the neglect of grades 1-5 since
managers perceive the upper grades to have more prestige and importance.
Grades 1-10 are under the control of a District Education Officer (DEO),
usually male, but in a few districts there are two - one of each sex. The DEO
is assisted by one or more deputies (DDEOs) and a larger number of male and



- 5 -
female assistant education officers (AEOs)./l The overall ratio of AEOs to
teachers is about 1:250, but since AEOs also spend most of their time on
secondary school matters, the nominal number of teachers per AEO at the
primary level is at least 500 for the typical district and over 700 in some.
With an average school size of two teachers, the typical AEO is expected to
cover 250-350 schools, largely without transport: a reasonable ratio would
be 25-40 schools each visited 5-8 times per year. As a result of these
constraints, primary schools remain largely unsupervised.
1.09      Teacher training for primary education is conducted in one-year
courses (Table 1.4). Primary teacher training is provided in 64 Teacher
Training Institutes (TTIs) that have an average capacity of only 150 students
and a combined output of about 12,000 p.a., less than 10% of the current
stock of 130,000 teachers. Most TTIs are divided by sex, and less than
one-third cater to females. As a result of inadequate overall capacity,
about 14% of male teachers and nearly 25% of female teachers enter service
without training; most of them are qualified by external examinations /2
while others are expected to take preservice training after a few years of
experience (see Table 2.2). Facilities of the TTIs are also inadequate;
there are often no laboratories, workshops or libraries, and almost no
equipment or suitable furniture. A new curriculum for primary teacher
training announced in 1976 divides a 48-week instructional year (33 hours per
week) into 10 topic subjects and short and long-term practice teaching of 3
and 5-weeks' duration. Seven curricula cover methods of teaching the prin-
cipal primary school subjects and the remaining three include principles of
education, child development, and school and classroom organization and
management. Although this new plan is an improvement over the previous
curriculum, operation is marginal due to weaknesses in staff, facilities and
equipment. Almost all TTI staff were prepared as secondary teachers;
virtually none has ever taught in primary schools and many have not even
taught in general secondary schools. As a result, they are unable to prepare
their students for the physical conditions and pupil needs and behavior in
primary schools. Staff often resort solely to lecture methods inappropriate
for the type of teaching needed in primary schools.
1.10      Both preservice and in-service training need to be expanded and
improved, and plans have been developed to cover population and enrollment
growth and to reduce class size. However, they have been largely suspended
because many trained teachers remain unemployed in urban areas and no way has
been found of inducing them to accept posts in rural areas. Major shortcomings
in the preservice training system include irrelevant curricula, poor teaching
and inadequately motivated students, many of whom do not enter teaching after
training. The Government plans to shift to a predominantly female primary
/1 For example, for the 21 districts of the largest province, Punjab, there
are 25 DEOs (4 female), 30 DDEOs (16 female) and 361 AEOs (110 female);
the ratio of primary teachers to administrators varies from 79 in Lahore
to 278 in Faisalabad, compared to the mean for the state of 184.
/2 External examinations are expected to be phased out in accordance with
the Credit Agreement of the Third Education Project (Cr. 678-PAK).

school training force: the present output of female teachers falls far short
of anticipated demand, and the Government therefore intends to convert some
male institutions to serve female enrollment. The supply of primary and
middle school teachers, particularly for girls' schools and for rural areas,
is expected to increase by 1980 as a result of Credit 678-PAK which will
construct and equip 2,200 additional training places to expand capacity by 10%
for males and 50% for females.

1.11      Opportunities for in-service training are limited and most teachers
only receive preservice training. The void in in-service training for
primary teachers is substantial in view of the large stock of teachers in
each jurisdiction (Table 1.3). To provide in-service training, the Government
created 17 centers to offer this type of training. The four provinces and
the Federal Territories each have a center for secondary training, but there
is no primary level center in Baluchistan. In addition, five general centers
(one in Punjab and four in the Federal Territories) focus on curricula design
and research. The Government now places special emphasis on in-service
training in view of the introduction of new textbooks, a trend toward reorien-
tation of the curricula and institution of a new curriculum for preservice
education. There is also concern about the 25% of existing teachers who
have had no preservice training. A program to provide all existing teachers
with a short period of in-service training by 1980 was announced in 1977 using
the centers mentioned above and a special corps of master trainers who would
conduct training at the local level. This plan is being implemented slowly;
however, it is not equal to the need to cover about 130,000 existing teachers
and only about 10,000 have benefitted to date. This program is viewed as a



-7-
crash measure, since a continuing and recurrent training system is needed to
handle at least one-third of the primary teachers each year. Staff and
facilities used for preservice training should form a nucleus for in-service
training. In-service training that is available also lacks quality and
relevance. Instruction is given entirely by lectures conducted by staff who
have no primary school experience. Daily sessions are long and do not retain
the interest of trainees. No emphasis is given to the teachers' priority
need for practical means to handle large multigrade classes in language and
mathematics.
Educational Plans
1.12      Under Pakistan's first four plans (1955-75), education spending has
aimed at physical expansion of the system and quality improvement; however, the
level of public spending on education has never risen above 2% of GNP, with
primary education receiving a smaller share of the total education budget than
secondary and higher levels (Table 1.5). Although there has been substantial
expansion at all levels (see IBRD #2018-PAK, Table 15, p. 47), implementation
has generally been unsatisfactory (except under the Second Plan), and important
physical targets remain, for example, in primary education where enrollments
have consistently fallen below targets (Table 1.5).

1.13      The education policy of 1972 increased the emphasis on primary
education; it set targets of universal education for boys by 1979 and for
girls by 1984, but enrollments did not grow to meet these goals (Table 1.5).
The Fifth Plan for 1978-83 established targets of universal enrollment of
boys in grade 1 by 1982/83 and 90% enrollment in grades 1-5 by 1986/87;
similar targets for girls were omitted, but the targeted 58% increase in
enrollment over the five years demonstrates a clear intention to try to
close the enrollment gap between boys and girls. The need for "extraordinary
efforts," including compulsion, is mentioned. A similar policy was reiterated
in an interim plan issued in October 1978, and a target date of 1992 was
specified for universal primary education for girls. While the share of
primary education in education development expenditure was below planned
levels (averaging 13.2% for 1972-77), its share in recurrent expenditures
increased from 30% to 45% between 1967 and 1977 and is projected to remain at
37% during the next five years (Table 1.6). The Fifth Plan allocations
reflect this increased emphasis on primary education, with primary education
spending exceeding the levels for secondary and higher education for the first
time (Table 1.5). Development expenditure for primary education is increased,
but at the same time the ratio between recurrent and development expenditures
is improved. A special provision of the Plan would prevent funds allocated
for primary and secondary education from transfer to other levels. The
second focus of the Plan is consolidation and quality improvements at all
levels. Overall, the level of education spending under the Plan would rise
to 3.7% of GNP. The targets are ambitious for enrollments, school facilities,
supplies of instructional materials, particularly in view of past experience
in construction, cooperation from local communities and the low commitment
of primary school teachers.

Bank Group Participation
1.14      Three IDA credits totalling US$27.5 million have been made to
the education sector in Pakistan. These projects were mainly (71%) directed
to postsecondary and higher education, and almost entirely (98%) to agricul-
tural, technical and teacher education. The first two education projects
(Cr 50-PAK, 1964 and Cr 206-PAK, 1970) provided US$8.5 million and US$4
million, respectively, to improve and expand postsecondary education (an agri-
cultural university, industrial technician training and an engineering
college). The Third Education Project (Cr 678-PAK, 1977) is providing



- 9 -
US$15 million to assist in expanding and improving: (a) middle and higher
level agricultural education; and (b) general teacher training, particularly
in rural areas and among females. All three projects have had implementation
problems: shortages of local funds and problems with civil works contractors
delayed the first two projects; and all three projects have had problems in
utilization of technical assistance.
1.15      In addition to project activities the Bank has recently completed
two major sector studies in education and related fields: The Education
chapter of the April 1978 Population Planning and Social Services Report
(Report No. 2018-PAK) and the December 1978 Education Sector Memorandum
(Report 2303-PAK).
1.16      The Government and IDA have shared three objectives in assistance
to education, namely, meeting manpower needs, improving quality and - more
recently - increasing equity (for rural population and among females). The
first objective, expansion of professional and technical education, was
pursued through the First and Second Education Projects. The completion
report of the First Education Project concluded that the project was producing
manpower in excess of demand although project institutions operated at less
than 60% capacity. Qualitatively, the investment in agricultural education
(about 80% of the project) was successful, but little quality improvement took
place in the technical institutes (20% of project total). The Second Education
Project appears to be successfully meeting manpower needs, but qualitatively
this project appears less successful: student/staff ratios are high, and
staff quality has been insufficiently improved. It is still too early to
determine the extent to which the objectives are being met in the Third
Education Project.

2. ISSUES IN PRIMARY EDUCATION
Problems
2.01      Unequal Opportunity.  During the period 1966-78, primary school
enrollments expanded at an average annual rate of 4.8% to raise the overall
enrollment ratio from 40% to 54%; however, substantial inequities in access
exist by sex and region (Table 2.1). The lack of educational opportunities
for girls is reflected in their low initial enrollment in primary schools
(47% never enroll), and for rural people generally by the limited coverage
of schooling in rural areas. Access is affected by the system of separate
boys' and girls' schools outside most urban areas, which contributes to
unequal school density (square miles per school) for males and females; for
instance, female density in Sind and Baluchistan is only about 20% of male
density, and for the nation as a whole, it is only 45% (Table 2.1). The
unequal provision of facilities is reinforced by the unbalanced distribution
of teachers, with a surplus of female teachers in some urban areas and
shortages in neighboring rural schools.

2.02      Wastage.  High dropout rates, contributing to overall low enrollment
levels, show wide variation by sex.  Between 1970 and 1975, about half the
students who entered grade 1 dropped out before grade 5, ranging from
45% of all students in Sind and Punjab to 64% in Baluchistan (and for girls
from 34% in Sind to 71% in Baluchistan). The highest dropout rate occurred
between grades 1 and 2: 25% for boys and 40% for girls. Enrollment of boys
in grade 1 in 1977/78 was actually above the total five-year old males (due
to overage students), while enrollment of girls in grade 1 was only 53% of
the female population. In Baluchistan and NWFP less than a third of five-
year old females were enrolled: 230 and 300 in 1,000, respectively. Higher
dropout rates in the lower grades means that classes in the lower grades are
large (50-60 pupils) and classes in the upper grades are small (10-20 pupils),
which leads to inefficient use of teachers. Most of the enrollment growth
expected in the next decade due to reduced dropout could be covered by the
present stock of teachers.
2.03      Low Quality.  A critical factor in high dropout is the poor quality
of instruction and resulting low learning achievement. In many schools, the
physical conditions are so oppressive and discipline so harsh that attendance
is discouraged and dropout induced. High rates of teacher absenteeism, a
reflection of lax supervision, contribute to indifference among students.
Teachers tend to be ineffective in covering the curriculum because they lack
proper training (paras. 1.09-1.11) and have insufficient and inappropriate
instructional materials. An important deterrent to effective teaching in
small schools is the need for most instruction to take place in multigrade
class groups, since preservice training does not prepare teachers adequately
for this task. A conventional measure of school quality, the percentage of
teachers with less than full training (Table 2.2), indicates significant
variation by province and by sex. The consequences of poor quality together
with low enrollments and heavy dropout mean that primary education does not
adequately provide general literacy for the coming generation and nearly half
of the money is spent on pupils who drop out before grade 4.

2.04      Qualitative problems were summarized in a recent statement by the
Government:
"About 60 percent of all primary schools in the country do not have
accommodation which can meet the minimum requirements. There are
many schools which do not have any accommodation at all and function
in 'open air'. These schools continue to move from one location to
another in search of shelter against severe heat, cold and rain.
Female teachers are in short supply in rural areas, and teacher
absenteeism is reported to be rampant. In many cases, teachers,
particularly women, remain on the payroll of rural schools without
ever going there. Many female teachers do not stay in rural areas
because of the feeling of insecurity caused by the lack of covered
accommodation for the school. Thus, there are many schools which
remain without teachers and exist only in the official records.
The administrative machinery, though fully aware of the situation
in each area, does not adopt any corrective measures. The
supervisory arrangements are not at all geared to offering any
assistance or guidance to teachers on educational matters.
Instead, the supervision/inspection is law-and-order oriented and
is generally carried out in response to local complaints. Because
of poor means of communication, absence of reasonable facilities
of travelling and preoccupation of supervisory staff with such
administrative responsibilities as disbursement of salaries, no
system of school supervision seems to exist and no one knows what
goes on in most of the schools."/1
2.05      Financial Constraints.  A program to improve and expand primary
education will clearly cost more. Although education is being given higher
priority under the Fifth Plan than in the past, government spending for
education, particularly at the primary level, is low and compares poorly to
spending in other developing countries (Table 1.6).  A major aim of the
Fifth Plan (para 1.13) is universal primary education for boys by 1987, and
under an interim plan (para 1.13), 1992 was set as the target for univeral
primary education for girls.  The budgetary allocation to primary education
has therefore increased under the Fifth Plan from 15% to 35% of the total
educational development budget (Table 1.5) , which should reverse the present
trend of secondary and higher education expanding more rapidly than primary
education. External assistance is expected to play an important role in
maintaining the recently expressed focus on primary education. The stated
educational objectives and priority, particularly to primary education with
special emphasis on female participation, are sound (para 1.13). However, the
achievement of targets depends on, inter alia, the Government's ability to
resist socio-political pressure from middle and upper class families, which
under previous plans resulted in funds allocated to the primary level being
used to expand postprimary education. The Fifth Plan document therefore
specifically prohibits transfer of the primary education budget to other
uses.

- 13 -
2.06      Even if sufficient development funds were provided for primary
education, provincial governments might not be able to mobilize the resources
needed to hire and pay additional teachers and to maintain facilities. For
example, universal primary education of boys and 80% enrollment of girls by
2000 /1 would involve an enrollment of 20 million children, a fourfold
increase over the present 5 million. Resources available to meet this need
will also grow but almost certainly at a lower rate than enrollment. Thus
without a significant change in the methods of delivery of primary education,
costs would increase directly in proportion to enrollment, would consume a
larger share of GNP, and would still not produce student output with literacy,
numeracy or other attributes needed for development of the nation.
Causes
2.07      The causes of inequitable access, high dropout and poor quality
are complex. They involve multiple economic, social and educational factors
which are interrelated.
2.08      Economic.  Opportunity costs are a major factor in nonenrollment
and especially in dropout. Child labor is prevalent among poor families and
includes such tasks as working in the fields, drawing water, or attending
other children in the home. School and crop calendars are not well synchro-
nized, and a child who has to work in the fields may fall so far behind in
his classwork that he drops out of school entirely. The direct cost of
attendance is another cause of dropout, especially for children from large,
poor families; although textbooks are relatively inexpensive, four books are
needed per year, and they often wear out and need to be replaced before
the school year is over.
2.09      Low levels of expenditure on primary education also contribute to
low enrollment and poor quality. Many areas do not have the buildings
necessary for organized teaching, but the shortage of teachers in rural areas
is an even more serious problem. Teachers, particularly females, often prefer
to remain unemployed in urban areas than to accept a rural position because of
low salaries, lack of allowances and promotion possibilities, and inadequate
housing in rural areas. In addition, inadequate spending on textbooks means
that most schools lack needed teaching materials./2
2.10      Socio-cultural.  Lack of parental support for primary education is
another major reason for nonattendance in rural areas. Traditional parental
attitudes favor protecting and educating girls at home, and the concept
of schooling in a nonreligious setting (compared with the orthodox view of
education by the Imam in a mosque) has not yet been fully accepted in many
rural areas. Virtually all decisions about the school (e.g., location and
appointment of teachers) are made without local participation adding to
/1 Much less optimistic than the government targets (para. 2.05).
/2 Studies in other Asian countries point to availability of teaching
materials as a crucial determinant of learning achievement.

parents' impressions of impotence in matters of village school management.
Moreover, the schools tend to be set apart from the local culture and the
content of teaching programs is frequently irrelevant to the local environment.
Some parents believe there is little monetary gain or social prestige attached
to completion of primary school if it is not followed by attendance in middle
school. The low priority given to primary education by the Government in the
past helps confirm this attitude.
2.11      Educational.  Reference has already been made to several educational
factors involved in low quality and attendance, viz. lack of teachers in rural
areas and inadequate supplies of teaching materials (paras. 2.03-2.04). The
quality of teaching is also an important factor in educational attainment.
Most teachers have received preservice training, but this deals with general
pedagogical principles rather than problems of teaching in local schools.
Teachers receive virtually no professional support from the education system
(paras. 1.09-1.11). Supervisors seldom visit primary schools and instead
deal almost exclusively with the secondary level and general administrative
matters (para. 1.08).
A Strategy for Primary Education
2.12      A strategy is needed for primary education to overcome the causes of
inequitable access, low enrollments and poor quality. Since the causes are
complex, the strategy to overcome them is necessarily complex. Moreover,
since conditions vary among provinces, different strategies should be developed
to take local conditions into account. The following paragraphs broadly
outline the four possible components of a strategy to improve and expand rural
education at the primary level.
2.13      Equal Opportunity.  To improve enrollment coverage at feasible cost
in rural areas, particularly for girls, the Government should:
(a) undertake a program to increase the supply of teachers in rural
areas through such measures as:
(i)  adjusting salary scales for teachers in rural areas;
(ii) introducing allowances for "hardship" or transportation;
(iii)  modifying the career system to give experienced teachers
opportunities for supervisory jobs;
(iv) recruiting less qualified village women as teacher assistants
in areas without teachers, and providing in-service training;
and
(v) providing housing accommodations for females;
(b) provide school facilities at appropriate locations determined
through systematic school mapping, and involve local communities in
school building and maintenance.



-15 -
2.14      Wastage.  To increase at feasible costs the proportion of grade 5
completion among students who enroll initially in grade 1, the Government should:
(a)  introduce additional supervision at the local level;
(b) encourage parental involvement in school management;
(c) adapt the school calendar to cropping patterns;
(d) experiment with providing direct incentives for attendance, such
as free textbooks and meals; and
(e) introduce education and orientation programs for parents to
reduce the discontinuity between school and home.
2.15      Quality.  To improve the attainment of basic education skills at
feasible costs, the Government should:
(a)  provide systematic professional support for teachers, including
regular in-service training and supervision;
(b) provide effective administrative control to reduce absenteeism
of teachers and pupils;
(c) increase the supply of teaching materials for students and experi-
ment with self-instructional materials;
(d) introduce simple formative evaluation of student progress;
(e) develop a bilingual curriculum using the local language as the
medium of instruction during the first three grades; and
(f) adapt curricula to local environments, by developing programs of a
more practical nature that emphasize local needs and use local
resources.
2.16      Costs.  The purpose of these strategies is to improve and expand
primary education without creating expenditures that cannot be met by the
federal and provincial authorities. Since teacher salaries constitute the
major part of recurrent primary education expenditures (over 98%), the
financial feasibility of the overall strategy depends mainly on reducing the
costs of teacher salary per student. Three approaches are possible:
(a) increasing the number of students taught per teacher, by increasing
class sizes or the number of class groups handled by each teacher;/l
/1 Research in other Asian countries suggests that marginal increases in
class size do not appear to affect achievement adversely.



- 16 -
(b) reducing salaries by recruiting less qualified teachers at lower rates
of pay; and (c) moving toward larger schools to increase economies of scale
and reduce the need for multiple grade teaching. These measures could be
accompanied by steps to develop self-instructional materials and provide
teachers with multi-class teaching techniques. The Government could also
experiment with ways of reducing capital costs by constructing schools in
areas of low school density (Table 2.1) and adding classrooms to existing
schools in other areas. At present, the cost of constructing primary school
facilities alone would prohibit any significant expansion in the number of
schools. Low cost schools could be constructed using local materials and
community self-help in constructing and maintaining buildings. Systematic
school mapping could also reduce the buildings required to cover a given
population. Together these approaches could help to reduce substantially the
total cost of a primary school building program.
2.17      Expenditures to increase the quality of instruction could contri-
bute indirectly (through reduced wastage) to a lower cost per graduate. A
higher quality of instruction and increased local supervision would presumably
lead to a lower dropout rate, which would result in better utilization of
existing (teacher and building) resources and in fewer student-years of
instruction per graduate. Expenditures on management and supervision could
also contribute to improved quality through better teaching.

3. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The above overall strategy could be accomplished only in the long
term and implementation should therefore be phased. The proposed project
would constitute the first phase, namely experimentation to determine the
best way of overcoming the major problems in primary education (paras. 2.01-
2.06). The proposed project would include the principal elements of the
primary education strategy (paras. 2.12-2.17), and analysis of results should
indicate which combinations of factors could be used most effectively on a
national scale; however, restrictions on implementation capacity and financial
resources and a need to keep the project at a manageable dimension do not
permit inclusion of all items listed./l The proposed project would pursue
four major objectives:
(a)  increased access to primary schools, especially for girls and for
rural poverty groups; this would be sought by (i) providing school
facilities and materials; (ii) providing more female teachers; and
(iii) enhanced supervision intended to improve school-public
relations and overcome parental indifference to enrollment;
(b)  reduced wastage, principally by reducing dropout and repetition,
through improved facilities, materials and instruction, and super-
vision (to reduce teacher absenteeism), and by working with
parents and community leaders to avert dropout;
(c)  improved quality of instruction to attain higher and more lasting
pupil achievement through (i) recurrent in-service teacher training
in methods of teaching and classroom management designed to make
better use of school time, and (ii) local, more frequent supervision.
(d) reduced costs by reducing wastage inherent in dropout, introducing
lower cost teachers, and moving toward larger class and school sizes.
The project proposes a limited approach to these objectives: coverage is
low enough to avoid large-scale investment in unproved approaches, yet large
enough to provide statistically significant experimentation and research.
The project would foster the development of local research capability by
extensive involvement of local staff as project researchers in the experimen-
tation and evaluation aspects of the project. Special training would be
provided for this purpose.  Local staff of universities and Institutes of
Educational Research would thus gain expertise and experience to enable them
to implement subsequent phases of a long-term improvement program.
/1 Certain elements of the overall strategy (para. 2.13-2.15) were omitted
to avoid undue risks, limit project dimensions and improve implementation;
these include salary adjustments, school meals, bilingual curricula and
self-help construction.



- 18 -
Content, Scope and Sequence
3.02      To attain its objectives, the proposed project would provide
assistance to the central and provincial governments in four components
to:
- strengthen the teacher service,
- expand supervision,
- improve instructional materials, and
- provide physical facilities.
The most important elements in the project are teacher training and super-
vision. Intensive and recurrent in-service training would be provided
throughout the project period based on the hypothesis that more frequent and
more practical training would improve teaching effectiveness. Improved
supervision of primary schools and staff would be provided through the
introduction of new primary school supervisors at two levels (supervisors and
learning coordinators) below the district unit of government. This approach
is based on the hypothesis that closer and more active supervision would
result in less teacher absenteeism, improved teacher performance, and closer
relationships among schools, parents and community. Additionally, the
project would experiment with inter alia lower cost, locally recruited
'lassistant teachers"/l willing to serve in rural areas, larger class and
school sizes, and low cost building design to control costs and performance;
provision of instructional materials as a means of raising pupil achievement;
and improved school-community-parent relationships to increase enrollment and
reduce dropouts.
3.03      Overall, this first phase project would include more than 4,000
schools, nearly 10,000 teachers, and over 380,000 presently enrolled students
and about 400,000 children who are not now enrolled, of whom over 70% are
females. The project would be limited to rural areas; it would cover 7-8% of
the nation's primary schools, teachers and enrolled children (Table 3.1 and
Map IBRD 14055). However, the scope of project content and coverage would
differ by province in order to: (a) concentrate project activities in the
two most disadvantaged provinces in terms of opportunities for girls (Baluchi-
stan and NWFP); and (b) provide for varying approaches to the components to
be tested. Higher coverage in Baluchistan and NWFP would be necessary to
assure adequate numbers of schools and teachers of both sexes for statisti-
cally significant experimentation, to provide greater equity in distribution
of educational resources and to permit the project to cover entire political
subdivisions.
/1  The term "assistant teacher" was chosen by the Government to denote a
less qualified person not fully entitled to the designation of teacher.
However, the performance of such personnel is often superior to that of
"regular" teachers, because assistants are employed nearer home, have
better rapport with pupils and parents and understanding of local needs
and tradition, and are more appreciative of a chance for cash employment.

based are from Fifth Five-Year Plan, 1977/78.  Number of teachers
estimated from 1975/76 data.
3.04      The project would be divided into three periods:
(a) Preparatory. A period of about 20 months devoted primarily to
selection and training of personnel, construction of physical
facilities, and design of experiments.
(b) Experimental School Years. Three school years beginning in March
of 1981, 1982 and 1983 in which the impact of the project components
would be measured and evaluated.
(c) Analysis of Results. A follow-up period of six to nine months in
which final experimental results would be analyzed and conclusions
reached.
Project Components
Teacher Service (Proposed Outlay: US$4.6 million equivalent) /1
3.05      The proposed project would strengthen the teacher service by adding
a new category of assistant teacher and providing a new pattern of in-service
/1 This and subsequent statements of proposed outlays, exclude contingencies.
Costs of experiments, transport, training, experts and salaries divided
proportionately between the teacher service and supervision components
(see Table 4.2).

teacher training. Assistance to the teacher service would be the largest
project component in terms of number of participants -*d *ci a and the one
considered most critical to achieving project objectives.
3.06      Assistant Teachers.  The project would finance the salaries of 340
assistant teachers, recruited to teach in schools near their homes (often in
the same village) to avoid housing problems. At least 190 (56%) would be
female. They would have completed grade 8 or have acquired the equivalent
achievement through independent study or experience. The assistant teacher
positions would be created as a means of utilizing unemployed rural persons
who would be familiar with the community and could teach near their homes; the
use of these less qualified teaching staff represents a promising cost reducing
factor and a means of supplying female teachers in rural areas. Special
preservice training and recurrent in-service training would be provided.
3.07      In-Service Teacher Training.  Two major improvements in in-service
training of teachers are foreseen under the proposed project: (a) pattern:
more frequent training (para. 3.08), and (b) content: more attention to
teaching methods, classroom management and parent and community relations
(para. 3.09). Training costs, and travel and subsistence allowances of
teacher trainees would be financed under the project. A total of over 10,000
teachers and assistant teachers would receive training, divided among the
provinces as follows:
Numbers of Teachers                    %
Punjab    Sind   Baluchistan   NWFP    Total   female
Existing teachers        4,500    1,200       1,200       3,000    9,900      31
Assistant teachers          100      100        100          40       340     56
3.08      A new pattern of training would be established to alleviate problems
caused by the present inadequate pre- and in-service teacher training (paras. 1.11-
1.13). During the four project years, recurrent training would be provided as
follows:
(a) Annually: each teacher and assistant teacher would receive 2-3
weeks each year of intensive resident training on general topics
conducted by project trainers (para. 3.18); and
(b) Alternate Months: each teacher and assistant teacher would receive
2-3 days of training on common teaching problems organized by
locally based supervisors (para. 3.13).
3.09      The training content would concentrate on subjects that are important
to learning achievement, but are neglected in present preservice training,
including (a) practical methods of teaching each major subject; (b) under-
standing of the ways children learn; (c) effective management of multigrade
classes; (d) parent and community relationships; and (e) ways to adapt the
curriculum to the social and physical environment of the pupil. The training
would include ways to instruct without resorting to harsh discipline and ways
to deal effectively with parents and community leaders.



- 21 -
Supervision (Proposed Outlay: US$2.5 million equivalent)
3.10      The present system lacks adequate supervision at and below the
district level, resulting in low teacher morale and performance, and a high
level of absenteeism.   The proposed project would aim to extend the system of
supervision below the district level and would add new supervisory personnel.
The proposed project would finance salaries and transport for new staff and
training for all supervisory staff in the project areas.
3.11      The project would introduce supervision for primary schools below
the district level of government by creating and providing salaries for two new
posts, supervisor and learning coordinator, as follows:
Present Pattern                   Proposed Pattern
I District Education Officer I   I District Education Officer I
I Assistant Education Officerl   I Assistant Education Officerl
I Supervisor
I Learning Coordinator      I
I Primary School            I     I Primary School             I
Ratios of new supervisory staff to schools would differ among the provinces:

These provincial differences would be used to measure the extent of coverage
possible under varying population densities. The new supervisory positions,
coupled with the position of assistant teacher, would create a five-step
career ladder in primary education: assistant teacher, teacher, headmaster,
learning coordinator and supervisor.
3.12      The new position of supervisor would be created in three /1 of the
four provinces, and of learning coordinator in all provinces.  Unlike the
existing inspectorate, the work of staff in these new positions would be
exclusively devoted to the primary level. Qualifications for supervisors
would be five years' experience as a successful primary teacher and evidence
of the leadership and counselling potential demanded by the position. Learning
coordinators would be recruited among teachers with at least two years of
successful teaching in primary schools who live in the immediate vicinity.
3.13      Learning coordinators would contribute to various aspects of the
educational process and would be guided and assisted by the supervisors. They
would support teaching staff, both by providing helpful supervision, and by
organizing and conducting recurrent in-service teacher training. They would
also provide classroom support by helping to develop teaching aids and by
evaluating student achievement. Another function, to expand enrollment and
improve attendance, would be achieved through individual counselling of
children and parents, as well as through parental meetings that stress the
value of school attendance. In a wider context, the learning coordinators
would encourage community involvement by identifying ways in which the school
could interact more effectively with the community, by conducting adult
evening classes, and by initiating community self-help programs in education.
The supervisors would support these efforts, and in addition would organize
and conduct group training for learning coordinators and teachers, and provide
a link between the new supervisory staff and existing officials.
3.14      The project would train all supervisory staff at and below the
district level in counselling techniques, personnel leadership, teacher
in-service training, and parent and community relationships (paras 3.17-3.19).
Instructional Materials and Curricula (Proposed Outlay: US$1.1 million equivalent)
3.15      The project would provide financing for textbooks, teachers' guides,
library books, and school and classroom equipment for project schools, as
follows:

This component would also include technical assistance and training to develop
new and additional materials for trial in schools. Attention would also be
given to modification of curricula in accord with local and provincial needs
and culture (para. 2.12).
Physical Facilities (Proposed Outlay: US$5.3 million equivalent)
3.16      The project would finance construction and furniture for classrooms,
residences for female teachers, and small resource centers for in-service
teacher education, as follows:

Most classroom construction would be additions to existing schools rather than
creation of new schools to achieve larger school size (para. 2.01). These
project facilities would vary within each province to permit testing of enroll-
ment, dropout and learning achievements under different conditions. The
general impact of the construction component would be assessed by the effect
of improved facilities on pupil enrollment, retention and achievement; on
teacher attendance, performance and job satisfaction; and on community pride
in schools under the experimentation program.

Staff Development and Research
Training
3.17       The successful implementation of the four project components would
depend largely on training received by project personnel. An extensive
training program has therefore been developed to cover eight categories of
personnel (Table 3.4).

school years of
supervisors and teachers
A cadre of about 220 male and female trainers recruited from teacher training
institutes, high schools with teacher training sections, colleges and univer-
sities, would comprise the major staff resource for the training program.
About one-tenth of the project trainers would receive intensive local and
overseas training (as part of segment A) to enable them to instruct the
complement of the project trainers (under segment B). The project trainers
would conduct initial training for all remaining project personnel (segment
C-1) before the start of the first experimental school year (March 1981).
Recurrent training (segment C-2) would be provided for teachers (para. 3.08)
and supervisors during the three experimental school years. During this
period, semi-annual or annual project seminars would continue the training of
higher level and more specialized project personnel. Under the project,
technical assistance would be provided to support the project trainers;
project assistance would finance part of the trainers' salaries, as well as
travel and per diem allowances.
3.19      Overseas training would be provided under segment A to allow key
personnel to gain firsthand knowledge of successful primary systems elsewhere
with special attention to curriculum development, teaching children from
underprivileged homes in small schools with multigraded classes and interaction
of teachers and supervisors in rural settings. The overseas training would
take place in both developed and developing countries to promote observation
of a wide range of approaches. These staff would then adapt effective practices



- 26 -
to needs in Pakistan and would promote their use in the subsequent training
segments. Suitable composition of this group would thus be critical to the
success of the training and therefore of the project. The following categories
of personnel would be included in segment A:
Table 3.6:  COMPOSITION OF THE "SEGMENT A' GROUP SELECTED FOR TRAINING
Category            Approx. no.                Rationale
Project staff               6         Directors of Training (1 Fed, 4 Prov)
District administrators   4          Familiarization with training (1 each prov)
Involvement in training (1 each prov)
Project trainers           25         1 in each major subject (language, math,
science and social studies) from each
province + reserve for specialties
Researchers                 5         Future research in training
Total                 40
The target female participation in this group would be at least 20%. Other
criteria for selection would include: knowledge of and experience in the
primary level of education; training experience; and facility in English.
Experimentation and Evaluation
3.20      The central purpose of the proposed project is experimentation into
the contribution of selected inputs to achievement of project objectives. Of
particular importance are solutions to persistent problems in primary education
in five areas: recruitment and retention of female teachers in rural areas;
teacher absenteeism; teaching effectiveness; school, parent and community
relations; and recurrent costs. The project would permit experimentation
in each of these areas to answer the following five questions:
(a) whether (i) provision of female teacher residences, and (ii)
establishment of assistant teachers can aid recruitment of female
teachers;
(b) whether increased training of teachers results in improved pupil
achievement;
(c) whether improved supervision reduces teacher absenteeism;
(d) whether increased contact between parents and teachers results in
greater enrollment and less dropout (especially of girls); and



- 27 -
(e) whether per student costs can be reduced through use of teacher
assistants and movement toward larger class and school sizes
(para. 5.04).
3.21      Measurements to answer these questions can be divided into four
categories:
(a) data on population, enrollment, pupil and teacher attendance,
dropouts and repetitions secured from schools through management
channels and school mapping capability;
(b)  benchmark tests of pupil achievement and attitude, and tests of
teacher knowledge and competence;
(c) measures of perceptions and attitudes of parents and community
members on education and schools; and
(d) cost data (national, provincial and by district and school).
In almost all cases the school would be the unit of measurement, but data
could be aggregated to produce figures for tehsils and districts. Control
schools (and perhaps tehsils) would be used for comparative purposes. During
negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would prepare and
send to IDA for comment (a) before the start of the first experimental school
year a report on baseline measurements and results achieved; (b) detailed
annual reports on results of project experimentation within four months of
the end of each experimental school year; and (c) at the end of the second
experimental school year a draft comprehensive proposal for the expansion
and improvement of primary education based on the tentative results of the
project.
Technical Assistance and Studies
3.22      Technical assistance would be required for two project elements:
(a) planning and organization of training, and (b) experimentation and
evaluation. Altogether the technical assistance would include: (a) about
12 man-years of expatriate specialist services; and (b) about 50 man-years
of local consultant services. The technical assistance would be divided into
two phases. The first phase would include services required before the
start of the first experimental school year (March 1981) and the second phase
would comprise the remainder to the end of the project period (September 1984).
To avoid delays experienced in earlier education projects, signing of a contract
for first phase technical assistance would be a condition of effectiveness and
signing of contract(s) for second phase specialist services would be concluded
by December 31, 1980. Advisors in training and experimentation would work in
teams to provide continuing assistance to lDcal staff. The majority of local
technical assistance would be in experimentaLion and would involve staff of
universities and education research institutes serving as project researchers.
Some local technical assistance would be made available for planning and
administration of training. Funds earmarked for the preparation of future
education projects (US$0.3 million) would also be included in the project.

Note: Totals do not always equal sum of detailed figures due to rounding.
About 64% of the physical structures and learning materials would be for class-
rooms; 26% for residences; and the remaining 10% for resource centers.
4.02      Base Cost Estimates refer to February 1979 prices.  Construction
costs have been estimated on the basis of a detailed breakdown of Bills of
Quantities for functional and simple buildings. Base costs range from
US$6.5/sq ft for classrooms to US$13.00/sq ft (including site development)
for the in-service training centers. Preliminary furniture and equipment
lists and allocations for books have been prepared for the project. These
were reviewed during negotiations and are reasonable in scope and costs.



- 30 -
Consultants' costs are estimated at US$75,000 per man-year for foreign
consultants and US$6,000/man-year for local experts. Training cost estimates
are based on detailed breakdowns of training requirements. Architectural
design services are estimated at about 2% of construction cost. Cost of
salaries is based on applicable Government scales of salaries plus allowances
(range: $360-$5,500 per man-year).
4.03      Cost Per Pupil Place.  Unit costs of facilities (net of professional
services and contingencies) are shown in the following table:

/a Refers to housing for any kind of teaching institution.
The small area per pupil place is feasible because children normally sit on
floor mats. As a result unit costs are low in comparison with other Bank-
financed projects (median value for 1974-77 primary education projects:
US$2231 pupil place). Furniture would only be provided in classrooms
for adult group use in the Punjab. Housing and teacher hostels would be
provided for female teachers in remote rural areas.
4.04      Estimated project costs include the following contingency allowances:
(a) physical contingencies (US$0.6 million) estimated at 5% of base
cost for unforseen factors; and
(b) price contingencies (US$3.6 million) calculated on the base cost
plus physical contingencies. These are based on the assumption
that construction and procurement would start in March 1979 and
take about 24 months, and local annual incremental cost through 1981
would be about 11%. Foreign annual incremental cost would be about
8% for construction and furniture and 7-1/2% for equipment and
technical assistance.
4.05      The foreign exchange component is estimated at about US$5.4 mil-
lion or about 31% of total project costs. This overall foreign exchange cost
was derived from an analysis of the labor, materials and overhead contents of



- 31 -
civil works; estimation of the amount of equipment imported from overseas;
and the foreign content of technical assistance. The resultant percentages
amount to about 20% for civil works, 29% for furniture, 60% for equipment and
books, 85% for transport, 85% for consultant services, 25% for training, 10%
for design services, and zero for local salaries and honoraria for local
experts.
4.06      Duties and Taxes.  The local customs duties and taxes on civil
works and locally procured furniture and equipment would amount to US$0.6 mil-
lion or about 10% of the estimated cost of these items including contingencies.
No customs duties are levied on directly imported educational equipment.
Project Financing
4.07      The total project cost of US$17.2 million would be financed as follows:
(a) the proposed IDA credit of US$10.0 million (60% of the total
project cost net of taxes) would meet 100% of the foreign exchange
costs and 39% of local costs;
(b) the Government would finance the remaining costs of US$7.2 million.
The pivot of the success of this project is the development of: (a) a
functional primary education supervision network (para. 3.10-3.14); and (b)
appropriate teaching staff for remote areas and for girls' education (para.
3.05-3.09). Therefore the project would finance 100% of training costs
and salaries for three types of new posts (assistant teachers, learning
coordinators and supervisors), which currently do not exist in the education
system. Necessary salary structure revisions are expected to be carried out
during the project period to permit the posts to become permanent features of
the education system upon successful completion of the project. Details of
the financial plan are given in Table 4.4. Local project cost financing
would cover US$2.1 million for salaries and allowances, US$0.1 million
for professional services related to civil works, US$1.8 million for technical
assistance and experiments, and US$0.6 million for contingency allowances.
Implementation
4.08      Administration.  The first two IDA-financed projects in Pakistan
(Credits 50-PAK and 206-PAK) suffered implementation delays of about eight
and 3.5 years, respectively. Efforts in the Third Education Project
(Credit 678-PAK) to strengthen implementation capacity and to avoid repe-
tition of earlier delays have been partially successful: (i) revolving funds
similar to the one established under the second education project (Cr. 206-PAK)
were established to avoid delays caused by rupee shortages; (ii) the project
director's training in a Bank-sponsored implementation seminar helped avoid
delays caused under earlier projects by staff's unfamiliarity with IDA proce-
dures; (iii) specific personnel in existing line agencies in two provinces was
assigned to implement the project and provincial project implementation units
were created in the other two provinces to coordinate project activities
within each province; (iv) a Federal Project Coordinating Unit with linkages

to the Bureau of Educational Planning (BEP) was established to coordinate all
aspects of the project; and (v) in an effort to avoid repetition of earlier
delays experienced in the hiring of technical assistance, the signing of
technical assistance contracts was made a condition of withdrawals for por-
tions of the project. Despite the five month implementation delay experienced
under the Third Education Project (Credit 678-PAK), there are indications
that the above measures are helping to prevent problems experienced under the
two first projects.
4.09      The proposed project would seek to build a permanent implementation
capacity within the primary education subsector.  At the federal level the
BEP would be strengthened as follows: (a) the Director would assume overall
project implementation responsibility; and (b) the BEP staff would be strength-
ened with the introduction of the following training evaluation and research
personnel: (i) three deputies in charge of training, research and operations;
(ii) a director of works; (iii) an information officer; (iv) an accountant;
and (v) four research officers. The BEP would work in close collaboration
with the unit in charge of Credit 678-PAK and the services of a project archi-
tect and a procurement officer would be shared between the two organizations.

The strengthened BEP would be responsible for coordinating the activities of
all government agencies involved in this project and would implement future
projects planned by the BEP. Its functions would, in particular, include the
following:
(a) coordination of the provincial project unit activities;
(b) assistance to the provinces in designing, implementing and evaluat-
ing training, research and experiments;
(c) recruitment of specialists and administration of technical assist-
ance agreements;
(d) intensive information program aimed at disseminating project
accomplishments outside and within the project;
(e) supply of expertise to the provinces in experimental low cost
school construction;
(f) procurement under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures
and coordination of local procurement;
(g) provision of timely and adequate flow of funds from the center to
the provinces;
(h) communications between the International Development Association
(IDA) and the provincial units; and
(i) preparation of claims for disbursements from the proceeds of the
proposed credit and periodic reporting to IDA.
4.10      At the provincial level the proposed project would seek to streng-
then implementation capacity with particular reference to training,
research and evaluation activities. The provincial departments of education
would be strengthened through the appointment of the following senior and
professional implementation personnel (Table 4.5)/1:

These staff would be located at the provincial capitals and have close liaison
with the planning wings of each Department of Education. Generally, the four
provincial planning units would: (a) organize selection of field personnel,
(assistant teachers, teachers, learning coordinators and supervisors); (b)
conduct pre- and in-service training courses; (c) organize (in collaboration
with the FPU) all activities related to educational research, evaluation and
experimentation; and (d) be responsible for procurement of civil works, local
procurement of furniture and equipment and provision of architectural services.
Accumulation of project implementation capacity is an important objective of
the project and the provincial project units would therefore be established
on a permanent basis to implement future primary education projects. The
Project Director in each province would be a specialist in the field of
education rather than in construction, because of the project's emphasis on
training, experimentation and research in education. Assurances were obtained
from the Government during negotiations that the FPU and the four provincial
units would be: (a) staffed as shown in para. 4.09 and Table 4.5, and
(b) maintained throughout the project period.
4.11      Training.  Implementation of all training segments would be prin-
cipal responsibility of training specialists of national and provincial
planning units. Provincial project units would mount recruitment programs
for all project personnel early in the preparatory phase in order to assemble,
with FPU assistance and approval, all training groups before training is to
begin (Table 3.5). Selection of trainees to be chosen nationally (project
trainers and researchers) would be a joint responsibility of the FPU and
provincial units.  A separate contract has been arranged for training segments
A, B and C-1 (Table 3.5). A major responsibility of the provinces will be the
organization and conduct of segment C training before and during the opera-
tional period. The field responsibility would be assigned to supervisors and
learning coordinators assisted by project trainers, the provincial planning

units and specialists.
4.12      Research and Evaluation.  Implementation of research and evaluation
would also be a joint responsibility of the FPU and provincial planning units
supplemented by project researchers and specialists. The research and
evaluation sections of the planning units would have overall responsibility.
Project research contracts are expected to be arranged with universities and
Institutes of Educational Research. The Government has prepared a preliminary
plan for experimentation and evaluation and developed a related plan for
technical assistance. These plans will provide guidance to the units
responsible for implementation.
4.13      Physical Design.  The Government has prepared several experimental
low costs designs for the project - some with Unesco assistance. The Public
Works Department (PWD) in the various provinces is planning to construct a
few pilot project schools in accordance with these designs. The scope for
implementing these experimental, low-cost designs would, however, be limited
because most of the construction would be minor extensions where the existing
structures would dictate the appropriate design types. The FPU would request
Unesco's regional office personnel from Bangkok to assist in further develop-
ing the earlier prepared low cost and experimental designs.  Preparation of
tender documents, tendering and supervision would be done by the PWD in two
provinces (Sind and NWFP).  In the Punjab this would be done by the People's
Work Program (PWP) and in Baluchistan these activities would be provided by
the Department of Local Government. These agencies have been selected
because of their specific manpower and administrative structures, which
enable them to implement small-scale projects in large numbers. Minor
supplemental architectural designs would be done with the assistance of local
consultants.
4.14      School Location Planning.  Criteria for selection of project schools
were developed during appraisal utilizing school mapping procedures. Further
refinements - primarily aimed at determining intraprovincial classroom
distribution - have been carried out and practically all sites have been
selected. Over 95% of the project schools are existing schools and the sites
of these schools are generally considered suitable for extension. As a
spin-off from the project, school location planning for nonproject schools
would be conducted with financial assistance from Unicef.
4.15      Finance Implementation.  Local funds (US$5.0 million) have been
earmarked in the Government's current fiscal year (ending June 30, 1979) for
implementation of the proposed project. Project preparation is generally in
an advanced stage and the Government is anxious to start implementation
without delay. Civil works contracts for project institutions signed after
November 30, 1978 would be included in the proposed project, (advance con-
tracting) but payments made against such contracts prior to the date of
credit signing would not be eligible for reimbursement from the proceeds of
the proposed credit.

4.16      In order to facilitate timely preparatory work on training, evaluation
and experimentation, the mission recommends that the Association provide retro-
active financing of up to US$100,000. Such financing would cover 100% of expen-
ditures for technical assistance incurred on or after January 31, 1979.
4.17      Budget allocations would be made available to the project on an
annual basis in accordance with the Schedule of Expenditure shown in Table
4.6. In addition the financial requirements for the project would be
reviewed regularly by the FPU to ensure that project implementation is not
delayed because of lack of funds. During negotiations the Government agreed
to: (a) furnish to the Association by March 1, of each year of implementation,
an estimate of project funds required for the following fiscal year; and (b)
to make the necessary funds available to ensure prompt project implementation.
4.18      Implementation Schedule.  The preparatory period of the project
started immediately after appraisal and is expected to be completed by
March 1981 (para. 3.04). This period includes: (a) preservice training
(para. 3.17-3.19) (b) preparatory work for evaluation and experimentation
(para. 3.20-21); (c) all construction (para. 3.16) and (d) all equipment and
materials procurement (para. 3.15). The main project period (36 months)
would start in March 1981 and would include implementation of supervision
(3.10-3.14); studies and evaluation (para. 3.20-3.21) and recurrent teacher
training (para. 3.07-3.09)). The final project period (8 months) would start
in early 1984 and would include final analysis of project results and recom-
mendations for future development in the primary education subsector (para.
3.21). The overall project implementation is expected to take about 5-1/2
years and the project is expected to be completed by September 1984. The
project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 2.
Procurement
4.19      Construction of several schools would normally be tendered as one
contract, but these are nevertheless not expected to exceed US$50,000 each.
Previous experience with education projects in Pakistan indicates that the
small size of the civil works and furniture contracts, the geographic
dispersion of the sites and the competitiveness of the local construction
industry would preclude any meaningful foreign competition in the bidding
process. Contracts for civil works and furniture (totalling about US$5.5
million) would therefore be awarded on the basis of locally advertised
competitive bidding in accordance with government procurement procedures in
which foreign firms would be allowed to participate. Direct labor ("force
account") by PWD and PWP would be used at about 20% of project sites



- 37 -
to test whether this construction mode is more economical than contract
awards (about US$1.5 million). Self-help construction was not considered
feasible because of prevailing community attitudes. Because of the small
size of all civil works contracts, prior IDA review of civil works contract
awards would not be required. During negotiations the Government confirmed
that the distribution of primary schools would be in accord with agreed
provincial distribution.
4.20      Equipment and vehicle contracts exceeding US$50,000 (in aggregate
about US$0.7 million) would be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. Local
manufacturers participating in the ICB would be given a preferential margin
of 15% over competing imports, or the existing rate of import duties, which-
ever is the lower. Contracts for equipment and vehicles which cannot
reasonably be grouped in packages of US$50,000 (in aggregate about
US$1.5 million) could be awarded without prior IDA review on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with local bidding
procedures. Where competitive bidding is inappropriate, or is not expected
to yield lower prices than local shopping, sundry equipment could be procured
by soliciting at least three price quotations subject to maximum value of
US$10,000 for each such contract and an aggregate total of US$250,000. Books
(US$0.5 million including contingencies) would be procured in accordance
with standard government procedures.
Disbursements
4.21      The proposed credit of $10 million would cover 60% of the total
project costs net of tax (100% of foreign exchange costs and 39% of local
costs). Disbursements would be completed in about 5-1/2 years and would cover
the following:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment,
vehicles, and books; and 80% of local expenditures for goods
procured locally;
(b)  25% of local expenditures for civil works and furniture;
(c)  100% of total expenditures for specialist services (including civil
work design); training and fellowships; and
(d)  100% of total expenditures (net of taxes) for salaries and allowances
of assistant teachers, learning coordinators and supervisors.
Any savings in the proposed credit would be cancelled on the Closing Date.
Disbursement is expected to be completed by June 30, 1985. The estimated
schedule of disbursements is shown in the following table:

4.22      Documentation.  Since construction of a large number of small
schools (about 1,000), salaries of a large number of individuals (860) and
travel and per diem for 11,000 trainees are being financed in this project,
special arrangements would be made for record keeping. The FPU would
maintain a file for each project school receiving physical facilities
available for inspection by IDA's progress review missions. Each file
would include: (a) the completed educational/architectural brief; (b)
the layout plans; (c) bids received; (d) bid analysis and contract recom-
mendation and award; and (e) details of expenditures. Disbursements for
civil works carried out by force account and by contracts of less than
US$5,000 equivalent would be made against statements of expenditures prepared
by PWD, PWP, or local government (total expenditure about US$2.0 million).
Similarly, disbursements for local training and local salaries (including
honoraria and allowances) would be made against statement of expenditures



- 39 -
prepared by the provincial project units (total about US$5.0 million
expenditure). All statements of expenditures would be certified by the FPU;
the documentation for which would be audited and retained for review by IDA
supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made against full
documentation.
4.23      Accounts and Audits.  Assurances would be obtained from GOP that all
agencies involved in project implementation would prepare and maintain separate
accounts for the project in accordance with sound accounting practices. Such
accounts, together with disbursement documents, would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The FPU would consolidate the accounts
from the various agencies and submit to IDA certified copies of the audited
accounts together with the auditor's reports within six months of the end of
each fiscal year. The audit report would include, inter alia, a statement
verifying that funds disbursed by IDA against statements of expenditures had
been used for the purpose for which they were provided. During negotiations
the Government provided assurances that federal and provincial auditing
procedures acceptable to IDA would be applied annually during implementation.
5.  BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
5.01      The project is expected to lead to substantial improvements in
primary education in terms of access, efficiency, learning achievements and
cost reductions. In the project areas, access to primary schooling would be
extended to about 15,000 male students and 30,000 females who would not have
entered grade 1 without the project./l It is further expected that as a
result of measures under the project, overall completion rates would be
increased from 50% to 60% for initial male entrants and from 35% to 50%
for females. Consequently, 40,000 males and 50,000 females would be expected
to complete the full five-year primary cycle who would not have done so
without the project. In other terms, in the project areas only about 35% of
the males and 10% of the females in the relevant age groups would normally
achieve literacy, but with the project, these figures are expected to be
increased to roughly 45% and 25%, respectively. Improved attendance, coupled
with better teaching, materials and facilities are also expected to contribute
to improved learning achievements which would be measured periodically under
the project. Overall, the gains for females are expected to be proportionately
greater than for males in keeping with the emphasis of the project. Moreover,
the project is expected to contribute to reduced unit costs (annual operating
cost per student and costs per graduate) through the use of larger class and
school sizes, and lower-paid assistant teachers. Even taking into account
the increased cost of more intensive supervision, unit recurrent costs p.a.
are expected to decrease on balance by 15-25%, or about PRs 20-35 per student.
/1  The qualitative estimates of benefits under each objective are illustrative
only since they required broad assumptions as proxies for essential data.
In the experimentation under the project, baseline data would be collected
on population, enrollment, retention and achievement to facilitate more
adequate measurements.



- 40 -
5.02      Though significant, these short-term benefits would be realized only
in the project areas which constitute less than 10% of the primary education
system. The fundamental justification for the project is the contribution it
would make to finding solutions to the problems of primary education, which
could then be applied over time to the 90% of the system not included in the
project. Thus the project could eventually benefit the country as a whole
through quality improvements and cost reductions in the delivery of primary
education. For example, the projected 25-30% decrease in unit recurrent
costs, if applied nationwide, would permit an expansion of enrollment coverage
by the same proportions without an increase in expenditure. Ultimately, however,
the success of the project must be measured by the benefits of primary education
to the individual and the positive effects of literacy on society. Studies in
other countries point to benefits of a more literate population in terms of
higher agricultural productivity, greater acceptance of population control
measures and lower fertility rates, and better understanding of nutrition and
health measures.
Risks
5.03      The project faces an implementation risk.  The proposed program is
complex, covering not only different components, but also a mix of approaches
for each province. Three measures have been taken to minimize this risk:
(a) federal and provincial planning units have been strengthened; (b) the
design of the experimentation would be adapted as necessary to take into
account the level of administrative resources that can be relied upon without
sacrificing the fundamental aims of the experimentation; and (c) technical
assistance would be provided for training and evaluation. The high degree
of involvement of provincial and federal staff in preparing the project has
helped to achieve broad local familiarity with its objectives and content, a
factor which should lessen implementation problems.
5.04      There is also a risk that the impact of the project could be reduced
because of noneducational factors. Poverty and other family influences could
prevent increased school attendance and reductions in dropout despite the
project inputs. The limited project measures may not be able to overcome
traditional reluctance of rural parents to educate their children, particularly
girls. To lessen this risk, a comprehensive training program would prepare
project personnel, particularly supervisory staff, for involving parents and
the community in the educational process so as to help change traditional
attitudes. In short, although the risks under the project would be compara-
tively high, the extent of the potential benefits are even greater and make
the project worth implementing.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01      During negotiations the Government provided assurances on the
following subjects: distribution of civil works (para. 3.16); reports on
results of baseline measures, annual reports on results and a comprehensive



- 41 -
plan for the development of primary education (para. 3.21); provision of
technical assistance (para. 3.22); project unit staffing (paras. 4.09-4.10);
provision of project funds (para. 4.17); and auditing procedures (para. 4.23).
6.02      Subject to the above conditions the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis of an IDA credit of US$10 million equivalent to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan for a term of fifty years including a ten year grace
period.
