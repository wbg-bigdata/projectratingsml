                            (b) reorient role o f state from operator to facilitator, and (c)
                            improve private participationineconomic activities.
Benefits            There are six important benefits to the operation.
                            Faster progress towards the achievement of PRSP objectives by
                            accelerating human development reforms, decreasing risk and
                            vulnerability o f the poor, and promoting growth in one o f the
                            poorest provinces o f Pakistan.
                            The sector widefocus, within human development, on education
                            and health enables the government to address the full range o f
                            challenges facing each sector.
                            The Bank support is integrated around a mutually consistent,
                            multi-sectoral reform agenda that supports the government's
                            comprehensive      reform program which           emphasizes   the
                            interconnectedness o f human development, fiscal strengthening,
                            governance and economic growth.
                            Donor harmonization         i s facilitated through the dialogue
                            between the government, the Bank and other development
                            partners, to coordinate all external assistance under the NWFP's
                            medium-termpolicy reform program.
                            Increased ownership and commitment by the government, as

                         Bank support i s targeted to the overall reform program
                         developed by the NWFP.
                         Stimulation of    economic growth through private sector
                         investment by reducing transactions costs to market entry and
                         facilitating commercial operations. Higher growth will create
                         greater fiscal space for the government, help reduce poverty,
                         and create employment opportunities for educated young
                         people inthe future
Risks              The NWFPDPC2 has six principal risks:
                         Any weakening o fthe macroeconomic framework, due to
                         inflation and external trade deficits, could pose a risk to this or
                         any other budget support operation.
                         As with all budget support credits, the government may not
                         allocate adequate resources to priority sectors inwhich case the
                         human development reform agenda, the sheet-anchor o f this
                         operation, may bejeopardized.
                         District governments are expected to play an important part in
                         the execution o f the reform agenda.       Lack o f harmony and
                         alignment o fpolicy objectives between the district governments
                         and the provincial government may hurt the implementation o f
                         reforms.
                         There i s a riskthat the procurement reforms across the province
                         will lagbehindthe reforms infinancialmanagement.
                         Capacity constraints both at the district level and at the

     DEVELOPMENT POLICY CREDIT TO THE NORTH-WESTFRONTIER
                                 PROVINCE (NWFPDPC2)

                         I.INTRODUCTIONANDOVERVIEW

1.      Human development levels in Pakistan reflect long-term under-investment in the
social sectors: and the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) suffers from human
development indicators that are below the national average for Pakistan. Broad based
improvement in human development outcomes i s essential to sustain the recent increase in
economic growth and public investment experienced in Pakistan and the NWFP, and to ensure
that vulnerable groups benefit from, and contribute to, expanding opportunities. The Government
o f the NWFP, recognizing this challenge, has launched a medium term reform program from
2005/06-2007/8. The overarching objectives o f this reform program are to accelerate human
development, promote economic growth and reduce poverty.

2.       The proposed North-West Frontier Province second Development Policy Credit
(NWFP DPC2) for US$130 millionis the middle operationof a series of three development
policy credits designed to assist the NWFP policy reform program. The current NWFP
program builds on the experience o f previous reforms, from 2000/01 onwards, that were
supportedby the World Bank through two structural adjustment credits (SACs) in2002 and 2004,
and the first development policy credit (DPC 1) in 2006. The two SACs emphasized fiscal,
expenditure management and growth reforms, while DPC 1 was a transition operation between
the expenditure and growth focused SACs and a future series o f operations that will emphasize
human development. The DPC series recognizes that for sustained human development
improvement it i s critically important for the budget process and governance structures to make
adequate resources available, and that these resources are spent prudently. Further, economic
growth i s vital because it creates better paying employment opportunities for healthy and
educated workers, and thus constitutes a key incentive for public and private investment inhuman
development. Also, strong economic growth helps generate revenues for sustained increase in
human development expenditure. Recognizingthis inter-connectedness, DPC1helped deepen the
fiscal and growth accelerating components o f the overall reformprogram. DPC2 a clear strategic
focus on accelerating human development, but also continues to support the fiscal, governance
and growth components o f the program.

3.       The NWFP DPC 2 assists the NWFP government to broaden and deepen human
development reforms, while also sustainingandbuildinguponthe momentumof reformsin
fiscal and public expenditure management,governance and growth. The operation supports
the government's comprehensive reform program that emphasizes the interconnectedness o f
human development, fiscal strengthening, governance and economic growth. DPC 2 i s organized
according to four pillars: (a) accelerating human development; (b) improving fiscal stability and
public expenditure management; (c) strengthening governance; and (d) promoting economic
growth through private sector development. Under the first pillar, the scope o f the human
development reform program has been substantially expanded to address challenges related to
coverage, quality and service delivery. In education, where previous reforms focused mainly on
increasing access to primary education, the scope has been broadened to cover secondary
education as well. The education reform program has also been deepened to address key issues
related to: (i)
              education quality, such as teacher development and the skills and competencies o f
school heads; and (ii) education governance, such as institutional strengthening o fthe Ministryo f
Education, empowerment o f local school communities, and the development o f a sound


                                                 1

monitoring and evaluation system. While inDPC 2 the deepest reforms are ineducation, inhealth
the reform program has been broadened beyond primary health to include access to secondary
and tertiary level health care. The health reformprogram has also been deepened to improve the
quality o f health services; and to strengthen governance and stewardship functions. The human
development program has also been strengthened through the preparation o f a social protection
strategy for the province, with a key focus on reducing the adverse impacts o f risk and
vulnerability on the poor. Under the second pillar, the fiscal sustainability o f the reform program
has been improved by consolidating expenditures within the medium-term budget framework,
and promoting own revenue generation. Under the third pillar, the governance framework has
been strengthened through the establishment o f a new accounting model down to the district
level, and through actions to bring procurement practices to international standards. Under the
fourth pillar, the climate to promote economic growth through private sector development has
been improved, especially through actions that lower administrative barriers and reduce the
transactions costs o f commencing and expanding economic activities inthe province.

4.      The NWFP has demonstrated capability to successfully implement wide ranging
policy reformsinthe past.The NWFP implementeda broad policy reformprogram from 2001-
2005, containingreforms inseveral areas: fiscal, public financial management and accountability,
human development, governance and civil service, and private sector development and growth.
The reform program focused on creating a sound fiscal framework for private sector led
economic growth. The program was largely successhl. The debt service burden declined from
1.8 percent o f provincial GDP (PGDP) in2000/01 to 0.9 percent in2004/05. The fiscal deficit fell
to under 1 percent o f PGDP. The composition o f public spending improved, with substantial
increases in development spending and the share o f the budget allocated to priority sectors such
as education and health. The NWFP economy grew at about 4.5 percent per year during the
period 2000-2005, which was in line with the growth o f the national Pakistan economy o f 4.7
percent per year. Positive progress was also made on improving human development levels.
Policies to provide fi-ee public education and textbooks to school children were adopted.
Following these reforms, the gross female primary enrolment ratio increased from 55 percent in
2001/02 to 65 percent in 2004/05, while the gross male primary enrolment ratio rose from 77
percent to 80 percent over the same period. In health, policies were instituted to increase the
health budget and expand primary health care provision. After the reforms were implemented,
during 2001/02 to 2004/5, the immunization rate for children aged 12-23 months rose from 57
percent to 76 percent, the immunization coverage o f pregnant women increased from 34 percent
to 45 percent, and the detection o fTB rose from 20 percent to 58 percent.

5.      The proposed NWFP DPC 2 is fully consistent with, and follows the principles of
engagement set out in, the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The CAS, approved
by the Board in June 2006, proposes to increase lending with a focus on areas o f the Pakistan
government's program that are critically important to promote economic growth and poverty
reduction, including human development. The proposed DPC2 i s based on the ability o f the
NWFP to meet the strategic engagement principles set out inthe CAS: (i)client pull through
                                                                              "            "
evidence o f committed champions o f reform, and demonstrated ability and willingness to
implement required reforms; (ii) strategic selectivity
                                    "                       " that seeks to replicate or scale up
approaches that have already been effective; (iii)greater focus on performance, guided by the
CAS results framework and associated integration o f monitoring and evaluation into the design;
and (iv) the use o f a programmatic approach to ensure sustained, flexible and predictable support
to reforms over the medium-term.

6.      Accelerating human development and promoting economic growth in the North-
West Frontier Province will generate substantial benefits to the population of Pakistan's
poorest province. The NWFP i s the third largest province inPalustan. Human development and



                                                2

income levels inthe NWFP are below the national average, with particularly sharp gender, socio-
economic and regional disparities. Sound and effective policies to improve human development
outcomes and raise household incomes will generate substantial economic and social benefits to
the people o f the NWFP. The focus on promoting gender, socio-economic and regional equity
will particularly benefit the poorer and more disadvantaged households and social groups,
allowing them to invest in human capital and participate more effectively in, and contribute to,
economic growth. Bank support i s organized around a mutually consistent, multi-sectoral reform
agenda that seeks to exploit synergy between policies to improve human development, sustain
fiscal stability, strengthen governance and promote economic growth.

                              11.NATIONAL PAKISTANCONTEXT

RECENT PROGRESSONHUMANDEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION

7.       The recent upsurge in economic growth in Pakistan has been accompanied by
improvement in human development and a reduction in poverty, but considerable
challengesremain.Preliminary analysis o f the most recent Pakistan Social and Living Standards
Measurement (PSLM) Survey 2004-05 shows that between 2000-01 and 2004-05 the country
enjoyed significant improvements in social indicators. Primary school enrollments, literacy,
immunizationcoverage and pre-and-post natal consultations improved (see Table 1and Table 2).

Despite this progress, Pakistan's social gap i s evident fiom numerous education and health
indicators in comparison to other similarly situated countries. Compared to other countries o f
South Asia, Pakistan lags behind in school enrollments, adult literacy, and child survival rates.
There are also significant rural-urban disparities. By far the most significant feature o f Pakistan's
social gap i s the divergence between the rich and poor in human development indicators.' For
example, while primary gross enrollment rates among the top three deciles are around 90 percent,
for households inthe bottom three deciles it i s less than 50 percent.

8.       Various poverty studies show a reduction inpoverty ranging between about 10.6 and 5.2
percentage points during the period 2000-01 and 2004-05. There has also been a reduction inthe
severity and depth o fpoverty, as well as inthe head count o fpoverty, both inrural and urban

areas. The progress in poverty reduction notwithstanding, a third o f Pakistan's rural population
cannot meet basic needs. Moreover, vulnerability i s a key feature o f poverty and a significant
proportion o f the population i s highly vulnerable to poverty. Recent analysis2 o f poverty and
vulnerability in Pakistan has shown that while about 33 percent o f the population i s chronically
poor andor vulnerable to chronic poverty, an additional 35 percent o f the population i s
transitorily (temporarily) poor or vulnerable to transitory poverty. Households vulnerable to
chronic and transient poverty include those with high dependency ratios, illiterate or poorly
educated household heads, households with unskilled labor, and share croppers and those
engaged in subsistence agriculture. Children o fpoor households are particularly vulnerable.

Recent Policy Initiatives bv the Government o f Pakistan to Improve Human Development and
Reduce Poverty

9.      A number of policy initiatives have been launched by the Federal Government to
further improve human development and reduce poverty and vulnerability. Pakistan's
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was finalized in 2003 which laid down the future
directions o f reforms and programs. The PRSP indicators and targets are aligned with the MDGs
and focus on achievement o f universal primary enrollment, reducing gender disparities, reducing
child mortality, reducing maternal mortality, combating communicable diseases, and eradicating
poverty. PRSP I1 i s being finalized and it seeks to further deepen the strategic direction for
attaining these stated goals and targets. Investmentsin human capital remain a core agenda of
PRSP II',which sees the provinces and districts as playing the pivotal role in service
delivery.

10.     In the educationsector, a series of initiatives and reforms have been recentlytaken
by the Federal Ministry of Education (MoE). These have implications for education policies
and programs inthe provinces. Key initiatives at the federal level include: (a) update o f the 1998
National Education Policy, which i s near completion4; (b) completion o f revision and reform o f
the national curriculum; (c) approval o f a National Textbook Policy to establish a competitive
system for development, printing and publishingo f textbooks; (d) completion o f two rounds o f
student testing under National EducationAssessment System (NEAS) for Grade IV and o f a pilot
assessment for grade VIII; and (e) completion o f the National Education Census (NEC) which

includes data on all education institutions (public, private, madrassahs, and polytechnics) from
pre-primary to university levels.' As a part o f fostering inter-provincial coordination, the M o E
also holds regular consultations with provincial education officials on ongoing reforms, policies
and programs.

11.       The FederalMinistryofHealth(MOW hasinitiatedpolicymeasuresand programs
which are likely to positively influence the NWFP healthprogram. The main national health
policy initiatives include: (a) broad based consultation to review the existing National Health
Policy and draft a new healthpolicy; and (b) the approval o f a strategic framework for nutrition,
maternal and neo-natal health, and an integrated disease surveillance system. The revisednational
disease surveillance system, once established, will provide timely information for disease
prevention and control. The MOH has also commissioned an assessment o f vertical programs to
identify options for further decentralization o f national health programs. The recent
announcement o f the President's initiative on Primary Health Care (PHC), which envisages using
rural support programs and NGOs to manage first level care facilities and preventive programs in
rural areas, will influencethe delivery o f PHC inNWFP inline with the President's initiative.

12.       The major earthquake which hit Pakistan in October 2005 was a large shock that
affected thousands of households to which the Government responded with short term
social protection measures. According to the joint ADB-World Bank Needs Assessment,
approximately 73,000 people died and more than 70,000 have been severely injured or disabled.
Many also lost their livelihoods. The government and donors responded to the earthquake with
pledges o f comprehensive assistance for relief and rehabilitation. In addition to deliveries o f in-
kind emergency assistance (food, blankets, tents and roofing sheets), the financial assistance to
the affected households comprises: a) housing support; (b) payments for death and injury; (c).
livelihood support; and (d) social welfare services for disabled groups.

13.       A new poverty targeted conditionalcash transfer is beinglaunched by Bait-ul-Mal,
a federal safety net programmeantto helpthe poor and destitute.Bait-ul-Mal runs a number
o f programs, the most important being the Food Support Program (FSP) which pays an annual
cash transfer o f Rs.3,000 to about 1.45 million beneficiaries. FSP i s complemented by a new
Child Support Program (CSP). CSP i s a conditional cash transfer for education targeted to
existingbeneficiaries o f the Food Support Programand technically supported by the World Bank.
CSP provides an additional benefit (over and above the FSP benefit), to FSP beneficiaries
provided their children o f school-going age regularly attend school. Families with no children o f
school going age or whose children do not attend school continue to receive the regular FSP
benefits and therefore do not lose out as a result o f this new program. CSP commenced as a pilot
infive districts during2006, includingKohistaninNWFP.An impact evaluation isplanned.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK, AND
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

14.       Since the beginning of the new millennium, Pakistan's economy has staged a
remarkable turnaround, laying the ground for sustained growth and poverty reduction. The
1990s were a period o f slow growth, and progress in reducing poverty and improving social
indicators stagnated. Successive governments initiated reforms, but with only modest results as
reforms faltered midway due to rising political pressures and constrained external financing.
Beginning in2000, the Government initiated a more wide-ranging and ambitious reformprogram
that was articulated in the Government's 2003 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, "Accelerating


    The data shows a healthy increase in enrollments at 33 million, out o f which 12 million are enrolled in private
    institutions. Overall, gender gap i s reducing with male share of enrollment at 57 percent and female share at 43
    percent.

Growth and Reducing Poverty, The Road Ahead." These reforms, along with debt restructuring,
and increased remittances and concessionary aid flows, resulted in a dramatic turnaround o f the
economy. In contrast to several previous IMF programs, both the 2000 Stand-by Arrangement
(SBA) and the 2001 three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) were successfully completed. Recent years have witnessed considerable improvement in
the performance o f the industrialand services sector, leadingto a significant acceleration in

economic growth, to 7.5 percent in 2003104 and 8.6 percent in 2004105. In 2005106, Pakistan's
economy withstood serious adverse shocks emanating from its worst ever earthquake, a sharp
increase in oil prices, and less favorable weather conditions, and registered continued strong
growth of 6.6 percent.6

15.      The acceleration in economic growth since 2001/02 has led to higher household
incomes and lower poverty. In2005/06, the per capita income increased to $847, up from $742
a year earlier (an increase of 14 percent in nominal dollars). More importantly however, all
segments o f the population, in both urban and rural areas, have gained from income growth.
Poverty declined significantly, and Pakistan's social indicators have started to show some
improvements    .'

percent o f GDP in 1999/00 to
about 3.3 percent in 2004/05. Earthquake related expenditures contributed to a higher deficit o f
4.2 percent o f GDP in 2005/06.* Net o f earth-quake effect the fiscal deficit was 3.3% o f GDP,
implyingthat a significantpart of earthquake impact was absorbed withinthe budget (See Figure
 1). Rapid economic growth, availability o f grants and concessionary finance, debt cancellation
and fiscal consolidation have enabled Palustan to reduce its debt burden sharply.                                                   The
government policy o f usingprivatization proceeds towards retirement o f debt also contributed to
lessening o f debt burden. Total government debt fell from about 80 percent o f GDP in2001/02 to
56 percent in 2005/06. Moreover, despite the rapid fiscal adjustment, social and poverty-related
expenditures continued to increase sharply and over a four year period (2001/02-2005/06) were
raised by 1.8 percentage points o f GDP, or by over 12 percent p.a. in real per capita terms,
although they remain low in comparison with other countries at similar levels o f per capita
income. The Government promulgatedthe Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act inJune
2005, under which it has committed itself to specific targets o f fiscal adjustment and debt
reduction.

 17.      Rapid economic growth and an expansionary monetary policy contributed to strong
aggregate demand. This caused an upsurge ininflation, which increasedto to 9.3% in2004/05,
but then fell to 7.9% in2005/06 as authorities took measures to tighten money supply. Despite
continued healthy growth inexports duringthe past two years, the external situation deteriorated,
as imports growth exceeded exports by a considerable margin. As the trade gap widened, the
current account has gone from a surplus to a deficit, which in 2005/06 i s estimated to have


7 According to the CPI-based price index overall poverty declined from 34.4% to 23.9%. Inurban areas,
  poverty declined from 22.7% to 14.9% and inrural areas, from 39.3% to 28.1%. According to survey-
  based prices, overall poverty declined from 33.3% to 28.3%. Inurban areas, the poverty declined from
   22.0% to 18.4%, and inrural areas, from 37.9% to 32.9%. The CPI-based price index suffers from being
   collected only in urban areas, therby leaving out rural areas where poverty i s the greatest. The survey-
  basedprice data suffers from being very limited, collecting only food and transport prices, which may be
  unrepresentative o f the items on which ruralhouseholds actually expend.

reached 4.4 percent o f GDP, despite sizeable increases in workers' remittances. Worsening
current account balance was financed mainly through non-debt inflows as continued strong
foreign investors' interest ledto a substantial increase inFDI.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

18.      Prospects for continued rapid growth are good, provided that political and
macroeconomic stability are maintained.The government is aiming to increase growth to 7-8
percent over the long run.For this, it plans to continue to implement reforms to reduce the cost o f
doing business in Pakistan, attract investment through the privatization program, and reduce
infrastructure and human development shortfalls. The SBP and the Government have expressed
their commitment to control inflationary pressures and the growing external imbalances, and are
expected to take actions to counter them.

19.      Since early 2005, there has been a gradual tightening of the money supply. Interest rates
have increased;' reserve and liquidity requirements ratios have been raised (by more than 2
percentage points inthe current fiscal year); and the discount rate has been increased (by 50 basis
points to 9.5. These, coupled with relative stabilization of oil prices in the international markets
and crossing the hump o f some lumpy imports, led to a marked slow down inimports during the
first 7 months o f 2006/07.'0 The import growth i s projected at 11% for 2006/07. This, however,
did not result in any significant improvement in current account balance as exports too
decelerated. Pakistani rupee has appreciated by around 12 percent in real terns over the past 18
months, which aided the strong growth inimports (and may have dampened exports), but has also
stifled the growth in exports. Nonetheless, the sudden and sharp deceleration in exports from the
beginning of this fiscal year may in part be to structural factors that have eroded international
competitiveness. Owing to higher non-debt inflows, the foreign exchange reserves increased,
albeit only marginally. On the basis o f these developments, it i s projected that while the current
account deficit will remain high during the next three years, increased capital flows will cause a
gradual build-upo f foreign exchange reserves, which are projected at 3.6 months o f imports in
2006/07 and risingto 3.8 months for the next three years.

20.      Tighter monetary policy also led to some easing o f inflationary pressures. Consumer
price inflation declined somewhat from a peak o f 11.5 percent inApril 2005 to 9 percent in July
2005 and 8.1% in January 2007. On the basis o f a sharp deceleration in monthly inflation in
January, end-year inflation i s projected to decline to 7.5%.

21.      Tax revenue collection during the first half o f 2006/07 was 27% higher than the
corresponding period in the previous year, in spite o f the sharp deceleration in import-related
taxes. Direct taxes were higher by 66%, reflecting the increased profitability o f the corporate
sector, in particular banking, energy and telecommunications, as well as better tax compliance
due to the tax administration reforms within the Central Board o f Revenues (CBR). The fiscal
deficit is, therefore, projected to decline gradually from 4.2% o f GDP in 2005/06 to 3.5% by
2009/10. These relatively low levels o f fiscal deficit will contribute to further improvements in
Pakistan debt indicators. Debt sustainability analysis has been carried out by the IMF and by the
World Bank, and indicates that the government's debt reduction path (which i s prescribed in the
Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Law) i s consistent with a sustainable debt outlook. As
discussed in paragraph, following the conclusion o f the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) in 2004, Pakistan is now on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule. IMF post-
program Monitoring was deemed unnecessary by the IMF's Board. An IMF Article IV

  Treasury Billrates increased from 1.7% in2003/04 to over 8% inthe current year.
lo The growth in imports decelerated from 31% in 2005106 to 12% during the first seven months of
2006/07.

     111.    THE CONTEXT OF THE NORTH-WESTFRONTIERPROVINCE

RECENT PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND
POVERTYREDUCTION

Achievements andProgress

22.      The NWFP has made good progressin implementinghuman development reforms
in recent years. Duringthe period from 2002 onwards the NWFP introduced a range o f policy
reforms to expand primary school attendance, especially among girls, and to improve access to
primary health care. In education, these policies included providing tuition free education and
free textbooks to primary school children (subsequently expanded up to secondary school);
expanding essential primary school facilities, such as classrooms, sanitation and boundary walls
for security; and increasing the number o f teachers. Inhealth, the key policies were focused on
widening access to important preventive services, such as Tuberculosis (TB) Daily Observation
Therapy Sessions (DOTS), Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services, and Family Planning.

23.      The education and healthbudgetswere increasedsubstantially from 2002 onwards
to support the educationand healthreformprograms.The educationbudget rose by over 150
percent innominal terms, from 9 billion rupees in2001/2 to 23 billion rupees in2005/6, while the
health budget rose by more than 100 percent in nominal terms, from 2.5 billion rupees to 5.1
billionrupees over the same period".

24.      The combinationof policy reformsand higher investmenthas enabledthe NWFP to
raisehumandevelopmentoutcomesconsiderablyinrecent years, especiallyamonggirls and
women. Ineducation, according to household survey data, the net female primary enrolment ratio
increased from 33 percent in 2001/2 to 40 percent in 2004/5, while the net male primary
enrolment ratio rose from 48 percent to 53 percent over the same period. In health, the
immunization rate for children aged 12-23 months increased from 57 percent in 2001/2 to 76
percent in 2004/5, the coverage o f Lady Health Workers for MCH and FP services expanded
from 50 percent to 60 percent, and the ante-natal coverage o f pregnant women by health
professionals increased from 34 percent to 39 percent, duringthe same period. Economic growth
also helpedreduce poverty, from 43 percent to 41 percent o f the population.

FuturePolicy ChallengesandDevelopmentNeeds

25.      Despiteprogressinrecentyears, the low initialconditionsof humandevelopmentin
the NWFP mean that substantial challengesremain.According to the latest PSLM 2004-05,
education, health and poverty indicators for the NWFP continue below the Pakistan average. The
NWFPnet primary enrolment rates o f 40 percent for girls and 53 percent for boys are bothbelow
the Pakistan averages o f 48 percent (girls) and 56 percent (boys), respectively (Table 1). The
NWFP female literacy rate o f 26 percent i s also considerably below the national average o f 40
percent. In health, the pre-natal consultation rate for women i s 39 percent, below the national
average o f 50 percent; while the post-natal consultation rate for women i s 21 percent, less than
the Pakistan average o f 23 percent (Table 2). Similarly, poverty rates, though reduced, remain
much higher than the country as a whole. These challenges are related. Addressing poverty and


l1While reliable province specific inflation data do not exist for Pakistan, national inflation figures during
this period suggest that in real terms the education budget rose about 110 percent and the health budget
about 70 percent during 2001/2-200516.

vulnerability allows households to invest in human capital; improvements inhealth and nutrition
contribute to improvements in learning outcomes; and investment in education helps reduce long
term poverty. The key issues facing the education, health and social protection sectors in
improving human development outcomes are listedinthe sections below.

EducationSector Challenges and Issues

26.      Gross enrollment in primary educationis relatively high for boys, much lower for
girls, and reveals considerable disparities in coverage of education by gender, economic
class and region in the NWFP. According to the most recent Education Management
Information System (EMIS) 2005-06 datal2, the gross enrolment inprimary education (age group
5-9 years) i s 98 percent among boys, whereas it i s only 66 percent for girls. Regional disparities
are also significant. Gross primary enrolment rates for girls range fkom 105 percent inAbbotabad
to 29 per cent in Shangla. Clearly a substantial proportion o f children in the NWFP, especially
girls, are not yet attending school at primary level. Children generally, and girls particularly,
belonging to poor families face a higher risk o f not being enrolled, and once enrolled, a greater
probability o f dropping out even when a school i s available The highest dropout rate inprimary
education i s concentrated at the transition point from Kutchi to Grade 1(about 30 percent).

27.      There is low enrolment, and high regional and gender disparities, in participation
ratesinmiddle school and above. There is a steep decline inparticipationrates inmiddleschool
and further up the education system. Total net enrolment according to household survey data, for
example, declines fkom 47 percent inprimary education to just 16percent inmiddle school, and a
mere 7 percent inhigher secondary education. There are also highgender and regional disparities
in middle school and above. For instance, the net middle school enrolment rate for boys is 21
percent, while for girls it i s only 11 percent. Further, middle school female enrolment rates in
some districts are extraordinarily low, just 3 percent in Shangla and 1percent inKohistan. At the
higher secondary education level, the net male enrolment rate i s only 9 percent, while the net
female enrolment rate i s a mere 5 percent.

28.     Expanding equitable access to primary and post-primary education is a key
development need. The focus o f education expansion in the past was on primary schooling.
While this focus has to continue, the education sector reform program now also needs to be
broadened to take into account access to education at post-primary level. The low enrolment in
middle school and above, especially o f girls, constrains the private and public sector labor
markets. For instance, there i s a shortage o f educated women for professions such as teaching,
nursing and medicine. In addition, the pool o f educated labor to take up managerial and
administrative positions within the province i s tightly constrained. The NWFP needs to increase
enrolment inmiddle school and above, to increase the stock o f human capital and be competitive
in the national and international labor markets in the future, as well as to staff education and
health institutions that need female professional and technical workers. The need i s particularly
acute in regions with very low female post-primary enrolment, such as seven districts where
female middle school enrolment i s under 12percent.

29.     Improving the quality of education is a critical reform challenge. The quality o f
education in the NWFP, as shown by indicators such as cognitive achievement, i s low. Among

l2The information in paragraph 22 i s based on EMIS data, as we have more recent EMID information
(200Y06) than householdsurvey data (2004/5). Typically, EMIS data report higher figures than household
survey data, so that the actual problemmay be even more acute, on the basis o f the household survey data,
than revealed inadministrative information.

NWFP experiences several constraints inthe provision o f good quality education. These include:
(a) a shortage o f teachers, especially at middle school and above; (b) poor deployment o f teachers
to remote areas; (c) the absence o f a strong professional qualification and development
framework for teachers; (d) insufficient management and leadership development o f school
heads; (e) the absence o f a good system o f technical support for schools; (0 inadequate teaching-
learningmaterial; and (g) poor physical learning environments, especially inremoteregions.

30.      The education sector faces a set of key challenges in ensuring good governance. The
key governance issue i s that the relationship between stakeholders from local communities,
especially parents, and schools remains weak. Other countries, including Bangladesh, India,
Nepal and Sri Lanka in the region, are actively promoting the involvement o f local school
communities, particularly parents, to play a role in improving school administration and
increasing resources for school development. Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) have been
formed inthe NWFP and the budget for instructionalmaterials and repairs, and for consumables,
has been allocated to PTAs. The role o f PTA's needs to be strengthened to administer selected
activities funded throughthe development budget, such as minor construction in schools.

31.      The private education sector has experienced increasing enrolment in recent years,
but would benefit from a more enabling policy environment. Policy measures to stimulate
further private investment ineducation are important, especially as the education system expands
beyond the primary level. The Elementary Education Foundation and the College Education
Foundation have the mandate to promote private investment in education, but require
strengthening to play an active and effective role. The Elementary Education Foundation
currently devotes a large proportion o f its resources and time to providing adult education, and to
implementing a program for community schools. This Foundation needs to focus more actively
on its mandate to improve private sector involvement in education, and to serve as an apex
institutionto finance the provision o f educationthrough the private sector. The role o f the College
EducationFoundation, too, needs to be directed to active promotion o f private sector participation
inCollege education.

Health Sector Challenges andIssues

32.      The health outcomes in NWFP appear to be improving. The IMR for NWFP in
2000/01 was reported to be the lowest for Pakistan at 56 per 1000 births (national average o f 85
per 1000 live births). The TFR however, declined at a slower pace than nationally, from 5.5 in
the early nineties to 5.1 in2000, quite a bit above the national figure o f 4.5 undfur behind other


l3Note that, as enrolment rates rise and children with weaker home learning environments attend school,
the average performance on cognitive achievement tests normally decline. As the NWFP has higher
primaryschool enrolment rates than SindhandBalochistan, one reasonfor the lower average cognitive test
scores may be the presence o f school children from less favorable home backgrounds inthe NWFP.

parts of South Asia. Estimates o f maternal mortality are not available but improvements are
likely to be modest despite declining fertility. With the launch o f the NWFP reform program
supported by the SACSand DPC 1, several achievements have emerged with a higher health
budget, including increasing immunization coverage and antenatal care attendance, improved
access to MCHand FP, and increased coverage o f TB DOTS services.           l4


33.       Despite the above improvements, the health sector continues to face significant
challenges in terms of coverage and access to primary health services. Maternal health i s a
major challenge, with proportions o f births attended by skilled personnel very low at 28 percent
pre-natal consultations and post-natal consultation, at 39 percent and 21percent respectively are
well below the Pakistan average of 50 percent and 23 percent respectively. Contraceptive
prevalence at 30 percent i s also below the Pakistan average o f 32 percent and significantly lower
than has been accomplished inIndia and Bangladesh. Inaddition one inthree children under five
are moderately or severely malnourished as judged by weight for age (37 percent). While this i s
lower than the national average o f41 percent it i s still highby global standards.

34.       The NWFP PHC facilities are underutilized, with most facilities seeing less than 20
patients per day. Further, this number has remained stagnant since 2000. Several factors
constrain the coverage, access and utilization o f public health care facilities. These include
uneven development o f health systems among the various districts; the poor location o f public
health facilities and a shortage o f well qualified and trained health personnel in remote areas.
Ineffective functioning o f the system i s due to weak management, inadequate staff motivation,
and little emphasis on measurement o fresults. Management at the district level i s limited by lack
o f strategic orientation and few management skills. Staff i s unaccountable, barely supervised, and
with little or no incentive for performance

35.       The quality of health care in secondary care health institutions varies across the
province due to weak management and lacks autonomy to function efficiently. The quality o f
health care in secondary health institutions varies and anecdotal evidence suggests it i s poor.
Although multiple factors contribute to poor quality o f care, weak management i s one o f the
critical factors. NWFP granted managerial and financial autonomy to four tertiary hospitals with
an aim to improve quality o f care and generating additional financial resources. There i s some
evidence that autonomy has resulted in increased utilization o f services, but control over human
resource management, financing and internal governance are insufficiently delegated, delaying
decision making and management. The secondary care District and Tehsil hospitals are also
managed by inadequately trained manpower and lack adequate administrative and financial
powers to function efficiently. These factors outlined lead to considerable variation in the quality
o f bothprimary and hospital care, with adverse effects on the utilization o f health services.

36.       The information on the quality of health care is uneven, and requires substantial
improvement. A major constraint to the improvement of the quality i s the absence o f
independent and reliable information on the quality of care across the province. Having such
information would be useful as a baseline and would help inthe design and monitoring o f health
care quality improvement measures. In particular, information i s required on quality o f care
indicators such as the quality o f the patient-provider interaction, patient satisfaction, knowledge
o f staff, availability o f staff, drugs, equipment, and specific services. This type o f information i s
neededespecially for primary health centers and District and Tehsil hospitals.

37.       The health sector also faces several key stewardship related issues. These include the
following:


l4The PSLSM data indicate significant improvements inhealth outputs such as immunization coverage and
use o f antenatal care, although firther analysis of the data is required.


                                                       12

a. Absence of an adequately enabling environmentto facilitate high quality private sector
   and NGO participation in the delivery of health services. In particular, the Health
   Foundation, which has the mandate o f private-public partnerships in the delivery o f health
   services, has engaged infinancing and supporting activities such as provision o f scholarships
   to medical graduates which are likely to contribute insignificantly health sector goals and
   objectives. There i s need to revitalize the Health Foundation by re-examining its role,
   mandate, scope o f work, financing and enhancing its autonomy in order to create an
   environment for private or NGO participationinthe health service provision.

b. Lack of regulatory mechanisms: The health sector inNWFP operates without a legislative
   or regulatory framework to ensure provision o f quality health care. Inaddition, the existing
   health related laws are poorly enforced. With uneven quality o f care and a growing private
   sector outside the policy framework o f the Government, the lack o f a regulatory framework i s
   a key constraint inensuring good quality o f care and protecting consumer rights. The NWFP
   has constituted a Health Regulatory Authority (HRA) to regulate the private sector, however,
   the HRA lacks a clear strategic direction and a practical approachregulation;

C.  Strengthening monitoring and evaluation is a priority area for the future development
   of the health sector. The evolving health program contains innovative elements, such as the
   contracting out the management o f health care centers and institutions to NGO's and the
   private sector. Inaddition, an increasing focus i s being placed on results and outcomes inthe
   design o f health policy. Inorder to support this higher level o f policy formulation and wider
   range o f management systems, there needs to be close monitoring o f performance over time
   and evaluation o f the innovations being tried out. Moreover, existing data sources, such as
   administrative and survey based health information, reveal weaknesses and inconsistencies,
    so that third-party verifications to provide external validity checks, and to improve the quality
   o f data over time, are important. The absence o f an independent monitoring and evaluation
   cell in the Department o f Health, staffed with adequately qualified and trained officials, i s
   also a key constraint to the improvement o f monitoring and evaluation inthe health sector.

d. Inadequatefinancing: Health sector expenditures, as part of the NWFP reforms, have been
    increasing in line with the MTBF; and allocations for development expenditure have
    increased significantly. However, both recurrent and development expenditures have fallen
    short of allocations, and health expenditure continues to be biased towards hospitals, rather
   than on cost effective interventions and PHC. Inaddition, an institutional mechanism to track
    expenditures at the provincial level i s absent, and limitsevidence based decision making.

PovertyReductionand Social Protection

38.     The recently released PSLM data show that in comparisonwith national poverty
reduction, the progress in poverty reduction in the NWFP Region has beenrather modest.
Not only i s the poverty incidence among provinces highest in the NWFP, but also the rate o f
reduction in poverty has been slower than for the country as a whole. This makes the poverty
challenge quite daunting. In this context, two important sources o f vulnerability are: high
seasonal unemployment inrural areas, and pervasive health risks that result in highmaternal and
infant mortality. Currently the social protectionprograms are inadequate to cushion either of the
two vulnerabilities. The NWFP needs to improve the targeting and implementation o f existing
programs, and evaluate the ongoingpilots insocial protection for coverage and effectiveness.

39.     The NWFP relies heavily on federal funding for key social protection programs,
with relatively little funding from the province at present. The provincial Department o f



                                                  13

Social Welfare and Women Development has seen its allocation tripling over the last year but the
budget i s still small compared to what i s being spent by federally funded programs such as Zakat
or Bait-ul-Mal. Other provincial institutions delivering social programs include the Departments
o f Health, School and Literacy, and Industry and Labor. Inaddition to those programs, a number
o fNGOs provide a variety o f services.

40.       The main federally funded programs are Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal. The provincial
government i s runningprograms such as welfare homes for beggars, orphans and children at risk,
and distributes a modest financial assistance to the disabled. The major funding for social
protection programs though comes from the federal budget under Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal. The
Gujara allowance (a small grant o f Rs.670 per month to identified destitute households) i s the
only major poverty-alleviatingprogram under Zakat and accounts for 60 percent o f Zakat budget.
A substantial proportion (26%) of Zakat fundingsupports education, the rest o f the budget being
spent on medical and other welfare allowances. Zakat resources have been decreasing over the
last years and sustainability o f the program i s questionable. The other federal safety net provider
i s Bait-ul-Mal. This institution i s implementing several programs including the Food Support
Program-FSP and the Individual Financial Assistance for medical, education and general
assistance. Bait-ul-Mal also runs centers for rehabilitation o f child laborers (18 current operating
in the Region; 11more are planned), and Vocational Centers for women (29 centers currently
operating, 9 more are planned). The budget has been increasing over the last years, mainly
because o f an increase inthe cash transfer program (the FSP).

41.       Overall, the NWFP currently runs a patchwork o f programs, funded both federally and
provincially. Programs need better targeting and coordination to ensure that the fiscal resources
allocated by the government are utilized optimally. The programs also need to be strategically
designed, especially to ensure that the poor are better able to participate and benefit from human
capital investments and economic growth.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Political and Economic DeveloDments

42.       Growth in the province was slightly slower than in the rest of the country in 2005/6,
mainly due to the 2005 earthquake, but reforms inprovincial finances have helped in creating
fiscal space and maintaining a sustainablefiscal position. Duringthe last six years (i.e., since
reforms started) the NWFP economy has grown at a slightly slower pace (4.5 percent p.a. on
average) than that o f Pakistan (4.7 percent)."      InFY05/06 the provincewas hitbya devastating
earthquake which in addition to a very large number o f casualties, homeless and injured, also
caused extensive damage to other public infrastructure and to private property. The loss in
employment and output inthe affected districts i s estimatedto be about 25 percent and the overall
impact on provincial GDP (PGDP) in2005/06 about 3.6 percent. Real GDP growth in 2005/06 i s
estimated at about 3.8 percent, and i s projectedto bounce back to 6.3 percent in2006/07.


43.       The budget expenditure figures for FY05/06 show that the overallfiscal deficit (1.7
percent of GDP) was in line with the Budget approved by the Provincial Assembly (1.6
percentof GDP). Both total current spending and development spending were contained below
the budget allocation (in sum 7% or Rs 3.7 billion below). The key reason for slightly
overshooting the deficit (by Rs 0.6 billion) was that federal grants were considerably lower than


l5 The PGDP estimates are unofficial andpreparedby the World Bank for the NWFP Economic Report (2005). There
are no oficial provincialGDP estimates inPakistan.

   expected (by more than Rs. 4 billion). Previous concerns about a possible considerable overrun
   on development spending in light o f a 22 percent supplementary budget request were allayed as
   the final outturn was 5 percent (Rs 1 billion) below budget. The ADP throw forward ratio (that
   indicates the efficiency in executing the existing project portfolio) continued to show
   improvement and declined to 2.8.16

li Government Finance Statistics

   44.       Own provincialrevenue collection grew by 9 percent, but fell marginally short of
   the budget target (by Rs 0.1 billion). Revenue collection was hampered in the earthquake-
   affected districts since part o f the assigned responsibilities o f the revenue agencies was to provide
   relief efforts in the aftermath o f natural calamities. In spite o f this, provincial tax collection
   showed robust growth (at 28 percent) from the previous year. Abstracting from the (relatively
   minor) revenue loss stemming from the earthquake the increased spending stemming from relief
   and reconstruction efforts was fully offset by additional grants from the federal government.
   However, non-tax revenue collection stagnated, reflecting a decline in full user charges. The
   province continues to need advice on revenue policy and administration.

   45.       The overall outlook for FY06/07 shows a fiscal strengtheningbeyond that planned
   in the Budget approved by the ProvincialAssembly and points to a fully sustainablepath.
   The overall fiscal deficit i s projected to decline from 1.2 percent o f GDP in FY05/06 to 0.6
   percent o f GDP (Rs 5.2 billion) this year (Table 6), as against a projected deficit o f 0.7 percent o f
   GDP in the original Budget".              Financing o f the deficit i s on low cost terms through the IDA
   credit and also reflecting effective containment o fborrowing on commercial terms the future debt



   16 This ratio (2.8) indicatesthat ifall ADP spendingat the current level were directed towards existing
   projects it would take 2.8 years to complete all o f them.

                                                                 15

service burden i s contained.18The main drivers for the overall fiscal improvement are substantial
increases in federal tax assignment (NFC award)lg and federal grants and transfers, reflecting the
realignment o f federal-provincial resource distribution that took effect this year. Going beyond
the budgeted increase, overall transfers from the federal government to the province are now
projected to be Rs 5 billion higher than Budget. Own revenue collection i s projected to grow in
line with provincial GDP inthe current and the coming fiscal year.20This should be fully feasible
in light of ongoing and coming measures inrevenue policy and administration. Total spending
(current and development) i s expected to come in slightly below budget. In the case o f
development spending the main reason for the slight under-expenditure i s inflatedprojections for
Foreign Project Assistance inthe Budget.

46.      The expenditure program has a relatively well balanced compositionbetween current and
development spending although there i s a need to raise the spending on maintenance and repairs
ofpublic assets incoming years. The wage bill has been contained at sound levels. The growth in
the civil service has been kept in check with a demonstrated track record over the last 3-4 years
whereas the rate o f general wage increases for provincial staff follows the federal government's
decisions. Sectoral budget allocations reflect the increasing emphasis on human development
with enhanced budgets for education and health. These budgets fully cover the cost requirements
o f implementing agreed reforms. Within development spending priority i s being given to
completing ongoing projects while limiting the number o f new projects                -  all with a focus on
further reducingthe ADP throw forward ratio which i s far below those o f the rest o fthe country.

47.      As a result o f the government's policy o f retiring prematurely the most expensive debt
since the start o f Bank-supported DPOs in 2002 while strictly limiting the assumption on new
debt and only on concessionary terms, the debt service burden has decreased markedly in these
years. Further premature retirement o f expensive debt depends on agreement with the creditor -
the federal government. However, the provincial government has made a Cabinet decision to
continue with its policy o f early debt retirement. It has presented a schedule for planned
retirement o f loans from the federal government but made it conditional on receiving the
additional hydel profit disbursements fiom WAF'DA or the federal government following
Arbitration on net hydel profits. The plan outlines retirement o f identified CDLs over the next 3
years amountingto Rs 3.4 billion.

48.      A provincial debt sustainability analysis has been camed out by the Bank. Given that the
bulk o f future debt service payments are already predetermined (fixed interest rates and
amortization schedules) one can with a highdegree o f certainty project the ranges o f debt service
burden over the medium and long term in different scenarios. The debt sustainability analysis
shows that the fiscal outlook i s robust and can maintain debt sustainability in the face o f a wide
range o f shocks. The positive debt dynamics mark a turnaround from the substantial debt
overhang the province was burdened with at the turn o f the century following a decade o f large
deficits, andthey reflect the success o fthe province's fiscal consolidation andrestructuring inthis
period as well as its strategy of early retirement o f the most expensive debt.



   Provincial government borrowing from the market i s effectively contained since the provinces need
a proval from the federal government to borrow, which as part o f its policy it i s not giving.
"The   system o f revenue transfers to the provinces through the National Finance Commission Award i s
enshrined inthe Constitution and their amounts determined according to a transparent formula (set down by
law) based on objective, verifiable data, currently covering the period up to 2010111. This gives a relatively
strong assurance o f the magnitude o fNFC transfers for the coming four years.
2o Own provincial revenue constitutes only   8 percent o f total revenues and grants, reflecting the lack o f a
buoyant tax base under the provincial purview whereas the buoyant tax revenue items are under the federal
government's purview.


                                                      16

49.      Public investment in human developmentincreased in 2006/7. The education budget
has risen to 20.8 billion rupees, about 20 percent higher than the previous year. The increased
education expenditure covers the cost o f the education reformprogram for 2006/7, including the
DPC 2 prior actions such as the stipends for girls attending middle and secondary schools in
seven districts, the allocation o f development funds for PTA's to engage in minor construction
work in schools, and the establishment o f an education sector reform unit in the Department o f
Education. Key DPC 2 milestones, such as the appointment o f 4,000 new primary school
teachers, the phased reduction o f missing facilities and the allocation o f incentives for female
teachers in backward areas are also contained in the education budget. The health budget for
2006/7 has risen to about 6.5 billion rupees, which i s an increase o f around 23 percent over the
previous year. This budget increase will cover the health sector reform program, including the
creation o f 500 new posts for nurses, and a special allowance for female medical officers,
gynecologists and lady health workers in remote areas. The two DPC 2 prior actions for the
health sector, primary health care centers in five districts awarded for management by NGO's,
and the baseline studies o f quality o f care assessments o f primary health care centers, are also
adequately covered inthe healthbudget.

50.      While the bulk o f the increasedrecurrent current spending goes to wages and salaries, the
allocation for Operations and Maintenance i s inadequate. Similarly, the ongoing rapid expansion
in development spending would require enhanced monitoring and inspection of projects with
associated increases in the Monitoring and Evaluation budget and the number o f qualified staff.
The strengthened Monitoring and Evaluation would over time lead to substantial savings in the
form o f reduced leakage and together with adequate Operations and Maintenance lead to better
quality o f public infrastructure and other government-owned physical assets. The NWFP and the
Bank have agreed that from FY08 the government will commence increasing the Operations and
Maintenance budget inreal terms.

5 1.     Withregard to the objective of fiscal transparency the presentation inthe 2006/07 budget
continues a few inadequate practices. These include over-estimating foreign project assistance
from donors, the wage expenditure by allocating for all sanctioned posts (rather than for those
which are likely to be filled) and o f interest payments by including some items that should be
classified as financing items.

                  Recent Progress and Challenges in Governance Reform

52.      The NWFP government recognizes that addressing governance weaknesses is
critically important to promote human development and improve fiscal management.The
governance program contains reforms in public financial management, procurement and civil
service reform and administrative devolution. Inpublic financial management, the key reform o f
establishing an integrated, automated budgeting and accounting system to connect provincial and
district offices with real time information has been completed. Further, for the second year
running, the 24 district governments o f NWFP have all prepared their respective budgets on the
basis o f the new chart o f accounts under the New Accounting Model principles. The province-
wide budgets are now available on uniform IMF GFS-compliant charts o f accounts, facilitating
the generation o f aggregated and consolidated fiscal data for the province. Monthly reconciliation
account levels inthe NWFP are the highest among all provinces, with accounts reconciliation for
receipts, expenditures, suspense and inter-governmental accounts scoring 96-100 percent.

53.     The NWFP is also the leading province in terms of improvements to public
procurementreformand legislation.The key reforms o f recent years include the enactment of
a Procurement Law and notification o f rules for procurement o f goods, works and services, and
the notification o f the standard bidding documents o f the Pakistan Engineering Council as the



                                                 17

recommended documents for the province. Moving forward, the governance reform program will
focus mainly on strengthening the financial management and procurement reforms, and carrying
forward the humanresource management database.

Future PolicyChallenges and DevelopmentNeeds

FinancialManagement

54.      Developing the operational IT connectivity and productivity for District Finance
and District Accounts Office sites, using uniform chart of accounts under the New
Accounting Model, is the main future policy challenge. This IT connectivity o f the New
Accounting Model will strengthen the timeliness, accuracy and efficiency o f financial
management within the province. Inaddition, it will facilitate maintaining monthly reconciliation
levels o f provincial accounts at over 95 percent, eventually leading to 100 percent, and timely
completion o f the provincial and district audits each year. The province also needs to train Public
Accounts Committee members, and to staff the Internal Audit Units with trained and qualified
personnel. Over time, the Budget Execution needs to be monitored and reported, for provincial
and district governments, to increase efficiency and transparency o f public expenditure
management.

Procurement

55.      The key policy challengeis to alignthe procurementrules closelywith best practice.
In this context, the NWFP needs to examine the rules (and possibly the law) governing
procurement, and make suitable amendments. In addition, the province needs to replace the
system o f Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR) by Current Market Rates (CMR), to facilitate
competition and efficiency. Also, the various codes, departmental rules andregulations need to be
reviewed, and their application synchronized within the stipulations o f the procurement rules.
This would include the review o f standard bidding documents, and recommendations for the
adoption o f various standard documents for small and large assignments. The legal and
institutional improvement o f the procurement system needs to be complemented by human
resource development and capacity building o f procurement staff and government agencies. Such
development would involve providing regular procurement training for government officials. In
addition, a home for future procurement reforms needs to be established, with a mandate and
capacity for procurement research, database management and updating o f procurement
guidelines. Moreover, a mechanism to redress complaints needs to be set up. And, as the
procurement system i s developed, awareness and training inthe reformed system will be needed.

Civil Service Reforms and Administrative Devolution

56.      The Human Resource Management (HRM) database needs to be operational to
provide timely and accurate information for decision making. Cost control through limited
and strategic recruitment i s important. In particular, expansion o f the civil service should be
mainly confined to priority areas, such as education and health. The Provincial Public Service
Commission (PPSC) needs to carefully monitor and regulate the staff recruitment and
management at the provincial and local levels, as mandated. Inaddition, the province needs to use
contract employment strategically to attract necessary skills from the labor market at competitive
rates. The HRMdatabase i s necessary to provide the informationrequired to manage civil service
staffing effectively and productively.

 Recent Progress and Challenges in Promoting Growth Through Private Sector
 Development

 57.        The NWFP recognizes the importance of private sector led development to promote
 economic growth. The province has made strong progress in private sector development in
 recent years, contributing to better economic growth. Public-private dialogue has been
 institutionalizedthrough the establishment o f an Investment Facilitation Council, headed by the
 Chief Minister, and an Investment Facilitation Committee to address specific issues. The
 reorientation o f the role o f the state from investor to facilitator has been strengthened by the
 participation o f private sector management in 7 o f the 17 industrial estates. Private sector
 representation has also increased in the mining committees. In addition, private participation in
 infrastructure has widened, with 7 o f the 10 small hydel projects leasedto the private sector.

 Future Policy Challenges and Development Needs

 58.        A key need for future private sector development is a unified investment facilitation
 center, coordinated by the private sector and corresponding government agencies, to reduce
 the financial and transactions costs for private sector investment. This investment facilitation
 center will substantially reduce the cost o f doing business in the NWFP, and contribute to long-
 term improvement o f the investment climate. The NWFP has substantial economic potential,
 based on potentially profitable services such as minerals and mining, tourism, hydro-power
 generation, construction, transport and waste management. Currently, more than any other sector
 growth in the mining sector i s hampered by the absence o f a strong regulator. The establishment
 o f a mines magistrate to help regulate the minerals and mining sector i s a key medium-term
 reform that could help pro-poor growth inthe mineral richNWFP.

 59.        The first operation in the series, DPC1, focused broadly on all pillars. Progress on the
 specific areas o fD P C l are given inBox 1below.

                                Box 1: Progresson key Prior Actions ofDPCl
 The Government has sustainedthe reforms o fthe DPCl triggers underall four pillars.

 Pillar I:AcceleratingHumanDevelopmentbyImprovingDelivery of Educationand HealthServices.
 The government continues to provide free textbooks to all primary school students, and girls up to grade
 10.Textbooks were distributedbefore the start of school year inSeptember 2006, and the government i s on
 target to distribute free textbooks prior to the next school year in September 2007. PTAs are functional in
 all primary schools, and continue to receive recurrent budget funds, which will be doubled to Rs.7,000 per
 classroom for FY08. Inaddition PTAs o f almost 50 percent o f all middle and secondary schools have been
 made functional. The implementation o f health reforms supported under DPC Icontinue to make
 satisfactory progress. The TB DOTS program is fully functional across all districts in NWFP through
 public health facilities and joint programs are being implemented with private and non state sector. The
 Government has also taken steps to enhance the implementation HIV/AIDS services for vulnerable
 population sub-groups. Provision o f HIV/AIDS services to IDUs,jail inmates and other high risks has been
 initiated. The IDUprogram is providing services to about 1600 IDUs while the services are now available
 intwo largejails inNWFP. Steps takenbytheNWFPhas also addressedproceduralbottlenecks facilitating
 NGO partners to focus on service delivery.
'Pillar 11: Fiscal and ExpenditureReforms.The Government has kept all reforms described inthe DPCl
 fiscal triggers, and inmost cases has carried implementation further. The fiscal budgets for FY06 andFY06
 show continued implementation of a sound fiscal policy that ensures fiscal sustainability for the province.
 The Government has managed to contain the establishment cost in terms o f GDP also in these last two
 years. The revenue measures in the trigger for DPCl are now established policy and ongoing practice.
 Bonus payments to excise and taxation staff continue to be linked to revenue collection performance, and a
 number o f Tax Facilitation Centers with support from private sector for collection o f selected taxes are in
 operation, and new ones are coming on stream. Government has also, in spite o f steady pressures for the

proliferation o f ADP projects, kept improving the effectiveness o f public investment spending with steady
reduction inthe throw-forward ratio o f development projects.

Pillar 111: Governance Reforms. The provincial budget continues to be presented since 2004-05 under
the format based on the New Chart o f Accounts. Progress has been made in undertaking procurement
policy reforms, and the government has recently agreed specific areas for reform with the Bank. The
government i s working steadily on removing inconsistencies inthe designation o f the appointing authority
for different levels o f officers and staff o f the departments devolved to the districts The provincial cabinet
has constituted a sub-committee to submit recommendation son the creation o f a district cadre from BPS 1-
15, as well as ensuring that provincial secretaries are kept intheir posts for at least 20 months. Inaddition,
the HRM database has been created and operationalized. The HRMdatabase on the payroll o f AG NWFP
i s updated on a monthly basis, on receipt o f relevant information.

Pillar IV: Accelerating Economic Growth and Promoting Private Sector Development. The Industrial
Estate Management Committees headedby the private sector have been established inall Industrial Estates
at Peshawar, Gaddon, Hattar , Nowshera, SI1 Peshawar, SI1 Mardan, and SI1 Abbotbabad. Finally, the
government has also proceeded to divest shares in the Bank o f Khyber, and government holding i s
restricted to 5 1%.25% o f shares have been offered to the general public.

IV. THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE POLICY REFORM
PROGRAM

60.       The central goal o f the NWFP Reform Program i s to improve living standards through
policies that accelerate human development, improve fiscal stability, strengthen governance and
promote growth. The strategy document summarizing the Government's program, Provincial
Reform Program 11, 2005/06 - 2007/08 (PRP 11), was issued in May 2006. The Provincial
Development Strategy consists o f four pillars:

          Accelerating human development to reduce poverty and raise the quality and standard
          o f life o f the people. Improvement in the coverage and quality o f education, health and
          social protectionservices, i s critical for sustained and inclusive economic growth.


          Improving fiscal stability and public expenditure management to strengthen and
          sustain investment to support the medium-term reform program. The low level o f human
          development in the province will require sustained public investment over many years,
          and the government needs to manage its fiscal resources prudently to ensure that its
          reform program i s financially sustainable.

     0    Strengthening governance by improving accountability,                       especially in financial
          management and procurement.


     0    Promoting private sector development to raise incomes and reduce poverty, and to
          increase employment opportunities in productive and sustainable economic activities
          withinthe province.
The scope and contents o f the NWFPreform program, under eachpillar, i s described below.
                              Pillar One: AcceleratingHumanDevelopment

61.       The government o f NWFP has developed a clear vision to both broaden and deepen
human development reform under the PRP I12005/6-2007/8, concentrating on the following three
key themes: (i)further improving access, coverage and utilization o f human development
services; (ii)   improving the quality o f services; and (iii)       undertaking management reform and
strengthening governance, including promoting public-private partnerships, increasing public

investment and developing a sound monitoring and evaluation system. The specific sectoral
reforms for the education, health and social protection sectors are presentedbelow. Financing for
HD sectors are enhanced within the medium-term development framework, and the level and
compositiono f education, healthand social protectionbudgets are aligned with sectoral priorities.
BroadeningandDeepeningEducationSector Reforms

Increasing Access and Coverage o f Education

62.      Increasing enrolment in primaryeducation, and improvingthe transition to middle
and higher levels of education, is a key component of the education reform program. In
order to raise enrolment in the school and college system, the government i s adopting strategies
on both the demand and supply sides o f the education system. The participation o f girls,
especially from poor regions, i s a priority focus o f the reforms to expand participation in the
education system.

63.      The demandfor educationwill be stimulatedthrough a variety of policy initiatives.
The incentive o f providing tuition free education in public schools will continue. In addition,
school children from grades 1-10 will continue to receive free textbooks, partly as an incentive to
attend school and partly to improve learning levels21.The NWFP i s also introducing a major new
policy initiative to promote girls enrolment in middle schools. The policy i s to provide all girls
attending school ingrades 6-10 with a stipend, to stimulate female enrolment beyond the primary
level. Initially, in 2006/7 duringthe preparation o f DPC 2, the stipend will be introduced in seven
districts where female middle school enrolment i s lower than 12 percent. In subsequent years,
depending on the impact o f the program, it will be further developed and expanded to other
districts. The main objective o f increasing female enrolment in middle and secondary schools in
districts with large gender disparities i s to produce a pool o f educated women for the future.
Based on the results o f pilots further demand side instruments to assist children from poor
households to attend school will be explored, as fiscal and administrative capacity allows.

64.      Supply side policies to expand the education system will complement the demand
side measures. The primary school network has been expanding over time, although about 30
percent o f primary schools still lack basic facilities. The NWFP will continue the policy o f
providing a primary school in each village, with adequate facilities such as water, sanitation and
boundary walls for security. The government has also recruited about 4,000 primary teachers, to
move towards the target primary school student-teacher ratio o f 40:l. Consistency between the
education sector reformplans o f district and provincial governments are being expressed interms
o f partnership agreements (Tops). Under DPC 2 the TOPScover increased budget allocations for
education from the District governments, the reduction o f missingschool facilities, and increased
enrolments in primary schools from 2007/8 onwards, in at least 50 percent o f districts22.Over
time, the TOPSwill be expanded to cover all districts. Attention will also be paid to reducing the
30 percent drop out at the Katchi (pre-school) level, including a phased program o f quality
improvement for Katchi education inprimary schools.

65.      In the mediumterm the governmentwill expand middle and secondary schools by
five percent annually. Female middle and secondary schools will receive priority in the
reduction o f missingfacilities. Over time, the middle and secondary teacher stock for the middle


21The delivery o f textbooks was successfully administered, with virtually all students receiving textbooks
on time, according to a study done in200516.
22 The allocation o f provincial funds to the districts will take the TOPSinto account, providing a fiscal
incentive for districts to formulate plans that are consistent with provincial norms for the location of
schools andthe reduction o fmissing facilities.


                                                     21

and secondary school levels will also be increased, ina phased manner.23The focus o f expansion
o f middle and secondary schools will be to reduce gender and regional disparities inparticipation
inpost-primary education. Over the long term college education will also be expanded, both by
stimulating private investment and strategically scaling up public provision. The main purpose o f
expanding college education will be to increase the stock o f well-educated women to take up
positions inprofessionaljobs such as medical practice and health services, secondary and college
teaching, and public administration, and to increase the employability o f college graduates o f
both sexes inthe private and NGO sectors.

Imurovinn the Oualitv o f Education

66.      The central objective of the educationreformprogramis to improve the quality of
education.Policies to improve education quality will focus on three core areas: (a) strengthening
teacher development; (b) improving the competencies and skills o f school heads; and (c)
developing a systemo f class roomtesting.

67.      Strengtheningteacher developmentis criticalto quality improvement.As part o fthe
reform program supported by DPC 2, the NWFP notified a teacher development framework to
set standards and norms for the teacher system. These standards and norms will form the
foundation for teacher development over the medium and long-term, and cover: (a) competency
levels that have to be attained, duringpre-service teacher education, for appointment as a teacher;
(b) professional development o f teachers in service, especially through on-site school based
support, but also through induction training and off-site support; (c) payment systems linked to
the achievement of professional standards; and (d) career progression linked to professional
development. Inthe medium term this framework, which will also be part o f an education sector
plan, will be implemented and institutionalized in phases. Initially, priority will be awarded to
upgrading the quality o f the weaker schools through on site teacher support, and to addressing
teacher absenteeism through incentives, including allowances and secure travel arrangements for
female teachers. Also, efforts will be made to recruit middle and secondary school teachers from
within the district itself, where feasible, as teacher absenteeism is lower among local teachers.

68.      Improvingthe managementand leadership competenciesand skills of school heads
i s a key reformto increaseeducation quality. Several policy measures will be supported under
the DPC 3 cycle. First, the government will create designated positions o f head teachers for
primary schools, so that a clear cadre o f primary school heads will be established. Second,
standards will be set to build the management and leadership skills o f school heads at all levels,
through a regular and recurring cycle o f professional development. Third, the relationship
between the academic services o f teachers and schools heads, and the education management and
administrative services o f education officials, will be clearly specified. This will include the
transition paths between services, promotion prospects within and across services, and relevant
professional development opportunities.

69.      A system of class room assessment to stimulate student learning and obtain
feedbackon student performanceis importantto improveeducationquality.This is areform
for which support will commence inthe DPC 3 cycle. This reform initiative involves buildingthe
capacities o f teachers, school heads and education administrators to: (a) implement class room
testing; (b) disseminate test information to parents and students, and within the school; (c) feed


23 A problemfaced by the province inappointing teachers to middle and secondary schools is a shortage o f
adequately educated women in the adult population who can teach in girls schools, especially in remote
rural districts. This i s a country wide problem, and it may take a generation to address the issue
successfully.



                                                   22

test information back into school management, professional development o f teachers and
classroom practice; (d) institute discussions o f test information between parents, students and
teachers; (e) undertake remedial teaching where problem areas are identified; and (f) arrange
feedback from schools up the chain o f education policy malung to the district and provincial
levels. This i s a complex but important program which will be implemented in stages, with the
capacity buildingwork commencingin200718.

Strengthening Governance and Service Deliverv inthe Education System

70.      Strengthening education governance is a vital component of the education reform
program. Several policy initiatives have been designed to improve governance and service
delivery. A key policy measure that i s being supported under DPC 2 i s the establishment o f an
education sector reform unit (ESRU) in the Department o f Education to act as the apex body to
lead the reform program forward. The mandate o f the ESRU will be policy development,
planning, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation. In this context the ESRU will lead the
preparation, monitoring and annual updating o f the education sector development plan. In
addition, the ESRU will play a key role in the preparation o f plans for the NWFP annual
development programs (capital budget) each year, including integrating donor financing within
the sector plan.

71.      The role of Parent Teacher Associations (PTA's) will be expanded to improve
school-communitylinks.PTA's have been givenbudgetary authority, under the reformprogram
supported by DPC 2, over school development budgets. This will enable PTAs to be involved in
school infrastructure improvement, like construction o f classrooms, boundary walls and latrines,
and the purchase o f furniture and equipment. It i s expected that this will improve the cost
effectiveness, timeliness and quality o f school related construction activities through local
stakeholder participation and supervision. The capacity o f PTA's will also be built up over time
to use the expanded budgetary authority, with emphasis on maintaining financial records and
bank accounts, formulating expenditure plans and records, conducting school development
meetings, and mobilizing parents to promote school attendance among children.

72.      Increasingprivatesector participationin education, especially at the secondary and
college levels, is animportanteducationdevelopmentstrategy inthe NWFP.The government
i s exploring options to re-structure and strengthen the Elementary Education Foundation and the
Frontier Education Foundation to develop private-public partnerships in education. Options for
re-structuring are the widening o f the Boards o f these Foundation to increase private sector
representation, and the provision o f a budget exclusively to stimulate private-public partnerships
at the school and college levels. Alternatives under consideration to strengthen private-public
partnerships inschools are based on options such as: (a) a one time capital grant to assist with the
cost o f expanding and upgradingprivate schools which meet accreditation criteria; (b) a one time
capital grant to support the establishment o f private schools, again subject to accreditation
criteria; and (c) meeting part o f the recurrent costs o f private schools, such as teacher salaries,
according to agreed norms. The contours o f this reform will be clarified during the DPC 3 cycle,
and will form a key element o f long-term Bank support to the NWFP education program.

73.      The education reform program places great emphasis on monitoring, evaluation
and studies of education performance. Several steps are being taken to strengthen monitoring
and evaluation. First, the Education Management Information System (EMIS) has been placed
under the ESRU, and its coverage and quality o f information will be improved over time to
support the information needs o f the education sector plan. Second, external accountability
checks will be introduced, as part o f the reform program supported by DPC3, through third party
validation (TPV) studies. These studies will provide independent monitoring data and evaluation



                                                 23

information for key reforms, such as teacher attendance, the functioning o fPTAs and the delivery
o f textbooks. The information from TPV's will also enable the accuracy o f administration
information, such as the EMIS,to be checked and improved over time. Other studies will also be
conducted, normally with the assistance o f external agencies such as universities and research
institutes, as and when required. In addition, information on cognitive achievement from the
NEAS will be incorporated into the data base o f the ESRU, and utilized for policy formulation in
a variety o f areas, includingresource allocationand teacher development.
74.      A policyreviewof the college systemwill be carried out to help the provinceprepare
a suitable development strategy for the college sub-sector. This study, which will be part o f
the DPC 3 cycle, will cover topics such as: (a) measures to improve quality and labor market
relevance o f the college system; (b) phased expansion o f enrolment in college education; (c)
options for financing expansion and quality improvement; and (d) improving the environment for
private sector participation in college education. The findings o f this review will feed into the
development o fthe college sector inthe next wave o f policy reforms inthe NWFP.
Broadeningand DeepeningHealth Sector Reforms

75.      The NWFP, aware of the challenges facing the health sector, has been working to
deepen health reforms, including progressively increasing financing for the sector within
the medium-term development framework. Improving quality, equity, and utilization o f
services in PHC and secondary care hospitals i s a key component o f the health reform program.
In order to improve quality and utilization, the government will focus on management
innovations to improve effectiveness o f the system. The NWFP will also continue to coordinate
with the federal government to implement the national nutrition strategy in the province in a
phased approach. The health reform program will support: (a) testing innovative approaches to
strengthening the management and organization o f health services; (b) increasing managerial
autonomy and accountability in the public sector; and (c) significantly strengthening the
stewardship function o f government, particularly monitoring and evaluation.

Strengthening Primary Health Care

76.      The NWFP will undertake three organizational innovations to strengthen district
level management of primary health care in nine under-performing districts. The
innovations, which will be assisted through DPC 2, include: (a) supporting five district
governments to contract NGOsto manage all the PHC facilities with responsibility for delivering
a package o f PHC services    - the contract will provide considerable management autonomy and
flexibility, well defined objectives and indicators o f success, and adequate financing at least
equivalent to previous year's budget; (b) increasing the autonomy o f EDOs (Health) with
enhanced administrative and financial powers to effectively manage two districts; and (c)
providing performance based incentives along with administrative and financial autonomy for
district managers and staff intwo districts. These innovations will be rigorously evaluated.

77.      Establishinga mechanismto measurequality of healthcare. Assessments to measure
quality o f health care are rare in Pakistan and NWFP. As part o f the reforms supported through
DPC2 an assessment o f quality o f care in PHC's will be implemented to obtain baseline
information. The assessments will be used to a) develop standards o f health care; b) set out the
measurable objectives o f PHC and hospital reform, and c) devise mechanism to regularly monitor
improvements inthe quality o fhealth care.

Strengthening Secondary Health Care

78.      To improve quality, equity and utilization of services in secondary care hospitalsthe
DOHwill undertake assessments o fthe experience o fhospital autonomy inthe NWFP. Based on


                                                 24

the findings o f the assessment, which are part o f the reforms supported by DPC 2, a strategy will
be developed to improve hospital governance, management and autonomy. This strategy will be
taken forward in DPC 3 with about three districts implementing models o f management
autonomy in their district/Tehsil headquarter hospitals to improve human resource management,
governance, and financing. The innovations, ifsuccessful, will be scaled up to other districts.

Improving Governance and Service Delivery inthe Health System

79.      The stewardship functions of the government are being strengthened through: (a)
enhancing monitoring and evaluation by establishing an independent monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) unit at the provincial level; (b) strengthening partnerships with the private and NGO
sectors through revitalizing the NWFP Health Foundation (NWFPHF);            and (c) strengthening
regulationo f the private sector by supporting the HealthRegulatory Authority (HRA)

    0    Enhancingmonitoring and evaluation functions The health reform program is being
         implemented in a devolved set up and needs regular assessment o f performance for
         informed decision making. GONWFP places a lot o f emphasis on strengthening
         monitoring and evaluation and performance assessment. Several steps will be taken to
         strengthen monitoring and evaluation functions at the provincial/district level. The
         Department will establish an independent monitoring and evaluation unit at the provincial
         level. The unit would assess sector performance, inform health policy, feedback to
         decision makers and enhance accountability by disseminating results to all stakeholders
         provide. The unit will be adequately staffed by skilled manpower to analyze HMIS and
         household data; undertake spot checks to improve quality o f HMIS data; contract out and
         supervise third party assessments and other studies; enhance utilization o f data by
         managers and decision makers and disseminate results to the public and other
         stakeholders.

    0    Strengthening partnerships with the private and NGO sector. The reform o f the
         NWFP Health Foundation i s a key policy measure to strengthen public-private
         partnerships in the health sector. The foundation will be restructured by redefining its
         role, mandate, scope o f work, financing, enhancing its autonomy and means to measure
         its performance. In the medium-term the Foundation will finance the private and NGO
         sector to improve provision o f TB DOTS and childmaternal healthcare services.

    0    Strengtheningregulationof the privatesector To improvequality o f care inthe private
         sector, DPC2 will help develop and implement a regulatory framework for regulation o f
         the health sector. The Health Regulatory Authority (HRA) will be supported through
         provision o f adequate financing and skilled staff to accomplish its mandate effectively.
         HRA will outline a well defined strategy, that addresses its: (i) term vision and
                                                                              long
         objectives; (ii)identifying priorities; and (iii)legislative and regulatory framework and
         means to implement it.

InitiatingSocialProtectionReforms

80.      Socialprotectionhas only beenrecently addedto its reformprogramby the NWFP
provincialgovernment, and needs further policy development. As such, strategic thinking is
needed on what the critical risks faced by poor households are, how well-targeted current
programs are, what are the gaps, and how to design a set o f fiscally sustainable and well
administered and targeted social protectionprograms. The NWFP government recently undertook
a situation analysis o f social protection in the province, collecting information (including
financial information) on all SP programs and initiatives in the NWFP. Based on the situation



                                                 25

analysis the Department o f Social Welfare has commenced the development o f a social protection
action plan to help poor people meet basic needs and alleviate poverty, as well as to enable the
poor to exit poverty through human capital accumulation and access to better jobs arising from
growth.

81.     The establishmentof a SocialProtectionReformUnit (SPRU) in the Departmentof
SocialWelfareto planand develop socialprotectionactivities, with aparticularfocuson the
reductionof risk and vulnerability,is an importantpolicy initiativeof the government.The
SPRU will also undertake monitoring and evaluation o f social protection programs in the
province, and the implementation o f Federal programs such as Zakat and Bait-ul-Mal. The
establishment o f the SP Reform Unit will be a key component o f the reformprogram that will be
supportedby DPC 3.

        Pillar Two: ImprovingFiscalStabilityandPublicExpenditureManagement

82.     The medium-term fiscal reform strategy is being closely integrated with the
government's strategy for humandevelopment andinclusivegrowth. To improve delivery of
social services, increased expenditures and sector-specific measures in education, health, and
water and sanitation, are being complemented with corresponding measures in fiscal
decentralization, to give service providers (local governments) additionalresources.

83.     The high-investmendhigh-growthstrategy envisaged in the medium-term reform
programwill have importantdevelopmentrewards but it will also requireadditionalfiscal
resources for its implementation. The 2006 amendment in the 1997 NFC (National Finance
Commission) Award covering FY07 - FY11 devotes an increasingly higher share o f the divisible
revenue pool to the provinces.

84.     The provincial budget received a substantial increase in federal revenue transfers in
2006/7 from the amended NFC Award: but the net effect on NWFP's finances i s more limited as
the direct cost impact on the provincial budget stemming from the federal government's general
pay increase i s o f comparable magnitude.24 Under the new arrangement, NWFP got an increase
o f about Rs.6 billion (12.7 percent) in FY07 compared to the terms o f the original 1997 NFC
Award. The estimated addition to the wage bill i s about Rs.4 billion, leaving a net impact o f 0.2
% o fPGDP.

85.     The NWFP government plans to strengthen own finances and i s committed to a full

mobilization i s a major challenge given the existing federal - provincial assignment o f tax
implementation o f the fiscal reform program that started in 2001. Increasing own resource

instruments that leaves NWFP with a limited tax base.*' With focused efforts on tax policy and
tax administration reform there i s some potential to generate higher own revenues over the
medium term from revenue sources such as the Motor Vehicle Tax (MVT), Stamp Duty,
Professional Tax, Urban Immovable Property Tax, Agricultural Income Tax and taxing services.
However, the growth strategy also requires increased resource transfers or tax assignment from
the federal government as well as increased external development assistance.

86.     To strengthen own revenue mobilization, the government will address issues in tax
administration to make it more effective, and strengthen collection o fbroad based taxes and user
charges. Besides improving tax administration through improved incentives, training and



24The 2006 amendment i s likely to be continued until such time that the NFC announces a new Award.
25Federal laws also exempt 7 out o f 24 districts in the province from paying taxes to the provincial
government.


                                                  26

computerization o f tax records:6       the provincial government plans to focus more intensely on
relatively broad-based provincial taxes. Collection o f MVT, which i s below potential, i s being
streamlined through a more automated collection system. To improve the structure and revenue
potential o f the urban property tax, the provincial government has completed a survey o f urban
properties. Key measures for rationalizing and improving the yield o f user charges include:
improving the water rate formula with the aim o f making it self-financing and a review o f higher
education fees and user charges for tertiary health services, with adequate safety nets for the poor.
Because o f these measures, the provincially collected revenue i s projected to increase at an
average rate o f 15 ?4 percent p.a. from FY06 to FY10. With federal tax assignment and transfers
expected to grow as projected in the current NFC arrangement overall provincial revenue i s
projected to increase by 15.7 percent per year, 3 percentage points faster than nominal GDP.

87.       The government plans to continue to create fiscal space by following its strategic debt
management policy to save interest payments through better debt management (in particular by
retiring loans from the federal government at high interest rates). Since agreement has recently
been reached with the federal government on early debt retirement, the provincial government
aims at retiring some debt prematurely this year and to continue this policy incoming years.

88.       Accelerating growth and facilitating access to service delivery will require not only
increasingthe overall level of public expenditures,but also improving the composition and
effectiveness of these expenditures, with relatively more emphasis on investment and operations
and maintenance, less on consumption, and better management of investment projects. In its
medium-term budget framework (FY07 - FY10) the government plans to contain overall current
expenditure in terms o f provincial GDP with a reduction from 6.9 percent in FY06 to about 6
percent in FYlO (see Table S), while significantly enhancing spending on high-priority sectors
such as education and health. An increasing share o f the budget will go to Maintenance and
Repairs to maintain the value o f public capital stock. Resumptiono f early retirement o f expensive
federal debt will continue to lower interest payments. Regarding public investment, the
government has raised the level o f development (ADP) spending from 2 percent o f PGDP in
FY04 - FY05 to an expected 3 percent o f PGDP this year (FY07) while continuing to reduce the
ADP throw-forward ratio considerably. The government will keep development spending at the
FY07 level over the medium term. It will invest more in priority areas that include education,
health, roads, irrigation networks, and water supply and sanitation while containing the "throw-
forward" o f the Annual Development Programat its current level inreal terms. Reforms will also
aim at raising the effectiveness of public investment spending through improved selection o f
projects, avoidingpost-approval escalation o f costs, and improved monitoring and supervision.

89.       The fiscal framework also envisages measures to fully meet future liabilities and
making the budget process more effective and transparent. It will continue to build up the
Pension Fund, the General Provident Fund and the Frontier Highway Authority Funds. Drawing
on the newly established Human Resource database for the civil service it will explore pension
r e f o m options by projecting pension liabilities under different reform scenarios. The government
will also continue to improve budget preparation through phased roll-out o f performance
budgetingto other districts. At the start of FY07 pilot performance budgetswere in place for
selected areas of four districts, making NWFP the leading province in the country in this
area. The performance budgets' targets and monitoring arrangements will be harmonized with
the districts' Terms o f Partnership in education and health service provision. To improve budget

Revenue (BoR) and the Excise and Taxation (E&T) Department; modernizing the mode of application o f
laws and administration o f agricultural and land-based taxes; and improving coordination between the BoR
and E&T Departments. The GoNWFP is undertaking a new study to improve revenue administration inthe
key revenue collecting Departments.

    90.        By continuing fiscal decentralization reforms the Government will enable local
    governments to function more effectively and hence improve the delivery o f social services." As
    a key step towards further fiscal decentralization the government has devolved the payment of
    district staff salaries through (district) Account IV with effect from July 2006. This should
    provide proper incentives to districts for efficiency gains in staffing. Inaddition, it also intends to
    increase the share o f district development budgets executed through (district) Account IV which
    also will need capacity building for district staff. The government has also made headway in
    formulating a transparent formula/system o f incentive grants to Districts for good performance in
    service delivery, and has initiated work on designing conditional grants. In this mechanism
    development funds could be transferred to the district governments (through Account IV)as part
    o f performance agreements between the provincial and district governments. Also, over the
    medium term the Provincial Finance Commission should be made permanent to institutionalize
    fiscal decentralization and review fiscal performance o f the districts on an ongoing basis.

    91.        The combined effect o f the provincial government's fiscal policies and reforms over the
   medium term are summarized in its medium-term budget projections. The broad outcomes
    include: (i)the provincially collected revenue will grow considerably faster than nominal
   provincial GDP; (ii)         the provincial current expenditure will remain at about 6 perent o f GDP,
    slightly below the 2006/07 level, throughout the medium term; (iii) level o f provincial
                                                                                          the
    development expenditure will be consolidated at about 3 percent o f PGDP; (iv) the fiscal deficit
   will decline from 1.2 percent o fPGDP in2005/06 to 0.6 percent in2006/07 and will on average
   remain at this level over the medium term; (v) the stock o f public debt will decline as a percent o f
   PGDP; and (vi) interest payments will continue to decline gradually interms o f PGDP and reach
   relatively low levels o f debt service burden (9% o f current expenditure) by 2009/10.

                            PillarThree: StrengtheningGovernance

92.      Weak governance has been an important development challenge, and the focus on human
development in the future will require continued improvements in: (i)public financial
management, (ii)    procurement; and (iii)   carrying the devolution process forward; the latter with
the goal o f improving the administration o f multi-tiered government (province/district/tehsil) and
making local governments more accountable for improved service delivery. The main thrust o f
governance reforms are as follows.

Public FinancialManagement

93.      The government will continue to implement its medium-term strategy for public financial
management reforms as outlined in the PFAA action plan. These reforms aim, inter alia, at
improving the reliability and accuracy of financial data, institutionalizing the internal audit
function and improving accountability and legislative oversight. The outcome o f the joint-donor
PEMre-assessment, currently inprogress, will further informon the renewed areas o freform that
the province will include as part o f its overall reform agenda.

ProcurementReforms

94.      While the province has made substantial progress in procurement reforms,
including promulgating a new Procurement Law, and rules, further work is needed to
effectively implement the regulatory framework.          .The  government i s refining phase 3 o f its
Procurement Reform Action Plan to align procurement rules to best practice over the medium
term. Among other things, this includes specifying the needed amendments in the procurement
rules, puttingin place a system for posting and updating market prices for use in cost estimates,
and providing procurement training.

Modernizationofthe civil service and administrationof multi-tieredgovernment

95.      The HRMdatabasewill needto continueand befully operational andbe integrated
with PIFRA. It should be in regular use, with reliable and timely data provided for HFW
planning and monitoring o f establishment levels, appointments, promotions and transfers at
provincial, district and tehsil levels. It can also be used, for instance, to monitor at provincial and
district levels the success o f policies to recruit and retain female teachers at girls' schools and
health workers at basic health units in disadvantaged districts. Initially the HRM database will
focus mainly on priority sectors, such as education and health, but will then be extended to cover
all sectors over the long-term.

       PillarFour:PromotingEconomic GrowthThroughPrivateSector Development

96.      With the overarching goal of reducing poverty in the province the NWFP
government's medium-term strategy also sets out to increase employment opportunities
through accelerated, inclusive growth. The government, supported by the Bank's analytical
work and the ground work inrecent years, has developed an overall strategy for economic growth
that was presentedat the NWFP development forum inM a y 2006.

97.      The private sector inthe NWFPhas always had a low base and efforts under the program
are meant to accelerate growth by usingprivate sector development as a key vehicle. The Bank's
support i s multi-pronged, with the emphasis being on reshaping the role o f the Government as a
facilitator for the Private Sector and not a provider. The focus has been on involving the private
sector inkey decision bodies that impact the productivevalue o fthe sector.


                                                   29

98.      The next phase o f the growth strategy aims to (i)strengthen the private sector by
promoting demand-responsiveness o f public sector agencies; (ii)          improve the functioning o f
industrial estates; and (iii)supporting an enabling environment to spur growth in important
sectors. The key policy measure for 2006/7 is the establishment of a one-window investor
facilitation center coordinated by the private sector and the corresponding line agencies.
This one-window investor facilitation center became operational inthe last quarter o f 2006, and
about 150 potential investors have already utilized its services.

99.      The government will implement a subsequent phase o f its growth acceleration strategy by
2007. The key reform will be setting up and starting operations o f a Mines Magistrate to
strengthen enforcement o f mining property rights and address labor concerns, to facilitate the
development o f the important minerals and mining sector. Legal recognition o f mines will be
extended throughout NWFP and the provincial policy extended to mines in PATA. In addition,
the NWFP will merge the SDA and Small Industries Development Board (SIDB), transfer
management control o f the Bank o f Khyber to the private sector, develop an enabling framework
for private provision o f power and initiate preparation o f a decentralized PPI law that defines the
role o f all relevant units (rather than establishing a central unit). It will also develop an enabling
framework for private provision o f municipal services, and seek to restructure the technical and
vocational training system consistent with principles o f being private sector led andresponsive to
labor market demands.

LINKTO CAS

100.     The DPC 2 is fully consistentwith the FY06-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
that was approved by the Boardin June 2006, and is the main vehicle for the delivery of
IDA support to the province.The CAS, which plans IDA availability o f US$785 million per
year to Pakistan, has three inter-related and mutually reinforcing pillars linked to the strategic
pillars o f the PRSP: (I)     sustaining growth and improving competitiveness; (11) improving
government effectiveness and service delivery; and (111) improving lives and protecting the
vulnerable. The NWFP DPC 2 supports all three pillars o f the CAS in the NWFP. Pillar 1 o f
DPC2, accelerating human development, impacts positively on all three CAS pillars. Pillar 2 o f
the DPC2, improved fiscal stability and better public expenditure management, i s a pre-requisite
for accomplishing the CAS pillar o f sustaining economic growth. Pillar 3 o f DPC2 i s aimed to
promote and strengthen governance, which i s critical for attaining CAS pillars 2 and 3. Finally
the fourth pillar o f DPC2, promoting growth and private sector development, i s perfectly
consistent with Pillar 1 o f the CAS. Bank engagement inNWFP through the DPC series i s guided
by the strategic principles o f the CAS: (a) client pull; (b) scaling up / replicating approaches that
have already proved to be effective; (c) focusing on outcomes; and (d) using programmatic
approaches to provide flexible andpredictable support to promisingmedium-term reforms.

COLLABORATIONWITHTHE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

101.     The Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), continue to work closely
and hold regular consultations on Pakistan macroeconomic issues. Pakistan is now on a
yearly Article IV Consultations cycle and the latest IMF Article IV consultation mission was
undertaken inJanuary 2007. The IMF successfully completed the final review o f the o f the PRGF
inDecember 2004 andthe Government o fPakistandidnotrequest a successorIMFprogram.

102.     The Bank is collaborating actively with development partners at the federal and
provinciallevels, including through the Poverty Reduction Support Credits at the national level,

and provision o f technical assistance for analytical and strategic work linked with the provincial
reform program. Other development partners are complimenting the Banks work in the NWFP,
especially in education, health and social protection. The EC i s supporting the education sector in
close alignment with the Bank DPC series. DFID i s working closely with the Bank to support the
NWFP provincial reform program, with a special focus on the social protection reforms and on
the health sector. GTZ i s providing technical assistance for the education and health sectors,
aligned with the reform program supported by other development partners. NORAD has a
program to support education activities, mainly the establishment o f local circle offices for school
administration; madrassah mainstreaming; and upgrading o f teacher training institutes. The
NWFP i s also receiving assistance from USAID, UNFPA and UNICEF to strengthen the district
level maternal and neonatal health services in selected districts. All donor assistance i s aligned
with the provincial reform program. The ADB i s considering preparing a an operation aimed at
supporting the growth pillar o fthe NWFP reform program, with emphasis on urbanmanagement.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

103.     The proposed DPC 2 is closely linked to a number of ongoing and planned
development policy and investment operations in the country.It complements the ongoing
Education sector DPCs in Punjab and well as the planned DPC series in Sindh, and strongly
promotes Pakistan's PRSP objectives. The reforms supported by the NWFP DPC 2 also
complement those at the Federal level assisted by the PRSCs. Learning Assessment reforms at
the provincial level will buildon the achievements o f the National EducationAssessment System
(NEAS) project. In addition the NWFP DPC 2 also incorporates lessons learned on encouraging
private-public partnerships in education in Balochistan during the preparation o f the Baluchistan
Education support Project (BESP). Finally, the Public Financial Management reforms supported
by the NWFP DPC 2 complement those being implementedunder the platform o f the Project for
Improvement o f Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA), to improve the overall fiduciary
environment and enhance the accountability process inthe use o fpublic education resources.

LESSONSLEARNED

104.     The DPC 2 builds upon lessons learned from previous policy based lending
operations in the NWFP and elsewhere, and Bank experience of national and sub-national
policy reformprograms.The key lessons include:

         Strong political commitment and leadership are essential for a successful policy reform
         program to improve human development andreduce poverty.
         A close partnership between the NWFP government, the Bank and other development
         partners i s required, at both the political and technical levels, to develop and implement
         deep and lastingpolicy reforms.
         Technically rigorous monitoring, evaluation and research studies are required to assess
         progress, measure results and outcomes, and guide the development o f future policy
         reforms.
         Analytical and advisory activities that increase the knowledge base and advance the
         policy agenda play an important role in the deepening and broadening o f the reform
         program.
         Strategic selection and sequencing o f reforms i s important to ensure deep and lasting
         impact on human development.

DESCRIPTIONOF THE OPERATION

106.      The proposed NWFP DPC 2 is the second in a sequence of three annual
Development Policy Credits that assist the NW"P government to implement the medium-
term development program to accelerate human development, improve fiscal stability and
public expenditure management, strengthen governance, and promote economic growth through
private sector development. The DPC 2 will provide a single tranche disbursement o f US$130
million (IDA) to the Government o f Pakistan, with the rupee equivalent being on-lent to the
Government o f the NWFP. DPC2 has a strategic focus on improving outcomes in the human
development sectors: education, health and social protection. In addition, DPC2 cames forward
reforms to ensure sound fiscal management, strengthen governance in the key fiduciary areas o f
procurement and financial management, and promote private sector led economic growth. These
reforms, while important policy objectives in themselves, will also help create fiscal space for
sustainable investment in human development over the long-term. While DPC2 supports the
overall NWFP reform program, a set o f key prior actions were identified by the government and
agreed with the Bank as the critical reforms to be completed during the preparation o f the
operation. The status o fthese prior actions are describedbelow.

framework of the good practice principles for policy based operations. The Good Practice
Principles on Conditionality are presentedinBox 4 overleaf.

 121.    The proposedoperationhasthe potentialto yield severalcomplementarybenefits.

a.       The NWFPDPC 2 will provideresources to supportthe NWFP's new medium-term
reformprogram, with a particular emphasis on improving human developmentoutcomes.
Human development levels inPakistan lag below most other developing countries at comparable
levels of per capita income, and the NWFP performs below the national average in human
development. Gender, economic and regional disparities inhuman development are also sharp in
the NWFP. The operation, by assisting the province to increase human development levels,
especially among girls and women, poor households, and in under-developed districts, will
generate substantial benefits interms of improved gender, economic and regional equity.

                                      Box 4. GoodPracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle1: ReinforceOwnership
The proposeddevelopment policy credit supportsthe reformprogramo f the NWFP Government, which i s closelyalignedto
the Medium Term Budget Framework. The operation has widespread ownership among key stakeholders at all levels of
government and political leadership, and has been designed on the basis of consultations with primary stakeholders (local
communities) and involvementof district governments. A track recordof high level ownership and commitment to reforms
has been demonstratedthroughout the periodof the two previousSACs andDPC1, and is continuing.Bank assistanceto the
Government programtakes into consideration the political economy of reform, as reflected in the sequencing of reforms,
 such as the phased entrance of district governmentsinto terms of partnershipagreementswith the provincial government in
the education sector, the gradualsharingofhealthcaremanagement with NGOs, andthe relaxationof administrativebarriers
to privatesector development throughthe one-windowinvestment facilitation center.

 The operation i s based on a strong platform of analytical work, such as the NWFP Economic Report, NWFP Public
 FinancialAccountability Assessment, PakistanPublic ExpenditureReview, Country Gender Assessment, CountryReport on
 Risk and Vulnerability and Devolution inPakistan. The four pillars of the reform program, and the contents of each pillar,
havebeen derivedfrom the findings andrecommendationsof these reports. Goingforward, the Bank is working closelywith
 the Government to strengthen the knowledge base on the province. Current analytical work includes establishing baseline
 measures of cognitive achievement in primary and secondaryeducation, setting baseline indicatorsof the quality of care in
 healthinstitutionsand a stock taking of social protectioninterventionsin the province. Further analyticalwork is plannedto
 support the future series of reforms, includingstudiesto promote private-publicpartnershipsineducation and to develop the
 college system, third-partyevaluationsof key reforms ineducationandhealth, and studiesof public finances andthe sources
 of economic growth.

 Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
 framework
 The Policy Matrix o f Reforms, which is based on the NWFP Government's overall reform program, constitutes the
 framework for all assistanceby development partners. Within this government framework, a variety of donors are assisting
 the education sector (EC, GTZ, Norway), the health sector (DFID and GTZ), social protection (DFID) and governance
 reforms (EC, DFID). The performance framework is derived from the Government Program, and the Government is
 establishingmechanismsto coordinatedonor supportto achievethese performancetargets.

 Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Banksupportto country circumstances
 The DPC supports the NWFP's overall reform program. The preceding SACs and DPCl established the foundation for
 sound fiscal management and economic growth in the province. DPC2 builds on this foundation to focus strategically on
 accelerating human development, while also carrying forward reforms to further promote fiscal prudence, strengthen
 governanceandstimulate economic growth.These are linked to Pakistan'soverallhumandevelopment andgrowthreforms.

 Principle4: Chooseonly actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement
 The programframework reflects the scope and content of the Government's reform program. The eleven key prior actions
 for DPC2 were identified, in consultationwith the Government, as the most critical actions across the four pillars of the
 reformprogram. The eleventriggers for DPC3 were selected, indiscussionwith the Government, as the key actions needed
 to accelerate the momentumofthenext roundof the reformprogram.

 Principle5: Conducttransparent progressreviewsconduciveto predictableand performance-basedfinancialsupport
 The program i s regularly reviewed by the Task Team through formal missions, through continuous dialogue with policy
 makers and administrators, and through field visits. The Government has established a review mechanism, under a higher
 level Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary, to monitor the progress of the program. This review process is
 strengthened by periodic third party monitoring studies and impact evaluation. These arrangements have enabled close
 collaborationbetweenthe Government and Bank to monitor the program, address problems and issues promptly, and fine
 tune the programto strengthenits implementation.


b.       Within human development, the reform program will cover the full education,
healthand social safety net programs,whereas inthe past only sub-sets o f each sector, such as
primary education or primary health care, were included. The sector wide focus o f DPC 2 on
education and health enables the government to address the full range o f challenges facing each
sector by focusing on both demand and supply side policies, and exploiting economies o f scale
and scope inthe implementation o f development strategies for each sector.

C.       DPC 2 enables the Bank to integrate support around a mutually consistent, multi-
sectoral reform agenda, and exploit synergy between policies to improve human


                                                         38

development, sustain fiscal stability, strengthengovernance and promote economicgrowth.
Hence, in addition to the strategic focus on human development, the NWFP's overall
development program will be assisted through this operation.

d.       DPC 2 will facilitate the dialogue between the government, the Bank and other
developmentpartnersto coordinateallexternalassistanceunder the NWFP'smedium-term
policy reform program.A future DPC 3 will offer a further vehicle for donors to harmonize
their financial support to the government.

e.       The design of DPC 2 increases ownership and commitmentwithin the government,
as Bank support is targeted to the overall reformprogram developed by the NWF'P.This
also increases coordination o f reform policies within government, as the development plans o f
each sector i s agreed with the Ministries o f Finance, and Planning and Development, and
includedwithinthe overall government budget.

f.       The proposed operation will also assist the province to stimulate private sector
investment by reducing transactions costs to market entry and facilitating commercial
operations.Higher private sector investment can increase growth andreduce poverty, and create
employment opportunities for educated young people inthe future.

POVERTY AND SOCIALIMPACT

123.     In NWFP, one of Pakistan's poorest provinces, poverty is strongly associated with
lack of access to critical education and health services. Where such services are available,


                                               39

lack o fhousehold demand for such services has been a key deterrent for poor children, especially
girls, taking advantage o f available schools and advancing their own education. The DPC 2 is
designed to address these concerns, and by doing so, it supports the Government's PRSP
objectives. The basic underlying motivation behind the proposed reforms inhuman development
are to ensure that: (a) the access to human development services in education, health and social
protection are equitable across income groups, gender and rural-urban location; and (b) both
market and state failures are addressed through systemic reforms in education, health and social
protection. By correcting deficiencies in service delivery in rural areas and by relaxing demand
side constraints o f poor families, the operation will significantly advance the main PRSP
objectives o f ensuring that the benefits o f growth are widely shared and that opportunities for
human capital accumulation are enjoyed by all socio-economic groups.

124.     Concertedefforts to improve human developmentoutcomesare importantnot only
to improve equity but also as anintegralpart of Pakistan's growth objective. By integrating
social protectioninterventions into the health and education programs, DPC series will address at
once both poverty and vulnerability along side advancing the medium term goal o f preparing a
well-educated and healthier workforce to meet the challenge o f promoting broad-based and
widely shared economic growth. Some o f the pilots being implemented will provide lessons for
future mainstreaming and/or for malung suitable adjustments in the design o f interventions.
Moreover, the whole set o freforms being supported by DPC series are such that significant social
externalities (such as secondary school education o f girls leading to lower infant and lower
maternal mortality) will result, thus raising the overall productivity and returns to public
investments.    To the extent the operation promotes public-private partnerships in advancing
human development, even private investments could be channeled to create social externalities.

125.      The NWFP Reform Program has been developed and is being implemented
through a process of extensive consultationwith stakeholders and beneficiaries, including
district and local government officials, the private sector, NGOs, and local communities.
The operation i s strengthening relationships between the government, the private sector and civil
society. The education reform program also empowers local school communities, such as parent-
teacher associations, to contribute to the management o f government schools, including utilizing
development and recurrent budgets. The health reform program empowers NGOs to manage
health facilities. The role o f the private sector in economic activities i s also strengthened in the
reform program, including private-public partnerships in infrastructure provision, and space for
the private sector to be represented in government authorities, such as the one-window investor
facilitation center.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

Implementation

126.     The reforms are being implemented by the Department o f Finance, Department o f
Planning and National Development, and the various sector departments, including the
Departments o f Schools and Literacy, Health and Social Welfare. A Reform Support Unit (RSU)
in the Department of Finance assists the coordination of the reform program. The key
departments and the RSU all have considerable experience o f implementing policy reforms, and
o f Bank operations to support such reforms, due to the experience o f earlier reform programs that
were supported through the IDA financed SAC 1 (2002), SAC 2 (2004) and DPC 1 (2006). The
RSU will be further strengthened, through the recruitment o f senior and experienced staff, and
capacity building o f the existing office, to coordinate the future series o f DPC's, commencing
with DPC 3.




                                                  40

127.    The overall monitoring and oversight o f the reform program i s the responsibility the
provincial government. However, district governments play a role in the implementation o f the
program in decentralized sectors, including education and health. The terms o f partnership
agreement between the provincial and district governments in education, and for management
innovations in health, will clearly specify the roles and responsibilities o f the two tiers o f
government, eventually strengthen capacity o f the district governments to deliver these key
services at the district level.

Monitoring and Evaluation

128.    The NWFP reform program contains a strong emphasis on monitoring and
evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation o f the program will be under the oversight of the
Department o f Finance, including the Reform Support Unit (RSU). In addition, within the key
sectors, health and education, the existing Health Sector Reform Support Unit and the Education
Sector Reform Support Unit that i s to be establishedas part o f the reforms will play major roles in
monitoring the program. The Health Management Information System (HMIS) and the Education
Management Information System (EMIS) will provide administrative data and management
information for the key human development sectors.

129.     Several measures are being supported as part of the reform program to improve
monitoring and evaluation. These include: (a) strengthening the information base on human
development through the improvement o f education and health information management systems
inthe Departments of Schools and Literacy, Higher Educationand Health; (b) capacity building
o f the Departments o f Schools and Literacy, Higher Education and Health to collect, process and
utilize policy relevant information for planning, management and monitoring purposes; (c)
contracting out third party validations o f data to external parties, including research agencies and
consulting firms; and (d)reliable, timely and comprehensive decision-oriented financial and fiscal
information generated across the province and posted on the government website.

130.     Surveys and censuses carried out by the Federal Government, such as the biannual
CWIQ surveys, triannual Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and triannual Pakistan
IntegratedHouseholdSurveys, addto the informationbaseonthe NWFP.These surveys and
censuses can be used for analysis and monitoring o f time trends o f key outcomes, including
poverty rates, school enrolment, and mortality and morbidity rates. In education, the Federal
government i s undertaking a census o f schools, includingprivate schools, which can feed into the
NWFP education management information system (EMIS). There i s also the national assessment
o f learning outcomes that will provide evidence o f cognitive achievement levels in the province.
The MOH has also commissioned an in-depth assessment o f vertical programs to identify options
for further decentralizationo f vertical nationalprograms.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

FinancialManagementReforms

131.     The NWF'P is the most advanced province in Pakistan in terms of financial
management reforms. The financial accountability environment in the province, as concluded
by the Provincial PFAA (April 2005), provides adequate safeguards for reliance on government
financial management systems. This i s reinforced by the progress o f actions implemented since
the IMF Safeguards Assessment (2001) o f the State Bank o f Pakistan, and also by the conclusions
o f the draft report presented at the government/joint-donor partners' workshop in January 2007
on the PEFA diagnostics and the OECD-DAC Baseline Procurement Assessment carried out for
the province, and planned for finalization during FY 2007. The draft PEFA PFM PMF report



                                                  41

highlighted the overall improvement in PFM in the province, with high rating scores in budget
comprehensiveness, budget classifications and orderliness, participation in the annual budget
process; predictability o f expenditure commitment flows; effectiveness o f payroll controls;
recording and management o f cash balances, debt, and guarantees. While improvements remain
to be accomplished in several areas, the strong commitment o f the province to initiate a renewed
strategy demonstrates that reformimplementationi s on course.

132.    The key thrust of the financial management reformprograminNWF'P rests on the
pace and comprehensiveness of implementationof the Bank-financed country-wide public
financial managementproject, PIFRA.Several critical performance improvements demonstrate
the commitment o f the NWFP, including: (a) improving the reliability and accuracy o f the
financial information, on a uniform basis, through the adoption o f a new chart o f accounts for
provincial and district governments' budgets and accounts, resulting in the highest levels o f
reconciliation o f accounts amongst all provinces; (b) being the first province to achieve 100 per
cent IT connectivity in FMIS implementation covering the provincial and all district
governments, enabling the production o f meaningful and comprehensive fiscal and financial
information on a timely basis; (c) improving the reporting lag for provincial government civil
accounts to 14 days from 15-21 days, and buildingon the strategy to improve timeliness to not
more than 10 days after each month-end; and (d) maintaining the pro-activity o f the provincial
and district external audit infrastructure incompleting the audit on a timely basis.

133.    Moving forward, the financial management reform program will include the
entrenchment o f transparency and disclosure requirements pertaining to the budget execution
status o f all provincial and district governments by ensuring that the financial and fiscal status
reports, in detailed formats, are posted to the website and made readily available; internal audit
functions are well established and are functioning and addressing systemic issues in the overall
management and control o f public resources; and the annual draft accounts are indeed produced
on timely basis (withinthree months o f the end o f the fiscal year) and equally audited on timely
basis usinginternational standards o f auditing.

134. Foreign Exchange Control Environment: An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the State Bank
o f Pakistan (SBP) was conducted in 2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities at the SBP
particularly as relating to its financial statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f
acceptable Central Bank standards. However, since a program o f reform has been agreed with the
IMF and is being implemented, the risks associated with foreign exchange management control
have been mitigated. The State Bank o f Pakistan has transitioned to producing financial
statements which accord with international accounting standards and formats. An independent
review o f the SBP's internal audit function, as recommended by the Safeguards Assessment, has
since been completed and recommendations implemented. The SBP has also established a formal
process o f reconciling data reported to the Fund as well as implemented guidelines to prohibit
operations that pledge or encumber reserves, or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair the
availability o f foreign exchange reserves outside an authorized framework. Equally, the SBP's
Act has been accordingly amended to strengthen and guarantee its independence and autonomy in
the management o f reserves as requiredunder the Safeguards Assessment.

ProcurementReforms

135.    The NWFP i s the leading province in terms o f governance reform encompassing
improvements to the public procurement legislative and regulatory framework. The NWFP
passed the Procurement Ordinance in 2002 as the first government (federal and provincial) inthe
country. Rules for procurement o f consulting services were notified inNovember 2002, and rules
for procurement o f goods, works and (non-consultancy) services were notified inDecember 2003.
The Ordinance was adopted by the parliament as the Procurement Law for goods, works and


                                                42

services in 2003. InFebruary 2006 NWFP prepared a road map to revise the procurement rules
and review the procurement law to eliminate all aspects limiting transparency and equal
opportunity and align these documents with international best practice. Upon request o f the
NWFP, the Bank arranged for a grant to facilitate to bringabout these amendments. The grant for
Strengthening o f Procurement Regulatory Framework was signed on August 10, 2006 and over
the next three years, it aims at the following achievements:

    e    aligning the procurement rules closer to international best practice, and suggesting
         amendments inthe law;
    e    replacing the system o f Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR) by Current Market Rates
         (CMR);
    e    review the various codes, departmental rules and regulations to synchronize their
         application incontext o f the stipulations o fthe (amended) procurement rules;
    e    implement an effective mechanism to redress complaints with respect to procurement;
    e    identify a home for procurement reforms for further research, database management and
         revisions; and
    e    implement awareness o f and training for the reformed system.

136.     The Finance Department i s the executing agency for this grant. As the phase o f the
procurement reform supported through DPC2, the government has defined the areas which
require improvements in the rules, the standard bidding documents and in the law if required,
especially to introduce a system o f market rates for preparingcontract budgets. Inthe next phase,
to be supported through DPC3 the NWFP will bringprocurement practices to best practice. This
will include notifying amendments in the procurement rules eliminating discriminatory
stipulations and aligning it to the best practice, implementing revised rules, adopting amended
Standard BiddingDocuments for goods, works and services, and ensuring their implementation.
These reforms will be supported by comprehensive procurement training at various levels, and
the setting up o f a provincial procurement institutional arrangement to act as a focal point for
procurement activities.

Conclusionsonthe FiduciaryEnvironment

137.     With the implementation o f the reform measures in the financial management and
procurement areas already on course in the province, and arising from the mitigated risks
associated with the manner inwhich the SBP manages the country's foreign exchange reserves as
highlighted in the IMF Safeguards Assessment, the overall fiduciary risk o f the program i s rated
`modest  '.

DISBURSEMENTSAND FIDUCIARY ASSURANCE

138.     On-Lending Terms: The Islamic Republic o f Pakistan, represented by the Federal
Ministry of Finance would be the Borrower. The Loan would be on-lent by the Federal
Government to the Government o f NWFP on terms and conditions as shall be agreed betweenthe
two governments.

139.     Funds flow arrangements: The Government o f Pakistan shall identify a Foreign
Exchange Account with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) and which forms part o f the country's
official foreign exchange reserves, into which the proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a
single tranche basis upon Credit effectiveness.        The Rupees equivalent o f the funds in the
Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund o f the
Government o f NWFP (Account No. 1- Non-Food) held with the SBP which i s used to finance
budget expenditures.



                                                  43

140.    Disbursements from the Consolidated Account No.1 (Non-food) by the Government o f
NWFP shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall
be needed. The proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in
the negative list as defined in the Schedule o f the Financing Agreement. If any portion o f the
Credit is used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule o f the Financing
Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount o f the said payment to IDA. Amounts refknded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled from the Credit.

141.    Assurance Requirements: For this credit, no special fiduciary arrangements, inthe form
o f an audit, are required; particularly in the light o f the manner in which SBP manages the
country's foreign exchange reserves. However, within 45 days o f disbursement o f the Credit by
IDA, the Finance Secretary o f NWFP shall provide a written confirmation to IDA certifying the
receipt o f the Rupees equivalent o f the Credit into the Consolidated Fund Account o f the
Government o f NWFP, the number o f the account, the date o f the receipt, and the exchange rate
applied to translate the Credit currency into Rupees.

ENVIRONMENTAL,ASPECTS

142.    The policies supportedby the proposed operation are environmentally benign, and
do not entail significant negative effects on the environment, forests, or other natural
resources. The DPC's focus on assisting the NWFP government to broaden and deepen human
development reforms while providing continued support to strengthen governance i s expected to
have positive environmental effects. Poverty reductions as a result o f improvements in human
capital are anticipated to reduce current over-dependence on "depletable" natural resources (e.g.,
biomass for fuelwood). Also, fiscal reforms include recommendations to increase resources
allocated to environmental agencies. Finally, supported governance reforms encompassing the
environmental agencies are expected to enhance their capacity to enforce environmental
regulations. Reforms aimed at accelerating economic growth through private sector development
might induce potential positive and negative environmental effects. Given the structure o f the
Province's industry, it i s anticipated that stimulation o f private sector activity will entail mainly
broad based growth o f light industries, with a modest environmental footprint and low pollution
intensity.

143.    According to the Bank's Strategic Country Environmental Assessment (SCEA)
Pakistan has an adequate environmental framework for environmental management. The
Pakistan Environmental ProtectionAct o f 1997 (PEPA) guides environmental management inthe
region. NWFP EPA has established three offices in the region with the aim o f complying with
PEPA provisions, including the agency's approval for the execution o f large public and private
projects. In addition, the Province has introduced the Sarhad Provincial Conservation Strategy
(SPCS), which aims to promote conservation and sustainable development. Unmatched elsewhere
inPakistan, three NWFPdistricts have incorporatedthe SPCS into their development agenda.

144.    The Bank is undertakingan institutions-basedStrategicEnvironmental Assessment
aimed at analyzingthe borrower's systemsto address the potentialenvironmental effects of
the program,with special emphasis on private sector development. The assessment has been
designed to identify and address existing institutional gaps that may hinder the government's
capacity to anticipate and respond to potential adverse environmental impacts. The assessment
will provide recommendations to strengthen the capacity to manage efficiently and effectively the
licensing system, as well as to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental norms and
conditions set as part o fthe licensingprocess.

RISKS AND R I S K MITIGATION

145.       The reform programand proposed operation face several key risks. Table 11below
provides a description of these risks, and mitigation measures. The Bank team assesses the overall
risks as moderate, and propose that the previous commitment and performance of the NWFP
government, as well as the strong potential benefits of the DPC series, justify the processing o f
the DPC 2 operation.

PublicInformationNotice (PIN)No. 06/139
December 7,2006

 Public Information Notices (PINS)form part o f the IMF's efforts to promote transparency o f
 the IMF's views and analysis o f economic developments and policies. With the consent o f the
 country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions o f Article
 IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
 level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments o f member countries with
 longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions o f
 general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
 The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IVConsultation with Pakistan i s also available.


1.        On November 22, 2006, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation withPakistan3'.

Background

2.        Pakistan's recent economic performance has been impressive. Growth has accelerated,
improvements in public spending and wide-ranging structural reforms have reduced the debt
burden and increased efficiency, and pro-poor policies have helped lower poverty rates. The
devastating earthquake o f October 2005 left a heavy toll in terms o f human lives and physical
and social infrastructure, but had relatively minor effects on macroeconomic indicators (except
for an increase in government spending) owing mainly to the small share o f the affected areas in
the overall economy.

3.        Economic developments duringthe fiscal year ending inJune 2006 were favorable, with
buoyant real GDP growth and inflation declining to 7.6 percent. The external current account
deficit, however, increased to US$5 billion (3.9 percent o f GDP), from US$1.5 billion (1.4
percent o f GDP) a year earlier. Record-high net capital flows (mainly from foreign direct
investment-including         privatization) more than covered the larger deficit and allowed for a build
up o f nearly US$1 billion in official international reserves. The interbank market exchange rate
was broadly unchanged from end-June 2005.

4.        The fiscal deficit exceeded the original budget target for 2005/06 owing to earthquake-
related spending. Excluding the latter, revenues and expenditures rose by roughly the same
amounts compared to the outturn inthe previous fiscal year. The government debt-to-GDP ratio
fell to 56 percent by the end o f June, below the 60 percent ceiling stipulated in the 2005 Fiscal
Responsibility Law. The budget for 2006/07 targets a deficit o f 4.2 percent o f GDP (excluding
grants), unchanged from the estimated outturn for 2005/06.


30 Under Article IV o f the IMF'sArticles o f Agreement, the IMFholds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusseswith officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staffprepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
o f the Board, summarizes the views o f Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.


                                                            1

5.         The growth o f broad money and bank credit to the private sector decelerated in 2005/06,
but private sector credit continued to expand at a relatively strong pace. Bank lending rates
became increasingly positive inreal terms as inflation declined; the real return on bank deposits
remained negative. The State Bank o f Pakistan's (SBP) claims on the government rose by more
than total government borrowing from the banking system, as the SBP absorbed treasury bills
that commercial banks did not roll over upon redemption. In July 2006, the SBP tightened
monetary conditions by raising reserve and liquidity requirements on bank deposits and the
discount rate.

6.         Foreign investors' interest in Pakistan increased significantly in 2005/06. Foreign direct
investment inflows, excluding privatization, rose by 70 percent, and foreign demand for
Palustani bonds was strong. Government divestiture from electricity and telecommunications
entities generated large foreign exchange inflows and revitalized the privatization process.

7.         Progress on structural reforms, other than privatization, was mixed. Reforms to broaden
the income tax base and streamline rates continued, and the legal framework for investor
protection was strengthened. However, implementation o f the schedule o f higher regional
electricity tariffs, a key step for continued reform of the power sector, remains pending, and
progress on trade liberalizationslowed.

Executive Board Assessment

8.         Executive Directors commended Pakistan's impressive macroeconomic performance
since 2001. They welcomed inparticular the acceleration in output growth, the steady decline in
debt ratios, and the fall inpoverty rates. Directors notedthat Pakistan's strong track record on the
macroeconomic and structural reform fronts had made the country increasingly attractive to
foreign investors, as shown by the record-high inflows o f foreign direct investment (FDI) during
2005/06 and the favorable terms obtained on recent sovereign bond placements in the
international capital markets.

9.         Directors noted that during 2005/06 the Pakistani economy had withstood well the
impact o f large negative shocks, including the tragic earthquake of October 2005, a sharp rise in
international oil prices, and unfavorable weather conditions. Although these shocks had limited
the scope for fiscal maneuver, growth had remained buoyant, inflation had declined slightly and
the import coverage o freserves hadremained stable.

10.        Directors nonetheless noted the risks to the outlook, including the continued strength o f
domestic demand, and its adverse effects on the trade and current account deficits as well as on
the pace o f disinflation during 2005/06. They noted also the authorities' view that
macroeconomic imbalances would decline without the need for further changes in the stance o f
policies envisaged for the current fiscal year, and welcomed the government's commitment to
tighten monetary policy, ifwarranted. However, most Directors felt that macroeconomic policies
during 2006/07 should be more effectively geared at reducing domestic demand and
strengthening the balance o f payments position. To this effect, many considered that a further
tightening o f monetary policy (including by allowing higher cutoffrates at treasury bill auctions)
should not be delayed to help strengthen the external position and allow the government to meet
i t s inflation target. Most Directors considered that to be effective, monetary policy should be
supported by exchange rate flexibility and a fiscal policy that keeps this year's budget deficit
(excluding grants and earthquake-related expenditures) at least at the level o f 2005/06.




                                                    2

11.      Directors stressed that, beyond 2006/07, Pakistan's macroeconomic policies should aim
at ensuring that the external current account deficit-to-GDP ratio remains on a declining path
with a steady build up o f reserves. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to adopt a
policy stance that maintains real interest rates at positive levels accompanied by a close
monitoring of credit growth, and a fiscal consolidation program that lowers the overall fiscal
deficit to a sustainable level over the medium term.

12.      Directors viewed the favorable prospects for sizable FDIinflows as important for future
gains in productivity and investment, but also as presenting challenges for macroeconomic
policy in the years ahead. They highlighted that continued reliance on FDI inflows o f uncertain
size and timing would require a large degree o f flexibility in economic policymaking. In this
connection, Directors stressed the need to improve the government's capacity to generate timely
policy responses to shortfalls o f external financing arising from negative balance o f payments
shocks. Directors were o f the view that those shocks should generally require monetary policy
and exchange rate responses, but also envisaged a role for fiscal tightening in cases where the
shocks are large, or more permanent innature. Directors cautioned that the option o f resortingto
the use o f international reserves to cover shortfalls o f external financing (especially those
stemming from delays inFDI-related flows) ought to be used sparingly.

13.      Directors viewed structural reforms conducive to higher saving and investment, an
improved business climate, and well-targeted poverty-related spending as critical for sustaining
growth and poverty reduction over the medium term. They encouraged the authorities to quickly
complete the reform o f the regulatory and tariff framework for the power sector, and step up
efforts to broaden the tax base and further curtail tax exemptions. Directors also saw scope for
improving the government's debt management strategy, including by increasing the issuance o f
long-term marketable securities and reducing its reliance on treasury bills and the National
Savings Schemes (NSS) to finance the fiscal deficit. Directors welcomed the initiatives
underway to modernize the NSS and reformthe system o f broker-financing o f stock trading, but
notedthat these should be followed quickly with measures that enable the integration o f the NSS
with local financial markets.

14.      Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to maintaining a liberal trade regime
and their determination to contribute to the success o f the Doha round o f trade talks. They called
on the authorities to resist pressures to reinstate ad-hoc tariff and nontariff measures and broaden
export subsidy schemes.

15.      Directors encouragedthe authorities to further improve the quality and timeliness o f data,
including by reporting fiscal data on an economic classification. They also urged the authorities
to expedite the process o f subscribing to the Special Data DisseminationStandard.

                         FIDUCIARY ASPECTSOF THE PROGRAM

FinancialManagementReforms

1.       The Pakistan CFAA (December 2003) concluded that there existed substantial
opportunities for consolidating current reforms throughout Pakistan and for introducingadditional
reforms to further strengthen public financial accountability. InJanuary 2004, a Provincial Public
Financial Accountability Assessment (PFAA) was concluded for NWFP with a view to
identifying the specific financial accountability issues in the province o f NWFP and designing
reform actions to be taken to reverse the weaknesses, exploit the opportunities and capitalize on
the strengths inherent inthe financial accountability environment inthe province. The assessment
captured and isolated the province-specific accountability shortcomings and helped to design a
reformagenda that has enabled the province to focus on implementing the required actions which
together are currently contributing to the enhancement o f the accountability regime at this sub-
national level o f government. The PFAA report has signaled the clear will and determination o f
the NWFP government to embrace reforms and this i s evidenced by the scale and variety o f
actions taken since then to improve the financial management regime inthe province.

2.       At the request of the NWFP, key development partners (WB, ADB, EC, DFID)jointly
carriedout a PEFA PFMPMF31Assessment as well as an OECD-DAC Procurement Performance
Measurement Assessment o f the Province, building up on the PFAA o f January 2004 and the
reforms already implemented so far. The draft report was prepared in December 2006 and a
stakeholders' workshop held in Peshawar in January 2007. The report highlighted a heightened
overall improvement in PFM in the province as denoted by the highrating scores achieved inthe
areas o f budget comprehensiveness, and in particular, budget classifications and orderliness and
participation in the annual budget process; predictability o f expenditure commitment flows;
effectiveness o f payroll controls; recording and management o f cash balances, debt, and
guarantees. While significant improvements remain to be accomplished towards achievingbetter
ratings in a number o f areas, the commitment o f the province to initiate a renewed strategy
provides a positive signal that the trajectory o freformimplementationi s on course.

3.       The key thrust o f the financial management reform program inNWFP rests on the pace
and comprehensiveness o f implementation o f the Bank-financed country-wide public financial
management project, PIFRA. Critical performance improvements demonstrative o f the level o f
reform commitment o f the Government o f NWFP include: (a) improving the reliability and
accuracy o f the financial information inthe province, and on a uniformbasis, through adoption o f
the new chart o f accounts for provincial and district governments' budgets and accounts and
achieving the highest levels o f reconciliation o f accounts amongst all other provinces; (b) being
the first province to achieve 100 per cent IT connectivity in FMIS implementation covering the
provincial and all district governments by December 2006, and thus creating the environment to
providing meaningful and more comprehensive fiscal and financial information on a timely basis;
(c) improving the reporting lag for provincial government civil accounts to 14 days from 15-21
days, and building on the strategy to improve timeliness to not more than 10 days after each
month-end; (d) maintaining the pro-activity o f the provincial and district external audit
infrastructure in completing the audit on a timely basis, although the finalization o f audit



 `PEFA PFM PMF: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Public Financial Management
PerformanceMeasurementFrameworkapprovedinJune 2005

certification remains a challenge to be addressed with the gradual introduction o f the new and
good practice audit methodology.

4.       A key dimension o f the required public financial management performance to allow for
the operation to proceed i s the agreed prior action o f ensuring the achievement o f operational IT
connectivity and productivity o f at least 20 District Finance and District Accounts Office sites
usingunifomchart o f accounts under the government's adoptednew, IMF GFS-compliant, chart
o f Accounts prescribed under the New Accounting Model. This prior action, as highlighted inthe
preceding paragraph has been fully satisfactorily met since all 24 District Accounts as well as
District Finance Offices have now been connected under an IFMIS basis for on-line budget
preparation, processing, execution, and financial reporting. The achievement o f this critical prior
action further buttressedthe reform consciousness and commitment o f the government o f NWFP
as being the first amongst provincial governments in Pakistan that can claim the full state o f
readiness to produce reliable, timely, accurate, comprehensive and meaningful financial and fiscal
information, on real time basis, for informed decision making. At the same time, the province has
become the first, amongst all four provinces, to assure the timely preparation o f reliable financial
statements, consistent with good international practice (International Public Sector Accounting
Standards), and submit these for timely external audit using the new audit methodologies
prescribedunder the Financial Audit Manual.

5.        Going forward, other key triggers, reform milestones and benchmarks include the
entrenchment o f transparency and disclosure requirements pertaining to budget execution status
o f all provincial and district governments by ensuring that the financial and fiscal status reports,
indetailed formats, are postedto the website andmade readily available; internal audit functions
are well established and are functioning and addressing systemic issues in the overall
management and control o f public resources; and the annual draft accounts are indeed produced
on timely basis (within three months o f the end o f the fiscal year) and equally audited on timely
basis usinginternational standards o f auditing.

6.       Notwithstanding the identified areas requiring further reform, NWFP is acknowledged
as the most advancedprovinceinPakistan interms of financial management reforms. The
financial accountability environment inthe province, as concluded by the Provincial PFAA (April
2005), provides adequate safeguards for reliance on government financial management systems.
This is reinforcedby the progress o f actions implementedsince the IMF Safeguards Assessment
(2001) o f the State Bank o f Pakistan, and also by the conclusions o f the recently held
government/joint-donor partners' workshop on the PEFA diagnostics and OECD-DAC Baseline
Procurement Assessment carried out for the province and planned for finalization during FY
2007.

7.       Foreign Exchange Control Environment: (An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the State
Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) was conducted in 2001.           It highlighted vulnerabilities at the SBP
particularly as relating to its financial statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f
acceptable Central Bank standards. However, since a program o f r e f o m was agreed with the IMF
and i s being implemented, the risks associated with foreign exchange management control have
been mitigated. The State Bank o f Pakistan has transitioned to producing financial statements
which accord with international accounting standards and formats. An independent review o f the
SBP's internal audit function, as recommended by the Safeguards Assessment, has since been
completed and recommendations implemented. The SBP has also established a formal process o f
reconciling data reported to the Fund as well as implemented guidelines to prohibit operations
that pledge or encumber reserves, or place restrictions on, or otherwise impair the availability o f
foreign exchange reserves outside an authorized framework, equally, the SBP's Act has been


                                                  2

accordingly amended to strengthen and guarantee its independence and autonomy in the
management o freserves as requiredunder the Safeguards Assessment.

ProcurementReforms

8.       Pakistan's North West Frontier Province is the leading province in terms o f economic
and fiscal reform, including governance reform which encompasses improvements to the public
procurement legislative and regulatory framework. Its SAC-supported Provincial Reform
Program (PRP) contained a series o f actions aimed at implementing procurement reforms in
phases.

9.       Marking the end o f the first phase, NWFP passed the Procurement Ordinance in 2002 as
the first government (federal and provincial) in the country. Rules for procurement o f consulting
services were notified in November 2002, and rules for procurement o f goods, works and (non-
consultancy) services were notified in December 2003.           The Ordinance was adopted by the
parliament as the Procurement Law for goods, works and services in 2003, as the main
achievement in phase 2. Through a notification by the department o f Planning, the Standard
Bidding Documents o f Pakistan Engineering Council were recommended for use. However,
while being a major step forwards, the Law and the rules do not completely adhere to the
international best practice inprocurement.

10.      The rules were designed and adopted by the officials o f the Finance Department, without
significant external assistance. Inevitably, therefore, these rules contain all the aspects o f the
existingprocurement procedures without bringinginany changes to align the procedures with the
modem public procurement practices.

11.      InFebruary 2006 NWFPprepared a roadmap to revise the procurement rules andreview
the procurement law to eliminate all aspects limiting transparency and equal opportunity and
align these documents with international best practice. Upon request o f the NWFP, the Bank
arranged for a grant to facilitate to bringabout these amendments. The grant for Strengthening o f
Procurement Regulatory Framework was signed on August 10, 2006 and over the next three
years, it aims at the following achievements:

         aligning the procurement rules closer to international best practice, and suggesting
         amendments inthe law;
         replacing the system o f Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR) by Current Market Rates
         (CMR);
         review the various codes, departmental rules and regulations to synchronize their
         application in context o f the stipulations o f the (amended) procurement rules. This also
         includes introduction o f various standard bidding documents and identifying means to
         adopt the standardPakistan EngineeringCouncil (PEC) biddingand contract documents;
         introduce sustainable procurement training for government officials;
         implement an effective mechanism to redress complaints withrespect to procurement;
         identify a home for procurement reforms for further research, database management and
         revisions; and
         implement awareness o f and training for the reformed system.

         The Finance Department i s the executing agency for this grant, and having this assistance
to carry out procurement reform, further work i s needed to actually make the Law effective and
ensure its implementation. As phase 3 o f the procurement reform, the government committed to

first define the areas which require improvements in the rules, the standard bidding documents
and probably inthe law and introduce a system o f market rates for preparing contract budgets, as
a near term action. In the mid term the identified amendments shall be brought about, and
implementationshall be focused on.

13.      As a next step the NWFP will implement Phase 4 o f Procurement Action Plan to bring
procurement practices to international standard. This includes notifying amendments in the
procurement law eliminating discriminatory stipulations and aligning it to the best international
practice, implementing revised rules, adopting amended Standard BiddingDocuments for goods,
works and services, and ensuring their implementation. These reforms shall be supported by
comprehensive procurement training at various levels and setting up o f a provincial procurement
institutional arrangement to act as a focal point.

Conclusionson the FiduciaryEnvironment

14.      With the implementation o f the reform measures in the financial management and
procurement areas already on course in the province, and arising from the mitigated risks
associated with the manner in which the SBP manages the country's foreign exchange reerves as
highlighted in the IMF Safeguards Assessment, the overall fiduciary risk o f the program i s rated
`modest  '.

DISBURSEMENTSAND FIDUCIARYASSURANCE

15.      On-Lending Terms: The Islamic Republic o f Pakistan, represented by the Federal
Ministry of Finance would be the Borrower. The Loan would be on-lent by the Federal
Government to the Government o f NWFP on terms and conditions as shall be agreed between the
two governments.

16.      Funds flow arrangements: The Government o f Pakistan shall identify a Foreign
Exchange Account with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) and which forms part o f the country's
official foreign exchange reserves, into which the proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a
single tranche basis upon Credit effectiveness.     The Rupees equivalent o f the funds in the
Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated Fund o f the
Government o f NWFP (Account No. 1 - Non-Food) held with the SBP which i s used to finance
budget expenditures.

17.      Disbursements from the Consolidated Account No.1 (Non-food) by the Government o f
NWFP shall not be tied to any specific purchases and no special procurement requirement shall
be needed. The proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in
the negative list as defined in the Schedule o f the Financing Agreement. If any portion o f the
Credit i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the Schedule o f the Financing
Agreement, IDA shall require the Government to promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount o f the said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such
request shall be cancelled from the Credit.

18.      Assurance Requirements: Within 45 days o f disbursement o f the Credit by IDA, the
Finance Secretary o f NWFP shall provide a written confirmation to IDA certifying the receipt o f
the Rupees equivalent o f the Credit into the Consolidated Fund Account o f the Government o f
NWFP, the number o f the account, the date o f the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to
translate the Credit currency into Rupees.

                                 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

1.       The country's policies in education, health, social protection, fiscal stability and
public expenditure management, and governance, supported by the proposed loan do not
entail significant negative effects on Pakistan's environment, forests, or other natural
resources.The policieswill notresultinany significant commitment o f suchresources. Although
some minor negative effects are possible, the net balance o f all effects i s likely to be either
positive or benign. For example, increased primary health care service delivery can impact the
environment through three channels: (i)  scale effects, (ii)
                                                           composition effects, and (iii)
                                                                                        changes in
techniqueshechnology. Scale effects, meaning overall increases o f infrastructure associated with
health care and wastes generated in the provision o f primary health care services, should not be
significant. Composition effects refer to the growth or decline o f more versus less-polluting
health centers. These effects are not likely to significantly affect the environment since the loan
supports mainly relatively non-polluting health centers. Finally, changes in techniques refer to
more efficient (and hence less polluting) technologies or processes that are introduced through
improved primary health care services. While these changes are impossible to quantify, the
adoption o f such technologies i s expectedto have positive environmental effects.

2.       The Bank's Strategic CountryEnvironmentalAssessment (SCEA) providesa broad
overview of Pakistan's environmentalpoliciesandinstitutions. The SCEA concludes that the
legislative framework for environmental management i s largely in place and the country has
made progress in establishing regulatory institutions for environmental management. However,
implementation o f policies has evidenced substantial variations across the country, mainly due to
the binding constraints o f insufficient resources and inadequate compliance incentives.
Recognizing these problems, the Medium Term Development Framework 2005-2010, which was
adopted in mid-2005, recommends a significant increase in the budget allocated for
environmental management to support implementation o fthe legislative framework.

3.       Simultaneously, Pakistanhas adopted environmentalsafeguards aimed at offsetting
and minimizing potential environmental risks associated with the North West Frontier
Province Development Policy Credit. The Pakistan legal framework contains provisions to
strengthen enforcement o f environmental regulations.       Additionally, there is a high level o f
environmental awareness in the Province, evidenced by the government's decision to respond to
environmental pressures by introducing the Sarhad Provincial Conservation Strategy (SPCS),
which aims to promote conservation and sustainable development. Unmatched elsewhere in
Pakistan, three districts in NWFP have integrated the SPCS into their development agenda.
Furthermore, environmental management within the province i s guided by the Pakistan
Environmental Protection Act 1997, which requires EPA approval for the execution o f large
public and private projects.     NWFP EPA has three zonal offices in the province and has
established an Environment Impact Assessment (EM) training center inPeshawar.

4.       Although the Bank-supported policies aimed at accelerating human development,
improving fiscal stability and public expenditure management, and strengthening
governance, are expected to have only minor negative environmental effects, Pakistan
recognizes the importance of proper environmental policies and proactive government
monitoring within an adequate environmental regulatory framework. To address such
concerns, Pakistan has adopted a National Environmental Policy (NEP), aimed at promoting
sustainable development. As part o f Pakistan's NEP, the government i s interested in


                                                 1

strengthening its country environmental systems, particularly for effectively identifying and
addressing environmental problems and priorities and taking into account the concerns o f
multiple stakeholders (including the most vulnerable groups). Pakistan's NEP also embodies
processes to monitor and evaluate progress to overcome the identified environmental priority
problems.

5.      The DPL's focus on assistingthe NWFPgovernmentto broadenand deepenhuman
development reforms while providing continued support to strengthen governance is
expected to have positiveenvironmentaleffects. Improvementsinhuman capital are aimed at
reducing poverty, and are consequently anticipated to reduce the current over-dependence on
"depletable" natural resources (e.g., biomass for fuelwood). Fiscal reforms are consistent with the
Medium Term Development Framework 2005-2010, as they include recommendations to
increase resources allocated to environmental agencies. Finally, to the extent that governance
reforms encompass the environmental agencies, the DPL i s expected to enhance the authority's
capacity to enforce environmental regulations.

6.      Reforms aimed at accelerating economic                growth through private sector
development might induce potentialpositive and negative environmental effects. While it i s
impossible to quantify these impacts, these reforms might eventually yield net environmental
benefits. Private sector activity i s to be stimulated by lowering administrative barriers and the
transactions costs o f investment. Given the structure o f the Province's industry, it i s anticipated
that the bulk o f industrial development will entail broad based growth o f light industries, with a
modest environmental footprint and low pollution intensity.

7.      The Bank is undertaking a sectoral environmental analysis aimed at assessing the
borrower's systems for reducing potential negative environmental effects linked with
private sector development, particularly in the mining and infrastructure sectors. As a
follow-up to the SCEA, the Bank has initiated an institutions-based strategic environmental
assessment o f the policy reforms associated with the North West Frontier Province Development
Policy Credit. The assessment has been designed to identify and address existing institutional
gaps that may hinder the government's capacity to anticipate and respond to potential adverse
environmental impacts. The assessment will provide recommendations to strengthen the capacity
to manage efficiently and effectively the licensing system, as well as to monitor and enforce
compliance with environmental norms and conditions set as part the licensing process. Such
recommendations will include specific proposals to consolidate the authority's capacity to assess
the potential adverse impacts o f resource-intensive businesses dealing with use o f natural
resources and involved in generation o f pollution and wastes. The timely completion o f the
assessment will ensure the incorporation o f environmental considerations in the design and
implementationo f Bank-supported policies.

                                   DEBT SUSTAINABILITY NOTE

This note analyzes the evolution over the next 15 years o f debt stock and debt service indicators
for a baseline (reform scenario with agreed medium-term fiscal framework). It also analyzes the
sensitivity o f the debt stock and debt service indicators to a range o f exogenous shocks and in
several policy slippage scenarios.

The note concludes that if NWFP continues recent years' fiscal reforms, it will ensure a robust
and sustainable fiscal and debt outlook over the medium and long term. The province has
undertaken considerable fiscal adjustment over the last 5 years and invested substantially in debt
restructuring, including by substitutingexpensive domestic loans with low-cost budget support
from the Bank. These efforts have now enabled the province to move onto a fully sustainable debt
path with an increasingly lighter debt service burden (for instance, interest payments measured in
terms o f % o f revenue and grants). The debt stock and debt service burden remain sustainable in
the face o f substantial shocks. However, the fact that persevering, substantial fiscal slippage (as
seen in several alternative scenarios) could bring the province back on an unsustainable path
underlines the importance o f the government staying close to its medium-term fiscal framework.

The current debt situation

The province i s currently not ina debt-stressed situation (table 1). The interest burden interms o f
% o f revenue and grants has decreased substantially over the last 5 years and i s now - at 10% -
well below commonly accepted thresholds for debt ~ustainability~'.

The vast majority o f interest payments, almost 93%, i s on domestic debt and only 7% on foreign
debt. The low share o f the latter reflects inparticular very low average nominal interest rates on
foreign debt (all concessional foreign aid); over the last 8 years it has been about 1percent inU S
dollar terms (and hence the real interest rate on foreign debt has been between -1% and -2% in
US$ terms).

Institutional context: Provinces in Pakistan are not authorized to borrow from the market
without specific approval from the federal government; hence any deficit financing (beyond
drawing down cash reserves or using temporary overdraft facility with the State Bank o f
Pakistan) will need the federal Ministry o f Finance's approval. The approval to borrow has in
most cases been given to borrow from the federal government (at relatively highinterest rates) or
from foreign donors.

Analytical framework for debt and debt service projections: the analysis builds on the
standard debt sustainability template for subnational governments but with some additional
features:
Inthe case o fthe NWFP, the debt service schedule for each individual, existing government loan
i spredetermined, including with fixed interest rates, for the rest o f the lifetime o f a loan (up to 20
years ahead). This data i s incorporated in the projections. Hence the only element o f projection
uncertainty for the debt service on existing loans i s with regardto the nominal exchange rate risk.

The analytical framework on the debt dynamics in the standard debt sustainability template
assumes in any given future year the same real interest rate for both old (existing loans as o f
FY07) and new loans. This i s improved in the modified framework used for this debt
sustainability assessment which splits debt stocks and their debt service in four categories:
existing portfolio o f domestic loans, existing portfolio o f foreign loans, new foreign loans (at
lower real interest rates than new domestic loans), and new domestic loans (residual since they
have the highest cost o f financing). The debt service sensitivity to future changes in interest rates
can therefore be pointed out more accurately since the debt dynamics module captures exactly
that as opposed to an average interest rate covering also old loans with fixed interest rates.

The analysis

The debt sustainability assessment i s based on analysis o f a set o f scenarios covering the period
FY07 - FY23 (2006/07       - 2022123) and sensitivity testing o f the baseline (reform) scenario for
exogenous shocks.

The following scenarios are analyzed:

     1.     Baseline scenario with continued reforms and DPC financing over the medium term
     2.     Baseline scenario with continued reforms but only DPC financing inFY07 (DPC2)
     3.     Combined fiscal and other economic policy risks - over a 10-year period
     4.     Combined fiscal policy risks over 10 years but partially offset by cutting capital
            expenditures
     5.     Higher fiscal deficits and no new DPCsbeyond DPC2.

Key assumptions underlying the scenarios are presented inBox 1.

         1.        Baselinescenario with continued reforms and DPC financingover the mediumterm
    The real interest rate on foreign debt used for projections is equal to the average real interest rates over the
    last 9 years (inUS$ terms), and similarly for the real interest on domestic debt. RIR on foreign debt: -1% (in
    US$ terms; debt service projections and debt stock figures are also adjusted for an annual depreciation o f
    the nominal Pak RsiUS$ exchange rate o f 2 -2 % percent to maintainpurchasing power parity). RIR on
    domestic debt: 5.9 % per annum. DPCs from the Bank (on IDA terms) are assumed for FY08-FY10, after
    whichbudget support drops by half. Provincial real GDP growth i s projected to average 6.7 % over the
    coming 5 years which lags the country's growth rate slightly (usingthe official macroeconomic projections
    o f GoP for this period). Inflation i s the same as reflected inthe official medium-termmacroeconomic
    projections o f GoP. The primary deficit that averages 0.3 percent of PGDP inFY06-FY07, is projected at
    0.28 % o f GDP inFY08,0.1% inFY09 and 0.06% inFYlO (as inthe government's medium-termbudget
    framework for FY08-FYlo). Itremains at 0.06% eachyear thereafter.

         2.        Baselinescenario without DPC financing over the mediumterm. Relative to the baseline
                   scenario the only change inassumptions is no M e r DPCs beyond DPC2; hence a much
                   higher share o f deficit financing comes from domestic loans at a higher cost.

Results from the baseline scenario

Inthe baseline scenario the combination of continued fiscal prudence and the ongoing (positive)
debt dynamics leads to a steady improvement inkey debt indicators (Charts l a and lb). The debt
service burden - measured as interest payments in % o f revenues and grants33- declines from 7
percent in FY07 to about 4 % percent by FY17 and remains at that level over the rest o f the
projection period. The debt stock / PGDP ratio declines from 12percent inFY07 to 10percent by
FY17 andto 9 percent byFY23.The steady reductioninthe debt service burdenleaves sufficient
fiscal space for expanding PRSP spending, including increasing development spending.

The fact that the ongoing debt dynamics are positive or in other words at this phase contribute to
a virtuous cycle, reflects that the average real interest rates are lower than the expected real GDP
growth. This again i s a result o f the government having overcome the previous heavy burden o f a
debt overhang (from the 1990s) by repaying over the last 4 years large parts o f its most expensive
domestic debt, partially by substitutingfor concessional IDA funds.

The projections o f the debt service can be made with a high degree o f certainty since the current
debt stock have predetermined debt service schedules (with fixed interest rates). Hence only the



33 This note uses this variable as the central indicator for assessing debt sustainability since it (implicitly)
measures how mucho f fiscal resources are available for other spending items after nondiscretionary
interest payments. The debt/PGDP ratio does not give as strong predictive power about the fiscal burden o f
the debt as the interest paymentshevenues and grants ratio when the debt stock consists o f debt instruments
with highly different debt servicing terms. The latter is the case o fNWFP.

debt service on new loans and the foreign exchange component o f existing loans are subject to
projection uncertainty.

Impactof IDA budgetsupport- comparingbaselinescenariowith andwithout the DPCs

The impact on the evolution inkey debt indicators is seen directly inCharts l a and lb. Inchart l a
the gap between the two graphs shows the savings in interest payments as share o f revenue and
grants as a result o f getting low cost IDA budget support. Over the medium-to long term the
annual savings are about 1 ?4percent o f revenue and grants. Inchart lb the cumulative effect o f
these savings i s shown as the gap between the two graphs, both showing declining debt stock in
terms o f GDP but in the scenario without new DPCs stabilizing at 1% % o f GDP higher than in
the baseline with new DPCs.

        Sensitivity analysis - shocks

The sensitivity o f the baseline scenario - the government's medium-tern reform scenario - i s
analyzed with regard to the following shocks:
1. Interestrate r i s k 2 standard deviations increase inthe real interestrate for bothnew domestic
        loans and new foreign loans (in US$ terms) compared to the baseline (increase by 2.9
        percentage points and 1.9 percentage points, respectively).
2. Exchangerate risk:30 percent nominal depreciationinthe Pak RupeeAJS$ rate inFY08, then
        same annual depreciation as inbaseline.
3. Negative real GDP shock: 1 standard deviation (2.8 percentage points) decrease inthe rate of
        growth inreal GDP compared to the baseline, starting inFY08 for 3 years.
4. Increasing the civil service wage bill by 12% interms o f share o f PGDP inFY08. Wage bill
        increases by 0.5% of GDP and remains at the new level.
5. Contingent liability r i s k the FY08 budget i s hit by the realization o f contingent liabilities,
        necessitating fiscal payments equivalent to 5% o f PGDP.

These are all substantial shocks (in several cases with confidence intervals of 95 %' for a normal
probability distribution). As seen in charts 2a and 2b the baseline scenario i s robust to all five
shocks. Inno case i s the sustainability of the debt service burden threatenedby the shock and the
interest burden remains below 8 percent over the long term, only marginally up from the FY07
level of 7%. Only in the case of contingent liabilities hitting the budget to the value of 5 % of

GDP does the interest burden spike initially to 10% before it gradually declines and converges
back to its long-term level o f 7 $4 percent after 10 years. Interestingly, the 30% nominal
depreciation o f the Pakistani rupee versus the U S dollar does not affect the debt service burden
much neither since interest payments on foreign debt only constitutes 7 percent o f total interest
payments (table 1). However, and importantly, the widening gap between the baseline scenario
trajectory for interest payments in % o f revenues and the trajectories for the shocks does mean
that substantial revenue resources would be pre-empted for debt service and could not be used for
high-priority areas such as PRSP spending.

Having established that the baseline scenario i s robust to a wide range o f shocks and preserves
debt sustainability, what would the impact on debt sustainability be o f scenarios o f fiscal
slippage?

        Impact of fiscalpolicy slippage

Chart 3 demonstrates the fiscal constraints within which the provincial government would needto
maneuver in order to maintain fiscal sustainability. Scenario 5 (primary deficit 1.5 percentage
points o f GDP (2 standard deviations) higher than in the baseline over the whole (16-year)
projection period and no new DPCs) i s the most severe case o f deep and prolonged fiscal
slippage. In this scenario both the debt service burden and the debt stock in % o f PGDP keep
growing throughout the projection period and do not stabilize, reaching high and unsustainable
levels over the longer term. Such a scenario i s highly unlikely for two reasons: first, it would
imply that the federal government would accommodate such large deficits and finance them, in
other words also have a quite expansionary fiscal stance - throughout 16 years. Second, it
assumes that no fiscal adjustment will take place year after year ina continuing worsening fiscal
outlook.

Also scenario 3 - a long-term worsening o f the primary balance compared to baseline o f 2 % o f
GDP for 10years - shows steadily increasing debt service burden and debt stock ratios but these
indicators stabilize at higher levels. Interest payments stabilize at about 17 percent o f revenues
and grants, up from 7 percent inFY07.This would imply an unsustainable squeeze on other, high
priority areas o f public spending, including human development spending. Again, this scenario
would be unlikely for the reasons described for scenario 5 (above).

Scenario 4 assumes some fiscal adjustment to curb the rising fiscal deficits - in the form o f
cutting public investment spending by 1 % o f GDP annually until FY17compared to scenario 3.
These investment cuts result in lower PGDP growth in addition to effects such as limiting the
supply of new facilities for public services. This scenario enables the province to stabilize its
interest burden in terms o f revenue and grants at about 11 percent - albeit much above the
baseline scenario it i s markedly lower than the two severe fiscal slippage scenarios and within
reasonable limits consistent with fiscal sustainability. While this scenario shows a muddling
through and technically preserves debt sustainability, it i s not sustainable from the point o f view
o f economic growth andpublic service provision.

In sum, the conclusion from the scenarios analyzed here is that the government's objectives o f
achieving higher rates of shared economic growth while also ensuring adequate PRSP spending
and improving access to public services, in particular basic social services, can best be met by
staying close to the agreed medium-term fiscal framework and along similar fiscal parameters for
the longer term.
