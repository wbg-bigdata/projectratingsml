MEMORANDUM AND REOOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$340 MILLION
TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION SECTOR PROJECT
1. I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Argentina for the equivalent of US$340 million to
help finance a road maintenance and rehabilitation sector project. The loan would
be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15 years,
including a grace period of 5 years.
2.   Background.  The Argentine Government has made the Reform of the State its
priority to foster the necessary increases in public sector effi7iency. An overall
reduction in public sector size and expenditure is beina achieved through
privatization, deregulation, and decentralization. In the Transport Sector, major
results have been obtained in: (a) privatizing the largest national airline; (b)
concessioning five major freight rail branches of a total length of 20,700 km, or
around 60% of the rail network; (c) concessioning all rail commuter services in
Buenos Aires, including the subway; (d) concessioning an interurban passenger
service of about 400 km; (e) involving the private sector, through concessions
financed by toll collection, in managing the maintenance and rehabilitation of about
25% of the national road network (Map 24715); and (f) transferring to local
governments a number of ports previously manag-d by a federal agency. These efforts
have been successful in railways (supporting a tranche release of US$75 million
equivalent of Loan 3291-AR, Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loan) and in roads
and ports.  Moreover, efforts continue to:  (a) privatize all possible railway
activities and rationalize or close the rest; (b) privatize the national maritime
company; (c) reform the highway subsector (described below); and (d) decentralize
the port subsector.
3. Road transport represents the dominant mode of internal transport (69% of
interurban freight, 83% of interurban passengers, 100% of urban freight, and 88% of
urban passengers). The basic national road network is in place, but its condition
generally is unsatisfactory with rapid deterioration widespread (currently, almost
two-thirds of the network is in poor to bad condition). Road maintenance has the
highest priority to arrest further system deterioration and stem economic losses for
the country. In April/July 1992, major flooding occurred in the northeastern part
of the country, further affecting the condition of provincial and national roads in
that area. Institutionally, there is widespread agreement that existing duplication
of responsibilities for similar highway activities between National and Provincial
agencies, which manage separate networks, is highly inefficient, and leads to
inadequate planning, sub-optimal use of resources and installed capacity, inferior
prod*action, and lack of coordination. The Bank's transport sector work (10/88,
ARGENTINA: Transport Sector Public Enterprises) identified this problem and made
recommendations to address this issue. The Government has incorporated most of the
recommendations in its current sector policies as reflected in Decree 616/92, issued
on 04/10/92.   This decree establishes that the role of the National Highway
Directorate (DNV) is now one of technical leadership, national road planning,
allocation and auditing of financial resources provided to the Provincial Highway
Directorates (DPVs), technical and finar.cial supervision of the concessions, road
research, environmental analysis, standardization of road maintenance and
construction, and training and transfer of technology to DPVs. The jurisdiction of
the national network remains with DNV, but the execution of road works and/or
related activities will be delegated to the DPVs.   Since in both levels of
government the road agencies perform and manage similar functions, the potential
increase in cost-effectiveness through delegation of work and responsibility is
high. Another important institutional deficiency in the highway subsector is the
lack of systematic preparation and analysis of the environmental impact of road
works that good help define possible mitigation remedies. Finally, the current
intense application of toll charges raises the question of the suitability of the
road-user charge system.



4. Rationale fgor Bank Involvlment. The proposed project is consistent with the
Bank's overall strategy in Argentina of promoting efficiency in the public sector
and reducing the fiscal deficit, which was reviewed by the Board during the FY93
Country Assistance Strategy presentation, in association with the approval of the
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (Loan No. 3558-AR, Report P-5862-AR) of
February 16, 1993. It would also enable the Bank to strengthen the Government's
commitment to: (a) the maintenance of road infrastructure, which has been neglected
in recent years as a result of the country's economic crisisl and (b) the major
institutional reforms in the road sector, which the Government has now launched.
The Dank's presence in the sector would bring a beneficial catalytic effect in
precipitating policy decisions and institutional improvements, which without Bank
participation may be harder to achieve. In particular, the proposed project links
well with the Provincial Development Project (PDP) (Loan 3280-AR) through the
strengthening of DPV planning and management capabilities through an intensive
Technical Assistance and Training Program. This program will be managed by DNV, as
the lead agency in the sector. It would complement PDP because it finances works
on national roads that are nei.:her included in the provincial networks nor eligible
for PDP financing. It would also complement the Flood Rehabilitation Project (Loan
3521-AR) by providing funds to repair damage to national roads and bridge.
attributable to the heavy flooding of April/July 1992. (The above-mentioned Loan
3521-AR provides financing for damages due to the same event, but only for repairs
to provincial infrastructure.). Moreover, the proposed project would help support
and monitor the complex transition program required to implement the agreed major
reforms in the road sector.
S. Protect gbiectives. The proposed project would: (a) support Government efforts
to downsize the central Government and decentralize implementation of public sector
investments; (b) ensure adequate maintenance and/or rehabilitation of the present
National Road network for those sections that have not been concessioned; (c)
strengthen DNV capacity to supervise road maintenance executed by the
concessionaires; (d) support the progressive implementation of the institutional
reform (para. 3) through (i) physical reconditioning of the road sections for which
maintenance and operational responsibility may be delegated to the provinces (thus
reducing the initial workload of the provinces), (ii) strengthening provincial
capability to manage road activities through a broad Technical Assistance program
and transfer of technology among highway agencies, and (iii) developing an
appropriate road planning and financing mechanism; (e) assist in achieving the
optimal combination of provincialization, privatization, and nationally supported
operations of those road sections of national interest; (f) support the creation in
DNV of an environmental unit with trained staff to prepare systematically and
monitor EA when the works warrant, and to provide guidance to the DPVs; and (g)
support transport studies of national interest.
6.   Proiect Description.  The proposed project, within a sectoral context, would
include a four-year time-slice (mid-1993 to mid-1997) of DNV's routine and periodic
maintenance program, as well as road reconstruction needs (91% of the program cost)
(regional Maps 24716 through 24720). It also includes emergency works to repair
damage to national roads caused by the recent floods in early 1992 (3.5% of project
cost) (Map 24715). The proposed project would also include a technical assistance
and training sub-component aimed at: (a) strengthening the capacity of the Sub-
Secretariat of Public Works (SOP) in establishing policy and goals in the road
sector; (b) strengthening DNV, and particularly its five regional offices (Map
24715), for the new roles they have to play; (c) improving the capability of DPVs
to plan, to manage and execute roadwork properly; (d) reviewing the current road-
user charge system; and (e) reinforcing DNV's capabilities to carry out national
programs for traffic safety, control of vehicle weights and dimensions, and other
broad-gauged activities that are too comprehensive for provincial oversight. The
proposed project would develop maintenance management and planning to permit
quantification of the costs of alternative technology procedures or funding
decisions. It will also allow the executing agencies to select the best-suited
maintenance strategy for Argentina's local conditions given funding constraints.
It would expand the use of the Bank-developed HDM-III/IBM models to DNV and its



-3-
regions as well as to all provinces, which would greatly increase the capability to
program the optimum use of scarce resources. The project would also support the
preparation of an Environmental Assessment Mar.ual to be systematically used in DNV
and disseminated to DPVs. The proposed project would, in addition, provide for
acquisition of office, communication, and specialized equipment for traffic
counting, vehicle weight control and rating road and bridge conditions, to enable
DNV to implement the results of the technical assistance programs. The project will
finance the consultant services required for the technical assistance component and
for the engineering of the proposed project. A set of Project Performance Targets
and/or Actions were developed and agreed at appraisal to facilitate project
monitoring during supervision.
7.   The total project cost is estimated at US$756.0 million equivalent (including
taxes) with a foreign exchange cost of US$286.5 million. The proposed Bank loan of
US$340.0 million, which is equivalent to the fc.eign exchange component plus US$53.5
million of local cost, represents 52.9% of the project cost (net of taxes) and 45%
of the total project cost. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A.   Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.   A timetable of key project
processing evente and the status of Bank Group operations in Argentina are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11413-AR, dated
May 10, 1993, is attached.
8.   A maximum amount of US$10.0 million (3% of the total loan) would be used for
retroactive financing of expenditures made after August 31, 1992 (approximately one
year before expected loan signature) for the emergency and urgently needed
maintenance works, as well as for consultant services for technical assistance
components. Procurement of contracts eligible for retroactive financing will be
carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines.
9.   Project ImDlementation. The executing agency will be DNV, which has recently
experienced a major streamlining as a consequence of the new role it has to play in
the highway sector (para. 3). To strengthen DNV and to raise staff morale, several
decisions have recently been taken by the Government (substantial salary increases,
clear definition of DNV's role, appointment of a capable general manager,
significant increases in DNV budgetary allocations, confirmation of the support to
the proposed project, and advertisement of a large number of road works), which are
helping to improve the situation. At appraisal, an in-depth analysis was carried
out concerning the capacity of DNV to execute the proposed project. The conclusion
was that DNV can carry out the project with suitable support from consultants and
the DPVs. This support is provided under the project. The day-to-day coordination
and monitoring of the project will be done by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that
has been created for this purpose.   The PCU will be composed of about 10
professionals (4 have already been appointed). The operation of the PCU will be
financed under the technical assistance component of the proposed project. Project
selection, within the sectoral context of the proposed project, will be based on
economic and environmental eligibility criteria agreed with the Government.
10. Proiect Sustainabilitv. The lengthy and in-depth preparation of the proposed
project, the commitment of the country to implement institutional reforms, the
recognition of the critical importance of road maintenance in the national economy,
and the carefully structured technical assistance and training programs, supports
the sustainability of the project.
11. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. The results of transport
projects in Argentina have been mixed. There have been some important achievements,
mainly in the highway sector, but with limited success with regard to broader policy
issues, such as pricing and intermodal planning, especially in railway projects.
However, major improvements have recently been achieved within the framework of the
ongoing reform of the state program. In most cases the projects have experienced
delays, and, in some instances cost overruns and lack of local counterpart funds
(particularly during periods of high inflation) have been a common occurrance in



4
several of the projects. These matters have been carefully taken into consideration
and addressed during the extensive preparation of the proposed project.
12. Acreed Actions. At appraisal, agreements were reached with the Government,
which were confirmed at negotiations, on the following: (a) a Government transport
policy  letter;  (b) action plans for two provinces to permit monitoring of
implementation of the launched reform program in the highway sector; (c) an outline
of the Environmental Assessment (EA) Manual for road works and its completion as
condition of Loan effectiveness; (d) a system to ensure enough funds will be
allocated In the future for road maintenance; (e) conducting a Road User Charges
Actualization Study and implementing follow-up actions recommended; (f) that the
Government will provide the required local counterpart funds during project
execution on schedule; (g) tnat the Bank will have an opportunity for comments
before approving DNV's annual road investment program; (h) execution of a study to
review the current classification of highways as provincial and national, and the
vitart of the implementation of 3ts recommendations by July 31, 1995; and (i) a set
of Project Performance Targets.
13. Environmental AsPects. The nature of the proposed civil works project-- mostly
rehabilitation and maintenance of roads on existing alignments and in already
developed corridors-- is such that environmental impact is not a major issue. As
part of the Technical Assistance Program, a manual is under preparation, and its
completion is a condition of Loan effectiveness (para. 12). The manual will provide
guidance to highway engineers on incorporating environmental considerations in the
plinning of roads and execution of road works.
14.  Project Benefits.   Avoidance of major road reconstruction costs and cost
savings to road users will be the major quantifiable benefits; however, equally
important, significant benefits also derive from the institutional reform program,
although they are not easy to quantify. In particular, significant benefits are
expected from the long-term effects of better EA of road works. The former, as is
normally the case with maintenance works, would amply justify the proposed project.
Average economic returns are as follows: for asphaltic paved roads the average ERR
is about 30%; for unpaved roads the average B/C ratio, at an opportunity cost of
capital of 12%, is 2.5; and for the repair of cement concrete roads the average ERR
resulted in a high 46%. For mathematical reasons, in the economic evaluation of
some works on unpaved roads, the ERR gave either multiple or no solution, and thus
B/C was used as the economic index.
15. Risks. All project components involve proven technology. There is enough
experience in the country with this kind of work, ard therefore t zhnical risks of
the proposed project are minimal. The most important risks relate to the capacity
of DNV to execute works and contracts, the sustainability of the institutional
changes and the availability of counterpart funds, which are, however, mitigated by
the project design and planned supervision. Another risk that exists involves the
National and Provincial Governments' willingness to change their institutional
interrelationships in the subsector and to dedicate a higher percentage of resources
to support maintenance, in the face of competing demands and political pressure to
defer expenditures on cost-reducing, preventive measures in favor of politically
more attractive investments.   However, given the degree of commitment by the
Government, as demonstrated by recent decisions, this risk is considered acceptable.
16. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
