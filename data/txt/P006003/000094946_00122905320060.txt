3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The main objectives of the project were to: (a) ensure adequate maintenance and/or rehabilitation of the national
road network for those sections not concessioned; (b) assist with the quality and financial supervision of the
maintenance to be executed by the concessionaires; (c) support the incremental implementation of the institutional
reform of the Direcci6n Nacional de Vialidad (DNV), Direcciones Provinciales de Vialidad (DPV), Secretaria de
Obras Ptublica (SOP) and Consejo Vial Federal (CVF) to respond to the Government's decentralization policy as
well as to changes in national/provincial government roles regarding sharing road transport subsector management
responsibilities, through: (i) the physical reconditioning of the road sections for which maintenance and
operational responsibility may be delegated to the provinces (thus reducing the initial workload of the provinces),
(ii) the strengthening of the generally inadequate provincial capability to manage road activities through a broad
Technical Assistance program and reinforced transfer of technology among highway agencies, and (iii) the
evolution of appropriate road planning and financing mechanism; (d) assist in achieving the optimal combination
of provincialization, privatization, and nationally-supported operations for those sections that are of national
interest; and (e) support the creation in DNV of an environment unit with trained staff to prepare systematically
and monitor environmental assessments when the works warrant, and to provide future guidance to the DPVs.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Project objectives were not revised during implementation. However, project description and the Loan Agreement
were amended in January 1996 to include a new category of disbursement for the CREMA contracts (Contrato de
Recuperaci6n y Mantenimiento). Such contracts are five-year performance-based contracts entered into by DNV
with private sector contractors to undertake all phases of road rehabilitation and maintenance works as a single
package, from design and programming of works, through the execution of such works. The new category was
financed by the previously unallocated amount and by the reallocation of uncommitted amounts from civil works
(rehabilitation and periodic maintenance). Thereafter, only Schedule I of the Loan Agreement was periodically
revised to reallocate the proceeds of the loan as requested by the Borrower.
3.3 Original Components.
Originally the project comprised: (a) a four-year tranche (mid-1993 to mid-1997) of the DNV's road maintenance
and reconstruction program for the portion of the national road network which is not concessioned; (b) flood
emergency works; (c) technical assistance for DNV reorganization and its reconversion program; (d) management
training and technical assistance; and (e) implementation of specific action plans in pilot provinces to transfer
know-how and strengthen their implementation capacity. The project would also include the equipment required
for the implementation of the various technical assistance components.
The original total cost of the project was estimated at US$756 million equivalent, including US$335.7 million for
rehabilitation works and periodic maintenance on the paved network, US$170 million for routine maintenance on
the paved and unpaved networks, US$20 million for flood emergency works, US29.7 million for consulting
services, US$3.6 million for equipment, US$113 million for identifiable taxes and US$84 million for physical and
price contingencies.
3.4 Revised Components:
In January 1996, the Bank agreed to revise project description by incorporating a new civil work
component called  "CREMA"  (Contrato  de Recuperacion  y  Mantenimiento).   Such  contracts  are
performance-based and require the Contractor to rehabilitate and subsequently maintain a subnetwork of roads
(generally between 100 and 300 km long) on a lump sum basis for a total period of five years. The Bank had
perceived at the time that DNV's innovative system of contracting an integrated rehabilitation and maintenance
program was likely to be cost and quality effective for several reasons: (i) by focusing on road user's satisfaction
and on Contractor's performance to achieve a minimum level of service rather than on inputs or resources used, the
system would foster innovation on part of the Contractor; (ii) by prescribing that the Contractor sets up his own
quality control system, DNV's supervision workload would be drastically reduced; (iii) by selecting a lump-sum
type of contract, the risk of cost overruns would be practically eliminated; and (iv) by extending the contract period
to five years the risk of unsatisfactory rehabilitation works would be greatly reduced since the Contractor has to
maintain the works over that period of time; in addition, Treasury would be deterred from failing to provide funds
- 2 -



for maintenance and to honor long-term payment obligations.
To finance the new component an amount of US$104 million was reallocated from the previously unallocated
category of the loan and from the residual uncommitted amounts for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance. The
percentage disbursement for the new CREMA category was set at 75%.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Consistent with QAG assessment (7/27/99) the quality at entry of the project is given a satisfactory rating. Indeed,
the project was designed as an integral part of the Bank's macroeconomic and sector assistance strategy for
Argentina. Project's objectives were supportive of the Government efforts to stabilize the economy, reduce fiscal
deficit, increase efficiency in the delivery of public services and achieve overall economic growth. The project
addressed major aspects of the sector with significant macroeconomic implications, such as: optimization of road
expenditures in infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance, increasing efficiency in the management of the
country's road networks including the preservation of the asset that they represented, which at the time of project
preparation was in dire need of restoration. Project risks were adequately identified and evaluated.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Apart from the objectives listed in para. 3.1 the project was expected to reduce vehicle operating costs on the
non-concessioned national road network through an adequate maintenance and rehabilitation program. During
appraisal, the surface condition index of that network (IE) was very low, about 5.5 and the proportion of roads in
poor condition was estimated at about 35%. At completion, nearly 45% of the network had been rehabilitated or
resurfaced under the project. This achievement, cormbined with the efforts provided for routinely maintaining the
system, helped improve substantially the condition of the network. Regular monitoring of surface conditions
between 1993 and 1999 gives the following indications: in 1996, the average surface condition index (IE) had
improved from 5.5 to 6 reaching at closing a value of 6.6, close to the target of 7 agreed during negotiations. In
that respect it is worth mentioning that a target of 7 is extremely rigorous and difficult to obtain over a network of
roads and that the achieved value of 6.6 may be considered as excellent. In terms of International Roughness Index
(IRI) the overall proportion of paved roads in poor condition (with IRI>5) has decreased from the appraisal figure
of 35% to 12% in 1996 and to 10% in 1998. Simultaneously, the proportion in good to very good condition (with
IRI<4) has increased from 44% in 1993 to 70% in 1998. The quality of road infrastructure also improved
substantially on the concessioned corridors over the last 6 years: the overall proportion of that network in poor
condition has decreased from 25% to practically zero percent. Purely public provision of road infrastructure and
heavily regulated transport services at federal level have practically disappeared and have been replaced by
public-private partnership and more efficient deregulated long distance road transport services as reflected by the
current status of the concessioned and non-concessioned contracts in the road sector. These contracts cover about
66% of the total length of the national road network and comprise approximately: 9,400 km of high traffic toll
roads (with daily traffic > 3000) under 20 concessions contracts (12-year duration), including the 4 accesses to
Buenos Aires and the access to Cordoba; 61 CREMA contracts (5-year duration) covering 11,667 km; 2 COT (
Construir, Operar y Transferir) contracts of 10-years duration covering about 626 km of non-tolled roads; and 13
routine maintenance km/month contracts of a 2-year duration which cover about 3,845 km.
Because of the above achievements the project outcome, overall, has been rated as satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by components:
a. Rehabilitation Components. The original objective was to rehabilitate about 7,700 km of paved roads.
At completion 9,940 km were rehabilitated, thus exceeding appraisal estimate by 22%.
b. Institutional Development Components. The institutional development components had the
following outputs:
*      Private sector participation in the management of the maintenance of the network has been drastically
improved: at appraisal, the 29,000 km-long non-concessioned national network was maintained entirely but not
-3 -



efficiently by force-account; at completion, only 20% of that network is maintained in-house.
*      Outsourcing modalities of maintenance activities over the entire national road system now involve a
balanced combination of toll roads concessions (25% of total length on high traffic volume roads), CREMA, COT
or km/month maintenance contracts with the private sector (43% of total length on medium traffic volume roads),
and delegated maintenance mandates to the provincial road departments (16% of total length, mainly on low
volume roads). Of the 38,408 km which comprise the entire national highway system, about 6,150 km only, i.e.,
16% are now maintained by force-account, and the intention is to bring that proportion down to less than 5%.
*      Because of the implementation of the CREMA contracts, it has been estimated that communities located
near the networks to be maintained would benefit through opportunities of employment generated by road
maintenance activities: about 5,000 jobs have been generated across all regions, every year.
*      The number of DNV staff has been drastically reduced over the last 6 years from about 4,000 to slightly
less than 3,000; i.e., the number of km of non-concessioned roads per agent has improved from 7 to nearly 11 (in
1990, the ratio was as low as 5 km/agent).
*      Planning, prioritizing, budgeting and programming of road works on the non-concessioned network are
now based on objective pavement condition and traffic surveys and the HDM model is widely used both at central
and regional levels to select and optimize economically sound highway expenditure programs.
*      An Environmental Division has been set up in DNV and has developed and is implementing satisfactory
environmental standards and guidelines.
*      A comprehensive training program has been implemented during the project and most of DNV's staff as
well as DPV's technical personnel have been trained and upgraded using the proceeds of the loan (see Section 10
for more details).
*      Supervision of the quality of maintenance executed on the concessioned corridors is adequately carried out
by a special department within DNV.
*      A number of important studies have been financed and executed under the project with action plans drawn
for the implementation of their recommendations: a study of the reformulation of the national road system sets a
solid foundation for furthering the road decentralization program; a road users charge study has been carried out
which showed that total highway expenditures are fully recovered from road users; a modem traffic information
and updated axle-load control systems have been prepared which will enable DNV, when implemented, to better
design, plan, and execute rehabilitation and capacity-increase programs in the future; a road safety study (a critical
issue in Argentina) has defined a comprehensive program of actions aimed at reducing the high accident toll
currently suffered by the country (Section 10 includes details of the achievements under the road users charges
study and road safety study).
*      Because it offers an effective means to improve the efficiency and public accountability of road
maintenance expenditures, the CREMA system of contracting has been a success and is enjoying a widespread
reputation across the region. The experience of the last 3 years has indeed been successful from various angles.
On the institutional side: (a) the system by prescribing that the Contractor sets up his own quality control system
has reduced considerably the need for time and staff consuming supervision (thus cost) and eliminated redundant
quantities and quality-testing of activities performed; inspection team size and tasks are reduced to the bare
minimum; (b) delays in project implementation which in traditional programs are due to lack of planning and
insufficient stock of prepared sub-projects have been minimized since the Contractor is required to carry out the
detailed engineering design before initiating the works; (c) focus is now on road users' satisfaction and on
Contractor's performance to achieve a minimum level of service rather than on inputs i.e. quantity activity and unit
rates compliance; (d) the system has fostered innovation on part of the Contractors in the programming and
execution of the works since acceptance and payments are not tied to rigid specifications related to workmanship
-4 -



but rather to end results and level of service; (e) in parallel to the Argentine initiative, several countries on the
Continent (including among others: Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil) are now experimenting and
selectively using many of the innovative features of that system; and (f) a paper describing the system and
presented at the Seventh International Conference on Low-Volume Roads in May 1999 received the award for that
conference. On the financing and funding side several advantages have been obtained: (a) the risks of cost
overruns have been drastically reduced since contracts are fixed-priced: currently, the cost overruns on the
CREMAs amount to less than 3% and are essentially due to force-majeur and compensable events (El Nino related)
and this is to be compared to the traditional 15% cost increase generally experienced with other conventional
contracting systems; (b) despite some delays in payment which have occurred at the end of 1999 due to emerging
macroeconomic difficulties, the use of the CREMA contracts seem to have deterred Treasury from failing to honor
the debts and the system provides a more stable funding for road maintenance as the long-term payments
obligations under these contracts become legally binding on the Govemment; (c) the average cost per year and per
km of the CREMA system is of the order of US$11,000 against a US$19,000 average cost for the COT contracts
while the unit cost of the km of rehabilitation under the CREMA stands at about US$66,000 to be compared to the
original estimates of US$59,000 based on less efficient conventional contracting methods; (d) likewise, the
CREMA routine maintenance cost is of the order of US$3,100/km/year which is consistent with the range of unit
costs experienced in the region for routine maintenance activities carried out by force-account or other traditional
unit prices contracts, i.e., from US$2,500 to US$4,000/km/year; and (e) procurement was a success as the lowest
bid price in aggregate exceeded the official budget by only 20% and this can be accounted for by the financial
charges of the contractors which had to invest up-front for the rehabilitation work, as well as by the risks
associated with high penalties in case of non compliance with the specified level of service and finally by the fact
that the contractor's design (overlay thickness) was sometimes more conservative than the minimum solution
specified by DNV on which was based the pre-bid estimate.
Since most of its objectives have been met, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory and the institutional
development impact has been rated as substantial.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic evaluation carried out at appraisal with the HDM 3 model indicated that the rehabilitation
component of the project (representing 60% of the original total base cost) had an Intemal Economic Rate of
Return (IERR) ranging from 21% to 35% with an overall average of about 30%. Ex-post analyses gave IERR
values ranging from 35% to 53% with an overall average of 44%. The economic return of the project remained
therefore at a highly satisfactory level.
A separate ex-post evaluation carried out for the CREMA sub-component alone also gave high returns: an IERR of
60% with a Net Present Value of US$1,173 million and a Benefit/Cost ratio of 1.8. The economic analysis also
showed the positive fiscal impact of the execution of the CREMA works: future annual rehabilitation costs for the
Road Authority will be reduced by about 30%.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
As part of the analysis referred to immediately above, it has been estimated that as a result of the execution of the
CREMA contracts, the national road agency will have positive financial benefits in the long term because future
expenditures needed to maintain the network at an acceptable level of service will decrease. The positive fiscal
impact has been estimated to be in the order of 30%: financial capital and recurrent maintenance expenditures will
be reduced from about US$11,300/lan/year to US$8,000/kln/year after project implementation. A financial
evaluation has shown that the financial rate of return of the CREMA sub-component is in the order of 65% at a
12% discount rate.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project has contributed to the establishment within DNV, both at central and regional levels, of a
comprehensive pavement management system, including the use of the HDM model for preparing and monitoring
efficient expenditure programs under budget constraints, based on technical and economic criteria rather than on
political considerations. It also contributed to the establishment of an appropriate environmental division and to
the setting up of a department responsible for the monitoring of the quality of services provided along the
- 5 -



concessioned corridors.  Moreover, the project has directly contributed to contracting out, using innovative
modalities, the maintenance of the network which was previously carried out by force-account and to obtain
improved funding for maintenance. Finally, the project helped finance an extensive training program for DNV
and DPV staff and also a number of major sectoral studies including action plans for the implementation of their
recommendations: decentralization of road maintenance mandates will be furthered thanks to the study on the
reclassification of the network ; road safety will be enhanced through the implementation of the traffic safety study
recommendations and more efficient network and traffic surveys will be carried out by implementing the results of
the studies conducted on traffic information systems, axle load measuring systems and pavement evaluation
methodologies. For these reasons, the institutional impact of the project has been rated as substantial.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The Tequila financial crisis of 1994 and 1995 introduced a substantial extemal shock outside Government
control which required that more stable financial mechanisms for maintenance be developed.
*      In early 1996, realizing that the CREMA system of contracting would be an effective means to improve
project performance in particular and the efficiency and public accountability of road maintenance operations in
general, the Bank agreed to amend the Loan Agreement and to create a special disbursement category of works
with an attractive rate of 75% (above the rates used for the other categories). The flexibility shown by the Bank in
revising the Loan Agreement to accommodate more private sector involvement had a positive effect on the project
outcome. Moreover in 1998 the Bank approved a new loan that would help sustain the CREMA contracts signed
under this project.
*      In 1999 the provincial and national elections slowed down decision-making across all govemment
agencies. This was compounded by emerging constraints on public spending and change in administration. This
factor affected in particular the institutional development component of the project (delays in contracting the last
sector studies).
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
*      The untimely provision of counterpart funds in sufficient amount has sporadically plagued project
performance throughout its implementation period. Both the civil works and institutional components
achievements were affected by the problem of local budgetary resources, particularly acute in 1995 and during the
last two years of implementation.
*      Because of the emerging "Tequila" crisis and as an economic emergency measure a decree signed by the
Superior Gobiemo de la Nacion in 1994 prohibited bidding and awarding of contracts for civil works between
November 1994 and March 1995. As a result, the physical component of the project was delayed with a substantial
disbursement lag during that period.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
*      In 1995, the civil works in the 1993-94 Road Investment Programs were delayed by poor designs and by
DNV's slow processing of design modification orders (more than 50% of the works contracted in 1993 needed
changes to their design).
*      Also, DNV's reluctance to and slowness in hiring Consultants affected the speed at which institutional
objectives (program of technical assistance) were achieved.
*      However, when the project was in disarray late 1995, as a result of the Tequila crisis (DNV's budget
allocations fell by about 25%, from nearly US$600 million to about US$450 million), Vialidad Nacional had
particular merit in developing and implementing the CREMA system of contracting and in involving the private
sector in the road maintenance activities to an unprecedented level. That enabled quick and intensified use of
available Bank loan and was instrumental in ultimately bringing about the highly successful achievement of project
objectives.

5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Project cost details are given in Annexes 2a (Project Costs by Component), 2b (Project Costs by Procurement
Arrangements), and 2c (Project Financing by Component). As can be seen in these annexes, the total project cost
at closing amounted to about US$615 million i.e. 81% of the appraisal estimate of US$756 million. The reduction
is mainly accounted for by the lower-than-expected costs for taxes and contingencies (initially assumed to be 35%
of project base cost) and by lower bid costs for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works. Overall, actual
average unit cost for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance (including works carried out outside the CREMA
contracts, using conventional ad-measurements type of contracts) was US$53,700 against an original estimate of
US$58,700/km.
Regarding project financing, the Bank contribution was 97% of planned estimates and the Government
contribution reduced by 31%, as compared to appraisal estimates.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is rated as likely, overall. However, as macroeconomic conditions in Argentina have
deteriorated recently, the financing and management capabilities in place will be tested. The DNV will need to
continue efforts to ensure sustainability including the following actions which need to be monitored:
(i)    necessary funds are timely, regularly, and appropriately allocated to the maintenance and rehabilitation of
the national road network (CREMA contracts) and given priority over new constructions. As indicated earlier, it is
estimated that through more timetable efficient, reliable and timely maintenance allocations the yearly
requirements are reduced by 30%;
(ii)    adequate pavement standards and models such as the HDM  are used to prepare and prioritize
economically sound road expenditure programs based on updated and objective road network condition and traffic
surveys. Recent improvements of the strategic road network condition will allow for more systematic management
to be developed;
(iii)   procurement of all DNV works are based on transparent and competitive bidding, whether they are or not
partly financed by multilateral agencies;
(iv)    adequate staffing including training and career development programs are provided and implemented
within DNV; and
(v)    the CREMA system of contracting is expanded to include the entire national non-concessioned network.
Even though the system introduces more rigidity in fiscal allocations to the sector it assists the Government in
supporting countercyclical measures focusing on the high priority network.
A follow-up project recently financed by the Bank is helping consolidate the benefits from this project, thereby
increasing the likelihood of sustainability. It is worth noting that DNV is now providing technical assistance to
countries in Central America on how to develop the CREMA contracting method.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Transition arrangements for the project's future operation are well in place and are being currently secured by a
Bank-financed follow-on project. The CREMA system of contracting is being expanded to cover the entire
non-concessioned paved national network and the bidding of a second package is now under way. Also the
Km/month contracts and the maintenance agreements with the Provinces have been renewed.  DNV's
organization, missions and staffing are being reviewed and modemized by the new administration which took
office in January 2000. Further training of staff is being provided for by the new Bank loan. However, and in the
face of current restricted budgets, the challenge for the on-going follow-on project is the availability of funds for
the CREMA contracts. There is a need to keep a close watch on the priority given to that issue by the Government,
- 7 -



and the Bank role in supervising and monitoring this project will be critical.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank performance during identification, preparation and appraisal was-satisfactory on the whole. Its involvement
in the project was consistent with the government's strategy on decentralization and supportive of the country
objective to resume economic growth, including the provision of efficient and reliable transport services to targeted
sectors of the economy as well as the promotion of the private sector operations in transport. The appraisal team
had a good skill mix of highway engineers, a transport economist, an environmental specialist and a procurement
consultant. Project design was simple and consistent with the agencies' implementation capacity overall. Risks
were adequately recognized and performance indicators appropriately defined.
7.2 Stupervision:
Bank supervision performance was also satisfactory. On average, the project was supervised twice a year and
implementation progress and ratings adequately reported. In recognizing the innovative nature of the CREMA
system of contracting, and in approving the needed restructuring of the project, Bank performance helped bring
about the successful achievement of project objectives.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance.
Overall performance was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Fully committed to the project objectives, the Borrower participated actively in the preparation of the project.
Government staff prepared all technical, economic and financial aspects of the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory The executing agency showed strong commitment to
the project and assigned adequate key managers to coordinate its implementation. Less satisfactory were the timely
and sufficient provision of counterpart funds.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Throughout the project implementation period, the implementing agency performance was satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower performance was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
1. The Argentine experience confirmed that strong government ownership and commitment can help bring
about dramatic and positive changes in highway sector policies within a relatively short period of time (in this case
in less than 10 years).
2.     This project has also shown that the implementation of an optimized network rehabilitation and
maintenance strategy can effectively bring an entire road network back into a satisfactory condition over a period
of a few years and at a reasonable cost.
3.     Proactive supervision and restructuring of the project as soon as critical assumptions have changed were
essential to achieve the development objective: in this case, by the end of 1995, stock of subprojects ready for
bidding was lacking and the design and adoption of the CREMA system proved to be an appropriate solution for
facilitating the use of the Bank loan.
-8 -



4.      Good quality of project design at entry, full Borrower's commitment and innovativeness, sound highway
maintenance policies involving private sector participation, Bank flexibility in revising the Loan Agreement, as
well as good support to supervision missions from the decentralized Country Management Unit are factors that
played a vital role in bringing about the success of the project.
5.     Albeit the CREMA system of contracting may not be a panacea and remains vulnerable to macroeconomic
conditions, experience has shown that it offers several and important advantages compared to other traditional
methods of contracting rehabilitation and maintenance works: it reduces substantially supervision costs and
practically eliminates project cost overruns; it also provides a more stable funding mechanism for maintenance and
it fosters innovation thus promoting cost-effective technologies on the part of the contractors.

10. Additional Information
The following additional information on the institutional development impact of the project are
noteworthy. They refer to what was accomplished through the training program, and to the conclusions
and recommendations arising from the Road Users Charges study and the Road Safety study.
Training Program.
DNV training requirements were identified by a survey carried out prior to appraisal. The
training program focused particularly on management, planning, engineering and highway sector
refonns. More specifically, needs were felt to: (a) improve management capabilities by moving to a
Management by Program budgeting system (MBP-oriented); (b) train staff in the application of the
Environmental manual for road works and in the utilization of related technologies and; (c) train DNV
personnel in prospective planning including the preparation of pluriannual road investment programs
based on appropriate models and criteria to support decisions on investments priorities.
The loan helped implement and substantially achieve a training program that was in line with the
above requirements: between 1996 and 1999 more than 60 senior staff were trained and participated to
nearly 30 events and training courses covering the following areas:
*   Environmental impact evaluation of road projects;
*   State-of -the-art road design, construction and maintenance technologies;
*   Economic analysis of road investments using the HDM model;
*   Value engineering applied to highway design and construction;
*   Physical, economic and financial monitoring of projects;
*   Road safety issues and solutions; and
*   Specific and customized courses on georadar, modified asphalt, Superpave asphalt mixture
design process, quality control of conventional and pre-stressed concrete structures, human
resources, and bridge rehabilitation and maintenance.
The implementation of the training program was instrumental in achieving the successful design and supervision
of the CREMA contracts.

Road Users Charges Studv
Between 1935 and 1989 the development of the road sector in Argentina was financed by the
creation of specific taxes on fuels, lubricants and tires. Since then the road sector has been funded by the
Treasury and also but more recently (as of 1990) by toll collection on concessioned corridors. This has
profoundly affected the structure of the road users charges system.
The study was to focus on determining the present structure of users charges and to identify
related charges to the different road users, distinguishing between the various road networks: national,
provincial, and municipal (in each case separating roads operated and/or maintained under concessions
from those operated and maintained without concessions).
The study was carried out under contract in 1999 by the Civil Engineering Department
(Transport Division) of the University of Buenos Aires. It determined all users charges including the
quantification of extemalities such as congestion costs due to urban traffic, environmental pollution and
accidents costs. The main conclusions derived from the study were the following:
*   Current users charges amount to about US$10.4 billion annually, including US$5.7 billion of
specific charges and US$4.7 billion of general taxes.
*   The specific users fees are sufficient to cover 100%  of total highway expenditures needs
estimated to be in the order of US$3.2 billion per year and 81% of extemalities estimated to cost
about US$3.1 billion, including congestion, environmental pollution and road accidents costs.
*   Total annual road users charges (US$10.4 billion) exceed overall financial road expenditures
needs estimated to be US$6.3 billion, annually.
* Fuel taxes alone (which were previously earmarked to cover highway construction and
upgrading) exceed network expenditures needs by about US$1.9 billion annually.
*   Total taxes paid by and recovered from road users annually (US$9.8 billion excluding toll fees)
represent about 22% of the Govemment general revenues (about US$50 million); and
*   Heavy traffic is not subsidized by light traffic and trucks fully pay the additional damage cost
that they impose on the network.
The general recommendations of the study were as follows:
I.     Ensure that at least US$3.2 billion are assigned annually to cover the costs of maintenance,
rehabilitation and development of the country's road system including the municipal and urban network;
considering only the national and provincial network, annual needs for maintenance, rehabilitation and
upgrading (paving) are estimated to be in the order of US$1.2 billion (US$520 million for the national
system excluding concessioned corridors, and US$640 million for the provincial network). Over the last
years, actual governments annual allocations (excluding toll fees of about US$600 million per year,
recovered from concessioners) have consistently amounted to about US$1.4 billion (US$500 million for
DNV and US$900 million for the DPVs) thus slightly exceeding estimated needs.
2.     Design specific instruments and explore efficient mechanisms (including road funds) aimed at
distributing the above funds to DNV and to the provinces and municipalities in accordance with their
respective needs.
3.     Expand the CREMA system of rehabilitation and maintenance to the entire national road
network including the concessioned corridors, once the concession contracts are terminated.
4.     Ensure that the national and provincial road agencies utilize more efficiently the resources
allocated to them. As suggested in 1. above the issue is less that of adequate financing from the part of
the governments but of improper assignation of available resources by the road agencies (too much
priority given to new constructions, over-designed and too costly pavement standards, and sometimes
- 10 -



excessive payrolls costs, and inadequate procurements methods).
5.     Apply and vigorously enforce the National Traffic Law No. 24.449 and Decree No 775 which
regulate the emission of gas and particles in the atmosphere as well as the allowable limit of noise, and
obtain the adhesion of the provincial governments which have not yet endorsed the terms and conditions
of the Law.
Road Safety Study
The Road Safety study included the preparation of three Manuals based on extensive
investigation, observations and surveys carried out on the national road network. The first Manual dealt
with inadequate practices and proposed solutions to correct them; the second manual focused on road
safety audit procedures; and the third manual elaborated on safe highway design including cities
crossings.
Based on the study, an action plan for the short term has been prepared and is estimated to cost at least
US$30 million.
Among the most critical improvements deemed necessary in the short to medium term are the following:
e Paving of shoulders on selected motorway sections;
*   Upgrading and paving of shoulders on conventional national roads carrying more than 2,500 vehicles
per day;
* Adequate protection of obstacles along the roadside (trees, electric posts, bridge piles, vertical signs,
guardrails, etc.);
e   Capacity increase (widening) on selected sections of the network;
- Edge marking of roads carrying upwards of 2,500 vehicles per day;
* Increasing size and dimensions of vertical signs;
- Improving level crossings at railway junctions; and
-   Elimination of Y-shaped intersections.
It is DNV's intention to implement the action program referred to above and to request Bank's
assistance in financing it as one of the component of a new loan.

SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S EVALUATION REPORT
INFORME FINALPRESTAMO 3611-AR
SINTESIS
OBJETIVO ORIGINAL
Ayudar a reducir el deterioro de la Red Vial Nacional de la Republica Argentina y contribuir al fortalecimiento
Institucional de la DIRECCION NACIONAL de VIALIDAD y de las DIRECCIONES PROVINCIALES
de VIALIDAD, a fin de poder incrementar la transferencia de funciones operativas realizadas por la D.N.V. a
contratistas particulares y a las Provincias y perfeccionar los Sistemas de Gerenciamiento de la Red Troncal.
El proyecto incluye un componente de asistencia tecnica y capacitaci6n para fortalecer a la DIRECCION
NACIONAL de VIALIDAD, en sus nuevas funciones de control de sistemas de gesti6n, liderazgo tecnico,
coordinaci6n y apoyo a las DIRECCIONES PROVINCIALES de VIALIDAD, investigaci6n Vial y
evaluaci6n del impacto ambiental en la red vial y su entomo.
El proyecto considera ademas, la asistencia tecnica para estudiar una conexi6n propuesta para el transporte
entre ARGENTINA y URUGUAY.
El objetivo final fue el de contribuir a la reanudaci6n del crecimiento econ6mico al reducir el costo del
transporte Vial en la Red Troncal Nacional.
ALCANCES DEL PROYECTO
Entre los alcances principales del proyecto estaba la necesidad de desarrollar un Manual de Evaluaci6n y
Gesti6n Arnbiental de Obras Viales, para su aplicaci6n por la D.N.V. a los proyectos de sus obras en las
distintas etapas de los mismos: a) estudio y proyecto, b) construcci6n, c) mantenimiento y d) explotaci6n,
por carecerse del mismo.
Ademas se prepar6 un programa de obras y mantenimiento para los afios 1993 a 1997 constituido por obras de
Reconstrucci6n, de Mantenimiento Peri6dico y de Emergencia por inundaciones, que abarc6 7.700 Km. de la
Red Nacional, con lo cual se debia alcanzar en la misma un indice promedio de rugosidad IRI 7, junto con
los trabajos a incluir en los Planes de Mantenimiento de Rutina.
La D.N.V. debia poner en vigencia, previo desarrollo del mismo un Sistema de Gerenciamiento de pavimentos
para la preparaci6n de los programas de obras, optimizando las inversiones destinadas a los mismos.
COSTO ORIGINAL DEL PROYECTO
El costo original del proyecto se estim6 en el equivalente de U$S756 millones.
ENMIENDAS AL PROYECTO
Se efectuaron 4 modificaciones al proyecto tendientes a optimizar las inversiones y asegurar el uso total de los
fondos del mismo, resultando el monto final de 622 Millones, sin haberse modificado los objetivos originales,
algunos de los cuales fueron superados.
OBJETIVOS LOGRADOS
El objetivo fisico era ejecutar 7.700 Km. de obras de rehabilitaci6n y pavimentaci6n. A la fecha de terminaci6n
se habran ejecutado 9.440 Km, es decir un 22,6% mas que lo programado.
Con relaci6n al mantenimiento de rutina se han formalizado 11 contratos y 2 convenios que atienden 3.845
- 20 -



Km y convenios con 14 Provincias que mantienen 6.186 Km, ademas de los 11.667Km incluidos en los
C.RE.MA.
El costo total comprometido del proyecto a su terminaci6n Ilega a USS614,6 millones, el monto original
previsto en el informe de evaluaci6n (SAR) es de U$S756 millones y la ultima suma revisada de acuerdo a
enmienda de Diciembre de 1999 es de 622 millones de d6lares.
En terminos relativos, el proyecto alcanz6 el 82% de los calculos de la evaluaci6n y estuvo levemente por
debajo de las ultimas previsiones.
Los costos unitarios de los trabajos de rehabilitaci6n se mantuvieron un 6% mas bajo que los previstos
originalmente, siendo su costo promedio por kil6metro de U$S53.600.
Un objetivo importante alcanzado fue el de privatizaci6n de las tareas realizadas a lo largo de toda la Red
Troncal, pues de 28.963 Km que inicialmente estaban sometidos al Sistema de Gerenciamiento por
Administraci6n, al finalizar el proyecto pasaron a 5.934 Km en su mayoria con superficies de rodamiento de
ripio y de tierra.
La diferencia se administr6 mediante nuevos Sistemas de Gerenciamiento.
Se ha contratado mantenimiento de rutina en 3612 Km mediante contratos con Empresas por un Sistema
denominado Km.Mes y otros 233 Km por el mismo sistema con la Provincia de Tierra del Fuego.
Mediante un sistema de contratos ineditos hasta el momento, que se denominaron Contratos de Recuperaci6n y
Mantenimiento (C.RE.MA.), se rehabilitaron y conservaron 11.667 Km
Se han firmado convenios para mantenimiento de rutina, dentro del marco de la reconversi6n vial, con 14
Provincias, abarcando 6186 Km.
El resto de la Red se mejora y mantiene mediante los Sistemas de Concesi6n con peaje y del C.O.T.
(Construir, Operar, Transferir) que es una concesi6n sin peaje, ambos sin financiaci6n del B.I.R.F.
Se ha creado en la D.N.V. una Divisi6n de Gesti6n Ambiental que ha elaborado un Manual aplicable a las
distintas etapas del estudio, proyecto, construcci6n y operaci6n de un camino, impartiendo pautas ambientales
a todas las areas de la D.N.V. Se han dictado cursos, mediante una firma Consultora, para capacitar al personal
en este tema. El Manual es usado por varias Provincias.
Se han establecido sistemas de Gerenciamiento de la Red apoyados en una base de datos que incluye las
condiciones y caracteristicas del transito y de la Red, basados en el modelo HDM III y HDM-ADM, adaptados
a las distintas regiones de la Argentina, para determinar programas de gastos optimizados para carreteras.
La proporci6n de rutas en condici6n critica a pobre (con IRI> 3,5) se redujo de 60% (condici6n en el momento
de la evaluaci6n) a 47% en 1998 y a 43% en la fecha de terminaci6n (31-12-99).
El indice de estado promedio de la Red en el momento de la evaluaci6n era 5,54. En el anio 1998 se increment6
a 6,5 y al finalizar el proyecto a 6,6. Es decir que practicamente se alcanz6 el objetivo propuesto inicialmente
que era igual a 7.
Desde el punto de vista econ6mico cabe consignar que las pautas establecidas durante la evaluaci6n se vieron
cumplidas al final del proyecto.
El analisis econ6mico en el momento de la evaluaci6n, utilizando el modelo HD1M3, indicaba que el
componente de rehabilitaci6n de las Carreteras Nacionales que representaba 48,4% del costo base total del
- 21 -



proyecto deveng6 una Tasa rendimiento Econ6mica Interna (ERR) de aproximadamente 30% en promedio
para Rutas con pavimento asfaltico, 2,5 B/C promedio para Rutas sin pavimentar y un 46% ERR promedio
para Rutas de hormig6n. Una evaluaci6n posterior realizada en la misma muestra de subproyectos dieron
Valores de 44% y de U$S 174 millones para el ERR y VPN respectivamente, permaneciendo por lo tanto en
niveles altamente satisfactorios.
La parte Institucional se desarroll6 satisfactoriamente, habiendose realizado diversos cursos de capacitaci6n,
con asistencia de 332 profesionales y la concurrencia de 65 profesionales a reuniones tecnicas en el Exterior.
Durante la vigencia del Prestamo se han introducido modificaciones en la estructura de la DIRECCION
NACIONAL de VIALIDAD y actualmente se estan preparando planes para reorganizar la REPARTICION.
Por todo lo expuesto el resultado del Proyecto se puede clasificar como muy satisfactorio.
*   Para asegurar el exito de proyectos como el presente, segun la experiencia adquirida con el mismo, se
deben preparar y priorizar programas Viales utilizando modelos adecuados como el HDM y bases de datos
basadas en estadisticas y datos reales y objetivos sobre la condici6n de la red y el transito.
*   El Mantenimiento de la Red debe contratarse dando preferencia a sistemas basados en el resultado, como el
C.RE.MA.
*   Deben efectuarse licitaciones abiertas.
*   Las misiones de supervisi6n del BANCO deben durar por lo menos 5 dias por cada subproyecto,
permitiendole al Personal del BANCO proveer mas guia y asistencia al prestatario.
*   Ha resultado de una utilidad extraordinaria haber incluido en el proyecto una partida para conservaci6n de
rutina, pues de lo contrario no se hubiera podido cumplir con uno de los objetivos principales, que es
alcanzar en la Red Troncal Nacional un promedio de IRI >= 7. Con esta partida se pudo mantener a traves
de los contratos Km.-mes y Convenios con Provincias (Transferencias de Funciones Operativas) 9.974
Km.
*   La gesti6n de los Funcionarios del B.I.R.F. que intervinieron durante la gesti6n del Prestamo como
durante la implementaci6n del Proyecto fue muy satisfactoria, excepto en el periodo que abarc6 los anios
1994 y 1995, donde no se lograban conciliar las opiniones de los miembros de las misiones con las
necesidades reales de la D.N.V.
*   El cumplimiento por parte de la Prestataria (La Naci6n Argentina) fue satisfactorio, aunque a veces los
fondos de contrapartida no pudieron estar disponibles en el momento oportuno.
*   El 6rgano de Implementaci6n (La D.N.V.) cumpli6 muy satisfactoriamente sus funciones, lo que se reflej6
en los altos indices de los objetivos alcanzados.
