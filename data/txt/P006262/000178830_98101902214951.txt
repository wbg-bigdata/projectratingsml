REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE NATIONAL HOUSING BANK (BNH)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A MINAS GERAIS WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Brazilian National Housing Bank (BNH) with the guarantee of the Federative
Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$36.0 million to help finance a
water supply and sewerage project in the Brazilian State of Minas Gerais. The
loan would have a term of 23 years, including three years of grace, with inter-
est at 7As per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to the state
water company of Minas Gerais, COMAG, at a rate of interest of 6% with princi-
pal and interest fully corrected for changes in the Brazilian general price
index.  Relending would be for 18& to 21 years including periods of grace of
6 to 36 months, depending on the characteristics of the individual COMAG sub-
projects to be financed.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, entitled "The Economic and Social Development
of Brazil" (R73-87), dated March 12, 1973, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on April 2, 1973. An economic mission visited Brazil in the latter
part of 1973 and its report is currently in preparation. Country data sheets
are attached as Annex I.
3.        The Brazilian economy has continued to grow at the very rapid pace
which began in 1968. The increase in domestic product for 1973 is estimated
to have been 10.5%. This was the third consecutive year of growth exceeding
10% and the sixth in which it exceeded 9%. Over this six-year period the per
capita income of the country has increased 50%, its manufacturing output has
doubled and its exports (in current dollars) have increased 3.5 times. Not
only was overall growth in 1973 very rapid but it was well distributed sec-
torially and regionanly. Industrial production was up 14%, and this will be
the fourth consecutive year of acceleration of industrial growth. Economic
growth for 1973 in the Northeast, where the weather was favorable for agri-
culture and where industrial output is beginning to show the effects of pre-
vious investments stimulated by fiscal incentives, was in the order of 13 to
15%. Finally, while world prices have been increasing rapidly, the Government
was able to manage its financial programs so that inflation did not accelerate
during 1973. However, increased infLationary pressures have been evident in
the early part of 1974 as a result o.r decontrol of some domestic prices and
rapidly increasing import prices especially for petroleum.
4.        The development of Brazilian industry seems to be entering a new
phase, as excess capacity which had been playing a key role in expansion of
output has largely been utilized and most key industries are operatingfl between



90 and 95% of capacity. Rapid expansion of industrial output has produced some
ttlenecks in the supply of intermediate goods and raw materials, especially
-ieel and petrochemicals. This supply gap is being filled by increased imports,
iic'h the Government has facilitated by reducing, and in many cases suspending,
-Import duties. The Government has plans in an advanced state of preparation for
evxpanding domestic production of these critical intermediate goods. Over the
_ort term, increased import requirements will reflect both these bottlenecks
tne higher costs of imported petroleum.
The agricultural sector is also undergoing some important structural
modifications. The strong increase in international demand for and prices of
major products has led to substantial changes in price-cost relationships among
traditional crops and new export crops like soybeans. Over the short term,
these changes are making it difficult for the Government to balance export de-
mand against requirements of the domestic market. In the case of beef, the
Government has temporarily restricted exports in order to dampen the increases
in domestic prices which might endanger its targets for reduction of inflation.
On the other hand, exports of some agricultural products have increased sharply
and Brazil has become one of the world's leading exporters of soybeans and
sugar. While recent trends are causing temporary difficulties in the management
of the aEriculture sector, they have generally desirable longer term implica-
tions for the location and structure of agricultural production. Pressure on
presently cultivated land caused by the expansion of soybean production is
encouraging a marked acceleration in the opening to commercial agriculture and
livestock production of large areas in the Center-West, and the agricultural
frontier is extending.
6.        There are indications that the continued rapid expansion of the
Brazilian economy had a beneficial impact on employment and real wages during
J973.  The data showing increased industrial employment (8% in 1973) and real wages
(2.3% in 1973) are clear. Less definite but perhaps more important are reports
of shortages of rural labor in the South and rising wages for farm laborers
harvesting coffee, cotton and sugar crops. While technicians and skilled
workers have been in short supply in Brazil for some time, there are now per-
sistent reports of scarcity of unskilled workers, especially in the :onstruction
industry of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. While indications of increasing
absorption of labor and rising real wages encourage the belief that the lower
income groups are enjoying an increase in their incomes in real terms, it cannot
yet be said to what extent this will dininish the skewed pattern of income dis-
tribution in Brazil.
7.        The rapid expansion of the Brazilian economy over 1968-72 depended
increasingly on the utilization of foreign savings. The resource gap, which
was 0.9% of GNP in 1968, grew steadily to 3.4% in 1972 as increases in domes-
tic savings did not keep pace with the investmen,; requirements of a 10% average
rate of GDP growth, as the investment rate rose irom 17.4% of GDP in 1968 to
19.4% in 1972. During this period the growth of exports, while averaging 13%
per year, was well below the 20% growth of imports. However, this pattern of



3
development was reversed in 1973 as domestic savings, stimulated by Government-
induced savings schemes and facilitated by increasing export prices, were esti-
mated to increase almost 23% and reach 19.8% of GDP. For the first time in
many years this exceeded the growth of investment, so that the resource gap
narrowed from 3.4 to 3.2% of GDP.   It should be pointed out that this may not
represent a trend toward narrowing resource gaps and reduced external capital
requirements but may, in part, reflect a lag between increased incomes due to
improved terms of trade and increases in consumption and imports.
8.        The growth of the Brazilian economy continues to be fueled by the
outstanding performance of export agriculture and industry. The dollar value
of Brazil's exports increased by 45% in 1973, following a 37% increase in 1972.
The country bas benefited from rising world commodity prices; nevertheless,
it is estimated that 64% of the increase in exports will be due to increased
volume. Thus, despite an increase in imports of more than 30%, largely re-
flecting expansion of wheat, steel, petroleum and chemical imports, the country
enjoyed in 1973 a positive trade balance for the first time since 1970 and the
current account deficit was smaller, at around US$1,200 million, than in 1971
or 1972. The first half of 1973 saw a continuation of the strong inflow of
foreign capital into Brazil, predominantly in the form of financial credits,
and, as in the past few years, this capital inflow exceeded the current account
deficit, resulting in a substantial accumulation of foreign exchange reserves,
which reached US$6.6 billion, the equivalent of about 11 months' imports, at
the end of 1973. These reserves provide a cushion of international liquidity
especially needed because of heavy short- and medium-term debt service payments
and would give the authorities adequate time to adjust their economic policy
in case of adverse balance of payments developments. In mid-1972, concerned
about both the term structure of external debt and the inflationary effects
of reserve accumulation, the authorities began to attempt to limit the inflow
of financial credits. The minimum maturity of financial credits was extended
to six, then eight, and ultimately to ten years. These measures proved partly
successful and the net inflow in the first half of 1973, US$1.3 billion, was
lower than that in the second half of 1972, US$1.8 billion. The lengthening
of minimum maturities for financial credits apparently induced some foreign
firms to switch to direct investment, which increased sharply. In September
the Government took even sterner measures to limit inflows of financial credits
by imposing a 40% reserve requirement on cruzeiros generated by new finaancial
credits while permitting existing credits to be renewed for a minimum maturity
of ten years. This measure virtually halted the inflow of new financial credits
during the fourth quarter of 1973. However, in view of the higher import costs
due to increased oil prices and the uncertain condition of the world capital
market, the authorities repealed the 40% reserve requirement in January 1974,
while leaving the minimum term at 10 years to assure an adequate flow of funds
on acceptable terms.
9.        The recent increases in world petroleum prices will have strong
direct and indirect consequences for the future growth of Brazil. During
recent years Brazil has become increasingly dependent upon external sources
of petroleum, which now supply three-fourths of its requirements, and is now
the heaviest importer of oil of all the less developed countries. The near-



ierm direct impact of increased oil prices will be strong, but should prove
manageable. Latest tentative estimates indicate it will add about US$1.5
billion to the oil import bill for 197h, an increase of 50 percent over
our earlier estimate. The Government is taking measures to lessen the long-
Ierm impact of oil price increases by raising domestic prices of petroleum
products, carrying out an investment program which emphasizes hydroelectric
noiler and rail transport, and beginning to develop alternative sources of
-iergy (shale oil and atomic power).
10.       Because Brazil has become increasingly integrated into the world
economy, its growth performance is now linked closely to the state of the econ-
omies of the industrialized countries. Insofar as the energy crisis affects
their economic well-being, it also affects Brazil's export growth prospects
and the potential for continued high levels of capital flows from the indus-
trialized countries to Brazil. Despite these uncertainties, Brazil's export
prospects are generally favorable and its foreign exchange reserves are ample
so that high rates of growth can be sustained, although some deceleration from
the recent records can be expected. However, at acceptable rates of growth
Brazil is certain to continue to have a sizeable resource gap, and mobiliza-
tion of large flows of official external long-term capital should play an import-
tant role in financing the current account deficit if the debt service burden
is to remain manageable. It is estimated that the average annual inflow of
official medium- and long-term capital required for the years 1974 to 1979
will be approximately US$1.9 billion, or almost twice the average annual
medium- and long-term official capital inflow for the years 1971 to 1973.
While the official loan capital needed to support Brazil's growth targets is
substantial, the direct import needs of most public investment projects are
relatively low, reflecting the ability of the domestic capital goods industry
to compete successfully under international competitive bidding and the low
direct foreign exchange component of many projects with strong social impact.
Hence, an appreciable part of official external financing should be made avail-
able to cover domestic expenditures.
11.       By the end of 1973, Brazil's total external debt (public and private)
probably exceeded US$11.5 billion, of which over US$7 billion was in the form
of financial credits.   The aforementioned recent measures extending the mini-
mum term of financial credits and virtually eliminating short-term credits are
having a favorable impact on debt structure. Between March 1972 and March
1973, the proportion of the debt due within two years fell from 40% to 31%.
Nevertheless, the debt service ratio for 1973, including all registered eaxter-
nal debt, but netting out service payments received on Brazilian loans to
other countries, is estimated at 38%. It should be noted that this debt ser-
vice ratio includes service on all public and private debt; the ratio for
public and publicly guaranteed debt alone would be very much lower. Nonethe-
less, the fact remains that Brazil's external debt is large and its debt ser-
vice obligations are high. However, the very large foreign exchange reserves
accumulated over the past several years ensure that Brazil will have the liqui-
dity to meet its debt service obligations in the short term, while the country's
record of high caliber financial management provides grounds for confidence in



- 5 -
the maintenance of creditworthiness over the longer run. On the assumptions
that exports increase by about 18% a year in nominal terms between 1973 and
1979 and that the average maturity of financial credits does not fall below
six years, the debt service ratio is expected to decline substantially over
the next several years and Brazil is considered creditworthy for continued
Bank lending.
12.       As a result of the trends in the Braz-lian economy- in recent years
and of careful economic management, there has been a remarkable broadening and
deepening of the country's productive base and its infrastructure as well as a
strengthening of its external sector. However, despite its recent growth and
vast potential, Brazil is still a country with a relatively low per capita
income, about US$464 (Bank Atlas for 1971), a very unequal distribution of
income and extensive poverty. The Brazilian Government believes that the pov-
erty and dualism which afflict the country can be ameliorated only if high rates
of economic growth are sustained, permitting absorption of the economically
marginal population into the expanding modern sector. Within the context of
rapid growth, the Government has committed itself to using the considerable
savings it generates for programs which have a social orientation and transfer
resources from the more developed to the less developed regions of the country.
These programs fall into two broad categories: regional development programs
for the Northeast, Amazon and Center-West designed to bring about a fuller
utilization of the country's land and natural resources, encourage expansion
of the agricultural frontier and promote industrialization of less developed
areas; and social development programs in public health and nutrition, water
and sewerage, low-income housing, education and social welfare, instituted to
broaden the distribution of and improve access to the benefits of economic
growth.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
Bank Operations
13.       By March 31, 1974, Brazil had received 47 loans from the Bank amount-
ing to US$1,742.3 million, of which 31 have not been fully disbursed. During
FY65 through FY69, disbursements averaged only US$10 million per year, increas-
ing to US$66 million in EY70, US$75 million in FY71, US$137 million in FY72,
and US$179 million in FY73. In the first nine months of FY74 they were US$165.5
million. Disbursements will continue to increzse during the next few years.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of March 31, 1974 and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       Bank lending to Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven loans were
approved totalling US$437 million (including three large loans to the steel
industry).  In FY73, six loans amounting to US$187.7 million were approved.  A
loan of US$125 million for the Itumbiara hydroelectric project has been the
only loan to Brazil approved thus far in FY74. A loan of US$81 million for the
Paulo Afonso IV hydroelectric project on the Sao Francisco River in the North-
east is being presented to the Executive Directors at the same time as the
present loan. At an advanced stage of preparation are an education project in
the Northeast and North, a railway rehabilitation program, a project to improve



- 6 -
the port of Recife, and a fifth highway construction program. We hope to pre-
sent these projects to the Executive Directors in the nex-t several months. We
are also working with the Brazilians on the preparation of an integrated rural
development project in the Northeast State of Rio Grande do Norte, an agricul-
t.ural development project in the lower Sao Francisco Valley, a settlement proj-
e,ct in the fjnazon region, an agricultural research program, a third livestock
development project, and a nutrition project.  We have also been requested to
Participate in the financing of the next phase of the expansion of the flat
steel industry, and we are also considering assistance to small- and medium-
sized industry.
15.       Brazil's total medium- and long-term external debt (excluding fin-
ancial credits) outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1972 was US$4.0 billion.
The Bank held, at the end of 1972, 12.2% of the medium- and long-term debt
outstanding; and the Bank's share of the service on this debt was about 6.5%.
If present trends continue as expected, the Bank's share in total medium- and
long-term debt outstanding will increase to about 19% by 1979, while the share
in debt service would increase to about 10%.
IFC Operations
16.      IFC has committed more financial resources to Brazil than to any
other country. Since 1957, IFC has made 22 commitments to Brazil, totalling
US$142.1 million, of which US$10.8 million has been repaid and US$55.6 million
sold. Of the balance of US$73.7 million, U$53.o million represents loans and
US$20.7 million equity. A summary of IFC's investments up to March 31, 1974,
is given in Annex II.
Lending Strategy
17.       In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has been supporting several impor-
tant objectives of the Government's development policy. One objective has been
the identification and support of projects designed to increase productivity
and incomes in the lowest income segments of the population, to broaden the
economic opportunities open to those groups and to alleviate human misery.
Project preparation efforts in this area have been intensified, and we hope
an increasing number of loans with this objective will be coming forward to
support Brazil's education, nutrition, water supply and sewerage and rural
development programs. Experience shows that projects in these areas are espe-
cially difficult and time-consuming to prepare, require close participation by
Bank staff through all stages of the project's life, and are usually relatively
small in size. Other external development lenders are also actively seeking to
help projects of this nature. For these reasons, only a limited number of
projects in these areas will be available and suitable for Bank financing in
the near future. While the concentrated efforts now being made along these
lines should eventually result in many more projects of this nature, in the
long run, for some time to come they will constitute a relatively small share
of total Bank lending to Brazil.
18.       Institutional development and policy reform, designed inter alia to
help ensure that public savings are used economically and that an adequate



-7-
volume of savings is available for applications in the social sector, have
been a second major objective in Bank lending to Brazil. They play a partic-
ularly important role in our lending in the transportation sector and speci-
fically, the railway rehabilitation program which is now being appraised. The
strengthening of development finance institutions would be a major objective
if we move forward with the proposed program of lending for small- and medium-
sized industry. In agriculture, our lending for livestock development has
served to introduce modern methods of ranch management, within the framework
of a supervised credit program. In both industrial and agricultural credit
our lending is linked to the application of progressively more realistic rates
of interest. We also expect to lend to support agricultural research in the
Northeast and to strengthen the federal mechanism for coordinating and super-
vising agricultural research.
19.       A third objective in Bank lending to Brazil, especially in the power,
steel and highway sectors, is to help provide necessary long-term external
capital.  In this regard, the Bank seeks to play a complementary role to that
of other lenders, supplementing their resources in individual operations and
financing activities that they are unwilling to finance. Brazil has needed
and will continue to need a very large volume of medium- and long-term loan
capital inflows to sustain rapid growth and achieve its employment creation
and regional development objectives.
20.        A fourth lending objective for the Bank has been to help ease the
foreign exchange constraint on Brazilian development by supporting projects
designed to increase Brazil's export capacity and, where economic, to substi-
tute domestic production for imports. Support of Brazil's steel industry, for
example, is helping Brazil develop self-sufficiency in a commodity which can
be produced efficiently in Brazil owing to the country's bountiful supply of
high-grade iron ore and the scale of its internal markets.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
21.        Over the past two decades the percentage of Brazil's total popula-
tion living in urban areas increased from an estimated 36 to 56%.    So far,
however, few of the low-income migrants to urban areas have been given ade-
quate water supplies or are served by sewerage systems. It was estimated io
1970 that less than 60% of the urban population was provided with public water
services and less than 30% with public sewerage services. It is therefore no
coincidence that Brazil's population suffers a high incidence of water-borne
diseases, and the death rate among children under five years of age, due to
gastroenteric infections, is nearly 100 times that of the United States.
22.       The inadequacy of the water ar.d sewerage systems has been due pri-
marily to institutional problems and the method of financing used. Responsi-
bility for water and sewerage in Brazil has historically been entrusted to
municipalities, the level of government which has been the weakest in techni-
cal, organizational and financial capability. Since the municipalities were



- 8 -
unable to organize adequate water and sewerage services, the federal and
state governments assumed the responsibility for building and financing new
systems, generally with budget grants. Chronic shortages of budgetary re-
sources, however, made this method of financing inadequate as well. During the
last decade, the total amount invested in urban and rural sanitation by numer-
ous federal agencies and state and local governments is estimated roughly at
~'i700 mfllion.  Services have particularly lagged in poor and small urban com-
-unities which have lacked the financial resources to construct water and
s.cwerage systems.
23.       In 1971, the Government embarked on a bold new program to furnish
adequate water and sewerage services to its urban population. (For these pur-
poses "urban population" has been defined by the Government to mean that part
of the population living in communities of 500 or more.) Its goal is to serve
80% of the urban population with adequate water by 1980 and 50% with satis-
factory sewerage services by the same date through a financially viable and
self-perpetuating financing mechanism. The addii;ional population so served
will number 35 million and 27 million respectively. The program calls for
investments of US$2.4 billion in the sector by the end of the decade. It oper-
ates under the aegis of the financially well-endowed and highly respected
federally owned and controlled National Housing Bank (BNH) and is called
PLANASA, the acronym for the National Sanitation Plan. The massive PLANASA
program will be financed half by BNH and half by the individual State Revolv-
ing Funds for Sanitation (FAE). BNH's principal financial resources are the
deposits of certain social security funds. The FAE funds are obtained from
allocations of up to 5% of the states' annual revenues. In poorer states,
where 5% of the fiscal income is not sufficient to meet the state's 50% fin-
ancing commitment, BNH extends supplementary loans to the states.
241.      The PLANASA program focuses on statewide, rather than individual
c-ity water and sewerage needs.  In order to enter the program states must sign
agreements with the BNH which establish single statewide water and sewerage
companies, draw up statewide investment plans and provide for state guarantees
of BNH loans. Twenty of Brazil's twenty-two states have formally signed such
agreements and entered the program. The statewide system of project prepara-
tion and financing has two novel features that help achieve a more equitable
distribution of income:
a. Varying interest ratns. BNH funds are loaned to states at
interest rates on locns varying from 4% to the poorest states
in the northeast to 4% to the relatively more prosperous states
of the south and center of Brazil. Principal and interest of
loans are fully corrected for changes in the general price
index.
b. Statewide or regional tariffs. The PLANASA program requires
the establishment of progressive statewide or regional tariff
structures, which impose higher charges per unit of water con-
sumed for high volume users than for low volume users, thereby
favoring low-income groups. Under the PLANASA program the rate
for minimum consumption may not exceed 5% of the minimum wage



-9
(the minimum wage varies between US$40 and US$50 per month).
Such a tariff structure permits the generation of cash in
wealthier cities, which may then be made available to finance
projects in poorer and smaller communities.
25.       A further major advantage of the PLANASA system is that by central-
izing in state water supply companies responsibility for all sanitation proj-
ects within each state, PLANASA makes possible the centralizatioji of manage-
ment, programming, construction, operations and finances, thus iricreasirng the
efficient use of resources and maximizing the use of scarce trained manpower.
The PLANASA system also enables national design and engineering standards to
be developed under the sponsorship of a potentially strong and professionally
competent organization within the BNH.
26.       The Government's major goals for the sector are thus to establish
a viable national financing scheme which will serve the water and sanitation
needs of the majority of the urban population by the end of the decade, within
the framework of a mechanism that will equally serve rich and poor states,
communities and individuals, with the incidence of the financial burden fall-
ing more heavily on the rich than the poor.
27.       The proposed Minas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage project will
be the Bank's third loan in the water supply and sewerage sector in Brazil.
The first two loans were made in 1971 to improve the water supply aiad sewerage
services in and around the city of Sao Paulo, before the PLANASA program was
underway. Descriptions of the status of those projects are included in Annex II.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The Government of Brazil has requested a Bank loan to help finance
the first phase of the PLANASA water supply and sewerage program in the state
of Minas Gerais. The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited
Brazil in May and June 1973. A report, entitled "Appraisal of the Minas
Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project", No. '21a-BR, dated May 17, 1974,
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.   A loan and project
summary is presented in Annex III.   Negotiations took place in Rio de Janeiro
from April 16, 1974, to April 26, 1974.   The Borrower, BNH, was represented by
a team headed by Dr. Fabio Alvares, Coordinator of External Resources for BINI.
29.       Prior to agreeing to appraise the PLANASA program in Minas Gerais,
the Bank reviewed BNH's national water and sewerage program and expressed its
interest and preference for financing projects in Brazil's poorest states.
BNH stated that programs in the very poorest states had already begun and
therefore Bank financing for those states would not be necessary in the near
future. Bank financing to Minas Gerais is well justified. It is Brazil's
second most populous state. Of it-s 12 million people, more than half are
classified as urban and live in 72.? towns and cities of 500 or more inhabi-
tants. The urban areas of the state contain a cross-section of problems that
are typical of those found in Brazil as a whole. Some areas of Minas Gerais,
such as the portion in the "drought polygon" of the Northeast, are among the



- 10 -
poorest of Brazil. Other areas, such as Belo Horizonte, the capital, are
experiencing the economic growth and complex urban problems common to other
rapidly growing Brazilian urban centers. At present, only 147 of the urban
areas in the state are considered to be satisfactorily served with water and
84 with sewerage. The needs of the state are great, and the experience gained
in the water and sewerage program for Minas Gerais can be usefully applied to
other Brazilian states.
Project Description
30.        The components of the project are:
a.   the design and construction of improvements or extensions
to about 31 water supply and sewerage systems, including
intakes, wells, treatment plants, pumping stations, trans-
mission lines and house connections;
b.   management and engineering consulting services for the Minas
Gerais state water company, COMAG;
c.   a study of the economic and social impact of water charges in
Minas Gerais which will analyze the water usage habits of
consumers and determine the income elasticity of demand, thus
serving as a basis for revising the state water and sewerage
tariff structure; and
d.'  a statewide sewerage investment study which will estimate
capital requirements and determine priorities for proposed
sewerage projects within the state.
Loan funds will only be used to finance the project components in subparagraph
"a". The components in subparagraphs "b", "c" and "d" will be financed by
COMAG and the state.
31.      fThe first stage (1974-1976) of the PIANASA program in Minas Gerais
which the proposed loan would help finance will provide or improve water supply
systems to cities and towns having an aggregate population of 2.7 million. It
is estimated that only 40% of the persons in those places currently receive
satisfactory continuous water services. The project will provide or improve
services for 1.9 million persons by 1980. If satisfactory sewerage projects
are prepared while the loan proceeds are being committed, the loan may also
finance sewerage projects. The subsequent second phase of the Minas Gerais
PLANASA program will complete the provision of adequate water services to
80% and adequate sewerage services to 50% of the state urban population by
1980.
32.       The subprojects selected for the first stage of the Minas Gerais
PLANASA program are located in communities within the state that have already
transferred their water and sewerage systems to COMAG and where relatively
profitable op3rations can be expected. It is the PLANASA method to schedule
the construction of the more profitable water and sewerage subprojects first,
so that they can help finance less profitable subprojects that will be subse-
quently included in the program. As a result, the first stage of the Minas
Gerais water and sewerage program places heavy emphasis (approximately 60% of



- 11 -
project resources) on completing water distribution systems in the heavily
populated and industrialized areas in and around the capital city of Belo
Horizonte, where large investments in water supply, not yet fully utilized,
have already been made. Bank staff have appraised only three of the sub-
projects to be included in the program. The Bank will be given the
opportunity to review for financing under the loan all subsequent subprojects
(see Section 3.07 of the draft Loan Agreement). During the execution of the
project, new subprojects may be substituted for those that have been prelimi-
narily identified for inclusion in the first stage PLANASA program, in case
any of the latter turn out to be technically, financially or economically
unacceptable. The possibility of substitution may lead to th-e number of
projects financed being more or less than 31.
33.       All subprojects included in the program will be appraised by COMAG
and reviewed and approved by BNH according to technical, economic and finan-
cial guidelines which have been reviewed with the Bank (see Sections 3.03
and 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). The subproject process begins with
COMAG making a preinvestment study and evaluating various alternatives. The
preinvestment study must be accepted by BNH before COMAG prepares the project
final design. After the design has been approved by BNH and submitted to the
Bank, and providing there has bean no objection raised by the Bank, the BNH
and FAE loans for the subproject will be signed. The Bank will make a detailed
review of all subprojects involving investment of US$1.5 million or more and
all subprojects whose construction costs per consumer served exceed by 20% or
more the average for the state, or for which the expected incremental financial
rate of return is below 10%. Subprojects having an incremental financial
rate of return below zero will not be financed by the Bank.   Subprojects with
financial rates of return as low as zero percent may be acceptable because the
water tariff paid by the consumer reflects only part of the benefits provided
by the water supply. In particular it reflects only part of the health and
environmental benefits of a safe water supply. As a consequence, a financial
rate of return calculation based on revenues from the sale of water under-
states the economic rate of return, particularly in communities of low-income
population where the tariff may have to he kept low because of the consumers'
limited capacity to pay. Projects with rates of return between zero and 10%
or with per capita construction costs 20% higher than the average will be
financed by the Bank only if a convincing case is made that they will brinL:
substantial social and economic benefits.
34.       In the past, Bank financing of water and sewerage projects   has been
directec to individual projects previously' appraised by the Bank. The proposed
project represents a significant departure from thisprocedure, since the Bank
has only appraised three of the thirty-one subprojects to be included in the pro-
gram and will conduct a detailed review of only those projects that fall within
criteria described in the preceding paragraph. Under these circumstances, the
Bank will probably conduct a detailed review of no more than 40% of the sub-
projects included in the program. The Bank will thus place great reliance on
the capacity of BNH and COMAG to prepare and evaluate projects properly. This
approach represents the most practical method of extending Bank assistance to a
water and sewerage investment program consisting of many separate projects in a
large number of cities and towns of varying size. Accordingly, the institution-
building aspects of the loan are important. Substantial Bank staff time will be
allocated for supervision of the project, to help the BNH and COMAG to develop
sound methods of project evaluation, implementation and control.



- 12 -
Project Rate of Return
35.       A financial rate of return for the project as a whole has not beell
computed because all of the proposed subprojects have not yet been appraised,
and subprojects may be added or deleted during project implementation. As
indicated in paragraph 3h, however, all subprojects will have to meet cri-
teria designed to ensure that they have acceptable social and economic
benefits.
Tariffs
36.       COMAG will charge tariffs sufficient to cover operating costs,
debt service requirements, working capital needs and a small amount, one
percent of gross fixed assets, for miscellaneous investment needs (see Section
4.09 of the draft Loan Agreement). In practice, this should result in a
financial return of not less than 6 percent on COMAG's gross fixed assets in
operation after the project is completed, rising to 8 percent in 1980. ITe
PLANASA program reouires statewide progressive tariffs with minimum tariffs
not to exceed 5 percent of the minimum wage. Industrial and commercial con-
sumers will be charged not less than the marginal cost of serving them. The
tariff structure will be revised and improved after completion of a "global
feasibility study" of the state water and sewerage investment program and the
project financed study of the economic and social impact of water use charges.
The global feasibility study is in preparation. It will provide information
on the total estimated cost of the water and sewerage investment, the average
cubic meter cost of water and the sequencing of the remaining subprojects in
the program.   The study of the social and economic impact of water use
charges will determine the water charges that can be absorbed by consumers.
Cost and Financing
37.       Project costs (which are summarized in Annex III) are estimated at
the equivalent of US$92.0 million, including 14 percent for physical contin-
gencies and 10 percent for price escalation. The latter contingency assumes
that the government will continue its "crawling peg" policy of progressively
devaluing the cruzeiro in line with inflation, thus limiting the impact of
increaseE in domestic prices on project costs expressed in terms of forei.-n
currency. Only about US$6.7 million of total project costs or 7.0 percent-
represents foreign exchange costs.   The Bank loan of US$36 million (39 percen!.
of total project costs) will thus be used to meet about US$29.7 million of
local expenditures, which (as noted in paragraph 10 above) is justified l,v
the fact that external capital flows required to support 13razil's higlh rate cf
economic growth exceed the capital goods import needs of 3raz-ilian public invc-:t-
ment projects.
38.       The Bank loan will be made to BNII to finance the CO-AG program in
Minas Gerais.  The loan will cover 80 percent of BNH's financing contribution
to the CO0MAG program.  The funds will be channelled to COMAG in loans of
18-1/2 to 21 years, including grace periods of 6 to 36 months depending on
the subproject to be financed.   The term of the Bank loan will be 23 -ears,
thus allowing up to 4-1/2 years for commitment and disbursement of sub-loans.



- 13 -
Interest on subloans will be 6 percent, with interest and principal adjusted
annually in accordance with the general price index, prepared by the Getulio
Vargas Foundation, the same index used for adjustment of Treasury bills.
With such indexing, recovery will be more than sufficient to mobilize the
domestic resources necessary for servicing the Bank loan, assuming a conti-
nuation of present economic trends. BNII and Bank funds will supply approxi-
mately 50 percent of COMAG's financial needs. The remaining 50 percent will
be financed by loans from the state revolving fund for sanitation workcs
with maturities and monetary correction identical to the loans from BNH,
but at an interest rate of 4.5 percent. M4anagement consulting services and
economic and sewerage investment studies for COMAG will be financed by COMAG
and the State of Minas Gerais.
Procurement and Disbursement
39       B3NH and COI4AG will follow the Bank's guidelines for procurement of
all goods and services under the project. All goods and services will be pro-
cured after international competitive bidding with Brazilian suppliers of
equipment and materials receiving a margin of preference of 1' percent. Due
to the large number of contracts expected (:nore than 100 for the period
1974-76), Bank review prior to awarding contracts will be limited to contracts
above US$700,000 for equipment and US$1,200,000 for civil work`s-  Since virtuallv
all the equipment and materials for the project are manufactured in Brazil
and available at competitive prices, all supply contracts are expected to be
won by local suppliers. The civil works contracts are small to meditum sized
and are expected to be won by local contractors.  Contracts for er'uipment
and civil works will not be eligible for retroactive financing. However
the Bank will reimburse BN{H for expenditures made after the date of the Loan
Agreement on contracts signed after June 1, 1973, provided the Bank's procure-
ment guidelines had been followed. An estimated schedule of disbursements is
presented in Annex III.
Organization, Management and Financial Status of the Borrower (BNH)
40.       BNH operates under the Ministry of the Interior, but is adminisLra--
tively and financially independent.  Its principal activity is to finance
national housing and sanitation programs.  A Board of Directors and an fec -
tive Committee administer BNH. The department responsible for water suppl-,
and sewerage activities is headed by a Director and is composed of three
divisions -- Analysis and Programming, Technical Control and Finance. The
department is staffed by dedicated and highly zompetent young engineers and
economists who have succeeded in satisfactorily managing previous BIHI water
supply and sewerage programs and launching the PLANASA program.   Its capacity
will be severely taxed as the enormous PLANASA program moves into full
operation. BNH regards the proposed association with the Bank as an oppor-
tunity to obtain advice and assistance in managing water supply and sewerage
lending programs.  BNH has agreed to consider in consultation with the Bank
measures that may be necessary to improve the management of its lending in
this area (see Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). These measures
include engaging management consultants, establishing management and proce-
dures manuals, establishing criteria for subproject appraisal and adopting
technical standards for design and construction.



- 1 4 -
4l.       During the period 1969-1973 BNTl's total assets have increased four
times from approximately US$1 billion to US$Lt billion. BINH's total liabilitie-
represented five times its equity as of December 1973. In fiscal year 1973,
I3NH's net return on net worth was 25 percent and on total assets 4 percent.
Long-term prospects appear satisfactory and enough sources of funds (mainly
fr-om the deposit of social security funds and repayments and income from
previous loans and investments) are foreseen to cover debt services and
future reauirements for funds.   BNH disbursements to the water supply and
sewerage sector in 1973 (US$140 million equivalent) represented 11 percent
of total BNH disbursements (US$1.3 billion eauivalent) made dcuring the year.
Organization, Management and Financial Status of the Beneficiary (COMAG)
42.       COI4AG, the Minas Gerais state water company, was establishled in
1963 to finance, build, operate and administer water and sewerage systems
throughout the state. The state owns a majority of COMIAG's common stoc.:,
with the balance held by federal entities and municipalities. The companry
is administered by a Board of Directors and an Executive Committee elect-ed
by the shareholders. COMAG carries full responsibility for implementing
the PLANASA program in the state.   It has recently absorbed the Belo Horizonts.
IIunicipal Department of Water and Sewerage (DE1-AB), and is also negotiating
with other municipalities in Minas Gerais for the transfer, throughl conces-
sion contracts, of their sanitation systems to CO0AG. COIMAG's new responsi-
bilities represent an important change in its operations. Before entering the
PIANASA program, COMAG had responsibilit;r only for 22 of the state's medium-
and small-sized city operations. It now has concession contracts to operate
70 water and sewerage systems within the state and contemplates assuming
responsibility for all of the state's 722 urban operations.    To cope witl
its greatly increased workload COMAG has designed a new organizational
structure with a central office in Belo Horizonte and eight a(dinistrative
regions. CO0AG's top management is well aware of the company's limited
experience and views the proposed association with the Bank as an opportunit-
to obtain advice and assistance from the Bank in order to improve company
operations.
43.       COMAG has agreed to take necessary steps to build up its own tech-
nical capabilities in analZzing subprojects and to establish, in consultation
with the Bank, new management and administrative procedures, manuals and con-
trols (see Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). The training of 6,000
COMAG employees will be undertaken as part of the BNH-sponsored national
water supply and sewerage training program. CO0MAG will also engage consultant:;
to design a long-range planning and information s-yrstem and to help in project
preparation, construction and supervision, operation and maintenance.
4L.       The financial performance of COM4AG and DEIMAE prior to 1973 was good.
In 1972 COMAG realized a rate of return on net fixed assets of 8 percent and
DEM4AE 17 percent. Consolidated assets of the two companies amonunted to about
US$48 million equivalent. COA1AG has a debt-equity ratio of 1:2, which is
satisfactory. However, the short-term financial position of the company
deteriorated in 1973, mainly because a financial contribution of thf- munici-
pality of Belo Horizonte did not materialize.   This caused a depletion of



- 15 -
accumulated cash surplus and delays in liquidating accounts payable. Cer-
tain short-term measures have already been taken to solve these current cash
problems. COMAG has now arranged for satisfactory measures to strengthen its
cash position, by restructuring tariffs which will result in increased
revenues, providing for additional equity and the refinancing on a long-
term basis of some short-term debt.
Environmental Effects
h5.       The Government has given priority in this project to water supply
works.  Sewerage services will receive priority in the next phase of the pro-
gram beginning in 1975. Over the short term, therefore, pollution of surface
waters in Minas Gerais can be expected to increase, but where such pollution
endangers sources of public water supply, the project permits the financing
of the necessary sewerage works. To facilitate the second phase of the proj-
ect and sewerage investment, the project provides financing for a statewide
investment study.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
l1f.      The draft Loan Agreement between Banco Nacional da Habitacao, the
Companhia Mineira de Aquas e Esgotos, the State of Minas Gerais and the Bank,
the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative Republic of Brazil and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section h
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approv-
ing the proposed loan are being diztributed to the Eaecutive Directors sepa-
rately. Features of the draft Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 32, 33, 36, 40 and 43.
47.       In the past, it has been customary in Brazil for the Bank to have
separate ,roject Agreemen-ts with the executing agency and financing agency,
wh!dich1, in the present loan, would be COMAG and the sta-e.  In deference,
}owever, to the renuest of BNIH that the Bank not establish contractual rela-
tionships with COIAG and the state to which BNH was not a party, Project
A.lreements will not be utilized and the draft Loan Agreement sets forth not
only- t"he rights and obligations of BNH but also the rights and obligations
of COIIG and the state. 13NH, COMAG and the state will all be signatories
to the Loan Agreement.
8.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Banc.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
(As of March 31, 1974)
There are now 31 effective Bank loans under disbursement:
Loan No.
403/474   Estreito Hydroelectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million
loans of February 26, 1965 and December 19, 1966; Closing
Date: June 30, 1974. The project was completed in December
T1973. quipment costs were substantially below estimates,
so that disbursements proceeded more slowly than forecast.
The original closing date was April 1, 1971.
404       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$25 million loan of
February 27, 1965; Closing Date: December 31, 1974. The
project was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about
18 months) except for the installation of equipment for an
associated transmission line. Ordering and the proposed
delivery of this equipment have been delayed, and the loan
is now expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 1974,
five years after the initial closing date.   The original
closing date was December 31, 1969, postponed to December 31,
1971, February 29, 1972, and further postponed to December 31,
1973.
442       Jaguara Hydroelectric Project:   USp49 million loan of March 15,
1T B; Closing Date: December 31, 1974. All the generators were
commissioned during 1971 and the project has been completed.
Disbursements will extend up to the end of 1974 primarily ibecause
equipment originally defective necessitated a postponement of the
last payments to suppliers. The original closing date was
April 30, 1971, postponed to April 3(0, 1973.
477       Power Distribution Project:   US$41 million loan of Decembe:r 19,
1966; Closing Date: December 31, 1973. This power distribution
project had a slow start but after administrative reorganization
in 1Q70 it gained momentum. Procurement for the project has been
completed.  Most of the overhead distribution system has been
completed, as has construction work on transmission lines, sub-
stations and underground distribution systems. The loan i3 almost
fully disbursed.  The original closing date was December 31, 1970,
postponed to December 31, 1973.
j   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report a;iy prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weakness in project execution.

Loan No.
516       Livestock Project: US$L40 million loan of September 23, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974. After initial delays due to
marketing and organizational difficulties, the livestock credit
program has been proceeding at a satisfactory rate. Some prob-
lems arose in early 1972 on the calculation of interest on
indexed principal amounts during the grace period but these have
now been settled. Although loan funds have now been completely
committed, US$2.9 million remains to be disbursed. The original
Closing Date was December 31, 1973.
565       Porto ColombiHydroelectric Project; US$22.3 million loan of
October 23, 196; Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Changes in the
project layout and design have increased substantially the local
cost, which will be covered by ELETROBRAS, without, however,
significantly affecting the economic justification for the project.
Construction work is on schedule and the last unit was placed in
service in early 1974.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project: US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1960; Closing Date: January 31, 1975. The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
This problem and price escalation greater than estimated in-
creased powerhouse construction cost by 72%, but, as the original
cost was very low, the resulting cost per kW of generating capacity
is still attractive. No financial difficulty is expected for the
company as a result of the overruns. The project is now two-
thirds completed and the first generating unit is expected to be
in operation in April 1974.
567       First Highway Construction Project: US$26 million loan of
October 23, 1960; Closing Date: March 31, 1973. The construc-
tion works under this project are completed, as are disbursements
o'n all original project items. Overall quality of work was
satisfactory. The closing date for the loan was postponed from
December 31, 1972, the original date, to March 31, 1973. The
Government proposed several related additions to the project which
would utilize the unexpended loan balance of about US$3.2 million.
The Bank requested further information on the additions, and the
revised proposals are now under consideration in the Bank. If the
proposals are accepted by the Bank the Closing Date will be
postponed.
656       Industry: US$25 million loan of February 16, 1970 to Banco do
Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Closing Date:   June 30, 1975. The loan
has been fully committed. The Terminal Date for submission of
subprojects, originally June 30, 1972 and postponed to June 30,
1973, was postponed a ,econd time to June 30, 1974 to give BNB an
opportunity to submit subprojects in an advanced stage of prepara-
tion. Slow utilization of the loan was due mainly to BNB's
unusually burdensome security conditions on subloans and its



ANNEX I I

Loan No.
emphasis on larger-scale projects, for which financing from other
than llorld Bank funds has been available.
-76       Second Highway Construction Project:   US$100 million loan of
May 25, 1970; Closing Date:   July 31, 1974.  Construction works
are underway and the overall quality of construction and super-
vision is satisfactory. There have, hoTwever, been substantial
cost increases on some contracts, so that the total construction
cost of the project is now estimated to be above the appraisal
estimate, excluding contingencies, but still iTthin the appraisal
estimate including contingencies. The execution of some contracts
has been seriously delayed by inclement weather conditions and
project changes, and it is expected that the Closing Date for the
loan will have to be postponed intil June 30, 1975.   Disbursements
under the loan are behind the appraisal schedule, due to a late
start of the project, but have improved during the last year.
677       Marimbondo Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of May 25,
1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. Construction work is proceeding
on schedule. The cost of increased excavation and concrete work
resulting from poor rock foundation is expected to be mostly off-
set by a reduction in earth fill work. A US$26 million overrun,
caused by equipment prices higher than estimated and additional
transmission facilities, was covered by a loan from a commercial
bank, but did not significantly affect the economic justification
for the project.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of April 5.
1971; Closing Date: May 31, 1977. The construction of the Salto
Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satisfactorily and no
cost overrun is foreseen at this time. The construction of the
transmission system -- delayed to allow a reexamination of
ELETROSUL's market in light of reviseO! demand projections in the
South of Brazil, possible new power sales in the Southeast region
and the addition of heretofore unscheduled generating capacity --
is now about to proceed as originally defined.
755       Education Project:  US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975. Progress on the construction and equip-
ment of the project schools is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Construction of six schools has been initiated, bids for construc-
tion of another five are underway, and design work for the remaining
five has been started. Although the project implementation is
behind the original schedule due to initial delays, disbursements
under the loan are expected to be completed by the Closing Date.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979. Because of other investments in the Port of
Santos and an increase in the cost estimate of the Bank-financed
project there, the execution of the Bank-financed project has been
delayed and its scope has been reviewed. The Bank and the Borrower



ANNEX II

Loan No.
have now agreed to postpone construction of part of the container
terminal, exclude from the project the corn storage silo, simplify
the rail access to the left bank of the project, and reallocate
the remaining loan amount to a larger dredger and more extensive
consultants' services and training. The Closing Date of the Loan
has been postponed from September 30, 1976 to June 30, 1979, in
accordance with the new schedule for completion of the project.
WJith the assistance of management consultants, satisfactory pro-
gress has been made in improving port operations in Santos.
However, a satisfactory plan for the reorganization of the National
Department of Ports and Navigable Waterways has not yet been
completed, but is expected to be ready by mid-1974.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:   US$22 million loan of June 21,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The project suffered initial
delays caused by the State of Sgo Paulo not furnishing the re-
quired counterpart funds. The required funds are now included in
the state budget. The Government has consolidated all the water
and sewerage companies in the state into a single company. A new
agreement must therefore be negotiated with the new company. The
new company has been tardy in providing the Bank the necessary
information to conduct negotiations.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:   US$15 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The original project
design included the pumping of untreated sewage into an area
reservoir representing a major source of water and serving as an
important recreational facility for the Sao Paulo area. Earlier
studies had shown that the reservoir could absorb the organic
pollution without damage for some time. Area residents, however,
objected to this solution and subsequent technical reviewr questioned
the initial judgment that no ecological harm would be caused. As
a result, the original design has been modified to exclude the
discharge of raw sewage and include a treatment facility. Bidding
procedures are in progress for other portions of the project. in
light of the lower costs associated with the above solution, the
loan amount has been reduced to US$12 million. The Government has
consolidated all the water and sewerage companies in the state
into a single company. A new agreement must therefore be negotiated
with the new company. The new compaxy has been tardy in providing
the Bank the necessary information tc conduct negotiations.
786       Railway Project - MBR:   US$46 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975. A delay of about six months
occurred in awarding the contracts for constructing the new
railway link for the MBR iron ore mine due to engineering prob-
lems encountered and inadequate project management by the Federal
Railways. Work on site has proceeded rapidly during 1973 and
much of the lost time was regained. New ore traffic commenced
on July 1, 1973.

Loan Mo.
787       MBB Iron Ore Project:  US$50 million loan of August 25, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The estimated cost of the
project has increased due to major design changes for the port
terminal and several investment additions to the project.
Target completion dates at the mine and terminal were met and
the first ship left port on November 26, 19Y3, with 150,000
tons of Aguas Claras Ore.
797       CSN Steel Expansion Project:  US$64.5 million loan of February 8,
1972; Closing Date: July 1, 1975. The Project is proceeding
according to schedule.
812       USIMINAS Steel Expansion Projeot: US$63 million loan of April 11,
1972; Closing Date:  June 1, 1976. The project is proceed3ing
according to schedule.
813       Third Highway Construction Project:  US$89 million loan of
April 11, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 197 . Construction works
are nearly two-thirds completed, but are slightly behind schedule;
the estimated total contract cost is slightly above the appraisal
estimate. The feasibility studies and detailed engineering
financed under the loan were started later than planned, but are
now almost completed at a cost substantially below the appraisal
estimate. Disbursements are lagging behind the appraisal fore-
cast, but have improved during the last half year and are now
expected to be completed by the original Closing Date of the
loan (June 30, 1976).
828       COSIPA Steel Expansion Project:  US$64.5 million loan of
June 14, 1972;. Closing Date: January 15, 1977. The project
is proceeding according to schedule.
829       Sao Simao Hydroelectric Project:  US$60 million loan of June 14,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1979. The contract for the
civil works was awarded to an Italian-Brazilian consortium in
May 1973, and the project is proceeding according to schedule.
853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:  US$6.'7 million loan of
July 24, 1972; Closing Date: December 1, 1978. COLONE has
prepared revised farm development plans whose credit component,
to be financed by public financial institutions, will be sig-
nificantly higher than originally estimated, although still low
in comparison to other settlement projects. Physical infra-
structure is likely to be completed in 1974, and it is
anticipated that the project will be completed in 1978 as
envisaged.
854       Fourth Highway Construction Project:  US$51 million loan of
August 14, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976. Construction
works are 37N completed and behind schedule; the estimated total
contract cost is slightly below the ,ppraisal estimate.

Loan No.
857       Grain Storage Project:   US$30 million loan of September 27,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1979. After some initial
difficulties with the appraisal of subpro,jects, the project is
now well underway. Daring the first year of operation, 90
subprojects (totaling US$11 million) were approved and another
94 (totaling US$15 million) are in the pipeline.
868       Interim Second Livestock Project: US$25 million loan of
December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977. The project
is proceeding according to schedule and will be fully committed
by the end of 1974.
887       Power Distribution Project:   US$20 million loan of April 16,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976. The project is proceeding
according to schedule.
923       Itumbiara Hydroelectric Project: US$125 million loan of
August 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1982. Invitations
to tender have been issued and the project is proceeding
according to schedule.
924       Agro-Industries Credit Project:   US$54 million loan of August 1
1973: Closing Date: December 31, 1978. The loan became
effective on March 11, 1974. The demand for credit is strong
and the participating banks are expected to commit project funds
by October 1975.
