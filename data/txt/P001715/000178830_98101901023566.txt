RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
CREDITS AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Government of Mali
Beneficiary:          Direction Nationale de l'Hydraulique et de l'Energie
(DNHE), State Ministry of Industry and Equipment
Amount:               SDR 4.4 million (US$4.6 million equivalent) from IDA
SDR 6.0 million (US$6.3 million equivalent) from the IDA
Special Fund
Terms:                Standard
Project               The proposed project would assist the Government to
Description:          improve living and sanitary conditions in the project
area in Western Mali. About 230 villages would be
beneficiaries of boreholes equipped with handpumps. The
project would stress villagers' direct participation from
siting of boreholes through construction of waterpoints
to operation and maintenance. Assumption by villagers of
responsibilities for maintenance would be a key
ingredient to the success of the project. The project
would strengthen Government's capability to identify,
prepare and manage this type of project. The project
includes: (a) provision of about 340 productive
boreholes in Western Mali, (b) supply and installation of
handpumps and necessary spare parts, (c) technical
assistance, consultancy services and a training program,
and (d) studies to prepare for a follow-up project.
Benefits and Risks:  The main benefits of the project would be the increased
availability of safe drinking water to the population to
satisfy their basic water needs all year round including
the dry season. The main risks pertain to the sustained
maintenance of boreholes and handpumps. To minimize
these risks the project would emphasize village promotion
and training activities.

I. THE RURAL WATER SUPPLY SUB-SECTOR
1.01     General country background information and relevant Urban Water Sup-
ply Sector information are contained in the President's RepDrt No. P-2954-MLI
dated June 16, 1982, and in the Staff Appraisal Report No. 3227-MLI dated June
10, 1982 (Power/Water Project), and are limited to a strict minimum here.
1.02     Mali's 7.2 million people are among the world's least privileged,
surviving on an annual per capita income of US$190. Eighty-seven percent of
the population lives in rural areas and derives an even lower annual per
capita income of US$100 from subsistence agriculture and nomadic livestock
enterprises. Administratively, the country is divided into seven regions.
The regions are divided into 46 administrative districts (called "cercles"),
which are in turn subdivided into 281 subdistricts (called "arrondissements")
each made up of 25-40 villages and hamlets. The districts, administered by
commanding officers, are the nuclei of major rural Government services. The
subdistrict is the basic administrative unit, and its center usually has a
school and dispensary. Villages are headed by chiefs and elected village
councils. The larger villages often maintain a rural maternity. Only 15% of
the population is literate; many rural villages do not even have one literate
person notwithstanding the Government's attempts to promote functional liter-
acy. The crude death rate is high at 21 per 1,000, largely attributable to
mortality in the 1-4 age group. Social pressures to replace lost children
result in high fertility, a high crude birth rate of 50 per 1,000 and a conse-
quent rate of population growth of 2.7% per year. Average life expectancy at
birth is 43 years; in Western Mali it is 33 years--about the lowest in the
world.
The Current Sub-sector Situation
1.03     The principal source of water supply in the rural areas in Mali is
groundwater which is generally found in small and discontinuous aquifers, and
is generally of good quality and in sufficient quantity to satisfy the needs
of individual villages. Annual rainfall ranges from 250 mm to 1,300 mm, and
is quite unevenly distributed.  In the Sahelian zone, it is common to have a
dry season of close to 9 months, during which period the traditional dug wells
tend to dry up, forcing the villagers to rely on the few remaining contami-
nated surface sources (ponds, and small rivers), which often involve distances
of several kilometers.
1.04     Overall, the rural population is highly dispersed, with more than 80
percent of the approximately 10,000 villages counting less than 600
residents. About 25% of the villages, or only about 18% of the entire rural
population, have access to safe water from modern water points, while more
than 7,000 villages still have to rely on contaminated water from the above
mentioned traditional sources. Water consumption estimates are difficult to
establish; it is likely that per capita consumption in the rural areas of Mali
is at the same level as in the general Sahelian context, that is, between
15-30 liters per capita per day (lcd).



-2-
Sub-sector Organization
1 .0     The main sub-sectoral institution is the Direction Nationale de
l'Hvdraulique et de l'Energie (DNHE' under the State Minister in charge of
7ndustrv and Equipment, which is responsible for establishing sector policies,
investment programs, preparation and execution as well as supervision of rural
water supply (RWS> projects.  A more detailed discussion on DNHE is contained
in Chapter III.
1.06     A second department within the Ministry is the Direction Nationale de
l'Operation Puits, (OP). In the early to mid-70s, at a time when borehole
drilling programs were not so common, this entity was responsible for identi-
fication, preparation and execution of large diameter dug well projects. The
results were rather disappointing, with OP constructing only 120 wells in four
years. OP's activities came to a standstill, as external donor funds were
progressively directed away from that department, and also as the Government
perceived the need to reorganize it. Under a new management, the department
has restarted in 1981 as the Government executing agency for open well con-
struction.  This department which is not at all involved in sector policy
aspects, is now active in about 17 scattered geographical areas, with a
staffing of around 350.  OP's new programs are financed by the African
Development Bank (AfDB), and by several donors under RWS components of rural
development projects.
1.07     From the mid 1970s, when borehole programs started following the
drought, investment programs in the order of US$5.5 million per annum have
been executed, resulting in approximately 1,600 productive boreholes by mid-
1982. The RWS sub-sector has been developed almost exclusively with external
assistance both as RWS projects and as part of rural development projects.
The major programs have been financed by UNDP/UNICEF, HELVETAS (Switzerland),
OCCE (France), SADF (Saudi-Arabia), JICA (Japan) and various non-governmental
agencies. Each donor agency, in principle, was assigned a different geograph-
ical area, and individual executing mechanisms under the supervision of DNHE
were set-up.
1.08     A hiatus exists in the relations between DNHE and OP in as much as
both are Directorates on the same governmental hierarchy level; thus, DNHE has
no control or influence on the activities of OP, whereas DNHE is meant to be
the responsible sector organization.
1.09     In terms of available well drilling equipment, there are presently
about a dozen rigs in Mali, which are all utilized under the different pro-
grams. These represent collectively a potential of approximately 1,100 bore-
holes per annum or more likely around 700 actual drillings because of less
than optimum use of rigs. This would translate into about 420 new productive
boreholes, assuming a 60% success rate for the country as a whole. Adding the
number of new open wells (100 per annum), about 500 new water points could be
constructed each year. At this pace, a full coverage of the RWS needs could
only be achieved in about twenty years.



- 3 -
1.10     New programs under preparation would increase the drilling activities
to about 1,000 boreholes per annum. Investments in the order of an estimated
US$150 million (in 1982 prices) over the next 7-8 years would be required to
accelerate the drilling programs to achieve the International Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Decade goals of supplying water to the entire rural
population. It would appear more realistic to expect meeting these goals with
a delay of at least 5 years.
RWS Sub-sector Issues
1.11     Throughout its recent development, the principal issues the sub-
sector faced can be summarized as follows:
(i) lack of rational medium and long-term planning in order to
establish a coherent overall sector development stragegy;
(ii) lack of organizational discipline and coordination between
DNHE and OP;
(iii)  inadequacy of budget provisions for planning, construction and
supervision, and poor provisions for maintenance;
(iv) shortage of qualified national technical personnel;
(v) insufficient experience in designing RWS projects demonstrated
by (1) an absence of promotional campaigns to encourage active
village participation including contribution to construction,
decisions as to technical and financial aspects of investments
and maintenance, and (2) absence of cross-sectoral linkages
with health and general development services.
Sub-sector Policies
1.12     The lessons from past and ongoing projects have not gone unnoticed.
DNHE, in view of its increasing activities in the RWS sub-sector, has started to
cope with the above issues and adopted the following new policy orientation:
(i) Regionalization of programs by limiting the zone of action for
each drilling unit in order to reduce the cost per well. This
policy has succeeded and resulted in almost doubling the
output of the UNDP/UNICEF projects;
(ii) Financial participation by villagers for both purchase and
maintenance of handpumps to promote the ownership concept,
thus encouraging the population to actively assume maintenance
responsibilities of their own investments. This policy
responds to the financial issue (para. 1.11 (iii) and (v)).
Very positive results are being gained under the ongoing 3
major RWS projects 1/;
I/   UNDP, Mali Aqua Viva, Helvetas.



-4-
(iii)  Increased importance of training at the village level to
achieve self-sufficiency in maintenance by the villages in the
RWS sub-sector;
(iv) Decentralization of DNHE's RWS project management and improved
coordination of programs to ensure flexibility of execution
and enhance coherent and standardized approaches to sector and
project issues;
(v)  Closer linkage of water and health aspects in the design and
implementation of RWS projects to maximize the synergistic
effects.
These policies deserve full support by IDA, more so as they reflect the state
of the art of the RWS situation in the Sahelian countries.
Bank Group Lending
1.13     The RWS sub-sector reflects the situation of "relatively plentiful
external assistance". There is no shortage of external aid in the development
of rural groundwater sources per se. Rather IDA's lending strategy in the
rural sub-sector will focus on channeling all assistance and efforts according
to a national strategy and institution building through identification and
promotion of the appropriate organizational framework improvements in project
planning, execution and subsequent operations and support of sub-sector poli-
cies, in particular with respect to technical design and beneficiaries' par-
ticipation.
1.14     The Project has reflected this approach from the preparatory stage
onwards, as this represents the first RWS project in Mali to be prepared in
such detail by DNHE. IDA's first free standing RWS project for Mali would
provide an excellent opportunity to further the mutual understanding between
the Bank and the Borrower, particularly in view of future sector develop-
ment. The Project could act as a catalyst to coordinate with other donors and
channel all external and national resources towards a common goal within the
national strategy, and thus obtain optimum results and benefits.
II. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY
2.01     The borrower will be the Government of Mali, and DNHE under the
State-Minister in charge of Industry and Equipment will be the executing
agency for the proposed Project.
DNHE - Staffing and Organization
2.02     DNHE is the Government department responsible for both urban and
rural water supply and sanitation. The Organization Chart is shown in
Annex 2. Within DNHE, the Groundwater Division is responsible for planning
and execution of all RWS projects. By the end of 1981, DNHE's personnel



- 5 -
numbered 145, but had increased to around 240 by the end of 1982. The major
increase was in the technicians and daily labour categories, as DNHE, as is
the case with other Government Departments, is held to accept annually its
quota of fresh graduates from schools in the absence of other employment
opportunities.
2.03     As of end 1981, about 40 persons were assigned to the Groundwater
Division of which 18 were engineers, supported by 2 Technical Assistance
staff, financed by France and Germany respectively. This division was origi-
nally set-up in 1974/75 as the counterpart agency under a UNDP-RWS project,
and thus, the various sections of the Division were geared mainly towards the
needs of that project. As a number of new RWS programs financed by various
external donors sprung to life, the quite natural response was to add per-
sonnel within the existing organizational framework.
2.04     Under the UNDP project, DNHE has been the implementing agency, con-
structing the wells by force account. With other bilaterally financed pro-
grams, the work is mostly carried out by special expatriate project teams
having their own equipment with some participation from DNHE. The array of
donors supplying different equipment has not been conducive to standardization
of equipment in Mali. Furthermore, given the scarcity of qualified local
personnel, DNHE has effectively spread itself out too thinly over the entire
sub-sector with the result that it has been employing more personnel with less
and less work experience, and with only marginal productivity in the absence
of a coordinated training program. The Groundwater Division has now plunged
into a situation where it is neither fully prepared to plan and prepare RWS
projects nor has the efficient tools to implement them.
2.05     DNHE itself is highly aware of the manifold sub-sectoral issues with
long term implications including institutional, technical, legal, financial
and manpower aspects. It has been agreed to carry out an institutional/sector
development planning study in parallel to the further processing and implemen-
tation of the Project, with the start-up to be financed under the PPF. This
study will delineate the most appropriate institutional framework and develop-
ment strategy for the sub-sector; it will draw upon the conclusions and
recommendations of a recently prepared sector study financed by FAC and FED.
2.06     In line with Government's decision to actively promote an existing
situation, i.e. the successfully implemented concept of decentralized manage-
ment of individual RWS programs, the Project will be managed by a DNHE Field
Team reinforced by technical assistance. The professional development of the
DNHE Field Team will be carefully monitored, and assessed against the proba-
bilities of future investment activities in the same general region (First
Administrative Region) and thus the groundwork laid for further developing the
DNHE outpost into a more full fledged regional office. For more details on
project management, see paras. 4.09 and 4.10.



III. THE PROJECT AREA
Origin of Selection of the District of Kita as the Main Project Area
3.01     The selection of the proposed Project area was determined on the
basis of an identification mission in early 1980 to respond to a request by                    4
the Government of Mali for IDA participation in both the RWS and Rural Health
sectors. Selection of the district of Kita as the main zone was based on
logistical considerations, such as accessibility of the terrain during the dry
season, expected successful drilling rates, and related cost considerations.
The Association's involvement in the districts of Bafoulabe and Kenileba, apart
from those for the construction of water points for Health Centers to support
the IDA Health Project, would be subject of a second project. No water supply
construction activities for the district's capital, "Kita-town", are scheduled
under the Project as a German aid-agency is already financing new facilities
there.
Population, Village Organization, Infrastructure
3.02     In 1982, the total population of the District of Kita was estimated
at 166,500 inhabitants; 149,000 being classified as rural and 17,500 located
in the city of Kita being classified as urban. According to the result of the
1976 census, the birth rate was 40 per 1,000 persons and the death-rate 16-17
per 1,000; more than 60% of the deaths occurred among children of less than 4
years of age. Migration to Bamako, other African countries or Europe has been
almost similar to the rate of natural increase (2.36%) with a result of a
stable, indeed slightly decreasing total population.
3.03     The District of Kita is part of the Region of Kayes, the First Admin-
istrative Region of Mali. The district is divided in eight sub-districts
("arrondissement"), each sub-district including 30 to 60 villages. Small
hamlets are bound to the villages; during the dry season, i.e. when no agri-
cultural activities are possible, the population of the hamlets usually re-
groups itself in the main villages. Total number of villages and hamlets are
303 and 800 respectively, while their median populations are 400 and 45.
Although income related assumptions are difficult to establish, it is esti-
mated that the average annual per capita income in the Project area is in the
order of US$50 - 75, and that virtually the entire population would fall under
the poverty level.
3.04     Each village has a "village council" headed by a "village chief";  it
usually consists of leading citizens and in some cases of people named by the
political authorities. The extent of the village chief's authority varies
with the socio-economic and political profile of the village concerned; how-
ever, the chief is usually the representative of the community vis-a-vis the
Government, and thus, among many other things, he is also in charge of tax
collection. Young men may join in traditional fellowships ("tons") which may
manage the mutual aid cash-boxes. When these cash-boxes exist, they chiefly
are fed either by monthly or yearly contributions, or by the benefit of com-
munal agricultural activities. Some villages have organized their own co-
operatives which resell indispensable articles (salt, sugar, etc.) at a small
profit also going to the community cash-box.



- 7 -
3.05     The road network in the district of Kita is very rudimentary and
completely unpaved; even the main roads cannot be used during the rainy season
because of the absence of bridges. The Dakar-Bamako railway system which
crosses the project area has been neglected; there is no possibility of
unloading heavy materials in Kita. Public telegraph and telephone facilities
hardly exist, making the use of a radio necessary.
Climate, Hydrology, Hydrogeology
3.06     The Project area is located in the Sudanese climate area, except for
the northern part which is already situated in the Sahelian climate zone.
Average rainfalls range from 1,300mm in the South to 750mm in the North, but
inter-annual rainfall variations could be very important. The rainy season
occurs between May and October with a peak in August. Analysis of available
data for the last 100 years demonstrates that periodic droughts usually do not
exceed 7 years, although the present one began in the early seventies.
Average temperatures are 33 0C at the end of the dry season and 25 C during the
rainy season. The wind speed is generally lower than 2 meter/sec. which does
not permit operation of windmills.
3.07     The hydrographic system, part of the Senegal river catchment area,
includes three perennial rivers, the Bafing, Bakoye and Baoule. Except during
the rainy season, most of the secondary hydrographic network is dry and
scarcely allows for satisfaction of basic water needs.
3.08     The geology of the Project area is only partially known, although
some general studies were carried out in 1977 by BRGM 1/ under FAC financing
and described in the documents available in the project files. Schists and
sandstones constitute the major part of the geological beds. Small and dis-
continuous aquifers may be found in:
(i) alluvial plains of the main rivers which have a limited importance
only,
(ii) the altered and fractured granite substratum which usually does not
outcrop in the Project area,
(iii) the fractured and pervious sandstones, which represent the main
possibility of underground resources in the Project area,
(iv) the schists, only if they are fractured.
Existing Water Supply, Health and Sanitation Conditions
3.09       Presently, the villagers obtain their water chiefly from tradi-
tional open dug wells and dibholes. Surface water is also used during the
rainy season. Half of the wells have a total depth less than lOm and so tap
the superficial aquifers only; due to the lack of appropriate technology for
1/   BRGM = Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (France).



- 8 -
well digging, 40% of them have a water depth less than 0.50m. It has been
estimated that during the rainy season about one productive water point is
available for 30 inhabitants and their livestock, i.e. 13 water points per
village. These figures decrease to one water point for 50 inhabitants, i.e.
7 water points per village during the dry season. It is not unusual for
larger villages to have more than 50 wells.
3.10       Usually, women are in charge of water collection by traditional
means (buckets and ropes). Water carried from the wells is stored at each
compound in metallic or traditional tanks (canaris) and generally changed
every day. Pollution occurs during the extraction, carriage and storage
cycle, and surveys have demonstrated that the population does not as yet
understand the causal relation between consumption of polluted water and water
borne diseases. A detailed survey carried out within the framework of the
Bank's parallel Health Project in the districts of Kita, Bafoulabe and Kenieba
indicates that about 110 sick days per year and per inhabitant may be attri-
buted to direct water borne diseases.
3.11       During the rainy season, i.e. when sufficient water is available,
the average domestic water consumption is estimated at 37 lcd, while the
median value is about 30 lcd. Consumption for basic needs (water for drinking
and cooking) is 14 lcd. This estimated level of consumption is rather high
when compared with water use in most African urban centers.
3.12       Latrine construction is essentially carried out with involvement of
technical assistance provided through volunteer agencies attached to primary
health care programs and is mainly concentrated in the larger villages. It
may be estimated that less than 5% of the rural population has sanitary means
of excreta disposal.
Existing Water Resource Balance
3-13       Among the 303 villages of the district of Kita, close to 70% are
reported to suffer periodic water deficit. During the preparation of the
Project all these villages were visited; a survey of the present population
and their livestock was carried out and available water resources during the
dry season were estimated. Water needs to be satisfied would, depending on
the objectives, require the following actions: (See Annex 3 for details).
(i)  the basic satisfaction of human needs in the district would require
about 300 additional water points to serve a population of 110,000
located in about 200 villages; or
(ii)  the satisfaction of the above needs and additional demand for
livestock and small scale agricultural usage would require the
construction of 575 additional water points to serve 117,000 inhab-
itants and their livestock as well, spread over 225 villages.
Against the background of available financial resources, and as a reflection
of agreed upon priorities, the proposed Project envisages to satisfy the basic
human needs only; the investment criteria are detailed in para. 4.03.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Genesis and Objectives
4.01       This Project has been prepared by DNHE assisted by a consultant,
BRGM under an IDA-PPF financing, following a request by the Malian Government
to implement an integrated RWS and Health Project to improve living and sani-
tary conditions, and thus contribute to the human capital formation in rural
areas. Hence, the Project would be implemented in parallel with an IDA Health
Project for the same general Project area. To meet the objectives, the
Project proposes to:
(i) supply water for the basic human needs in about 215 villages in the
district of Kita and 15 villages in the districts of Bafoulabe and
Kenieba where Health Centers would be built;
(ii) set-up an operation and maintenance system of the water points
which would ensure availability of spare parts and emphasize maxi-
mum self-reliance by the villagers themselves; and
(iii) strengthen the capability of DNHE to identify, prepare and manage
RWS projects, as well as provide technical assistance to the
villagers for maintenance of the handpumps.
Project Components
4.02       The proposed Project would include the following components:
(i) provision of about 325 productive boreholes in the district of Kita
during a four year drilling campaign, and provision of about 15
productive boreholes during the first campaign in the villages in
the districts of Bafoulabe and Kenieba where Health Centers would
be built;
(ii) installation of about 340 handpumps and supply of necessary
replacements and spare parts;
(iii) management of the Project including:
(a)  consultant services for Project preparation (already financed
under the PPF);
(b)  construction of Project management offices, garage and ware-
house. "Base de Kita" (to be financed under the PPF in order
not to delay Project implementation); and
(c)  technical assistance to DNHE for general Project management
including geophysical survey for well siting and promotional
activities at the village level, as well as supply and
operation of the necessary equipments and vehicles of the
DNHE's Field Team;



- 10 -
(iv) consultant services for a mid-Project review and preparation of a
second project in the districts of Bafoulabe and Kenieba; and
(v) construction of additional water points and/or supply and
installation of additional equipment and/or additional consultant
services to take advantage of opportunities emerging during the
first years of implementation. A technical and economic evaluation
would be made by an independent expert as to the optimum use of the
corresponding funds at the time of a review during the third
drilling campaign (para. 4.26).
Investment Criteria
4.03        To make up the whole water deficit in the District of Kita (para.
3.13) does not appear to be a realistic objective; hence, the scope of the
proposed Project has been defined on the following basis:
(i) to limit, in the light of absorptive capacity constraints in Mali
and the Bank's relative unfamiliarity in this field, the duration
and the size of this Project to the use of two drilling rigs
during three campaigns 1/ and of one drilling rig during an addi-
tional fourth campaign. During the first campaign, one rig will
operate for about six months in the districts of Bafoulab'e and
Kenieba to construct the boreholes required for the Health
Centers. According to experience in Sahelian countries, an effi-
ciently operated drilling rig would drill at a pace of around 11 -
12 boreholes per month, thus resulting in about 100 boreholes per
campaign. With an expected 50% success rate in the District of
Kita, and 33% only in the districts of Bafoulabe and K6ni!&ba (para.
4.05), a total of about 340 productive boreholes could be drilled
under the Project;
(ii) to allow for supplying the maximum number of villages, the satis-
faction of human basic needs, i.e. about 20 to 25 lcd, has been re-
tained as design criteria. The average water production of a bore-
hole equipped with a regular handpump being limited to about 1 m3/h, a
new water point will be created for 500 inhabitants at the maximum;
(iii) to distribute the 325 proposed boreholes in the District of Kita
the following criteria will also be considered: prevalence of
waterborne diseases, size of the village, existence of a school or
a Health Center, possibilities of economic development, distance
between the village and the remaining water sources during the dry
season, and accessibility of the village. A very important cri-
terion, however, would be the willingness of the beneficiaries to
contribute physically to and participate financially in the pre-
paration of the site of the water point, and in the purchase as
well as maintenance of the handpumps (para. 4.12).
1/   A drilling campaign corresponds to the period October-June.



- 1 1 -
Technology Used
4.04       Supplying water in rural areas of Sahelian countries inevitably
requires an evaluation of the trade-offs between open wells and boreholes. On
the one hand, open wells present the advantages of providing access to several
users at the same time, lifting water by traditional means; on the other
hand, their construction is slow and expensive (twice as much as a borehole),
bacteriological quality of the water is often unsatisfactory, and water avail-
ability is subject to seasonal variations of the aquifer. Modern boreholes
can be drilled within one day at lower cost, availability and quality of water
generally pose no problems, but installation of a pump is necessary. Based on
experiences of other RWS Projects in Mali, it is proposed to mainly equip the
villages with boreholes; only a few open wells could be built either by "OP"
or by a private contractor within the limits of the possible additional works
to be defined at the time of the mid-Project review (para. 4.26). However, as
the Project will introduce new technologies it will require a thorough
psychological preparation of the population; thus promotional activities will
play an important role for Project execution.
4.05       Hydrogeology in the Project area not being well known (para. 3.08),
systematic aerial photo interpretation, followed by a thorough geophysical
survey will be carried out by the DNHE Field Team prior to borehole siting.
For this purpose an experienced geophysicist as well as the required equip-
ment 1/ (electric, magnetometric sensors) will be provided by the Consultant
under the technical assistance contract (para. 4.09). Despite the geophysical
surveys, average success rates are expected to be only 50 percent in the
District of Kita and 33 percent in the districts of Bafoulabe and Kenieba in
view of the difficult geological formations prevailing in the Project area.
4.06       Drilling of boreholes will be contracted to a qualified company.
According to the geological formation either rotary or "down the hole hammer"
methods will be used. Average depth is estimated to be about 55-60 meters
with drilling diameters of 4 to 6 1/2 inches in most cases; these character-
istics do not justify initial reconnaissance drillings. When necessary, PVC
casing and screens will be installed. As a general rule, a borehole would be
considered productive, and placed into operation, when the yield exceeds
1 m /h.
4.07       Productive boreholes will be equipped with suitable pum s, the
average discharge rate of which will in most cases be 0.7 to 1 .0 m2/h.  Some
very productive boreholes could be equipped with handpumps yielding 2 to
4 m9/h; last, a limited number 3f solar pumps may be installed on very pro-
ductive boreholes (more than 5 m /h) within the limits of the possible addi-
tional works to be defined at the time of the mid-Project review (para. 4.26),
provided the corresponding high investment cost could be justified by the
possibility of implementing small agricultural or livestock projects. Choice
1/   Equipment to remain with DNHE at the end of the contract.

of pump supplier on ICB basis will not only be based on the quality and per-
formance of their product, but also on their capability and willingness to set
up in the Project area under the supervision of DNHE, the necessary logistics
for further operation and training of local caretakers at the village and sub-
district level. It is expected that the ongoing "UNDP Handpumps Project" for
which the Bank is the executing agency will be able to provide pertinent
information to the Government prior to award of the contract of supply and
installation of handpumps.
4.08       The completion of the well site will be carried out with participa-
tion by the villagers under the supervision of the DNHE Field Team. It will
consist of building an adequate and properly drained apron and a protection
wall.
Project Management
4.09       As indicated in para. 2.06, the Project management will be based in
Kita.  The DNHE engineer currently responsible for the preparation of the
proposed Project has been appointed as Project Manager. His appointment or
the nomination of an alternate, suitably qualified candidate acceptable to IDA
was a condition for negotiations. The DNHE team will further comprise 4
engineers (2 hydrogeologists, 1 geophysicist and 1 RWS specialist) and 2
technicians (1 hydrogeologist and 1 RWS specialist). They will be assisted,
up to the end of the third drilling campaign, by a foreign technical assis-
tance team (2 hydrogeologists and 1 geophysicist). The Technical Assistance
Team will be in charge of:
(i) general management of the Project: bid evaluation, contracts
writing, technical and financial construction supervision;
(ii) siting of the water points by geophysical survey (para. 4.05);
(iii) supply and operation of vehicles and equipment necessary for the
Project Field Team activities in Kita; and
(iv) on-the-job training of the local counterpart in project management
and work supervision.
It is expected that the fourth drilling campaign and general Project activi-
ties in Years 4 and 5 will be entirely implemented by the DNHE Field Team
without foreign assistance.  The DNHE field office would also include an
accountant, and the activities would be subjected to an annual audit (para.
4.29).
4.10       In order to ensure sufficient operation from the beginning of the
Project, the Project Manager and 5 more DNHE staff (drilling rig operators and
RWS technicians) will receive during 1983 training related to their future
responsibilities in the ongoing RWS projects in Mali, financed by the PPF.



- 13 -
Villagers' Contribution to and Participation in the Project
4.11       The Malian Government recently adopted the policy of encouraging
the rural communities to participate, to the extent possible, in the financing
of the handpumps and to assume greater responsibility in the operation ana
maintenance (O&M) of the water points. This orientation is seen in the RWS
sub-sector throughout the Sahelian Region and in many coastal countries as it
results from reflections on:
(i)   the less than satisfying experience in the past where RWS invest-
ments mostly failed as the beneficiaries were not at all sensitized
and were left out of participation in maintenance and repair. and
(ii)   the excessive burden on the authorities' administrative capac_ty to
sustain a large scale maintenance system.
In Mali the three major RWS projects have adopted the new approach in recent
years and introduction of the ownership concept of handpumps by the rural
communities as well as day-to-day maintenance by the villagers themselves have
proven successful. Furthermore, systematical preventive maintenance has led
to considerable decrease in the number of recorded pump failures. For example
in the Helvetas Project the annual failure rate dropped from 130 per 10C pumps
to 15 per 100 pumps in the course of 12 months.
4.12       Prior to the drilling of a borehole, DNHE will enter into an agree-
ment with each participating village outlining the village's responsibilities
related to the construction and O&M of the water point. Agreement forms
already in use in the other RWS projects are in general acceptable to IDA.
They are now being revised to be tailored to this specific Project. Annex 4-1
contains a pro-forma agreement form currently used for the Helvetas Project.
Prior to installation of the handpump the villages will have to pay to the
Project account a financial participation of MF 270,000 (US$360) in 1982
prices and not subject to inflation throughout the Project implementation
period, representing about one third of the purchase price of the pump
(MF 660,000 /3 = MF 220,000 or US$295) and the cost of the ten bags of cement
necessary for the site preparation (MF 50,000 or US$65) (para. 4.03(iii)).
Surveys performed during Project preparation show that this amount is withir.
the affordable range of the beneficiaries and that the willingness to actively
assure this contribution as well as the necessary expenditures for the subse-
quent maintenance (Chapter V) is very high among the target population.
4.13       Villages will assume the cost of regular maintenance of the pumps
including purchase of spare parts and of repair interventions by the DNHE
Field Team.   In other projects active participation of the villagers in hand-
pump maintenance has more than halved the amount of recurrent costs from
approximately MF 120,000 to around MF 50,000, per handpump and per year, i.e.
from US$160 to US$67.

Maintenance of the Water Points - Role of DNHE
4.14       DNHE will assure throughout the Project implementation period:
(i)  the set-up of the necessary logistics such as availability of spare
parts, (which will be financed up to Year 5 by the proposed Pro-
ject) storage depots, and pricing of spare parts;
(ii)  the training of caretakers at the village as well as at the sub-
district levels for preventive maintenance and small repairs (in
connection with the handpumps supplier); and
(iii)  the availability of its own mobile maintenance team (the opera-
tions' cost of which will be financed up to Year 5 by the Project)
to assume co-ordination of village and sub-district level repair
activities and to intervene in cases where repair problems exceed
the skills of the rural population.
It is expected that by the end of the third drilling campaign, the DNHE Field
Team will be largely capable to fulfill these responsibilities without further
technical assistance. However, in recognizing the importance to optimize
scarce resources by utilizing available talent in the project area as much as
possible and to benefit from economies of scale, DNHE will enter into arrange-
ments satisfactory to IDA with ODIPAC 1/, an IDA-funded regional development
agency, to obtain some operational support. DNHE will use ODIPAC's storage
depots for the location of spare parts, obtain assistance for the village
training activities, and subcontract to it the village level promotional
activities to be carried out jointly with the IDA Health Project. DNHE's
maintenance activities would be higher in the initial years, when villagers
have not yet fully mastered the maintenance and repair techniques. The de-
pendency on outside support would gradually decrease, and the DNHE maintenance
team will then assume a larger monitoring function of the pumps installed and
of the hydrogeological conditions of boreholes operation.
Handpumps Replacement
4.15       Handpumps installed under the Project will be guaranteed by the
supplier for at least 12 months. Thus, the replacement issue will become
relevant only in the outer years. In most cases, replacement would take the
form of gradual renewal of worn out parts, stretched out over several years,
therefore limiting the financial burden imposed upon the rural communities. A
potential problem would exist for those expected few cases where the whole
pump would have to be replaced. The Government's policy, already successfully
implemented under the major ongoing RWS projects, is to require the beneficia-
ries to carry the full cost. For the proposed Project, possibilities will be
studied and ways elaborated to tap the credit system available under the
ODIPAC project.

Village Level Promotional Activities
4.16       The promotional activities, i.e. the "software" tools to be used at
the village level play a most important role for RWS projects to ensure their
success:
(i)   by preparing the rural communities on how to cope with the newly
introduced technologies, by training the local caretakers for O&M
aspects and by explaining the respective role of the villages and
DNHE in order to "demystify" the hitherto alien technology so that
it be absorbed at the village level enabling the rural communities
to become largely self-sufficient (as it has been the case with
bicycle technologies);
(ii)   by introducing, together with the IDA Health Project, hygiene and
sanitation related concepts which would result in modified be-
havioral approaches towards water use reflected in improved hygiene
standards. These, in turn, would then be the basis for improved
health conditions to be expected as a result of the Health Project.
4.17       The promotional activities for the Water and Health Projects must
by necessity be designed so as to be integrated into the overall development
process in the Region. To this end, the two Projects will seek operational
support from ODIPAC, (para. 4.14) and DNAFLA 1/ before April 1, 1984. Experi-
ences in rural development projects as well as in the ODIPAC covered areas
have shown that the population responded better to extension efforts, and
participated more actively in marketing, credit and input supply activities,
if at least a nucleus of villagers had attained a minimal level of functional
literacy and numeracy in their own language. Thus, DNAFLA as ODIPAC's execut-
ing agency for functional literacy related activities will play an important
role in the two Projects' promotion activities. A detailed write-up on the
subject of community participation, including the role of DNAFLA, is available
in the Project files.
4.18       During appraisal, it was agreed that the project costs pertaining
to this aspect estimated at US$340,000 for the implementation period would be
financed entirely out of the Health Project, with the exception of the
recruitment of a Malian Sociologist to be financed under the RWS Project. The
respective responsibilities, the methodology and timetable of intervention was
agreed upon during meetings involving both Health and Water executing
agencies, ODIPAC and DNAFLA.  Annex 4-2 contains a brief description of the
agreed upon community promotion activities.
Project Cost
4.19       The estimated cost of tne project is MF 8,875 million
(US$11.90 million) with a foreign exchange component of MF 7,415 million
(US$9.95 million) representing 84%. Taxes and duties on imported goods as
well as taxes on works are not applied to Bank Group projects in Mali;
however the Project cost includes taxes on fuel which represent MF 310 million

4.20       Project costs have been calculated after a detailed analysis of
each component based on cost data from similarly organized RWS projects in
Sahelian countries, and compared with quotations obtained for similar works
recently tendered for in the region.  All costs have been adjusted to reflect
unit prices as of end 1982.  Detailed calculations are available in Project
files.
4.91       Project costs include financing of all the operating costs of the
DNHE Field Team during the implementation period: supply, operation and
maintenance of vehicles, field allowances for the administrative staff, office
operation and spare parts for handpumps. Project costs, however do not in-
clude salaries of the administration staff as no additional position would be
created by the proposed Project. These recurrent costs amount to about 9% of
the total throughout the Project implementation period.
4.22       The cost of a productive and equipped borehole for the Project area
at an expected success rate of 50%, is estimated at about US$20,000 (expressed
in base cost as of end 1982) of which 68% correspond to the drilling and site
preparation, 9% to supply and installation of handpumps and 23% to borehole
siting, construction supervision and promotional activities.  Another break-
dowr shows that as an item of major importance foreign manpower would repre-
sent one third of the cost of a productive water point.  While this proportion
in overall cost would vary as a function of the actually attained success
rates, nonetheless it largely justifies the objective of strengthening the
capability of DNHE in management of further RWS projects (para. 4.01 (iii)).
4.23       Allowances for physical contingencies on construction work at the
average rate of 15% are provided. In addition allowance has been made for
price contingencies for imported goods and services at a rate of 8% in 1983;
7.5% in 1984; 7% in 1985, and 6% thereafter. For local cost, the respective
rates are 15% in 1983; 12% in 1984, and 10% thereafter.
Project Financing
4.24       An IDA Credit of US$4.65 million equivalent and a Credit from the
IDA Special Fund of US$6.26 million equivalent are proposed. The remainder of
US$0.99 million equivalent would be financed by the Government (US$0.87 million
of which US$0.42 million representing the amount of taxes on fuel) and by the
beneficiaries themselves (US$0.12 million) (para. 4.12). The Government of
Mali would be the borrower of the Credits, which will be entirely administered
by DNHE.
Implementation
4.25       Detailed designs and tender documents are being prepared by DNHE,
assisted by the Consultant BRGM, and financed under the PPF. They will be
ready by December 1983. For bid evaluation, contract preparation and
construction supervision, DNHE will be assisted by an Engineering Consultant
selected in accordance with Bank procedures (para. 4.09). The signing of the
contract with the Engineering Consultant will be a condition of effective-
ness. It is expected that construction will start by October 1984 and extend
to June 1989 (Annex 4-4).



- 18 -
4.26       During the third drilling campaign, DNHE will employ an independent
and qualified Consultant on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA to carry
out an evaluation of the activities to be included in the fourth drilling
campaign. These activities could be according to the opportunities which had
emerged during the first years of Project implementation either drilling of
additional boreholes or open wells (para. 4.06), either purchase and
installation of additional handpumps or solar pumps (para. 4.07) or additional
consultants services (para. 4.09). Such a program of possible additional
activities, the amount of which will be limited to the funds allocated for
this purpose, will be submitted to IDA for review and approval three months
before the end of the third drilling campaign.

As the contract for drilling of boreholes will be financed out of the proceeds
of the IDA Special Fund credit, it will be awarded through ICB procedures in
accordance with the IDA Special Fund Guidelines and Practices.  The contract
for supply and installation of handpumps as well as other contracts for
possible additional works or equipments will be awarded through ICB procedures
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines and Practices. For technical
assistance (para. 4.09) and studies (para. 4.02 (iv) and 4.26), consulting
firms will be selected in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. The
technical assistance contract (para. 4.09) will cover about 95 man-months at
an average rate of US$7,300 per man-month, including salaries, subsistence
allowances, and travel (as of end 1982 prices), and also supply and operation
of necessary vehicles and equipment. No domestic preference will apply in
contract award, since sufficiently qualified and experienced local contractors
and suppliers do not exist.

4.29       The Government contribution will be paid to a special Project
Account in six installments, the amounts of which have been tailored to meet
the forecasted requirements for Project financing by the local participation;
the schedule of payments to the Project Account is justified in Annex 4-5.
Allocation by the Government for its fiscal year 1984 of MF 110 million
(US$167,500 equivalent) for the Project, establishment of the Project Account
and payment of the first installment of MF 20 million (US$26,500 equivalent),
will be conditions of effectiveness of the Credits. Further installments of
MF 90 million, MF 110 million, MF 150 million, MF 190 million, MF 90 million
(US$121,000, US$147,500, US$200,000, US$255,000 and US$121,000 equivalent)
will be paid before the beginning of each drilling campaign not later than
August 31, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 respectively. Proceeds of the



- 20 -
villagers' contribution (para. 4.12) will also be paid to the Project
Account. This account will be managed by the Project Manager, supervised by
the Director of DNHE, and subject to regular review by Bank staff and an
annual external audit. Funds will be used for payment of the portions of the
drilling contract not covered by the IDA Special Fund Credit, for purchase of
cement required for site preparation, spare parts for vehicles as well as some
office supplies on the basis of a budget established for each drilling
campaign.
4.30       The estimated schedules of disbursements of the Credits given in
Annex 4-6 are based on the average disbursement profile for water supply and
sewerage projects in West Africa. The closing date of the Credits would be
June 30, 1992.

V. AFFORDABILITY
Objectives
5.01       One of the most important parameters in Project design has been the
emphasis on minimizing the incremental financial burden on the national budget
(i.e. DNHE's budget) as a result of the Project in view of the severe finan-
cial constraints of Mali. Therefore, solutions were sought to assure adequate
coverage of the ensuing recurring costs by the beneficiaries themselves, all
the while taking into account the rural population's affordability limits. To
this end, extensive socio-economic surveys were carried out in the Project
area during the preparation phase to establish the profiles of villages in the
Project zone.
Recurrent Cost Implications
> D2       By Project completion the incremental recurrent cost per water
pu._n!per year are estimated to be in the order of MF 60,000 with the
following approximative breakdown:
Incremental Annual Recurrent Cost per
Water Point During the Fifth Campaign
(End 1982 prices)

At the village level:
-Purchase of spare parts                        15,000      25
-Remuneration for emergency assistance

At the DNHE level:

Total                  60,000    100



- 22 -
In addition, villagers would remunerate their own pump caretaker most likely
In kind, in the Drder of MF 3,000/month per water point. Incremental annual
recurrent cost could be higher for the initial years, during which the
villagers would not as yet feel comfortable with pump maintenance. Further
details are available in the Project files.
5.07        The estimated total incremental O&M costs as a result of the
Project are shown below.

c/       including personnel, overhead, depreciation and operation of venicles
by completion of tr.e Project, tne resulting additional budgetary burden to
IDNHE would be about TMF 12 million per year (US$16,000) in 1982 prices, or 9%
of DNHE's RWS sub-sector budget in 1982. It is expected that the covenanted
annual Government counterpart contributions, which are far higher than the
future annual O&M costs alone (para. 4.29), will serve as a "primer" for
continued Government budgetary allocations for the post-Project period. An
allocation level of MF 12 million (1982 prices) will enable DNHE to fulfill
its obligations of assuring adequate support to and supervision of proper
maintenance of the Project investments. IDA Project supervision in the outer
years will envisage to assist DNHE in working out the exact levels of finan-
cial commitments required and in establishing the appropriate procedures. On
the other hand annual service on the IDA Credit, starting around 1994, will
amount to approximately MF 220 million (US$295,000). During negotiations
assurances were obtained from Government that after the Project implementation
period adequate resources reflecting the annual O&M requirements would be
provided for in DNHE's annual budget.

Cost Recovery Approach
5.04     Clearly it is not possible to aim for recovery of the capital costs
by the beneficiaries for RWS projects in the Sahelian zone except for partial
recovery from handpumps.
5.05     The villagers' initial contribution to the Project of about
MF 270,000 (para. 4.12) could represent approximately 2% of an average
village's annual expenses in the district of Kita 1/. While certainly a non-
negligible cash outlay, during field visits the willingness to participate was
ascertained virtually everywhere. This willingness can be traced to
expectations of a reliable water source all year round, the associated time
savings (in particular during the height of the dry season) and to a lesser
extent of improved water quality and health improvements. Further, as an
illustrative comparison, the above indicated amount would represent the value
of approximately 2-1/2 cows (usually regarded as capital stock) 2/ or two-
thirds of the cost of a marriage for a Malink;e groom 3/, thus leading to the
observation that a participation in this amount would appear well within the
affordable limits of a village's accumulated capital stock.
5.06     Partial cost recovery envisaged from the villagers for recurrent
costs estimated at MF 60,000 (US$80) per annum would represent less than one
percent of the current estimated expense levels in an average village, and
must be considered affordable.
5.07     Spare parts will be sold to the villagers at a price 10% higher than
the import prices to allow for handling and administration charges. Fuel
charges will, to the extent possible, reflect the actual distances to be
covered by the relevant maintenance team called in for the specific repair
intervention.
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01     The main benefits of the Project will be the increased availability
of, in principle, safe drinking water to the population in the Project area to
satisfy their basic water needs all year round including the dry season.
Together with the IDA Health Project, this Project is expected to result in an
improvement in the health status of the affected rural population, thus
contributing potentially to the widely recognized country objective of human
1/   Assuming an average village size of 400 persons, and based on MF
34,000/person.
2,' The price of a cow at the village level lies between MY 100,000-125,000.
3/   Bride price of MF 375,000 (three cows and various gifts) plus feast
(over three days).

resources development and increased agricultural production for the rural area
in Mali. Ps a further benefit, but of no lesser importance, the Project will
develop important initiatives of community organizatioL, by institutionalizing
new water and health related activities at the village level, thus serving as
a vehicle towards further community development. By adopting the approach to
maximize the responsibilities of the beneficiaries themselves in O&M, and
financial aspects of those activities, the Project will also attempt to
minimize the incremental burden on the national budget of DNHE.
6.02     As to institutional aspects, apart from the village level, a major
benefit of the Project is expected to be the installation of a nucleus Field
Team of DNHE in the First Administrative Region within the framework of the
decentralization policies of the Government for the RWS sub-sector. This
field office will remain in place after Project completion to continue
supervision of O&M of the water points, and to supervise execution of future
generation RWS projects.
6.03     A quantification of the benefits would appear rather difficult at
this point. Some target figures are given in the Rural Health Project SAE as
to expected improvements in health standards of the covered population as a
result of the implementation of the two Projects. However, it would be highly
speculative to attempt a rate of return analysis of the Project.
Risks
6.04     The major risks concerning the implementation of tne proposed Project
do not pertain so much to the construction of the boreholes and equipment with
handpumps, but to the sustained maintenance of these investments. Clearly the
Sahelian experience has shown that maximum responsibility of the rural com-
munity together with a fostering of a sense of ownership of communal wells is
so far yielding the most promising results.
6.05     Yet, given the relative newness of this orientation many unknown
factors remain; the answers to questions such as those following will have tC
await the results of actual Project implementation:
(i) will the villagers really continue to tend to the maintenance of
the water point (pump) after the initial euphoria of having water
easily accessible has waned;
(ii) will the communities be continuously able and willing to finance
spare parts and the repairs services;
(iii)  will the villages be able to solve whatever new sociological
conflict situations may arise as a result of the introduction of
the communal handpump; and
(iv) will afterwards the health and living conditions really improve
substantially and the villagers acknowledge it as such.
The Project has been prepared with all these questions in mind, and conse-
quently emphasis is being put on the village promotion and training activi-
ties. The concept of a, if maybe not legally, but at least morally binding



- 25 -
(for such traditional societies) "contract" will be applied also following
positive experiences from the other major RWS projects in Mali.
6.06     Still, the rural communities would not be able to solve all their
maintenance and repair problems, but would need a viable outside support
structure in order to be prepared for all eventualities. This support will be
provided by DNHE with the assistance of ODIPAC. There is a risk that the
existence of ODIPAC itself is not necessarily assured beyond the life of this
Project. This risk had to be accepted, however, to make use of existing
available institutional and human resources. A successful support role for
ODIPAC would conceivably strenghthen and assure its own success as it is
essentially a rural extension agency. While performance of ODIPAC will be
closely monitored during the Project, contingency plans would be drawn up by
DNHE in consultation with IDA.
6.07     As a further note, there is the possibility that the projected
success rate of 50% might not be attained, leading to even higher cost per
productive borehole. Yet it is felt that this retained success rate is
already rather conservative in comparison with countrywide estimates of 60%.
Meticulous application of geophysical works prior to drilling and improved
knowledge of hydrogeological characteristics during Project execution could
likely lead even to more positive results.
6.08     As to water quality, while an unknown factor as yet, there is little
concern, judging from experiences in adjacent RWS program zones with similar
geological formations.
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     At negotiations, assurances were received by Government on the
following:
A)   As conditions for Credits Effectiveness:
(i)  DNHE will enter into a contract with a competent engineering
consultant to assist in the management of the Project and
provide technical assistance to the DNHE Field Team on terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA (para. 4.25);
(ii)  DNHE will establish one Project Account for:
(a) all funds resulting out of the villagers' initial
contribution to the Project, as well as their payment
for recurrent costs (spare parts, etc.) (paras. 4.12 and
4.29);
(b) all other funds necessary for Project management (para.
4.29);



- 26 -
(iii) The Government will:
(a)  allocate for its fiscal year 1984 an amount of MF 110
million (US$147,500 equivalent) for the Project (para.
4.29); and
(b)  deposit into the Project Account at the date of its
establishment an initial contribution of MF 20 million
(US$26,500 equivalent) (para. 4.29).
B)   Other covenants:
(iv) DNHE will enter into arrangements with ODIPAC and DNAFLA as
to their operational support not later than April 1, 1984
(paras. 4.14 and 4.17);
(v)  DNHE will have its Project Account audited annually by an
independent auditor whose qualifications are satisfactory to
IDA, and reports will be made available to IDA within 6
months of the end of each drilling campaign (paras. 4.09 and
4.29);
(vi) The Government will pay into the Project Account installments
of MF 90 million, MF 110 million, MF 150 million, MF 190
million and MF 90 million (US$121,000, US$147,500,
US$200,000, US$255,000 and US$121,000 equivalent) not later
than August 31, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 respectively
(para. 4.29);
(vii) The Project Management will prepare a budget three months
before the beginning of each drilling campaign, covering
expenses during the upcoming campaign for review and approval
by IDA (para. 4.29);
(viii)  DNHE shall, during the third drilling campaign, employ an
independent consultant on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA to carry out an evaluation of the activities to be
included in the fourth drilling campaign and submit a program
of such activities for review and approval by IDA not later
than three months before the end of the third drilling
campaign (para. 4.26);
(ix)  The Government will allocate to DNHE's annual budget, after
the Project implementation period, adequate resources
reflecting the estimated annual O&M requirements (currently
estimated at MF 12 million (US$16,000) in end 1982 prices)
(para. 5.03); and



- 27 -
(x) DNHE will enter into arrangements with each participating
village to set up the responsibilities of each village,
including the financial and physical contribution in
construction, operation and maintenance of the water points
(paras. 4.12 and 6.05).
Recommendation
7.02     Subject to reaching agreement on the items listed in the paragraphs
above, the proposed Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.65 million
and a Credit from the IDA Special Fund of US$6.26 million.

INDICATIVE AVERAGE INCREMENTAL COST (AIC) CALCULATIONS
1.       Experience in ongoing RWS projects in Mali as well as in neighbouring
countrias, has shown that the use of a borehole equipped with a pump would
vary considerably over the twelve months of a year. While for health and
education related reasons it would be desirable that the total village popula-
tion limit the use of traditional wells for non-human consumption, this would
hardly be a realistic expectation. Because of the haphazardous nature of
consumption projections for the newly constructed water point, any long term
marginal cost estimates per cu. m. of water as approximated by the Average
Incremental Cost are difficult to establish. Nonetheless, an attempt has been
made to arrive at an indicative range.
Consumption Assumptions:
2.       The table below gives a possible scenario as to the use of a haed
pump as a percentage of an indicative daily installed capacity 10-12.5 m /day
(which would correspond, for a village of 500 people, to an allocation of 20-
25 lcd).

Months 3 - 6 = Peak of dry season
3.       The resulting annual consumption would then be in the order of
1950 m3 to 2,440 m3. For convenience sake it is assumed that this level of
water use from the pump-equipped water point would stabilize.

4.       The assumptions for the cost per water point have been assumed as
following:
Estimated Cost per Water Point and
Recurrent Cost per Pump and Year
(in end 1982 prices LIF 1,000)
1
MF
(thousands)
-    The cost per productive borehole (including
drilling, site preparation and supervision)
in a village in the distict of Kita (at 90%
of cost of items (i), (ii), )iv), (v) in the
Summary Table 4.01 on page 16, and a 50%
success rate.)                                                11,800
-    purchase and installation of handpumps                          1,000
Investment cost per water point                      12,800
-    useful life of a pump       -  5 years
-    useful life of a borehole - 20 years
-    annual recurrent costs per pump                               60,000
This would rougly translate into the following cost stream:
Year               Cost (million MF - Early 1983 prices)
1                                12,860
2-5                                    60
6                                 1,060
7-11                                    60
11                                 1,060
12-15                                    60
16                                 1,060
17-20                                     60
NPV at opportunity cost of capital-10%               14,608
5.       At an opportunity cost of capital of 10%, the present value for the
investments and recurrent cost has been estimated at MF 14,608 million.  The
present value of water consumed would be 18,262 to 22,850.  The iong run
marginal cost as expressed by AIC would then range from MF 770/m  to MF
616/m                                                                        1
