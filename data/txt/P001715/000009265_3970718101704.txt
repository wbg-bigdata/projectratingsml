Terms:            Standard
Project           The proposed project would assist the Government to improve
Description:      living and sanitary conditions in the project area in
Western Mali. About 230 villages would be beneficiaries of
boreholes equipped with handpumps. The project would 3tress
villagers' direct participation from siting of boreholes
th-iough construction of waterpoints to operation and mainte-
nance. Assmption by villagers of responsibilities for
maintenance would be a key ingredient to the success of the
project. The project would strengthen Government's
capability to identify, prepare and manage this type of
project. The project includes: (a) provision of about 340
productive boreholes in Western Nali, (b) supply and
installation of haudpumps and necessary spare parts, (c)
technical assistance, consultancy services and a training
program, and Jd) studies to prepare for a follow-up project.
Benefit           The main benefits of the project would be the increased
and Risks:        availability of safe drinking water to the population to
satisfy their basic water needs all year round including the
dry season. The main risks pertain to the sustained
maintenance of boreholes and handpumps. To minimise these
risks the project would emphasize village promotion and
training activities.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMN T ASSOCIATION
REPORT AJD RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AND SPECIAL FUND CREDITS TO
THE REPUBLIC OF MALI FOR A RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Devel-
opment Credit of SDR 4.4 million (US$4.6 million equivalent) and a proposed
Credit from the IDA Special Fund of SDR 6..O million (US$6.3 million equiva-
lent) on standard IDA terms to the Republic of Mali to help finance a proposed
Rural Water Supply Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.       Two reports entitled "Economic Memorandum on Mali" (3200-MLI) and
"Mali-Special Economic Study-Planning Institutions and the 1974-78 Plan"
(3333-MLI) were distributed to the Executive Directors on June 30, 1981. The
following paragraphs are based on these reports and the findings of recent
World Bank and IMF economic missions. Annex I gives country data.
Economic Resources and Constraints
3.       Mali has a population of over 7 million inhabitants, in an area of
1.24 million square kilometers in the middle of sub-Saharan West Africa. In
1982, GNP per capita was only US$180. By almost any measure,. Mali is one of
the least developed countries in the world, with a subsistence-oriented econ-
omy (85 percent of the population depends on the primary sector), dependence
on a few commodity exports, an extremely low rate of domestic savings (minus
2.7 percent of GDP in 1982), a high population growth rate (2.8 percent), a
low level of education (less than 10 percent adult literacy and a 27 percent
primary enrollment rate), and difficult living conditions that give a life
expectancy at birth of only 45 years.
4.       Poor physical and underdeveloped human resources, as well as inade-
quate economic and social infrastructure, constrain economic growth in Mali in
the short and medium term. Potential for agricultural production is limited
by uncertain rainfall, fragile soils prone to exhaustion and erosion, and lew-
yielding, traditional crop and livestock technologies with little scope for
intensification. Mineral and energy resources are limited and difficult to
exploit. Human resources are underdeveloped, in part because access to basic
amenities like clean water, better health care, and educational opportunities
remains quite limited. There are shortages of skilled workers and experienced

Second Mali Sud Rural Development Project which was distributed to the
Executive Directors on September 15, 1983.

managers. Transportation and communication are extremely expensive by world
standards, because Mali is landlocked and internal distances are vast. The
above factors result in low incomes, small domestic markets, and limited
potential for industrial development. Finally, Mali is a small open economy,
with trade concentrated in a few commodities. Imports and exports together
amount to more than half of GDP.  Cotton and livestock comprise four-fifths of
exports, and petroleum and foodstuffs, one-third of imports. Thus, the coun-
try is extremely vulnerable to changes in world prices and declining terms of
trade.
5.       Although economic development will be difficult in the short and
medium term, Mali has economic potential that can be developed over the long
term. Malian farmers are among the most proficient in West Africa. Rainfed
maize production could be significantly expanded in the south. Mali has more
irrigated rice land than any other Sahelian country, as well as the largest
physical scope for expanding irrigation. Hydroelectric generating potential
on the Niger and Senegal rivers is significant. Although mineral resources
remain largely unexplored and unexploited (except for gold), they may offer
longer-term opportunities.
Economic Performance 1960-82
6.       The Malian Government has attempted since independence to promote
economic growth while trying to improve social equity and raise consumption
from very low levels. During 1960-82, annual growth of GNP per capita
averaged 1.1 percent in constant prices, although annual variations were large.
The economic structure has shifted as the agricultural sector has become less
important while the services sector has become more so. Although this tend-
ency is normal for developing economies, in Mali it also reflects the effect
of policies that have shifted resources to the urban sector and to public
consumption. At the same time, the industrial sector has stagnated despite
government efforts to create a modern industrial base. Because of drought and
declining terms of trade, as well as continuing mistakes in economic manage-
ment and poor allocation of public resources, there have been since indepen-
dence consistently large and worsening imbalances in public finances and on
foreign accounts, with declining domestic savings and growing foreign indebt-
edness. While economic and social objectives have been partially achieved,
the process has led to severe financial and economic disequilibria that have
been sustained only by dependence on foreign borrowing and the accumulation of
arrears.
7.       Mali's economic history can be divided into four periods (1960-67,
1967-74, 1974-80, and 1980-82) based roughly on changes in economic and poli-
tical conditions. The changes in economic and financial structure during
these four periods are indicated in the following tabulation:

These figures (as well as the economic indicators in Annex I) illustrate some
of the major trends in the Malian economy.
8.       Post-independence, 1960-67.  The first post-colonial government
undertook a major program of modernization that included an independent mone-
tary system, an ambitious five-year development plan, a program of industria-
lization based on state enterprises, and a welfare orientation intended to
keep prices down and to assure consumers an adequate supply of basic commodi-
ties. During this period, GDP growth was high in part because of favorable
climatic conditions, but public pricing and investment policies created finan-
cial imbalances that could not be sustained. Government budgetary deficits
often exceeded 5 percent of GDP. By 1967 the resource gap had quadrupled (as
a percent of GDP), net foreign assets had turned negative, and the debt ser-
vice ratio had risen to 19 percent. The economic crisis led to the signature
of monetary accords with France in early 1967, followed by a 50 percent deval-
uation in mid-1967 and reintegration with the franc zone in early 1968.  At
that time, the French Treasury opened an Operations Account for Mali to pro-
vide overdraft facilities to support the convertibility of the Mali franc.
9.       Economic Reform, the Sahelian Drought, and the Energy Crisis,
1967-74. In late 1968, a new government launched an ambitious but pragmatic
reform program that proposed to increase official commodity prices and liber-
alize private trade--especially in cereals. But the shock of the severe
Sahelian drought (1968-73), followed by a quintupling of petroleum prices
during 1972-74, caused economic performance during 1967-74 to be poor, leading
to a decline in the primary sector output and real per capita income.  These
shocks also prevented the new government from carrying out reforms, and eco-
nomic policies remained inadequate. For example, low official prices and
restrictive marketing regulations discouraged agricultural production and led
to increased food imports. Recourse to bank credit to finance the mounting

losses of state enterprises led to increased external debt. By 1974, the
economic imbalances--already large 7 years earlier--had either deteriorated
or not improved. Domestic dissaving was greater, net foreign assets had
fallen by over 100 percent, and public external debt more than doubled. The
resource gap was also larger although this reflects partly the large inflow of
foreign aid to sustain consumption after the 1968-73 drought.
10.      Uneven recovery, 1974-80.  Compared to the drought years, the sub-
sequent period was favored by generally better weather and more foreign aid.
There was more rapid growth of GDP, led by agriculture recovering from the
drought. But the severe disequilibria in public finances and external
accounts inherited from earlier periods were not corrected. Inflation in-
creased. Domestic dissavings and the resource gap remained high. The need to
finance increasingly large Government Treasury deficits and growing losses in
state enterprises caused short-term foreign liabilities to double. Borrowings
to finance the 1974-78 Development Plan caused external long-term public debt
to double as well. Despite a few abortive efforts late in the period, the
Goverment did not develop and carry out reforms. Continuing external shocks,
like a second jump in petroleum prices, hampered reform efforts, but the
availability of substantial foreign resources also made the imbalances more
manageable and relieved some of the pressures to change policies.
11.      New orientations, 1980-82.  Faced with both worsening financial
disequilibria and a more restrictive central bank credit policy, the Malian
Government at the end of 1980 requested technical and financial assistance
from both the Bank and the IMF to help it formulate and carry out a program of
economic reform and adjustment. IDA responded to this request with a US$10.4
million Economic Management and Training (EMT) project (Credit No. 1307-MLI).
The first assistance was in the field by mid-1981 under Project Preparation
Facility financing, and the project was approved in December 1982. The IMF
prepared a one-year Standby Program, which was approved for SDR 30.4 million
in May 1982, and a second, 18-month Standby Program is under negotiation. In
conjunction with this assistance, the Government has carried out numerous
reforms in the areas of public finances, government employment, education,
agriculture, and state enterprises.
12.      In public finances, Government has more than halved the budget defi-
cit, while also significantly reducing arrears, by increasing receipts faster
than expenditures. Regarding public employment, Government has reduced re-
cruitments and stopped automatic hiring of graduates. The education budget
has been reallocated in favor of basic education. In agriculture, Government
has both liberalized markets for coarse grains and groundnuts and substan-
tially increased official producer prices. Distortions in retail grains
markets have been reduced, as have the financial losses of the state marketing
board. The record for state enterprises is less positive, in part because of
difficulties in reducing excess employment, but the Government *s exploring
major restructuring options.



-5-
Development Policies
13.      1981-85 Development Plan.  This Plan continues to give priority: to
water development for the -ural population, livestock, and irrigation; to
agricultural and livestock production for achieving food self-sufficiency, for
supplying an expanded agro-industrial sector, and for increasing commodity
exports; to energy development; and to conservation of natural resources--
especially forests and pastures. More importantly, the new Plan emphasizes
for the first time the need for policy reforms to re-establish fundamental
financial and economic equilibria, notably by balancing the government budget,
reducing the balance of payments deficit, reducing the losses of the state
enterprises, reorienting education, controlling recruitment for the Civil
Service, and increasing local private participation in investments. Develop-
ment expenditures propooed by the new Plan are estimated at US$2.2 billion of
which US$1.7 billion would be required during the five-year planning period.
Foreign sources will be expected to provide over 85 percent of the financing.
At the end of 1982, the Government hosted, with UNDP assistance, a Donors
Roundtable Conference to solicit firm donor commitments for Plan financing.
Although unsuccessful as a pledging session, the Conference gave the Govern-
ment a forum to demonstrate its new receptivity to greater aid coordination
and to reiterate its request for non-incremental recurrent cost financing,
estimated at about US$300 million per year to help support policy reforms.
14.      Although the stated objectives of the Plan focus fairly well on the
major constraints to economic development in Mali, the link between investment
and objectives is weak. The document is essentially a cataloging of projects
rather than allocation plan for scarce domestic and foreign resources. As a
result, planned investments often appear to be too capital-intensive, unduly
focused on the secondary sector, and oriented towards now projects rather than
rehabilitation of existing assets. The Plan is also overly ambitious; the
implied annual investment level is about 50 percent greater than the planned
level for the 1974-80 period, which was itself only half realized. Implemen-
tation already appears to be far behind schedule. As in the past, the poor
performance and delays are caused by irsufficient project preparation, poor
project management, inadequate Government counterpart financing, and poor
supporting policies, as well as unrealistic expectations. These problems are
likely to persist, although the Government is increasingly open to a dialogue
with IDA and the IMF on improved resource allocation and investment budgeting.
15.      Foreign Aid.  Foreign aid finances practically all public investment
in Mali and is therefore critical for promoting future growth. More than half
of this aid is in the form of grants, and almost all the rest is loaned on
highly concessional terms by official aid agencies. Multilateral agencies
provide about two-fifths of long-term loans. IDA is by far the largest multi-
lateral lender, accounting for over half the multilateral loans and for
19 percent of total debt committed and outstanding at the end of 1982. Long-
term external public debt (about three-fourths of which is disbursed) has
increased substantially over the last 10 years, although debt levels per
capita and as a share of GDP have declined, reflecting the increase in offi-
cial grant aid and continued recourse to short-term liabilities drawn on the
Operations Account. Actual debt service payments on long-term debt have been
quite modest in the past, and in 1980-81 the debt-service ratio was lower than



in the late 1960s and the early 19703. The debt-service ratio could rise
significantly in the mid to late 1980s, but the Government is in the process
of rescheduling several loans. It is expected that this and other measures
(converting loans to grants and obtaining special balance of payment financ-
ing) will keep the debt-service ratio within manageable proportions.
PART II - WORLD BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
16.      The proposed credit would be the Association's thirtieth credit ex-
tended to Mali (:.ncluding two supplementary credits), which would bring total
commitments of IDA funds to US$292.2 million equivalent. Of the twenty-nine
operations already approved, eleven have been for agriculture and related
industries, eight for transport, two for education, two for telecommunica-
tions, two for energy, one each for smallscale industries, urban development,
power and water supply, and technical assistance. Agriculture and transporta-
tion represent the largest share of past commitments, with 37 and 28 percent,
respectively of total commitments. The experience with ongoing operations has
been mixed. In general, project implementation has been hampered by Mali's
difficult public finance situation, although the disbursement profile through
1981 for Mali is slightly more rapid than for both the West Africa Region and
all IDA countries. In addition, the International Finance Corporation has
made two investments for a total of US$3.2 million, one in a company manu-
facturing bleach and plastic products, and the other in a company processing
sheanut butter for export.
17.      The Bank Group's strategy in Mali is governed by the constraints and
potentials set out in Part I. The principal objectives of Bank Group assis-
tance are to help improve the country's economic policies, to finance produc-
tive investments, and to help develop institutions to implement policies and
projects effectively. The scope and pace of IDA's program depends on an on-
going assessment of the country's economic management; particularly upon the
willingness and ability of the government to address policy issues and under-
take reforms where they are needed.
18.      In response to the changed policy climate over the past two years
(para. 11), we are devising a flexible program of financial and technical
assistance. While our interventions will continue to be in the form of indi-
vidual projects, they will increasingly help promote reform in support of the
Government's efforts. Already, an economic management and training project,
begun last year, provides institutional support and detailed policy analysis
on which long-term structural reform can be based. The future lending program
includes investment projects in the rural sector, in general and social infra-
structure (transport, power, water supply, health, education) that directly
address policy and institutional issues--agricultural pricing and marketing,
public enterprise reform and public employment policies. Where possible,
projects will be closely related, as is the case with the proposed project and
a health development project--both cover the same general region and both
support each others' activities.

PART III - THE RURAL WATER SUPPLY SUB-SECTOR
The I.ural Water Supply (RWS) Sub-sector Situation
19.      The principal source of water supply in the rural areas in Mali is
groundwater which is generally found in small and discontinuous aquifers, and
is generally of good quality and in sufficient quantity to satisfy the needs
of individual villages. Annual rainfall ranges from 250 mm to 1,300 mm, and
is quite unevenly distributed. In the Sahelian zone, it is common to have a
e      dry season of close to 9 months, during which period the traditional dug wells
tend to dry up, forcing the villagers to rely on the few remaining contami-
nated surface sources (ponds, and small rivers), which ofton involve distances
of several kilometers.
20.      Overall, the rural population is highly dispersed, with more than
80 percent of the approximately 10,000 villages counting less than 600 resi-
dents. About 25 percent of the villages or only about 18 percent of the
entire oural population have access to safe water from modern water points,
while more than 7,000 villages still have to rely on contaminated water from
the above mentioned traditional sources. Water consumption estimates are
difficult to establish; it is likely that per capita consumption in the rural
areas of Mali is at the same level as in the general Sahelian context, that is
between 15-30 liters per capita per day (lcd).
RSW - Sub-sector Organization
21.      The main sub-sectoral institution is the Direction Nationale de
l'Hydraulique et de l'Energie (DNHE) under the State Minister in charge of
Industry and Equipment, which is responsible for establishing sector policies,
investment programs, preparation and execution, as well as supervision of
rural water supply (RWS) projects.
22.      A second department within the Ministry in the sector is the Direc-
tion Nationale de l'Operation Puits, (OP), the Government agency for open well
construction. This department, which is not involved in sector policy, is
active in 17 scattered geographical areas, with a staffing of around 350.
OP's programs are financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), and by
several donors under RWS components of rural development ojects.
23.      The RWS sub-sector, and in particular the borehole programs, have
been developed almost exclusively with external assistance both as HWS pro-
jects and as part of rural development projects. The major programs have been
financed by UNDP/UNICEF, HELVETAS (Switzerland), CCCE (France), SADF (Saudi-
Arabia), JICA (Japan) and various non-governmental agencies. Each donor
agency has, in principle, been assigned its own geographical area, and sepa-
rate executing mechanisms under the supervision of DNHE have been set-up.
From the mid 1970s, when these programs started following the drought, invest-
ments in the order of US$5.5 million per annum have been nxecuted, resulting
in approximately 1,600 productive boreholes by mid-I982.  New programs under
preparation would increase the drilling activities from currently 700 to about
1,000 boreholes per annum. While this would represent a major expansion over



ac-tual levels, it would still be far from sufficient to correspond to the
iaceds* Investments of an estix.rited US$150 million (in 1982 prices) or 3 to 4
times the present levels over the next 7-8 years in the form of accelerated
drilling programs would be required to achieve the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade goals of supplying water to the entire
rural population. It would appear more realistic to expect meeting these
goals with a delay of at least 5 to 10 years.
RWS Sub-sector Issues
24.      Throughout its recent development, the principal issues the sub-
sector faced can be summarized as follcws:
(i) lack of rational medium and long-term planning for a coherent overall
sector development strategy;
(ii)  lack of organizational discipline and coordination between DIHE and OP;
(iii)  inadequate budget provisions for planning, construction and super-
vision, and for maintenance;
(iv)  shortage of qualified national technical personnel; and
(v)  insufficient experience in designing RWS projects demonstrated by
gt) an absence of promotional campaigns to encourage active village
participation including contribution to construction, decisions as to
technical and financial aspects of investments and maLintenance; and
(2) absence of cross-sectoral linkages with he.Ilth and general de-"el-
opment services.
Sub-sector Policies
25.      The lessons from past and ongoing projects have not gone unnoticed by
the Nalian Government and by the donors active in this sub-sector.  DNHE, in
view of its expanding activities in the RWS sub-sector, has with increasing
support by the donors, started to cope with the above issues and adopted the
following new policy orientation:
(i)  Regionalization of programs by limiting the zone of action for each
drilling unit in order to reduce the cost per well. This policy has
been successful and resulted in almost doubling the output of the
UNDP/UNICEF projects;
(ii)  Financial participation by villagers for both purchase and mainte-
nance of handpumps to promote the ownership concept, thus encouraging
the population to actively assume maintenance responsibilities of
their own investments. Positive results are being gained under the
ongoing 3 major RWS projects;
(iii) Increased importance of training at the village level to achieve
self-sufficiency in maintenance by the villages in the RIS sub-
sector;



- 9 -
(iv) Decentralization of DMHE's RYS project management and improved coor-
dination of programs to ensurp flexibility of execution locally and
enhance coherent and standardizea approaches to sector and project
issues; and
(v) Closer linkage of water and health aspects in the design and imple-
mentation of RWS projects to maximize the synergistic effects.
26.     These policies deserve full support by IDA, more so as they refle*-t
the state of art of the RWS situation in the Sahelian countries.
Bank's Lending
27.     The RWS sub-sector receives relatively plentiful external assistance,
essentially for the development of rural groundwater sources. The proposed
project represents IDA's first free-standing RWS project for Kali, and
reflects the Association's lending strategy in the sub-sector which is, over
and beyond past involvement in this sub-sector through components of rural
development projects, focussed on- national strategy development and institu-
tion building through (i) promotion of appropriate organizational improvements
in project design, execution, and subsequent operations; and (ii) support of
sub-sector policies, in particular with respect to technical design, benefi-
ciaries' participation and cross-sectoral linkages with health. The proposed
project has been pre,ared in close coordination writh a health development
project, and it includes direct support to that project (para. 29(i)). The
Association is assisting in the development of the urban water supply sub-
sector through the water supply component of the llali Power/Water Project (Cr.
No. 1282-ltLI) which focuses on the utility's sound institutional development.
PAT IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28.     The proposed project was identified in 1980 in parallel with the pro-
posed health development project. In October 1980 an advance of USSO.44 million
was granted under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for preparatory
studies. A further advance of USS$O.5r million was granted in August 1983, to
finance construction of a project base, necessary to accelerate project imple-
mentation and for advance training of national staff. The project was
appraised in October/November, 1982. Negotiations were held in Washington, in
October 1983. The Government delegation was headed by the Director of DNEE.
A Credit and Project summary is given at the beginning of this report and a
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 4402-LIl, dated November 17, 1983, is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A supplementary project
data sheet is presented in Annex III.
Project Objectives and Description
29.     Together with the proposed health development project, the project
aims at improving living and sanitary conditions in the proj".ct area. The
proposed project's main goals are to:



- 20 -
(i) supply water for basic human needs in about 215 villages in the
district of Kita and 15 villages in the districts of Bafoulabe and
Kenieba where health centers would be built under the proposed
health development project;
(ii)  set-up an operation and maintenance (0&N) system of the water points
to ensure availability of spare parts and emphasize maximum self-
reliance by villagers; and
(iii)  strengthen the capability of DMKE to identify, prepare and manage RiS
projects, as well as provide technical assistance to villagers for
maintenance of the handpumps.
30.      The project consists of:
(i) provision of about 325 productive boreholes in the district of Kita
during a four-year drilling campaign, and provision of about 15
productive boreholes during the first campaign in the villages in the
districts of Bafoulabe and Kenieba where health centers would be
built;
(ii)  installation of about 340 handpunps and supply of necessary replace-
ments and spare narts;
(iii)  management of the project including:  (a) consultant services for
project preparation (financed under the PPF), (b) construction of
Project Nanagement offices, garage and warehouse "Base de Kita  -
(financed under the PPF), and (c) technical assistance to DNHE for
Project Management including geophysical survey for well siting,
promotional activities at the village level as well as supply and
operation of the necessary equipments and vehicles for the DuKE's
field team;
Civ)  consultant services for a mid-project revi-zv (para. 33) and
preparation of a second project in the districts of Bafoulabe ant
K-enilba; and
(v) construction of additional water points and/or supply and installa-
tion of additional equipments and/or additional consultant services,
activities to be defined at the time of a mid-project review to be
carried out during the third drilling campaign by an independent
consultant, to take advantage of opportunities emerging during the
first years of implementation.
Project Cost and Financing
31.      Total project cost is US$11.9 million including US$0.4 million in
fuel taxes. US$10.0 million is in foreign exchange. This excludes import
duties, which are not applicable. Project costs have been calculated after a
detailed analysis of each component based on cost data from similarly orga-
nized RWS projects in Sahelian countries, compared with quotations obtained
for similar works recently tendered in the West African region and take into
account the estimated low success rate of drillings in the project area (50



- 11 -
percent). Base cost is calculated as of end 1982. The average cost of techni-
cal assistance (including salary, social charges, international travel, local
allowances and company overhead) has been estimated at US$ 7,300 per month.
Allowances for physical contingencies on construction works and consultant
services at average rates of 15 percent are provided, and price contingencies
have been included at a rate of 8 percent in 1983, 7.5 percent in 1984, 7
percent in 1985, and 6 percent thereafter for foreign exchange components and
at a rate of 15 percent in 1983, 12 percent in 1984, and 10 percent thereafter
for local cost components.
32.      The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 4.4 million (USS4.6 million) and
Credit from the IDA Special Fund of SDR 6.0 million (US$6.3 million) would
finance 92 percent of project cost, or 95 percent of project costs net of
taxes. The remaining project costs of US$1.0 million would be covered by
Xalian counterpart funds, of which US$0.1 million are estimated to be contrib-
uted directly from the project beneficiaries.
Project Implementaation
33.      DNHE, under the State Ninister in charge of Industry and Equipment,
would be responsible for the implementation of the project.  Detailed designs
and tender documents financed uiLder the PPF, are being .prepared.  They will be
ready by December 1983. For bid evaluation, contract preparation and construc-
tion supervision, DME will be assisted by an engineering consultant selected
in accordance with Bank guidelines. The signature of the contract with the
consultants would be a condition of effectiveness (Development Credit Agree-
ment (DCA) Section 6.01(c) and Special Fund Credit Agreement (SFCA) Section
6.01(d)). It would be important that actual drilling activities start by
October 1984; the project activities would extend to end 1989. During the
third drilling campaign, DME will employ a qualified and independent con-
sultant to carry out a mid-project review and an evaluation of the activities
to be included in the fourth drilling campaign (DCA and SFCA, Sections 3.09).
For training and promotional activities at the village level, DNHE would be
supported by the Office de Developpement Integre des Productions Arachidieres
et Cerealiares (ODIPAC), an IDA-supported rural extension agency, and the
Direction Nationale de l'Alphab&tisation Fonctionnelle et de la Lingaistique
Appliqu6e (DNAFLA), the national functional literacy agency. To this end,
DNHE will enter into arrangements with ODIPAC and DNAFLA for this support no
later than 1 April 1984 (DCA and SFCA Sections 3.07). Timing of implementa-
tion with the proposed health development project will be closely monitored,
in particular the drilling of boreholes for the health centers.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.      The contract for the drilling of boreholes would be awarded through
ICB procedures in accordance with the IDA Special Fund guidelines. The con-
tract for supply and installation of handpumps, as well as other contracts for
possible additional work or equipment would be awarded through ICL procedures
in accordance with IDA guidelines. For the technical assistance and studies,
consulting firms would be selected in accordance with procedures acceptable to
IDA. The technical assistance contract would cover 95 man-months, and also
the supply and operation of related vehicles and equipment. No domestic



- 12 -
preference will apply in contract award, because of the absence of qualified
local contractors and/or suppliers.
35.      The proposed Credits would be disbursed as follows:

Tol1     _4.6                      6.3
36.      The Government contribution will be paid to a Project Account in six
installments. Allocation by the Government for its 1984 fiscal year of MF 110
million (USS147,500 equivalent) for the project, establishment of the Project
Account, and payment of the first installment of MF 20 million (US$26,500
equivalent) would be conditions of effectiveness of the Credits. (DCA Sections
3.01(b) and 6.01(a) and (b) and SFCA Sections 3.01(b) and 6.01(a) and (c)).
Further installments of NF 90 million, MF 110 million, MP 150 million, MF 190
million and MY 90 million (US$121,000 US$S147,500, USS200,000, US$255,000, and
US$S121,000 equivalent) would be paid before the beginning of each drilling
campaign not later than August 31, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 respec-
tively (DCA and SFCA - Sections 3.01(c)); proceeds of the villagers' contri-
bution will also be paid to the Project Account (DCA and SFCA Sections
3.01(c)). This account will be managed by the Project Nanager, supervised by
the Director of DNHE, and subject to regular review by Bank staff and an
annual external audit (DCA and SFCA Sections 4.01 (b)). Funds will be used
for payment of the portion of the drilling contract not covered by the IDA
Special Lund Credit, for purchase of cement required for site preparation,
spare parts for vehicles as well as some office supplies on the basis of a
budget established for each drilling campaign. The budget would be prepared
three months before the beginning of each drilling campaign and reviewed by
IDA (DCA and SFCA Sections 3.06).
Affordability and Cost Recovery
37.      An important parameter in project design has been the emphasis on
minimizing the financial burden on the DNHE's budget. Hence, beneficiaries
will assume the cost of regular pump maintenance, including purchase of spare
parts and of repair interventions by the DNHE, estimated at MF 26,500 per
waterpoint in 1982 prices, or almost 45 percent of expected annual operation
and maintenance costs.- By project completion, total annual recurrent costs
are estimated to be MF 21.5 million per annum in 1982 constant prices, of
which DNEE would provide NF 12 million per annum or 9 percent of its 1982 RWS



- 13 -
sub-sector budget. Annual Government counterpart contributions to project
implementation should serve as an adequate "primer" for budgeting allocations
to DNEE in post-project years. During negotiations the Government gave assur-
ances that, after the project implementation period, adequate resources re-
flecting these estimated annual maintenance requirements would be provided for
in DNHE's annual budget (DCA and SFCA Sections 4.02).
38.      Full recovery of capital costs by beneficiaries is not feasible for
RWS projects in the Sahelian zone. However, in line with recent Government
policy to encourage rural communities to participate to the extent possible in
the financing of handpumps and to assume greater responsibility in the opera-
tion of the subsector, the project aims at partial recovery for handpumps.
Thus, prior to installation of the handpump, the villages will be asked to pay
to the Project Account a contribution of KF 270,000 (US$360), representing
about one-third of the purchase price of the pump and the full cost of the
cement necessary for site preparation in 1982 prices. The amount, together
with the contribution to operation and maintenance costs, is within the
affordability range of the beneficiaries, and surveys have shown that the
willingness to assure this contribution as well as the necessary expenditures
for subsequent maintenance is very high among the target population. DNHE
will enter into arrangements with each participating village setting out the
responsibilities of each village, including the financial and physical con-
tribution in construction, operation and maintenance of water points (DCA and
SFCA Sections 3.08).
Project Benefits and Risks
39.      The main benefits of the project would be the increased availability
of safe drinking water in the project area year round. This is expected to
result, in conjunction with the proposed health development project in
improved health among the affected rural population. As a further benefit the
project would promote initiatives of community organization by institu-
tionalizing water and health related activities at the village level, thus
serving as a vehicle towards further community development. By attempting to
mnaxmize the responsibilities of the beneficiaries themselves in organization
and management, and in the financial aspects of those activities, the project
would also reduce the incremental burden of the nazional budget of DNHE.
40.      A major benefit at the regional level will be the installation of a
nucleus field team of DNHE in the First Administrative Region within the
framework of the decentralization policies of the Government for the R1S sub-
sector. This field office would remain in place after project completion to
continue supervision of 0& of the water points, and the execution of future
generation RWS projects in that region.
41.      The main risks pertain to the sustained maintenance of boreholes and
handpumps. The Sahelian experience has shown that the most promising results
are reached when a sense of ownership of communal wells is fostered in vill-
agers and the responsibility for their maintenance is given to the rural
community. However, given the relative early stages of the RYS sector devel-
op=ent and recent adoption of this orientation, many questions related to
sustained community motivation to use and maintain the investments, and to the



- 14 -
real impact on health and living conditions remain and can be answered only
during actual project implementation. The project consequently emphasizes
village promotion and training activities. Also, to further reduce this risk,
the concept of a "contract' between the Government and the rural communities,
will be applied in the project following positive experience from other
similar rural water supply projects in Mali (para. 38). Still, the rural
communities would not be able to solve all their maintenance and repair prob-
lems, but will need a viable outside support structure. This will be provided
by DNHE with the assistance of ODIPAC and DNAFLA as these agencies have
already established a presence in the project area and are accepted by the
rural communities.
42.      On the technical side, it is possible that the projected success rate
of 50 percent might not be attained, leading to higher cost per productive
borehole.   However, this success rate is conservative in comparison with
countrywide estimates, which are in the 60 percent range. Meticulous applica-
tion of geophysical works prior to drilling as well as improved knowledge of
hydrogeological characteristics during project execution should ensure more
positive results. As to water quality, while an unknown factor at present,
this is unlikely to prove of major concern, based on experiences in adjacent
RWS program zones with similar geological formations.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.      tie Development and Special Fund Credit Agreements between the Repub-
lic of Mali and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executire Directors separately.
44.      Special conditions of the project including conditions of effective-
ness are listed in Section III of Annex III.
45.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development and Special Fund Credits
will comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development and Special Fund Credits.

/6/  Labor Force from World Development Report 1983; these figures actually represent the 1980 labor force.
Bank estimates of value added by sector are not yet available. These figures were calculated by assuming
that between 1981 and 1982 the sectors changed (relatively to one another) as noted in the IHF Staff Report.
These relative changes were applied to 1981 Bank's sectoral breakdown and scaled to sum  to GNP.
