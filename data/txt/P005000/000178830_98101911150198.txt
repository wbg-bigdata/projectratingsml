EGYPT
APPRAISAL OF KAFR EL DAWAR AND EL BEIDA
TEXTILE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to replace obsolete equipment and
expand production of the Government-owned Misr Fine Spinning and Weaving
Company Kafr El Dawar (KED) and Misr El Beida Dyers (EB) both located near
Alexandria, Egypt. The project is expected to cost US$153 million equivalent
including financing of sector assistance and be completed by July 1979. In
the case of KED, annual manufacturing capacity will be increased by 10.1 mil-
lion linear meters of polyester/cotton fabrics; 16.5 million meters of fine
cotton fabrics of which 11.4 million meters would be exported; and about 1,200
metric tons of cotton yarn all of which would be exported. In the case of EB,
the company's annual converting (i.e. bleaching, dyeing, printing, merceriz-
ing, and finishing of yarn and fabrics) capacity will be increased by about
43 million meters of fabric and 1,550 tons of yarn. In addition, obsolete
equipment witlh an annual production capacity of converting 30 million meters
of fabric and 500 tons of yarn will be replaced. The operations of the two
companies are closely interrelated as all of KED's production is converted by
EB on a commission basis. The project would benefit from existing management,
skilled labor, and infrastructure and would use locally grown cotton and
imported polyester fiber; it would also provide additional employment for
about 2,850 persons. Incremental output of the project would satisfy about
7% of the next ten years estimated expansion requirements.
ii.       Until the end of 1975 the two companies were wholly owned by the
Egyptian General Organization for Spinning and Weaving (EGOSW) which was
created in 1961 as a parastatal organization but dissolved as of December
31, 1975 along with all General Organizations. EGOSW was responsible for
most of the production of textiles in the country and was organized as a
holding company to function as a link between the Government (Ministry of
Industry) and the individual textile companies. The objective of the abo-
lishment of the General Organizations and thus of EGOSW was to remove a
superfluous layer of management and give the companies more freedom in their
day-to-day operations and make them more competitive. The companies are now
directly responsible to the Minister of Industry, who in the formulation of
sector policy, is assisted by a Higher Council, consisting of the chairmen
of the boards of all the public sector textile companies and representatives
from other Ministries.
iii.      The public sector dominates the textile industry and has the mono-
poly in yarn production. In 1974, the 30 public sector companies had combined
sales of LE 401 million (US$1,027 million) and were employing 266,000 persons.
The importance of the textile sector is underlined by the fact that, besides
providing for nearly all of the local needs, textile products have in 1974
accounted for 43% of exports of manufactured goods. Despite the importance
of the textile sector to the Egyptian economy no comprehensive sector stud-
ies have been done in the past. To overcome this deficiency, the Bank
Group financed a detailed study of this sector under the Agriculture and
Industrial Imports Project of December 1974 (CR. No. 524-EGT and LN. No.



- ii -
was completed in May 1976 and its findings are presently being reviewed by the
Government and the Bank.
iv.       In the last five years domestic per capita consumption of textiles
rose at about 2% per annum. To meet this increase, exports had to be cur-
tailed and some fabrics had to be imported since increases in local production
could not cope with demand. The per capita consumption of textile fibers in
Egypt (4.5 kg. per year), though much lower than in the US or Western Europe
(22.5 and 14.0 kg. respectively), is somewhat higher than in countries of a
sirmilar income level; this is mostly due to the existence in Egypt of a
domestic textile industry based on local cotton and controlled domestic
prices cf textiles. Assuming a moderate growth in the domestic demand for
textiles, the projections show that very considerable investments in the
industry will be required to satisfy this demand and to maintain Egypt's
expcrts of cotton textiles. At the same time it is clear that the increas-
irig demands of the domestic textile industry will reduce the cotton available
for exports. To deal with the anticipated reduction in fiber availability and
at the same time maximize export earnings, the Government is planning to estab-
lish plants for the domestic production of synthetic fibers and to import
short staple cotton in the future so as to restrain the use of premium
Egyptian long staple cotton for local consumption unduly.
v.        About 35% of the domestic fabric consumption is of so-called "ra-
tioned" fabrics which are allocated to each individual at subsidized Govern-
ment-controlled prices, which often do not cover production costs. Prices
for non-rationed fabrics are also controlled by ,-he Government, but the com-
panies can obtain high enough prices to recoup their losses on the "rationed"
fabrics. It appears that the pricing mechanism designed to give the local
consumer low-priced textiles is not always effective; within its review of
the overall price structure the Government is currently studying the situa-
tion, taking into account the Bank's observations on this matter.
vi.       Although exports of textiles are of great importance to the Egyp-
tian balance of payments, the proportion of the country's exports in the
world textile trade has accounted for only about 2% of the total trade and
less than 5% of the cotton yarn and fabrics trade. About 60-70% of Egypt's
textiles exports go to the relatively unsophisticated markets in the Eastern
European and Arab countries. Quotas for Egyptian textiles in the European
Community and the US have not been filled by a wide margin for several years
and a modest increase in the country's exports as envisaged under the project
is not expected to present any significant marketing problems.
vii.      KED and EB both started operations in 1938 as private companies
and were nationalized in 1963. The companies have been operating at capacity
for some time and employ about 21,000 and 7,000 persons respectively. Both are
operated by local, highly competent management teams; they are profitable and
have sound financial positions. To carry out the project, each company has
already established an implementation unit. Their managements are fully
capable of implementing the project, provided some limited assistance is
provided in such areas as procurement, production planning and quality
control systems. This will be done through a Technical Advisor firm to
be selected during July 1976.



- iii -
viii.     Total financing required for the project would amount to about
US$153 million equivalent of which US$105 million would be in foreign cur-
rency. Most of the foreign exchange financing is proposed to be met by loans
from the Bank (US$52 million) and by the Arab Fund for Social and Economic
Development (Kuwaiti Dinars 10 million or US$34.5 million equivalent). The
proposed Bank loan would primarily finance the weaving equipment for KED and
all of the converting equipment for EB, and would be made to the Arab Republic
of Egypt at an interest rate of 8.85% per annum for 15 years including 4 years
of grace. Except for some financing for sectoral assistance (US$1.3 million),
the loan would be on-lent to the two companies at 10% interest with the same
repayment terms as those of the loan.   The Arab Fund loan would finance most
of the foreign exchange required for spinning equipment for the KED sub-project.
The balance of foreign exchange of US$18.6 million would be supplied by the
Government. Financing of local costs of about US$48 million equivalent is
envisaged to come from the following sources: (a) the companies' own genera-
tion of funds; (b) a suspension of dividend payments by the companies to the
Government during the implementation period of the project; (c) the repayment
of transfers made previously by the companies to other public sector enterprises;
(d) an increase of the Government's share capital in the companies; and (e)
from local commercial sources. The Government has agreed that these alternatives
or a combination thereof will be explored and has assured the timely avail-
ability of the required local and foreign currency for the financing of
the project. Should there be any additional need for funds to complete
the project--either because of a project cost overrun or a shortage of funds--
it will also be the responsibility of the Government to find such funds in the
form acceptable,to the Bank.
ix.       The project is expected to increase further the companies' finan-
cial strength. The financial rates of return are calculated at 12% and 16%
for KED and EB respectively. After implementation of the project the debt/
equity ratio will be about 42/58 for KED and 24/76 for EB and each company
is expected to be able to service its debt comfortably. Furthermore, to
safeguard the financial positions of the companies, certain financial cove-
nants will apply. The two subprojects combined are expected to yield an
attractive economic rate of return of 22%. The project's annual net for-
eign exchange savings are estimated to reach about US$52 million equiva-
lent by 1980. The technical and commercial risks of the project are minor
because of the standard plant design and because its incremental output
would satisfy only a small portion of the next ten years estimated expan-
sion requirements.
x.        In addition to some outside assistance in the implementation of the
two sub-projects (US$0.3 million), provision has also made for technical
assistance in the preparation of a feasibility study for a new textile project
(US$0.1 million) as well as training abroad of technical and supervisory
personnel from the textile sector (US$0.2 million). Also US$1.0 million is
included to provide technical support for the task force to be established by
the Government to develop an action program and institutional measures to
revitalize exports of industrial goods to convertible currency areas.
xi.       On the basis of the agreements reached with the Government, KED
and EB, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$52 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Egypt has requested Bank financing of US$52 mil-
lion for about 49% of the foreign exchange expenditures of two fully state-
owned textile companies, Kafr El Dawar (KED) and El Beida (EB) both located
in Kafr El Dawar (Map IBRD 11966) to expand their production from 107 to 134
million linear meters and from 135 to 178 million linear meters respectively;
to replace obsolete equipment and to assist in sector training and export
development. Estimated total financing required for the project is LE 59.8
million (US$153.2 million). The remainder of the foreign exchange required
would be provided by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (Arab
Fund) and the Government of Egypt. Local financing would be made available
from retained earnings of the companies, new Government share capital and
other local sources. Both sub-projects are expected to be completed by
July 1979.
1.02      The operations of the two companies are closely interrelated since
all of KED's output (grey yarn and fabrics) is converted by EB on a commis-
sion basis. KED is one of the largest and more efficient mills in Egypt
with a satisfactory operating performance and relatively high product quality.
During 1968-75 the company exported about 40% of its production of fabrics,
or about one-third of total Egyptian exports of fabrics. EB is the largest
converting operation in Egypt with 25% of all installed capacity for bleaching
mercerizing, dyeing, printing and finishing of yarn and fabrics. The KED and
EB sub-projects would account for only a small portion (4.2% and 7.6% respec-
tively) of the textile sector's estimated expansion and replacement require-
ments over the next 10 years.
1.03      Bank Group involvement in the Egyptian textile sector commenced
in 1973 when IDA made a credit of US$18.5 million to help finance the Cotton
Ginning Rehabilitation Project (CR. No. 423-UAR). Subsequently, a study of
the textile sector was included as part of the Bank Group's Agricultural and
Industrial Imports Project (CR. No. 524-EGT and LN. No. 1062-EGT) of December
1974. This study, completed in May 1976, will serve as the basis for future
Bank Group involvement in the sector. Without preempting the final findings
of the study, the Government decided to request Bank financing of KED and EB
since priority was given to the expansion of these two companies already at
the initiation of the study. This decision was later supported by the find-
ings of the sector study. The Bank assisted the Government and the companies
in the preparation of the project.
1.04      The project was appraised in January 1976 by a mission consist-
ing of Messrs. A. Sandig (Chief), N. Petry, and M. Sarris of the Industrial
Projects Department and F. Kaps of the EMENA Region. A glossary of tech-
nical terms used in the textile industry is given in Annex 1.
II. THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANIES (KED AND EB)
A.   Structure of the Textile Industry
2.01      During nationalization of industrial enterprises which began in
1961, most of the existing textile companies became state-owned and were



-2-
until the end of 1975 incorporated into the Egyptian General Organization for
Spinning and Weaving (EGOSW).  EGOSW was a holding company reporting to the
Ministry of Industry, and was responsible for operating, coordinating, super-
vising and developing the textile sector. In 1974 the 30 textile companies
(Annex 2-1) in the public sector had combined sales of LE 401 million
(US$1,027 million) and employed 266,000 persons. Although some of the com-
panies had a small number of residual private shareholders, over 95% of the
shares were owned by EGOSW.
2.02      By Presidential Decree No. 111 dated September 4, 1975 all General
Organizations, including EGOSW, were dissolved effective December 31, 1975
and all shares of the former subsidiary companies were transferred from EGOSW
to the Government. The decree removed EGOSW as an intermediary and made
the companies directly responsible to the Ministry of Industry. EGOSW has
been replaced by the Hligher Council which is presided over by the Minister
of Industry. The Council members comprise the Chairmen of the Boards of
all the 30 textile public sector companies, as well as representatives of
the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, Planning and Economy. The Higher
Council has advisory rather than line responsibilities, and while the
purpose of the decree is to give greater freedom and flexibility to the
mainagements of the individual companies and hence to permit them to act in
a more competitive manner, specific policies in these areas will still have
to be determined. The management and the structure of the individual com-
panies have not been affected by the abolishment of EGOSW.
B.   Organization, Operation and Financial Performance of the Textile Sector
1.   Organization
2.03      The textile industry covers a wide range of activities such as
spinning, weaving, converting, knitting and garment manufacturing. Since
nationalization in 1963, all spinning and converting as well as 70% of weaving,
45% of knitting and 30% of garment manufacturing have been part of the pub-
lic sector; the balance being carried out by several hundred small companies
in the private sector. Because of the dominant position of the public sector
and because only limited statistical data is available about the private sec-
tor, the historical situation of the textile industry can best be described
in terms of EGOSW data.
2.04      The 30 public sector companies formerly controlled by EGOSW produce
mostly cotton textiles but also manufacture synthetic fibers, jute products,
spare parts for textile machinery and carpets. Each of these companies had and
still has a similar organizational structure with Boards consisting of a
Chairman, four executive directors representing the management, and four
memnbers elected from amongst the employees.
2.   Operations
2.05      In the last eight years (1968-75) the number of spindles and looms
increased by about 40% and 30% respectively (Annex 2-2). Also, output per
loom increased by 15% as modern equipment was installed. Nevertheless in-
vestments in new facilities and the rate of replacement of obsolete eqtuipment



- 3 -
during this period have been far from adequate as -- despite full capacity
utilization of the industry and a good potential for exports -- domestic
consumption of textiles showed only a modest increase (para. 3.01) and textile
exports decreased. All mills operate on four shifts, 350 days per year.
Consequently, repairs and maintenance have regularly to be carried out during
working hours affecting adversely the efficiency and actual capacity utiliza-
tion. The mills are operated by local management and technicians and in view
of the age of the equipment -- more than half is over 25 years old -- as well
as continuous shortage of spare parts making working conditions and maintenance
particularly difficult, the performance of management and supervising personnel
for most of the companies must be rated as highly satisfactory. At the same
time because of Government employment policies, the mills are heavily over-
staffed resulting in labor productivity (para 2.12) substantially lower than
in the US and Western Europe although still somewhat higher than in most other
developing countries.
2.06      Locally grown cotton is the industry's major raw material and
accounts for 96% of fiber input. In 1975, 48.7% (218,000 tons) of cotton
production was consumed locally by the textile mills; the rest was exported
and continued to constitute Egypt's most valuable single export crop. In
1974, the last year for which complete export data is available, exports of
cotton and cotton products accounted for about 70% of the value of all Egyptian
exports. In the same year exports of cotton yarn and fabrics accounted for
43% of exports of semi-finished and finished products (Annex 2-3).
3.   Financial Position of the Textile Industry
2.07      An analysis of the consolidated income statements and balance
sheets for EGOSW for the years 1968-74 (Annex 2-4) reveals that a careful
control of input and output prices has been exercised since all operating
ratios have stayed remarkably constant.

During the same period internal cash generation of the EGOSW companies was
of the order of LE 269 million (US$689 million) while total investment was
only about LE 137 million, or about half. Of the difference some 30% was paid
to the workers and the remaining 70% went to the Government's budget in the
form of dividends as required by law. Leverage is quite low with a debt/



- 4 -
equity ratio of 23/77 for EGOSW as a whole as of the end of 1974. The for-
eign exchange for purchasing textile machinery has come mostly from bilateral
sources and from the Government's reserves.
2.08      Overall, the industry has a good financial record -- the problem
being not generation but inadequate retention of funds. The substantial
transfers by the industry to the Government as are required by law and
the shortage of foreign exchange have, as mentioned previously, limited
the individual companies' ability to replace obsolete equipment and invest
in new facilities. Since the majority of Egypt's textile machinery is very
old, there is no doubt that in the future the textile industry will require
substantial investments (paras. 3.05 and 3.06).
2.09      A related matter is the complete financial dependence of the in-
dividual companies on the Government. Up to now, the companies have had
no freedom in using their self-generated funds and the only vehicle of obtain-
ing funds has been the annual budget. As a sequel to the abolishment of the
General Organizations, the Ministry of Finance is now in the process of
developing a new financial policy for all public sector companies.  This is
expected to allow the companies more freedom in making use of their own funds
and in borrowing from banks. At this time, however, it is difficult to predict
when this new policy will become effective and what specific form it will take.
C.   KED and Its Operations
2.10      KED was established in 1938 and nationalized in 1963.  The company
has always concentrated on the spinning and weaving of very fine yarns and
grey fabrics. The company enjoys a near monopoly position in the production
of fine poplins for the domestic market and is, by providing about 25% of the
country's fabric exports, an important earner of foreign exchange. KED has
only spinning and weaving facilities and depends for all converting of its
products on EB. KED with a work force of about 21,000 is the second largest
employer in the textile industry. Its present share capital of LE 2.2 million
is wholly owned by the Government.
2.11      The management of KED is competent and most of the top managers have
been with the company for many years. In May 1975, when the previous chairman
was appointed Minister of Industry, Mr. Hussein Fahmy, who had been the com-
pany's marketing director, became chairman. The Board members are listed
in Annex 2-5 and the organization chart of the company is shown in Annex 2-6.
2.12      KED's main operations (5 spinning and 3 weaving mills) are located
in one complex near the village of Kafr El Dawar, 15 miles southeast of
Alexandria, the second most important city of Egypt. The company also has
a spinning mill in Mahmoudia, 20 miles from Kafr El Dawar, and another is under
construction at Komhamada, 30 miles north of Cairo. In 1975 KED produced 100
million linear meters of fabric including 26 million meters for export and
1,700 tons of yarn and sewing thread. KED's production and other statistical
data for the period 1969-75 are shown in Annex 2-7. Production and efficiency
figures per spindle and per loom are very good in relation to the type of
equipment and fineness of the yarns and fabrics produced. Although the wages
paid by KED are low in comparison to other, including developing countries-



-5-
this advantage is largely offset by KED's low labor productivity due to
overemployment. The result is that labor costs per unit of output are nearly
the same as for example, in the US textile industry where wages are very much
higher (Annex 2-7).
D.   Financial Analysis of KED - Past and Future (without the Project)
2.13      The historical financial statements of KED are shown in Annex
2-8 and earnings forecasts through 1985, together with the assumption made,
are given in Annex 2-9. These projections assume that no major investments
would be undertaken by the company. Key financial data are summarized below.

The historical financial statements for KED indicate a satisfactory earnings
and financial record and one that is better than the average EGOSW enter-
prise. They also show an earning pattern which reflects the stability of
KED's domestic market and the policy of the Government to ensure that input
and output prices are correlated. Although KED's export sales volume, due to
worldwide recession in textiles, has significantly deteriorated over the past
two years, this has been offset by an increase in world textile prices,
leaving the export earnings nearly unaffected. For 1976 a significant recovery
in export volume is expected. The company has very little debt and the
liquidity has been satisfactory; also the projections indicate that KED would
remain financially sound.
E.   EB and Its Operations
2.14      EB was established in 1938 and nationalized in 1963 with the
Government owning all the shares.  The company's plant is also located near
the village of Kafr El Dawar and its management is considered very competent
with an impressive number of able executives. Dr. Shazli, who had been
chairman of EB for over 15 years, retired at the end of 1975 and Dr. Borai,
previously the chairman of another public sector converting company, took
his position. Board members are listed in Annex 2-10 and EB's organization
chart is shown in Annex 2-11. Most of the company's business consists of
converting yarn and fabrics on a commission basis with about three-fourths



-6-
deriving from the public sector and the rest from private sector companies.
In 1975 its production amounted to 1,270 tons of yarn and 142 million meters of
fabric, approximately 25% of the total Egyptian output. In the late 60's the
company started to diversify and is now the only Egyptian producer of wool
tops and synthetic tops (Annex 2-12).  In 1975 production of these items
reached 5,100 tons and thus accounted for 56% of EB's sales revenue. Total
employment is about 7,000. The company is not credited with any export
earnings from its converting business and exports of wool tops accounted for
only 5% of EB's sales revenue in 1975.
F.   Financial Analysis of EB - Past and Future (without the Project)
2.15      The historical financial statements of EB are shown in Annex 2-13
and earnings forecasts through 1985 are given in Annex 2-14. As for KED
these projections assume that the company would undertake no major invest-
ments in new facilities. Key financial data are summarized below.

2.16      In the past, EB's financial position has been much stronger than
the average Egyptian textile company and sales have been growing steadily
reflecting an increasing demand for the company's services. Internal cash
generation has been impressive and in excess of the company's capital invest-
ments; the balance going to the Government's budget. More recently, however,
the company has had to borrow rather heavily to finance increases in current
assets which rose from about LE 12 million in 1973 to LE 26 million in 1975,
while sales increased by only about 35% during the same period. Part of
this increase is explained by higher inventory levels of raw materials and
documentary credit. These reflect the company's hedging against the uncertain
raw material and foreign exchange availability. Equally noticeable, however, is
the increase in accounts receivable during 1974 and 1975. As a result of an
overall decrease in the liquidity of the public sector, there has been a
significant increase in the collection period mainly from the companies pur-
chasing EB's wool products. The recent introduction of a 6% p.a. interest
charge for overdue payments should, however, lead to a decrease in accounts
receivable and offset the cost of financing them. The inventory situa-
tion has already improved in 1976. With the expected reduction in the



collection period, it is projected that the company will be able to improve
its current ratio to 1.4 in 1976 and subsequently maintain a current ratio
of over 1.5 without much difficulty. It is also projected that the company
should be able to maintain its sound overall financial position. EB has
agreed to submit to the Bank within 6 months of the signing of the project
agreement a detailed study of its liquidity position under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank.
2.17      Since EB has to import about 75% of its chemicals and dyestuffs
and nearly all its wool and synthetic fiber requirements, it is most impor-
tant for the company that the foreign exchange for these purchases is promptly
provided by the Government; this has not always been the case. An agreement
to that effect has been received from the Government. The increased certainty
of the availability of foreign exchange will also allow EB to reduce its raw
material inventory levels.
III. MARKET AND MARKETING
A.   Past and Present Textile Situation in Egypt
3.01      Production, consumption, imports and exports of textiles (by major
groupings) in the last six years (1970-75) are shown in Annex 3-1. Since
1970 domestic consumption of fabrics has been rising at an average annual
rate of 4%, or by 2% on a per capita basis. The pattern of consumption and
production growth has been erratic although the growth of population and
consumption has been faster than increases in production. In order to achieve
at least a modest increase in consumption under these circumstances, exports
were reduced and in 1975 fifty million meters of fabric were imported from
China.
3.02      While much lower than in industrialized countries, textile consump-
tion in Egypt is somewhat higher than in countries with a comparable income
per capita (Annex 3-2). This is mostly due to the existence of a sizeable
domestic textile industry based on local cotton and the Government's policy to
control and subsidize the prices of utility fabrics of which a certain quantity
is allocated to each individual. These fabrics, which are also referred to
as "rationed" fabrics, account for about 35% of domestic consumption and are
frequently sold below production costs (Annex 3-3).
3.03      Egypt has essentially a sub-tropical climate and cotton products
meet 95% of consumer textile requirements. Most of the rural and urban male
population wear "galabiya," a traditional heavy cotton, loose, one-piece, out-
erwear; females wear "melay-laf," a black wraparound garment. In the large
cities, people wear European type clothing but wool accounts for less than 4%
of total fiber consumption. Imports of textiles until 1975 were almost non-
existent. Lately, easy-care polyester cotton blended fabrics have become
popular and while local production in 1974 was only 5.5 million meters (0.7%
of total production), 3 million meters were imported and an estimated 7



- 8 -
million meters were smuggled into Egypt; the current unsatisfied demand for
this type of fabrics is estimated at 37 million meters (Annex 3-4).
B.   Textile Fabrics Forecast for Egypt
3.04      Supply and demand forecasts for textile fabrics in 1985 are summarized
below and shown in detail in Annexes 3-5 and 3-6.

Available for Home Market             667         817          867     898
Total Consumption/Demand              663         812        1,059   1,371
Balance (Deficit)                       4           5         (192)   (473)
Population (million)                2  33.3        37.2         42.4    46.1
Apparent Consumption per capita (m ) 19.9          21.9         25.0    29.7
Production forecasts for textile fabrics are based on the assumption that
existing mills will operate at present levels of efficiency and capacity
utilization. Output of the proposed project is included as well as that of
minor expansions in progress or already approved. It is also assumed that
the expected future drop in production due to deterioration and attrition of
obsolete facilities will be compensated by purchase of new equipment. Under
these assumptions, the figures indicate only a modest increase in the pro-
duction of knitted fabrics in the private sector but generally demand for
textile products is expected to increase faster than supply.
3.05      The demand projection as given above has been made by using 1975
as base year and assuming a population growth of 2.2% per annum 1/, and a
6.5% GDP per capita growth up to 1980 and 6% thereafter. Income demand
elasticity for textiles implied in these projections is assumed to be 0.5;
this is somewhat lower than the 0.7 average for developing countries as a
whole 2/, as their present per capita consumption is considerably lower than
that of Egypt. It is also assumed that by 1985 the country's fabric exports
will have increased by 23% compared with 1975, or by 2.1% per year, i.e., the
same rate at which cotton consumption in the world is expected to grow. 2/ In

- 9 -
view of the importance for Egypt to increase its foreign exchange earnings
and the fact that revenues from exporting textile products, based largely
on a local resource (cotton), cannot be easily replaced by export of other
manufactured products the assumed export growth would be desirable and attain-
able.
3.06       Comparing the estimated demand and supply projections, it appears
that, unless additional production facilities are provided, in 1980 demand
will exceed supply by about 190 million square meters and in 1985 by about
470 million square meters. Even when assuming a more modest growth of demand
equal to that in the last five years (4% per annum), in 1980 demand will
still exceed supply by tbout 120 million square meters and in 1985 by about
300 million square meters. There are no comprehensive Government projections
of textile demand in Egypt and actual domestic consumption will largely depend
on overall economic development in the country, the priority given to exports
of yarn and fabrics, the level of investment in the textile industry and
Government policy regarding price and wage controls.
3.07      The Egyptian textile industry is facing three major problems in
the next ten years: (a) shortage of additional manufacturing capacity;
(b) need for substantial replacement of obsolete equipment; and (c) short-
age of cotton for export, assuming priority is given to the domestic market.
Solving the first two problems is largely a question of availability of
financing. The new Five-Year Plan for 1976-80 has not been finalized and
the allocation of investment funds for the textile sector is not yet avail-
able. The textile sector study (para 1.03) indicates that about US$1.0 bil-
lion, expressed in 1975 constant prices, would have to be invested in the
industry (75% in foreign currency) to achieve a supply/demand balance in 1985.
3.08      As noted, the equipment used by the textile industry is largely
obsolete with 72% of the looms and 44% of the spindles being over 25 years
old and 25% of all textile equipment in use for over 30 years. It has been
estimated that within the next ten years one million spindles and 10,000
looms plus auxiliary machinery (i.e. about 50% of existing equipment) should
be replaced. The cost of such replacement would also be close to US$1.0 bil-
lion. Consequently the cost of the proposed project represents approximately
7% of the financing which might be required for expansion and replacement of
obsolete equipment in the sector in the next ten years.
3.09       Egypt has been a major producer of cotton and in 1970 the country
accounted for almost 5% of world production (Annex 3-7). Since then pro-
duction has steadily been decreasing as the limited amount of arable land
has to accommodate an increasing demand for food crops. This, combined with
rising domestic consumption, resulted in a drastic decrease in cotton exports.
This trend is expected to continue in the future (Annex 3-7). Ninety percent
of the country's cotton exports is long and extra-long staple in which Egypt
has a dominant position, accounting for one-third of world production and al-
most half of world trade (Annexes 3-8 and 3-9). Long and extra long staple
cotton is more valuable than short staple cotton which, if imported, could



- 10 -
satisfy most of Egypt's cotton requirements. Therefore, in order to maximize
foreign exchange revenues, Egypt will have to import short staple to release
long and extra-long staple for export. Another measure to alleviate the fiber
shortage would be importation and/or local production of polyester fibers in
Egypt. A more detailed discussion of the present and future fiber situation
in Egypt is given in Annexes 3-10 and 3-11.
C.   Marketing of Textiles
1.   Distribution
3.10      Fabrics from the factories are sold either to public sector whole-
salers (80%), private wholesalers (15%), or private garment manufacturers
(5%) (Annex 3-12).  There are eight public wholesale organizations, six of
which are department stores with about 300 retail branches throughout the
country and the remaining two sell to 30,000 private retailers. Terms are
either cash or 90 days with LE 10,000 credit limit per account. Rationed
fabrics account for approximately 35% of total consumption with each indivi-
dual entitled to purchase 6 meters per annum (but not more than 26 meters per
family). Most of the rationed and cheaper fabrics (up to LE 0.3 per meter)
are distributed in roughly equal proportion by the department stores and the
two wholesale companies. The bulk (85%) of so called "novelty fabrics" (over
LE 0.3 per meter) is sold by the department stores. In 1974, Cairo, Alexandria,
and Tanta, the three largest cities, which accounted for 26.3% of the popula-
tion, recorded 35.4% of retail sales. They were served by 125 branches of
the department stores but only 5,000 retailers.
2.   Prices
3.11      Ex-factory prices of rationed fabrics are determined by the Ministry
of Industry in cooperation with the Ministry of Supply. There have been
no increases in these prices since 1968 and on average they are well below
costs (Annexes 2-4 and 3-3). It appears however that the consumer does
not always benefit from this policy as a good portion of rationed fabrics
is sold at retail prices considerably higher than those prescribed. Domestic
ex-factory prices of non-rationed fabrics have increased since 1968 by 25% but
are still about 7% lower than world prices. Also price controls for these
fabrics result in proliferation of the number of fabrics beyond actual market
requirements and do not provide any incentive to manufacturers to raise and/or
maintain a high quality of domestic fabrics.
3.12      Export prices of yarn and fabrics are determined by the competitive
conditions in world markets at the official rate of exchange. To compensate
the manufacturers for occasional losses on export sales within the imposed
quotas the Government operates a special export incentive scheme with the
level of incentives ranging according to market conditions. In 1975, the
incentive level was 15% of the FOB value of the goods exported to convertible
currency countries and 3% to bilateral and barter agreement countries.



- 11 -
3.13      Because of strict controls on wages and prices, a policy which is
likely to continue in the immediate future, production costs for woven cotton
fabrics increased by only 10% in the period 1970-75, i.e., much less than in
countries importing textiles. Consequently Egyptian cotton products are now
competitive even at the official exchange rate in world markets at prices
which are profitable to local manufacturers (Annex 2-4) and it appears that
the incentive scheme may no longer be required.
3.14      It is recognized that there are a number of issues regarding proper
pricing of inputs and outputs of the textile sector which are causing some
distortion in the sector. However, because of the state of flux in Egypt's
public sector, it is too early to expect immediate decisions and solutions
regarding these issues. The Bank's observations on the subject of the pricing
policy in the textile sector are described in Annex 3-13.
3.   Imports and Customs Duties
3.15      Imported fabrics are subject to customs duties ranging from 75-100%
ad valorem. In addition, import licenses are very difficult to obtain and
the procedure for the necessary foreign exchange allocation is very cumber-
some. Imports of fabrics have therefore been negligible amounting to only 2%
of the market in 1974 (Annex 3-1). More recently Government policy has changed
toward some liberalization of imports but it is too early to say what effect
this change may have on textile imports.
4.   The Export Situation
3.16      As pointed out, exports of cotton yarn and fabrics are a very impor-
tant element in the national economy and provided, in the period 197C-74, be-
tween 40% and 50% of the country's foreign exchange earnings in the manufac-
tured products category (Annex 2-3). Exports of yarn account for about one
quarter of total yarn production and exports of fabrics for 10-15% of total
fabric production. Constrained by the lack of modern equipment and growing
domestic requirements Egyptian exports have been largely restricted to yarn
and grey fabrics destined for markets in the Eastern European and Arab coun-
tries which, in the last five years, absorbed between 60 and 70% of exports.
In 1974 only 30% of the yarn and 35% of the fabrics exported were to the
European Community (EC) and other Western countries.
3.17      The proportion of Egyptian exports in world textile trade has been
small. In 1972 total imports of textile products by developed market economy
countries amounted to US$14,265 million of which Egypt's exports (US$288
million) accounted for only about 2% of the total 1/. Also, in terms of
volume, Egypt's share in world exports of cotton yarn and fabrics decreased
from 6.5% in 1970 to less than 5% in 1974 (Annex 2-3). Hong Kong remained
1/   UN Conference on Trade and Development Statistics, 1974.



- 12 -
the major exporter of textiles and clothing from developing countries ac-
counting for 43.5% of cotton and 40% of man-made textile exports. In cotton
goods, Hong Kong was followed by India (9.7%), and Pakistan (7.9%), and in
man-made textiles Korea (18.4%) and Yugoslavia (8.5%) were other major ex-
porting countries. In the same year the US and the Federal Republic of
Germany absorbed 52% of total cotton products and 69.2% of man-made tex-
tiles exported by developing countries.
3.18      In the EC and the US, Egypt's annual quotas have not been filled for
several years (Annex 2-3) and therefore a modest increase of Egyptian produc-
tion to be exported as a result of the project, should also in this respect
not present any significant marketing problems. A 1975 bilateral agreement
with the US established a textile quota for Egypt of 72 million square meters
for 1976 (11,000 tons) and 105 million square meters for 1977 (16,000 tons),
compared with average Egyptian shipments of 3,500 tons per annum for the
1971-1974 period. If all additional fabrics production financed by the
project (1,700 tons annually) were to be directed either to the EC or the
US markets, the quotas would still remain unfulfilled.
c.   Export Promotion
3.19      A successful economic development program will depend on an expan-
sion of export markets and an extension of the kinds of products that are
competitive in these markets. Without a very significant export increase it
would be difficult for growth to be self-sustaining. Textiles and textile
products have in the past been the major manufactured export and could provide
a leading role in the future. The five-year plan framework recognizes the
problem and tentatively projects almost a doubling of total exports during
the period 1976-80. Exports of industrial products are expected to provide
much of the impetus, but there are obstacles to be overcome; of prime import-
ance are improvements in quality control and hence quality of products. Others
are increase in price competitiveness and marketing capabilities. In view of
the importance of accelerating the pace of exports and of instituting meas-
ures to sustain their growth in the long term, technical support is included
towards this program. An outline of a study to develop an export promotion
program and its implementation is described in Annex 3-14. The Government has
agreed to carry out such a study, and this program will cover all industrial
export potential (not just in textiles).
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Location and Scope
4.01      The project is designed to expand and rehabilitate the manufac-
turing capacity of two textile companies: Kafr El Dawar (KED) and El Beida
(EB). The project is scheduled to start production in mid-1979 and provide
employment for about 2,850 persons (Annex 4-1).



- 13 -
4.02      The KED sub-project will add about 78,000 spindles and 900 looms
and thus increase the company's manufacturing capacities of fine cotton
and polyester/cotton fabrics by 16.5 and 10.1 million linear meters respec-
tively. The expected product mix of these additional capacities is shown
in Annex 4-2. About 70% of the cotton fabrics output of the sub-project
as well as all the yarn not used in weaving will be exported. At maximum
projected efficiency (90%) of the new facilities, KED's annual manufacturing
capacity for yarn will be about 27,000 tons and for fabrics about 134 million
linear meters as against 21,000 tons and 107 million linear meters respective-
ly at present.
4.03      The EB sub-project consists of the expansion of converting capacity
for 43 million meters of fabric and 1,550 tons of yarn and, in addition, the
replacement of obsolete equipment for converting 30 million meters of fabric
and 500 tons of yarn. The EB sub-project also includes expansion of the
caustic soda recovery and fabric coating operations. At maximum projected ef-
ficiency (90%) of the new facilities, EB's annual capacity for fabric convert-
ing will be increased to about 178 million meters and for yarn converting to
about 2,800 tons as against 135 million linear meters and 1,250 tons at present.
4.04      The design of both sub-projects takes into account that the existing
mills are not entirely balanced and rearrangement of production schedules
after the sub-projects are implemented will result in increased overall capac-
ity utilization. On the basis of not fully satisfactory experience with the
four shift/350 day per year operation the two companies plan to operate the
new mills on only three shifts and 300 days to leave more time for scheduled
maintenance. On this basis productivity is expected to increase and unit
labor costs to decrease considerably compared with the existing operations
which will continue to operate on four shifts and 350 days per year.
4.05      In addition to a Technical Advisor to assist the implementation
units of the two companies (para 4.16) the project also provides for some
technical assistance and training to the textile industry: (i) training
abroad of technical and supervisory personnel from the textile sector subject
to a detailed program to be submitted by the Ministry of Industry not later
than August 31, 1976 (US$0.2 million); and (ii) technical assistance for the
preparation of a feasibility study for a new textile project (Us$o.1 million),
for which the Government will submit to the Bank a specific proposal not later
than December 31, 1976 taking into account the recommendations of the textile
sector study.
4.06      As explained in para 3.19, a special effort is needed by Egypt
to expand exports. The Government has agreed that within one year from
the initiation of the work (which is expected to begin within three months
after loan effectiveness), the ministries concerned will jointly recom-
mend to the Government, following consultation with the Bank, an action
program to revitalize exports through measures aimed at specific product
lines and markets, and a set of policies that may include export incen-
tives. The work will be under the direction of an inter-ministerial com-
mittee to include, inter alia, the Ministers of Commerce, Economy and



- 14 -
Economic Cooperation, Planning, Industry and Agriculture or their representa-
tives. A task force will be assembled with professional staff seconded from
the ministries, and with help from qualified consultants. Bank staff will
assist the Government in the initiation of the task force, including prepara-
tion of the scope and content of the work and its review, the selection of the
consultants, and supervision of their work. The estimated foreign exchange
cost (US$1.0 million) of this program based on 600 man-weeks of consulting
time has been included in the project (U$1,700/man-week).
B.   Machinery and Buildings
4.07      The mills will be equipped with new but conventional machinery.
The type and amount of equipment has been specified in the feasibility studies
prepared by KED and EB as revised where felt necessary, after review by the
Bank. All spinning, weaving, converting, and service machinery has to be
imported. A list of machinery required for the different plant sections is
shown in Annex 4-3.
4.08    2 To house the new faci ities KED will have to construct about
54,400 m  and EB about 19,800 m 2 of covered floor space2  The area of floor
space to be provided for (0.4 m per spindle and 20.4 m per loom) is in line
with standards accepted in the textile industry. All factory buildings are
to be of steel reinforced concrete which, in Egypt, is standard construction
for industrial buildings. While steel and cement are manufactured locally,
the demand for such materials exceeds by far the local supply. It is there-
fore anticipated that most of the construction materials required under the
project will have to be imported. Bank financing of US$2.3 million which
would cover about half of the foreign exchange requirements for such items,
is included under the project. For technical quality reasons the spinning
section will be air conditioned while the weaving section will be humidified.
Furthermore, the spinning section will have an overhead air exhaust system and
the carding room an additional floor waste filter exhaust to improve working
conditions and yarn quality. The proposed machinery layout has been reviewed
and found satisfactory.  The Government has agreed that the project will re-
ceive high priority regarding availability of public sector contractors and
building materials so that implementation can proceed according to schedule
(Annex 4-4). As the operations of the two companies are closely interre-
lated the schedule is designed in such a way that both sub-projects are
to be completed within one month of each other.
C.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.09      Basic raw materials required by the KED sub-project are cotton and
polyester. In 1980, at maximum projected efficiency (90%) the mills will use
annually 33,200 tons of cotton and 1,700 tons of polyester staple; incremental
requirements will be 6,100 and 1,500 tons respectively. The Ashmouni and
Giza cotton used by KED are of superior quality suitable for spinning of fine
cotton and polyester/cotton yarns. For EB, input materials will be grey cot-
ton fabric for PVC coated products as well as dyestuffs and chemicals, 75% of
which will continue to be imported.
4.10      There is an ample supply of cotton in Egypt.  In 1975 only slightly
more than half (Annex 3-7) the crop was processed by the domestic industr-,



- 15 -
As mentioned, however, availability of cotton (Annex 3-10) for export is
expected to shrink substantially (from 230,000 tons in 1975 to 116,000 tons
in 1985) as the Government is giving high priority to an expansion of the
local textile industry to meet domestic demand expectations for textiles
and employment objectives and increase foreign exchange earnings by export-
ing more highly processed goods (para. 3.09).  Polyester staple will have to
be imported initially but eventually the fiber is to be supplied from a new
plant now being considered by the Government.  The Government has provided
assurances regarding future supplies of input materials required by the
project including import licenses and foreign currency allocations for mate-
rials to be imported to ensure efficient operation of the new facilities.
4.11      As for requirements of electricity, steam, and water, KED is using
121 million KWH per annum of which 76 million KWH is generated by the com-
pany's own power station and 45 million KWH is obtained from the national
grid through the Rural Electrification Authority (REA). For the project the
company will require an additional 66.5 million KWH from REA. While it is
not envisaged that REA will have difficulties in meeting this incremental
need, the Government has provided assurances regarding the availability of
sufficient power. KED's water filtering and steam generating capacities are
almost twice current requirements and consequently the additional project
needs (25%) can be easily met. As for EB, it is currently generating 37.5
million KWH and using 30 million KWH, the rest is fed into the public grid
(REA). With the expansion of its steam power plant, currently underway and
to be completed in 1976, production of electricity will be increased to 58
million KWH and consumption, including the project, to 42 million KWH. Upon
project completion EB's steam requirements will be of the order of 100 tons
per hour and be met by the existing and presently expanded boiler capacity.
The company also has a filtering plant with a capacity almost double its
present usage; consequently incremental water requirements of the project
(32%) will present no problem. It appears therefore that the project will
have no difficulty in securing additional supplies of power, steam or water.
D.   Ecological Considerations and Occupational Hazards
4.12      As KED is a grey cloth mill there are no water or air pollution
problems and none are expected as a result of the project. KED's new spin-
ning and weaving sheds will be equipped with air filters to control fibers
and dust being exhausted into the atmosphere and humidity and temperature
will be controlled for technical reasons but at the same time creating bet-
ter working conditions. Also the design of the buildings will allow the
noise level to be kept below 90 decibels. Carding machines will be equipped
with floor waste exhaust filters to minimize dust hazards.
4.13      Effluent from the EB plant is highly alkaline (pH 10-11) and is
discharged to a special drainage canal. As the water in the canal is on
the acid side due to effluent from a rayon plant, 200 meters downstream
from EB, the pH of the water in the canal, after the effluents from the two
plants mix, is down to 8. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) of the effluent is
125 ppm, equivalent to 3 tons or 4% of daily output. The drainage canal which
leads to the Mediterranean Sea 15 miles north, serves as an outlet for effluent



- 16 -
from several chemical and other industrial plants in the Alexandria area as
well as the overflow of water used for irrigation. Consequently the project
does not introduce any environmental dangers. There will be no air condition-
ing in EB but all departments generating heat and/or steam will be equipped
with special hoods with forced exhaust systems to lower the temperature in
the working areas.
4.14      The power plants of the two companies operate on crude oil but
the boilers are equipped with automatic regulating devices to ensure maximum
combustion and the boiler flue contains no carbon monoxide. Since the crude
contains 3.5% of sulfur a certain amount of sulfur dioxide is generated.
However, the plant is located in a rural area and the workers living in
houses adjacent to the plants are not affected as the chimneys are each
about 60 meters high.
E.   Implementation, Staffing and Training
4.15      The managements of KED and EB are competent in operating their
existing plants and neither company is employing expatriates. Also, expan-
sion of plant facilities in the past was accomplished by local management
in a satisfactory manner as was the preparation of the feasibility studies
for the two proposed sub-projects. It is recognized therefore that the
projects can be successfully executed by the present managements with only
limited outside assistance. Project implementation units have already
been established within KED and EB, each consisting of a team leader, spe-
cialized engineers and scheduling coordinators. All have been selected from
existing staff and seconded to the implementation units full time. The teams
will be supported by regular company personnel as required. Preparation and
evaluation of foreign tenders is being coordinated and supervised by the Gen-
eral Authority for Industrialization (GAFI), which is responsible to the
Ministry of Industry for all foreign procurement in the industrial sector.
4.16      While the companies have good experience with the equipment they
are currently operating, they are not adequately familiar with the different
types of modern machinery which will be offered to them as a result of inter-
national competitive bidding. Also, operation of the new plants at higher
productivity levels will require additional training as well as introduction
of modern technical and cost control methods during project implementation
and early operations.  Since KED and EB do not have sufficient experience
in international procurement, mill control and production planning systems
for high productivity operation, the companies will employ an internationally
experienced textile engineering and consulting firm as Technical Advisor (TA)
acceptable to and on terms satisfactory to the Bank.  The main responsibility
of the TA will be to assist the implementation units of the companies in
drafting detailed engineering specifications, evaluating tenders and in
providing management and technical assistance to KED and EB to start-up their
sub-projects and integrate them with existing operations.  The terms of
reference for the TA are given in Annex 4-5.  The estimated foreign exchange
cost of this assistance (US$0.3 million), equivalent to about US$1,900 per
man-week of consulting time based on the actual offers received, has been
included in the project.



- 17 -
4.17      Skilled workers from the companies' existing operations will be
selected and trained to operate the new equipment. As the equipment will
be of conventional design it is judged that training, customarily given by
machinery suppliers, plus special training programs for supervisory and other
personnel carried out with the assistance of the TA during implementation and
early operation of the project, will ensure the new plants to achieve full
operating capacity within one year after start-up.
F.   Present Status
4.18      EB and KED are presently completing the engineering designs and
will place contracts for civil works before July 1, 1976. Both companies
have already selected the personnel for the implementation teams. Notices
to vendors have been sent to all embassies of the Bank's member countries
and Switzerland in Cairo and advertisements have been placed in foreign
newspapers. Proposals for technical assistance have been received from
several consulting firms interested in serving as TA and an appointment,
in consultation with the Bank, by the Ministry of Industry is expected
shortly.
V.  CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      Total financing requirements are estimated at LE 59.8 (US$153.2)
million including LE 5.0 (US$12.7) million interest during construction.  A
summary of capital costs including a breakdown among the different project
components is shown below and the details are given in Annexes 5-1 to 5-3.

5.02      The base cost estimate was prepared by KED and EB from informa-
tion obtained from textile equipment suppliers and Egyptian construction
firms in November 1975. A 5% allowance for physical contingencies was
added for possible changes in the scope of the project; these changes,
however, are expected to be minimal since the project details are well
defined. To provide for inflation until the expected date of commitment,
annual price escalation rates of 9% for 1976 and 8% for 1977 and thereafter
were assumed for foreign equipment and 13% and 12% for civil works respec-
tively. As the type of equipment to be used is standard and the project
scope is well defined including civil works (which are relatively modest
because of already existing infrastructure) the risk of cost increases
is limited and the capital cost estimates are considered realistic.
5.03      Permanent incremental working capital requirements for the proj-
ect are estimated at LE 12.8 (US$32.8) million including LE 2.5 (US$6.5)
million in foreign exchange needed to finance additional raw material in-
ventories of polyester fibers and yarn and dyestuffs and chemicals which
have all to be imported. Details of the working capital requirements are
shown in Annex 5-4 for KED and in Annex 5-5 for EB.

1/   The financial forecasts assume that all financing other than the Bank and
Arab Fund loans will be in the form of equity:  (a) the companies' own
generation of funds (about US$42.6 million equivalent including about
US$20.6 million from suspension of dividend payments by the companies
to the Government during the implementation period of the Project); (b)
the repayment of transfers made previously by the companies to other
public sector enterprises (about US$16.4 million equivalent); and (c)
an increase of the Government's share capital in the companies (US$7.7
million equivalent). Should only internally generated funds be avail-
able as equity, the rest would be borrowed on terms that will enable the
companies to comply with the current ratio covenant of 1.5. Such borrow-
ing would not significantly reduce the debt service coverage from the
projected comfortable levels of 4 to 8 times reflecting the strong
debt/equity ratio of the companies (paras. 6.08 and 6.10).



- 20 -
The proposed Bank loan of US$52 million would cover about 49% of the project's
total foreign exchange requirements. The Arab Fund would provide a loan of
Kuwaiti Dinars 10 million (US$34.5 million) equivalent for financing spinning
equipment for KED. The remaining foreign costs of about US$18.6 million will
be met by the Government.
5.05      Financing of local costs of about US$48.1 million equivalent is ten-
tatively expected to come from the following sources: (a) the companies' own
generation of funds; (b) a suspension of dividend payments by the companies
to the Government during the implementation period of the project; (c) the
repayment of transfers made previously by the companies to other public
sector enterprises; (d) an increase of the Government's share capital in the
companies; and (e) from local commercial sources. The Government has agreed
that these sources or a combination thereof will be employed and has assured
the timely supply of the required local and foreign currency for the financing
of the project consistent with the financial covenant to maintain a current
ratio of 1.5. While therefore the exact distribution of these local sources
ihas not yet been finally determined, the financial projections in Chapter V
indicate that a shift toward more debt financing, as compared to the assump-
tions made, is not going to adversely affect the financial soundness of the
two companies. Should there be any additional need for funds to complete the
project -- either because of a project cost overrun or a shortage of funds --
it will also be the responsibility of the Government to find such funds on
terms acceptable to the Bank.
5.06      The proposed Bank loan (U$52 million) would be made to the Govern-
ment at 8.85% interest for 15 years including 4 years of grace. Except for
the amount earmarked for training and technical assistance to be adminis-
tered by the Ministry of Industry (US$1.3 million), US$25.8 million and
US$24.9 million would be on-lent to KED and EB respectively at an interest
rate of 10% p.a. and on otherwise identical terms. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the companies. Signing of the Arab Fund loan, the appoint-
ment of technical advisors, and execution of the subsidiary loan agreements
between the Government and the companies will be conditions of effectiveness
of the proposed Bank loan.
C.   Allocation of Loans
5.07      Bank and Arab Fund financing would be on a parallel basis with
specific goods and services to be covered by each of the two lenders.

D.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.08      Goods and services financed by the Bank would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines,
except: (1) items costing less than US$100,000 equivalent but not exceeding
the aggregate amount of US$1.0 million for each company; these items may be
purchased through international shopping on the basis of suitability, avail-
ability and price considerations following approval by the Bank of the list
of items involved; (2) proprietary items necessary for repair of the existing
equipment and items in limited supply which are critical to the timely comple-
tion of the project and whose aggregate cost is estimated not to exceed US$2
million for KED and US$1 million for EB; these items may be procured following
bidding from a list of qualified suppliers, with prior Bank approval; and (3)
construction materials (such as cement, steel and timber) and raw materials
(polyester fibers, dyestuffs and chemicals); these items may be procured
through international shopping on the basis of at least three quotations from
qualified foreign suppliers approved by the Bank. Raw materials would all
be imported but, since some of the construction materials are also produced
locally, Egyptian manufacturers would have an opportunity to tender. However,
because of the shortage of construction materials and the continuous need
for importing such items, it is unlikely that domestic manufacturers would be



- 22 -
able to bid (para. 4.08). As mentioned above, construction materials are
expected to be procured through international shopping. If, KED and EB
choose to procure such materials through international competitive bidding,
local manufacturers would be allowed a preference of 15% or the actual
customs duty, whichever is lower. Preparation of technical specifications
is now in progress and it is expected that the first equipment orders could
be placed in January/February 1977.
5.09      Equipment financed by the Arab Fund would be purchased according
to its own procurement guidelines. Local procurement and contracting for
civil works will be carried out according to guidelines specified by the
Egyptian Ministry of Industry and General Authority for Industrialization.
These guidelines ensure adequate competitive bidding within Egypt and are
satisfactory to the Bank.
5.10      The Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of the foreign expenditures for imported equipment
and spares and related items (raw materials);
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
construction materials or 100% of the local expendi-
tures (ex-factory costs) if locally manufactured; and
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for project and sector
Technical Assistance and Training.
Retroactive financing for the technical advisors and foreign expenditures for
bid advertisements would be eligible in an amount not exceeding US$100,000
equivalent for expenditure after May 1, 1976. The Bank loan is expected to be
fully disbursed by mid-1979; an estimated disbursement schedule is given in
Annex 5-6. Any portion of the Bank loan not utilized for any part of the
project will be cancelled. The Arab Fund Loan would be used to finance
foreign exchange expenditures of the spinning equipment for KED. Foreign
exchange expenditures for freight, insurance and erection will be paid in
conjunction with the categories of equipment financed by each of the two
lenders. It is estimated that at most US$1.0 million (or 2%) of the Bank
loan would be disbursed for local currency expenditures (construction materials).
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01      The financial analysis, including forecasts of earnings and rates
of return, has been carried out on an incremental basis for each of the
two sub-projects and, in addition, financial projections have been prepared
for each of the two companies. It is assumed that both projects will start
commercial production by July 1979 and, based on 300 operating days per
year, that efficiency of the new facilities will reach 90% in 1980. Given the
fact that the two companies have a record of operating their equipment at high
capacity utilization and efficiency and expecting no market constraints, the
production build-up is considered realistic.



- 23 -
A.   Incremental Financial Analysis
6.02      The KED sub-project is forecast to increase the company's sales
in 1980 by about LE 18 million and it is expected that about 30% of this
increment will be exported. Detailed incremental income statement projec-
tions and underlying assumptions are given in Annex 6-1 and are summarized
below:
Key Incremental Financial Data for the KED Sub-Project
(In Current Million LE)
1979     1980       1981       1985
Sales                          4.3     14.6       18.2       20.4

Profit After Tax
as % of Sales                  -      10.3       18.1       22.4
6.03      The project is estimated to become very profitable in the second
year of operations (1981) with a profit after tax to sales ratio of over
18%, which compares to only about 8% for the existing operations. The com-
pany's revenues from domestic sales are strongly influenced by the price
assumption made for polyester cotton fabrics. At present, KED realizes on
average about LE 1.60 (US$4.10) per meter on the small volume it is now
producing and selling. This price is not related to costs but reflects
the unsatisfied demand for this type of fabric in Egypt. As a result of
KED's and other projects in the sector, the supply of polyester cotton
fabrics will increase and it can be expected that prices will drop consid-
erably and will become more closely related to production costs. Assuming
that KED wants to realize at least an internal rate of return of 15% on its
investment in the polyester cotton plant, a sales price of LE 0.8 (US$2.05)
per meter has been taken; this is only slightly higher than the estimated
world market price for this type of fabrics.
6.04      The financial rate of return for the KED sub-project is estimated
at 12%. The return is most sensitive to changes in sales prices. A 10%
lower price level than the one assumed would reduce the return to 9%. An
increase in operating or capital costs by 10% will result in a decrease in
the financial rate of return by 2.3% or 1.4% respectively.
6.05      The EB sub-project is also expected to generate substantial incre-
mental sales revenues, i.e. by about LE 12 million in 1980. Details of the
incremental revenues, operating costs and the assumptions made are shown in
Annex 6-2 and are summarized below:

% of Sales                        -       12.8      17.4      18.5
6.06      The realization of the sub-project will continue to support the
profitability of the company as the profit after tax for the new project is
estimated at over 17% of sales. The attractiveness of the project is further
reflected in the high financial rate of return of about 16%. This rate drops
to about 10% as revenues decline by 10%. Similarly, an increase in operating
costs or capital costs by 10% will result in a decrease in the financial rate
of return by 3.5% or 2.0% respectively.
6.07      Since the financial rates of return for the two sub-projects are
attractive, the overall return for the project is also satisfactory and is
expected to be about 13% (Annex 6-3).
B.   Financial Analysis of Companies after Implementation of Sub-Projects
6.08      Financial projections through 1985 for KED's entire operations
are shown in Annex 6-4 and key data for selected years are summarized

6.09      Implementation of the sub-project will significantly alter the
scope of operations and financial position of the company. In real terms,



- 25 -
sales will increase by nearly 60%, profits are expected to triple and so
are gross fixed assets. Long-term debt will increase substantially and
bring the company to a maximum debt/equity ratio of 42/58. The cost struc-
ture will also be affected. Before implementation of the sub-project depre-
ciation and interest accounted for only 4% of total operating costs; by 1981
these will increase to 9%. Liquidity and debt service coverage will remain
more than adequate. Overall, the financial outlook for the company is good,
provided that the Government will continue to allow KED to set adequate sales
prices (para. 6.14).
6.10      Financial projections for EB are contained in Annex 6-5 and key
data for selected years are summarized below:

/I   Based on assumptions discussed in paras 5.04 and 5.05.
6.11      Projecting from an already sound position, the proposed expansion
will further improve the company's finances. In real terms, sales revenue
is expected to increase by more than 50%, profits will nearly double and
gross fixed assets will increase by about one-third. The companies'
liquidity position is expected to be satisfactory. Current ratio is pro-
jected to increase from 1.2 in 1975 to 1.5 during the life of the project.
Debt/equity ratio is also projected at a comfortable 30/70, and the debt
service coverage is more than adequate.
6.12      Even after the additional borrowing envisaged for the project,
both companies will have a very ample debt service coverage, indicating
that amortization of the proposed loans could be shortened to less than
the assumed 11 years without endangering the cash position of KED and EB.
However, under the existing financial regime, the companies do not have
control over the funds they generate, except for those derived from depre-
ciation out of which debt repayments have to be made. To leave the companies
some cash for their own disposition, it is therefore necessary to have the
debt repaid over about the same number of years as the project's assets are
depreciated.



- 26 -
6.13      The financial statements of KED and EB are audited by the Central
Agency for Auditing, a government agency. This arrangement is acceptable to
the Bank.
C.   Financial Covenants
6.14      To safeguard the strong financial position of the two companies
as indicated above, the Government has agreed that it will:
(a) not take any action which would preclude the companies
from meeting all their expenses and servicing debt out
of earnings and, assuming efficient operations, from
earning a reasonable return on invested capital;
(b) allocate sufficient foreign exchange to the companies for
the purposes of procuring future supply of input materials
as required; and
(c) not make any cash withdrawals from the companies over and
above the legal requirements which would prevent each of
them from maintaining a current ratio of at least 1.5;
in any event the Government will promptly provide the companies
with any funds required to maintain this ratio.
The companies have also agreed to the following:
(a) To ensure their liquidity, KED and EB will maintain a
current ratio of 1.5 or above;
(b) Before completion of their sub-projects, KED and EB will
not undertake any new investments in excess of US$2.5 mil-
lion equivalent each per year without prior agreement
with the Bank; and
(c) After completion of their sub-projects the two companies
will not undertake any further capital investment without
prior agreement with the Bank if as a result of such in-
vestments their respective debt/equity ratios would exceed
60/40.
D.   Major Risks
6.15      The project faces only moderate technical, managerial and com-
mercial risks. After assurance on the availability of public sector con-
tractors and building materials (para 4.08), the potential for substan-
tial delays and major cost overruns during project implementation, unless
caused by a sudden increase in the demand for textile equipment which is
considered unlikely, is rather low because of (i) KED's and EB's experi-
ence in managing, constructing and operating textile projects; and (ii) par-
ticipation of a Technical Advisor in some aspects of project implementation.



- 27 -
The commercial risks of the project are rather small, because of the large
unsatisfied demand for the polyester-cotton fabrics in Egypt and the rel-
atively minor additional exports of cotton products as compared to present
exports.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      For the economic analysis of the project, costs and benefits are
divided into tradeable and non-tradeable items and are valued at their re-
spective world market and domestic prices. Most significant in the economic
analysis is the valuation of the raw materials and textile prices. Annex 7
contains the detailed assumptions made in this analysis.
A.   Raw Material and Textile Prices
7.02      The three types of raw materials required by the project are cotton,
polyester fiber and yarn, and dyestuffs and chemicals. All of these can be
treated as tradeable commodities with defined world market prices.
7.03      The cotton required by the project is of the long staple variety
Egypt produces. Underspinning of the domestic cotton is minimized in this
case by producing mostly fine and very fine yarns and fabrics particularly
for the 100% cotton fabrics destined for export. World market prices for
Egyptian long-staple cotton have followed the same trend as the shorter
staple cotton varieties which account for the bulk of the trade. However,
the premium over the shorter staple varieties has fluctuated rather widely
and has, over the last 25 years, been as low as 30% and as high as 100%
with an average of about 60%. In line with prices for other commodities
all cotton prices reached unprecedented high levels in 1973/74. Although
prices have come down, it is not expected that they will return to levels
prevailing before 1973. For purpose of calculating the economic rate of
return of the project the Egyptian cotton has been priced by using the
Bank's estimate for the long-term international price for short-staple
cotton of US$0.52 per pound (in constant 1976 dollars) and by applying
the historically derived premium of 60% to arrive at an average price of
US$0.83 per pound of Egyptian long-staple cotton.
7.04      Polyester represents a major breakthrough in man-made fibers and
the recent growth in the man-made fiber consumption has to a very large
extent been satisfied by this fiber. Accordingly, polyester prices which
were around US$1.00 per pound in the early 1960s have come down to around
US$0.50 at present. Polyester has thus become an economic and widely ac-
cepted substitute for short-staple cotton and is expected to follow the
price trends of short-staple cotton closely. A long-term international
price in constant 1976 dollars of US$0.50 per pound FOB of US$0.54 per
pound CIF is assumed.



- 28 -
7.05      About 75% of the dyestuffs and chemicals required by EB are im-
ported and for these imports the same CIF prices as used in the financial
analysis, although excluding duties and taxes, have been taken. The remain-
ing 25% are procured locally and consist of a very large number of items for
which world market prices are difficult to ascertain; consequently domestic
prices have been used.
7.06      The project output is valued in terms of the export and import
substitution benefits it provides. The types of cotton fabrics which will
be produced as a result of the project are already produced in the country
and border prices for these can be derived from historical export prices.
For the polyester-cotton fabrics intended for the local market it is diffi-
cult to establish border prices because international trade in textiles
takes place in a large variety of fabric constructions and finishes and
such prices are generally not published. The border prices for the poly-
ester-cotton fabrics are therefore estimated by adding to the international
raw material costs, spinning, weaving, and converting costs as are consid-
ered typical for efficient producers of textiles in Western Europe.
7.07      To determine the economic benefits of expanding EB's converting
capacity it has been established (Annex 7) that EB's commission charges,
somewhat lowered for some specific services (so as to make them all in line
with prices prevailing in Europe and the US), can be used to estimate the
economic benefits of this sub-project.
B.   Economic Rate of Return and Foreign Exchange Savings
7.08      Based on the above assumptions, the sub-projects and the overall
project yield satisfactory rates of return as shown below:
For KED    For EB    For Overall Project
Economic Rate of Return         21%         22%             22%
7.09      The above returns are calculated using the market exchange rate
(fE 1.00 = US$1.56) 1/ as a crude approximation of a shadow foreign exchange
rate. However, even if the official rate of exchange (IfE 1.00 = US$2.56)
were used, the returns would be only about 2% lower, which indicates that
the economic rate of return for this project is not very sensitive to the
exchange rate used. For calculating the above returns the amounts (US$1.3
million) earmarked for sectoral training and technical assistance were ex-
cluded from the project costs, since the benefits deriving from this invest-
ment cannot be easily quantified. The reason the economic rate of re-
turn for the overall project (22%) is higher than the financial rate of
return (13%) is because the differential between the economic and finan-
cial benefits (100%) outweighs the difference between the economic and
financial values of both capital and operating costs (43% and 74% respec-
tively, Annex 7).
1/   In May 1976, this rate was adjusted to LE 1= US$ 1.47.



- 29 -
7.10      The estimated foreign exchange cost of the project is US$105.1
million equivalent. In return, by 1980, the project will result in an esti-
mated net annual foreign exchange saving of about US$52 million equivalent.
Such savings do not constitute an economic benefit additional to those
included in the projected economic rate of return.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Assurances and agreements were obtained from the Government, KED
and EB on the following major points:
A.   From the Government that it will:
(a)  assure future supply of domestic input materials as well as
issue import licenses and foreign currency allocations for
materials to be imported to allow the execution of the project as
well as efficient operation of the new facilities (paras. 2.17
and 4.10);
(b)  not later than three months from the effective date of the
proposed Bank loan initiate an export promotion study and
program (paras. 3.19 and 4.06);
(c)  submit not later than August 31, 1976 a detailed program
for the training abroad of technical and supervisory personnel
from the country's textile sector (para. 4.05);
(d)  submit to the Bank by December 31, 1976 a proposal for the execution
of a feasibility study for a future textile project (para. 4.05);
(e)  assure availability of public sector contractors and building
materials so the implementation of civil works can be carried

twist yarn); (c) a number of filaments laid together with
more or less twist; or (d) a single filament with or
without twist, a monofilament.
Yarn, carded:    Yarns made from fibers that have been carded but not

ANNEX 2- 9
EGYPT - TEXTTLES PROJECT
KAFR EL DAWAR - WITHOUT THE PROJECT
Assumptions Made for Calculating Projected
Production. Revenues and  E eratiiF josts
A.   Production
(a) Fabrics
Estimated production for 1976 is used as a basis in terms of level
of production and composition of the product mix which is about the
same as in 1974. It is assumed that exports would reach again and
remain at about h0O of total fabrics production.  It is assumed that
minor investments will take place which will allow the company to
maintain the level of production over the planning period.
(b) Yarn
Yarn surplus for sale is calculated as the difference between total
yarn production and weaving and sewing and fishing yarn. It is however,
assumed that no yarn would be available from Kon Hamada in 1976, 2,000 tons
in 1977, 3,000 tons in 1978 and 3,200 tons thereafter. All yarn is for
the domestic market.
(c) Sewing and Fishing Yarn
KED's estimate is used. All sewing and fishing yarn is for the
domestic market.
(d) Wlaste
lWaste is a function of the total yarn output and is estimated to bc
about 35% of the total yarn produced (or 26% of the overall cotton
required). The yarn required for weaving is estimated by assuming an
average fabric weight of 142 gramms per linear meter and a wast.e in
weaving of 5%. About 70% of the waste is assumed to be consumed in the
domestic market, the remainder is exported.
B.  Sales Prices
The 1976 price levels are used as a base to calculate the expected
sales revenue which is then adjusted to compensate for the assumed
increases in operating costs. Under the assumptions made, the sales
revenue and thus the average sales price will have to increase by
about 4% per annum -lo ,aintain KED at its -resent level of n-rof;ta,bo 1itvr.



ANNEX 2-9
Page 2
C.   Operating Costs
(a) Inflation Factors
Expected mid-1976 operating cost levels have been used as a basis
and local costs have been inflated by 5% per year for the local costs
and by 8p per year for Lmported inputs, the latter being the average
international price index for manufactured goods.
(b) Wages and balaries
At the end of December 1975, KED will employ 20,200 people at an
average salary of 32 LE/month. During 1976 an additional 1,500 people
will be required for the spinning mill at Kom Hamada. After that there
will be no more labour required. Salaries and wages will increase
during 1976 to 34.5 LE/month.
(c ) Raw Materials
Raw material requirements during 1976 will be as follows
Cotton              Tons       Price (EP/ton)       Value (000 EP)
Ashmouni             8,284          332                 2,750
Giza 69              8,976          357                 3,204
Giza 68              5,239          395                 2,069
Giza 45                332          442                   147
Total Cotton        22,831          358                 83171
Other Fibers           644          650                   419
Total               23,475          360                 8,590
The cotton requirement for the new spinning mill at Kom Hamada will
require the following amounts :
1979
1977        19A8 And 'hereafter
Assumed
Yarn Production (tons)        2,000        3,000       3,200
Waste Factor                  1.18         1.18        1.18
Cotton (tons)                 2,360        3,540       3,776
At Average Price (LE ton)       358          358         358
Value (000 LE)                  845        1,267       1,352



ANNEX 2- 9
Page 3
(d) Pbwer
Power is assumed to stay at present consumption levels for the mill at
KED totalling about 125 million kwh or about LE 900,000 per anmum.
For Kom Hamada an additional 24 million kwh or LE 170,000 per annum
would be required.
(e) Maintenance Materials
Maintenance materials are expected to go up 6% p.a. starting from
1976. This assumption reflects the requirement of increasing maintenance
costs to maintain 1976 production levels.
(f) Packing
Packing materials for exports are staying at 1976 levels.
(g) Commission
From historical data it can be shown that the cost of commission dyeing and
finishing of dyeing and finishing fabric and yarn can be approximated by using
an average of 0.062 LE/linear meter of finished fabrics. Given the fact
that the product mix is not changing, subcontracting can be expressed as
a percentage of sales revenue, which has been between 16% and 19%
historically. Here 18% is assumed.
(h) Indirect Taxes
This includes the production tax on yarn, the duties on imported raw
materials and the treasury tax on finished fabrics. Historically this
has amounted to between 25-28% of the value of the raw materials. Here
27% is assumed.
(i) Dapreciation
Depreciation on existing machinery is based on actual KED calculations.
From 1976 a yearly amount of LE 240,000 is added for depreciating the
disputed Indian machinery.  From 1977  450,000 LE per annum are added for
Kom Hamada.
(j) Replacement Provision
Once an asset is fully depreciated a replacement provision of 4% p.a.
is made. For KED's written off machinery, this amounts to the following:
Replacement &
Depreciation       Replacement        Depreciation
1976              1,421              276                1,1h5
1977              1,628              303                1,325

ANNEX 3-10
EGYPT - TEXTILES PROJECT
COTTON AND RAW MATERIALS
1.        Egypt is a major producer of cotton. Production increased until
1970 when 541,000 tons were produced accounting for 4.7% of world production
(Annex 3-7). By 1975 production of cotton decreased to 448,000 tons while
in the period 1970-1975 domestic consumption of cotton fabrics increased
from 117,000 to 146,000 tons. The increase in population has had a twofold
effect on the cotton supply/demand balance. On one hand the limited amount
of arable land has to accommodate an increased demand for food crops while
on the other hand more cotton is required to clothe the growing population.
Changes in the supply/demand balance are shown in Annex 3-7, page 2. In the
period 1967-1973 Egyptian cotton exports averaged 288,000 tons per annum.
In 1974 exports dropped to 260,000 tons and in 1975 to 230,000 tons.
2.        In future, world consumption of cotton is projected to grow at
the rate of 2.1%1A while demand for Egyptian cotton may grow at a somewhat
slower rate there is no reason to assume that Egypt should not be able to
retain its traditional share of the world market if sufficient supplies of
cotton are available for export. Ninety percent of Egypt's cotton exports
ia long and extra long staple in which Egypt has a dominant position,
accounting for one-third of world production and almost half of world
trade (Annex 3-8).
3.        The supply/demand balance for cotton and cotton production in
Egpt indicates (Annex 3-7), however, that by 1985 only 116,000 tons will
be available for export in the form of lint. This is based on the
Governmentts policy to: (a) increase domestic consumption; (b) increase
exports of fabrics; (c) maintain export of cotton yarn at present levels;
and (d) also establish domestic production capacity to manufacture 50,000
tons of polyester fiber. In order to maximize foreign exchange revenues
Egypt will have to import cheaper short staple cotton to release the more
valuable long and extra long Egyptian cotton for export.
4.        The traditional price relation  between short staple (Liverpool
index) and Egyptian long cotton and extra long cotton have been 0.71 and
o.56 respectively. Import of foreign cotton has been considered on several
occasions by the Government in the past and until recently rejected on the
advice of Egyptian agricultural experts, who feared that imported cotton
oould carry diseases capable of infecting and destroying the local crop.
However, large scale trials indicated that short cotton can be imported
and utilized safely in the area of the city of Alexandria and other areas
j/ IBRD Commodity Paper No.163/75.



ANNEX 3-10
Page 2
which are located far enough from cotton plantations. It is therefore
expected that large scale importation of short cotton will be undertaken
by the Government.
5.        Another measure to alleviate the shortage of fibers would be
importation and/or local production of polyester fibers in Egypt to release
long staple cotton for export. Polyester can be easily blended with cotton.
Polyester-cotton (65/35) blended fabrics are superior to 100% cotton in
terms of durability, dimensional stability, and easy-care characteristics.
Use of synthetic fibers in Egypt is economically sound as polyester staple
can be landed in Alexandria at US$0.50 per lb FOB compared with Egyptian
cotton which, even at current depressed prices, commands between US$0.80
and US$1.25 per lb (average US$0.90) FOB Egyptian port. The long range
price trend also favors polyester. Since 1966 the price of cotton
(American Middling 1-1/16") has increased from US$0.29 to US$0.64 per
pound while the price of polyester, despite the quadrupling of oil prices,
dropped in the US domestic market from US$0.80 to US$0.55 per pound
(Annex 3-11). The trend towards polyester is worldwide (Annex 3-9) both
in developed as well as developing countries and in the period 1967-1971
world imports of :nanmade fabrics increased from US$682 to US$1,263 million
i.e. by 85% or twice the rate of growth of cotton fabrics. WFhile in 1960
cotton accolmted for 68% of all fibers used in the world, by 1972 this
figure had decreased to 52% and it is estimated that by 1985 the cotton
share may be as low as 44%. On the other hand, the share of polyester
increased from 1% in 1960 to 11% in 1972'and is expected to reach 25% in
19851/. Detailed projections for world consumption of cotton, polyester
and other major fibers are shown in Annex 3-11.
6.        The Government has announced plans for establishing, within the
next five years, a chemical complex to produce 25,000 tons of polyester
fibers as a link with the future development of the petrochemical industry.
Negotiations to erect another plant with capacity to produce 15,000 tons
of polyester fiber and 10,000 tons of polyester filament are well advanced.
Therefore, the part of the project to increase KED's capacity to produce
polyester-cotton fabrics is well timed as it involves replacement of cotton
with polyester in the domestic market. The project would provide a
valuable opportunity for the Egyptian textile industry to develop technology
for efficient manufacture of polyester-cotton blends on modern equipment.
This is most important in view of the long range plans of the Government
to introduce polyester into Egypt on a massive scale.

ANNEX 3-13
EGYPT - TEXTILES PROJECT
CURRENT PRICIWi POLICY IN THE TEXTILE SECTOR
1.        Ex-factory prices of rationed fabrics are determined by the
Ministry of Industry in cooperation with the Ministry of Supply. There
have been no increases in these prices since 1968. In 1973 the average
cost of production of these fabrics was E o.154 (US$0.394) and the selling
price LE 0.134 (US$0.303) i.e. 14% below ex-factory costs (Annex 3-3). The
subsidy is therefore financed by the losses incurred by the individual
sector companies which have to fill production quotas for rationed fabrics.
The aggregate losses on production of rationed fabrics amounted to 11% of
the industry's profit after taxes in that year but it appears that the
subsidy does not always benefit the population as a good proportion of the
rationed fabrics is being sold on the black market. It is questionable
whether subsidizing of rationed fabrics is really meaningful as only a
small proportion of a family's income is spent on textile products. It
also appears doubtful that an alternative mechanism for enforcing rationing
can be successfully set up and it would be the Bank's recommendation that
the Government consider abolishing the subsidy. This would free the whole
textile industry from a large number of bureaucratic rules and regulations
without making arn real difference to the consumer.
2.        Ex-factory prices of non-rationed fabrics are controlled by the
Industrial Control Board (ICB) which has a staff of eight people to monitor
prices of more than 120 industrial goods. For an existing product the price
can only be raised by submitting evidence that operating cost increases
cannot be covered by the existing price. For a new product the company
submits a proposed price and cost structure and the application normally
gets routine approval by the ICB.  Only if a substantial number of complaints
are received the price is investigated. In the textile industry the easiest
way of increasing the price of an existing product is by slightly changing
the construction or the finish of a fabric and to apply for a new product
price which is normally granted by the ICB.  It appears that        price
increases are granted to compensate the individual companies for losses
incurred in the production of rationed fabrics; this practice is widely
followed in the industry and has led to a proliferation of products beyond
market requirements. It would therefore appear that decontrolling of prices
for non-rationed fabrics would basically not change anything for the final
consumer, it would most likely reduce the number of products required by
the market and it would eliminate a rather ineffective and bureaucratic
procedure. The decontrolling of prices for non-rationed fabrics would have
one further advantage and that would be the fact that higher quality fabrics
would command a premium which would give an incentive to the companies to
keep their quality standards high. At the moment quality is not reflected
in the price structure and textile companies do not have any reason for
raising the quality of their fabrics destined for the domestic market.



ANNEX 3-13
Page 2
3.        Wholesale and retail profit margins are also controlled by the
ICB, both for rationed and non-rationed fabrics. The wholesale margin is
between 3% and 6% and the retail margin between 9% and 19% according to
the price category. In addition, there is an excise duty for non-rationed
fabrics varying from E 0.01 to 0.05 per meter which is passed from the
customer through the retailer and wholesaler back to the factory. When the
fabric manufacturer is also a spinner the excise duty collected can be used
to offset production duties on yarn payable to the Government; otherwise
the excise duty is returned to the Ministry of Finance. On the whole the
cost of distribution is extremely low compared with free economy countries.
The margin between the ex-factory price and the price paid by the customer
in Egypt never exceeds 25%, versus 250-350% in the US and Western Europe.
Details of the pricing structure is shown on page 5.
4-        Prices of yarn and fabrics exported to convertible currency
markets are governed by competitive conditions in world markets. Con-
sequently export transactions with these countries may either be profitable
or non-profitable according to world market conditions in arn particular
year. To compensate the manufacturers for occasional losses on export
sales within the imposed quotas the Government allows a special incentive
which currently, in 1975, was established at 15% of the FOB value of the
goods. In addition, all proceeds from transactions in excess of the quota
are eligible for conversion at parallel market rates.
5.        Prices of goods exported to socialist or "Eastern Bloc" countries
are determined by bilateral or barter type agreements concluded at Govern-
mental level with companies having little influence on the price or volume
of the contract. All proceeds from these transactions are eligible for
conversion at parallel market rates. There is also an incentive scheme
but as these transactions have been, as a rule, more profitable than sales
to more competitive convertible currency countries the Government incentive
is currently 3% of the FOB value.
6.        The Textile Consolidation Fund (TCF) is responsible to the
Ministry of Industry for quality control of exported goods, conformity of
fabrics with specifications, and also for monitoring the level of world
prices. Presently, TCF is not directly involved in the marketing of
exports which is done by the individual companies but all contracts for
export sales have to be checked and approved by TCF before they are
finalized and executed. The TCF is financed from the proceeds cf a levy
paid by the manufacturers at the rate of 6% of the value of cotton consumed.

EGYPT - TEXTCITLS PROJECT
A  ROGRAM FOR STREZATHTENIL  EXPO3T C.4PA3ILITIES
1.        .  is generally agreed that futu e development depends in large
measure on ImDroving the capability to           O - otn manufactured goods and
agricu ;ural co.m oaCties.  There are several stages to the prcgram, and
because of their common interests in the Droblems. it is suggested that
the effcrt be undertaken Jointly by the Ministries of Foreign Trade,
ocononQy and Economic Cooperation, ?Planning, Industry, and Agriculture.
;: .      It is anticipated that by the end of one year from initiation
o h roFram the -Ministers could jointly recommend to the Government:
set o) ol-cv measures for stimulating exports, particularly
including one or more export incentive schemes.  Some alternative incentive
schemes that should be considered are briefly described below; (ii) an
actJcn prcgram for revitalizing industry, specifically to create export
capability. through measures that are also briefly described below.
J. nhe first stage I's to undertaKe an operational analysis of the
current oosition on exports, to identify products that have been exported
-n the recent past or are being exoorted and, most importantly, to analyze
tne apoarent limitations or constraints that prevent improvements now.
The cause commonly cited for lack of better export performance is shortage
cf foreign exchange to import inputs or to undertake investment, but while
that may be a contributing cause, there are many others that may, from our
-oservaions of in dividual enterprises, be equally or more important.
Industrial enterprises are often unable to compete in world markets
effectively because of inefficiencies that can be traced to a variety cf
::ctors, including: uncertain management; inappropriate technological
Drocesses and equipment, lack of incentives to be efficient and lack of
aocountability; an administratively controlled price system; insufficiently
-rained labor; lack of a strong promotional and marketing capability due
to inexperience; and an entrepreneurial spirit that has oeen s-ppressed.
The first stage of the analysis is to take stock orF the current situation
and identify the key limitations _n various product lines andior enter-
prises.  The process of clear identification will itself lead to ideas for
possible solutions to these problems.  It should be specially noted that
the sector or planning studies that were agreed to in the first import
prcIecti/ are now, or shortly will be, underway, and the first stage of
tho.,? Analvses is to investiaate current conditions in each of the six
lst,? groups2/.  Consequently they shculd be able to contribute to
~-is suggested analysis.

h.        Concurrently with the first stage of work, the task force,
composed of a few professional staff from each of the Ministries plus
foreign consultants, should also institute a systematic study of the
products in which Egypt now has a comparative advantage or, with a little
assistance and correctives, could have such an advantage. The analysis
should be in the form of calculating the real domestic resource cost of
earning or saving a dollar of foreign exchange through importing or
exporting. Thus, for example, if in terms of real domestic resources it
costs E 3 to earn a dollar of foreign exchange by exporting or the same
amount to save a dollar of foreign exchange by domestic production which
substitutes for imports, and if the actual exchange rate is E 2 for US$1,
then the activity is clearly inefficient to the economy; the activity is
efficient if the domestic resource cost is less than LE 2. The mechanics
of this kind of analysis are well known and can be easily understood.
The task force of the Ministries would be supplemented by selected foreign
consultants. The funds for this activity will be provided in the KED-EB
textile project. This is briefly discussed below.
5.        The results of this operational analysis would be a comprehen-
sive list of products for which conditions for export are favorable or could
be made favorable with small additional assistance. This list of products
would be the ones the Government should encourage for export by providing
incentive programs. They are the ones in which costs of production are
favorable in world markets and in terms of the costs of domestic resources.
6.        Another part of the analysis is to determine the characteristics
of foreign markets in order to determine those that are most favorable for
expansion of Egyptian exports. This stage would evaluate the market
conditions (prices, competitors, delivery requirements, quality of products
needed, etc.) in all of the product lines and in a variety of countries.
Special attention could be given to other arabic countries.
7.        This stage of the analysis should also prepare a plan for
increasing promotional and marketing programs to exploit market opportuni-
ties. Egyptian industry is noticeably weak in this area. Various measures
could be considered including      assigning a greater responsibility to
commercial and economic attaches of embassies abroad to report daily or
weekly on prices, market trends, fashions, contract advertisements, trade
fairs, lists of buyers, etc. in all of the selected product lines. From all
of the above work an operational plan for greatly strengthening the pro-
motional and marketing effort should emerge.



ANNEX 3-14
Page 3
8.        It is also necessary to provide a solid basis of incent-ves to
industry to export. Every successful country has had an incentive systen
which has been revised as conditions change. A review of the costs and
the relative effectiveness of various incentives is an important phase of
the work of the task force. The objective is to find those incentives that
are least costly and most effective in promoting exports. Many measures
have been employed including: (a) custom duty drawback or exemption for
imported goods to be directly incorporated in exports; (b) preferential
credit for finance of exports, or for investment for exports; (c) direct
export incentives in which a percentage payment is made based on the value
of exports. Targets may be established and the incentive applied only to
the exports above target; (d) "export bonuses" in which the firm is permitted
to sell a claim on imported materials, above those it needs for its own use,
at whatever price the market will pay; (e) export bonuses based on exceeding
past performance, or based on the amount of value added in the export commodity.
There are literally thousands of variations and combinations of export
incentives. The task force should evaluate the major alternatives and
recommend a set of incentives that will be effective in promoting exports.
9.        Finally, based on all of the above work the task force should
recommend specific measures that would increase export capability in certain
industries or enterprises. These might include: recommendations on specific
investments; changes in tax or custom duty regulations; changes in price
regulations; special allocations of foreign exchange; allowances to enter-
prises in free zones; etc. The purpose is to bring production that is now
just marginal for exports into a regime and conditions where it would be
exported efficiently.
10.       Organization of the Task Force:  It is recommended that the task
force consist of a few professionals seconded from each of the Ministries
plus foreign consultants. It is recommended that from two to four
professionals be seconded from each Ministry. The proposed Bank loan could
support the foreign exchange costs of the task force including the foreign
consultants.   The equivalent of about 10-15 man years of foreign consultants
could be provided. Thus the task force would have 20-25 professionals.
With that size of staff each of the problems cited above could be quite
thoroughly covered.
11.       The program is to cover two years of activity and it is estimated
to cost US$1 million. By the end of the first year a preliminary report will
be prepared for the Government outlining policies, incentives, and specific
actions in industries and enterprises that will improve export capabilities.
The second year will commence implementation through an export promotion
agency and complete additional analytical work so that the whole program can
be sustained.



ANNEX 3-1 4
Page 4
12.       On average, US$500,000 in foreign exchange is needed each year.
This will support a resident staff of about 3-h experts, who will work with
counterparts in the Government, in undertaking the analytical studies of
incentives, other policy measures, cost analyses of products, design of the
total program, etc. In addition, short term consultants equivalent to
another 2-3 fall time persons will be needed to provide practical advice on
marketing procedures and problems for specific products and specific markets,
engineering and technical advice on raising quality levels, lowering costs,
etc. in individual enterprises or groups of enterprises. These will be part
of the specific action programs.
13.       It is estimated that personnel and all associated foreign exchange
costs will amount to US$480,000 annually and US$20,000 is set aside for
Egyptian officials and businessmen to obtain training and information abroad
at trade fairs and visits to successful exporting countries. In addition it
is estimated that the equivalent of US$150,000 annually in local currency will
be required for logistic support of the program. This will be supplied by the
Government.

ANNEX 4-5

EGYPT - TEXTIIES PROJECT
EMPLOYMENT OF TECHNICAL ADVISOR FOR
MISR KAFR EL DAWAR (KED) AND MISR EL BEIDA (EB)
1.        About US$300,000 is included under the proposed loan for the
employment of non-Egyptian technical advisors.
These advisors should be employed as soon as possible to forward project
implementation during the present period of relative stagnation in the
world textile equipment industry and would be involved in the initial
procurement stage of the proposed project and, during the implementation
period, would assist the project teams established within the two
companies in executing the proposed project.  Initially the recommendation
regarding the employment of outside consultant-advisors had not been well
received by the Egyptian authorities who felt that there was enough
expertise available within Egypt to perform the functions expected from
the outside advisors. The authorities had, nevertheless, agreed to invite
proposals from a short list of consultant firms, using terms of reference
agreed with the  Bank,  and indicated they would not object to appointing
consultants if these offered better expertise than is available in Egypt.
2.        The draft terms of reference for such advisors were discussed
with the companies during appraisal and a number of consulting firms have
already been contacted by the Ministry of Industry.
3.        Local management of KED and EB are competent in managing
existing operations and neither company is employing any expatriates.
Feasibility studies have been prepared by the companies; also, expansion
of plant facilities in the past were accomplished by local management in
a satisfactory manner. It is recognized therefore that execution of the
proposed project can be successfully carried out by the present management
with only limited outside assistance. Implementation of the project is
being handled by special units established within KED and EB. The KED
team consists of a team leader, electrical, civil, spinning and weaving
engineers and a scheduling coordinator. The EB team consists of a team
leader, electrical, civil, dyeing, printing, and finishing engineers and
a scheduling coordinator. All these people have been selected from
existing staff and seconded to the project units on a full time basis and,
at a lower level, the teams will be supported by regular company personnel.
Preparation and evaluation of foreign tenders is being coordinated and
supervised by the General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI), which
is responsible to the Ministry of Industry for all foreign procurement in
the industrial sector.



ANNEX 4-5
Page 2
4.        While management personnel of the companies have good experience
with the type of equipment they are currently operating, it appears that
they may not be fully familiar with the different types of modern nachinery
which will be offered to them as a result of international competitive
bidding. Also, operation of the new plant at a higher productivity level
would require additional training as well as introduction of modern
technical and cost control methods during implementation and early operations
of the plant. Since KED and EB do not have sufficient experience in inter-
national procurement, mill control and production planning systems for high
procuctivity operation the companies will employ a 'technical Advisor
(TA). The main responsibility of the TA will be to assist the implementation
units of the companies in drafting detailed engineering specifications,
evaluating tenders and providing management and technical assistance to
KED and EB to start up the project and integrate it with existing operations.
The TA will most likely be an experienced engineering and consulting company
with worldwide reputation and expertise in the textile field. To cover the
cost of this assistance US$0.3 million, based on about 150 man-weeks of consulting
time, has been included in the project for Bank financing.
5.       It is believed that the early involvement of outside experts
familiar with modern machinery and equipment as well as implementation of
modern systems in the areas of project control, inventory management,
preventive maintenance, high productivity operation and quality control are
very important for a successful start and timely implementation of the
project. It is also believed that in view of the large procurement element and
potential costs associated with any delay in project implementation,the expenditure
of US$0.3 million to be spent for the TA which represents about 0.2% of the
project cost is well justified.
6.        The Arab Fund which is interested in co-financing the project
has also expressed the view that employment of a TA will be essential in
assisting the companies in the implementation of the project, particularly,
in the area of procurement.
7.        The Terms of Reference for the TA are as follows:
(a) The TA will give technical assistance to KED and EB during
implementation and early operations; (b) the TA shall supply, as required
during project implementation and early operations, highly experienced
engineers in the fields of spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, and
finishing, and any other discipline required. The duration of the assign-
ment is estimated to be 3-1/2 years; (c) specifically, the TA shall assist
KED and EB project teams in:



ANNEX 4-5
Page 3
a) reviewing plant design and machinery specifications;
b) formulating and evaluating tender documents for plant and
machinery;
c) developing production plans, including work assignments, and
operating and maintenance schedules for machinery designed to
maintain high productivity operation;
d) developing quality standards for company products as well as
appropriate quality control methods;
e) reviewing and monitoring the work of the project teams and
setting up a project control system based on up to date project
management methods;
f) start-up and early operation of new machinery and equipment.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES
The Base Cost Estimate reflects estimated equipment prices
prevailing in November/December,1975. Detailed listings of assumed unit
prices by type of machine are given in Annex 4-3.
The following assumptions have been made with respect to cal-
culating freight, duties etc :
Spare Parts: Estimated at 5% of value of imported machinery and
equipment.
Freight and Insurance: Estimated to be 10%o of f.o.b. value
of imported machinery, equipment and spares.
Import Duties:  None
Clearingand Local Transport: Estimated to be 2.5% of f.o.b.
value of imported machinery, equipment and spare
parts.
Erection: Estimated to be 3% and 5% for KED and EB respectively
of f.o.b. value of imports. Half would be in
foreign exchange.
Physical contingencies are 5% of the Base Cost Estimate. The
allowance for price escalation is as per the detailed schedules assuming the
following inflation rates:

KAFR EL DAWAR
Assumptions Made for Calculating Incremental
Worling Capital Requirements
Working capital requirements for the project were determined by using
the following assumptions. The working capital requirements here exclude
short term debt that might be used for financing. Allocations of profits
which are carried over the year-end and the current portion of long-term
debt are also excluded.
A. Current Assets
(a)   Cash:
5% of cash operating costs are assumed to be sufficient for cash
requirements. Any excess or deficit cash will be shown in the cash surplus
balance outside current assets.
(b)   Accounts Receivable:
The actual collection period of 55 days or 15% of the sales revenue
is taken.
(c)   Inventory
For inventory, the following breakdown is used :
(i)   Rpw Materials Inventory:
Cotton, the basic raw material, is allocated to KED in
October-November each year and fully paid during that
time. Actual shipments of cotton are made between
October and April. The year-end inventory of cotton
has historically been between 35-40% of the yearly
require-nents. Here 37% is assumed. The same percentage
is used for imported fibers, i.e. polyester staple and
filament yarn.
(ii) Work in Progress:
Inventory of work in progress has been about 10% of
total operating costs,



ANNEX 5-4
Page 2
(iii) Finished Goods:
The finished goods inventory equals about 12% or 45 days
of total operating costs.
(iv) Spares:
KED kecps about a three-year supply of spares. For the
Base Case, the spares inventory is assumed to remain at
1976 levels (in real terms). For the project, the
estimated spare requirements are taken and maintained
at 0.79 million LE (in 1976 prices).
(v)   Other:
Fuel and oil, packing materials, waste and documentary
credits amount to about 2.5% of total operating costs
and are included in this category.
(d)   Other Current Assets
Includes loan to employees, other short-term debtors, prepaid cotton
and miscellaneous current assets amounting to about 7% of total operating
costs.
B. Current Liabilities
(a)   Accounts Payable
Trade accounts payable amount to about 1h% of total cash operating
costs.
(b)   Other Current Liabilities
Include prepaid sales and non-commercial current liabilities and can
be estimated at about 7% of total cash operating costs.

EGYPT - TEXTILES PROJECT
EL BEIDA
Assumptions Made for Calculating Incremental Working Capital Requirements
Working capital requirements for the project were determined by using
the following assumptions. The working capital requirements here exclude
short term debt that might be used for financing. Allocation of profits
which are carried over the year-end and the current portion of long-term
debt are also excluded.
A. Curirent Assets
(a) Cash
5% of cash operating costs are assumed to be sufficient for cash
requLirements.
(b) Accounts Receivable
25% of total sales revenue is used.
(c) Other Debtors
These are assumed to amount to 6% of total sales revenue.
(d) Inventory
This is broken down into:  raw materials, work in progress, finished
goods, spares and others.
(i)  Raw Materials: 1 .Chemicals and Dyes - the following schedule
of percentages of yearly requirements is
assumed: 1976, 120%; 1977, 105%, 1978, 9C%;
1979-1985, 80%.
2. Wool - 25% of yearly requirements.
3.  Gray Cloth - 17% of yearly requirements.
(ii) Work in Progress
5% of total operating costs.
(iii) Finished Goods
11% of total operating costs.
(iv) Spares
For the Base Case the 1976 level of LE 2.10 million is taken
escalated by 5% annually.
The incremental requirements for the EB sub-project are
LE 0.45 million in 1976 prices.






ANNEX 5-5
Page 2
(v) Other
This includes Documentary Credit, Packing and Parcelling Mats
and "Other" -- an assumption of LE 2.0 million is made reflect-
ing a historical level unlikely to be affected by the project.
B. Current Liabilities
(a) Accounts Pr3yable
Estimated at 25% of cash operating costs.
(b) Other
Estimated at 6% of cash operating costs.

EGYPT - TEXTILES PROJECT
KAFR EL DAWAR
INCRZPENTAL FOR THE PROJECT
b:oduction, Sales Price, and Operatinf Cost Assuptions
A. Genseral
Assumptiona made about the expected inflation of sales prices
and operating costs are the same as those made in the income statement
projections for the company without the project (Annex 2-1i). All prices
and costs given below are in mid-1976 prices unless otherwise noted.
Some of the operating costs Fre expressed as a percentagq of
another variable. In these caaes, the percentage was either derived from
the actual data of the last five years or estimated by the Bank from data
given by the company.
Tax calculations and profit allocations are described in Annex
2-9.
B.   Production
(a) Efficiency
The new spinning and weaving facilities will begin commercial
production in July 1979 with the following build-up in efficiency
assuming 300 operating days per year :
1979 for 6 months       50%
1980 for 6 months       75%
Thereafter              90%
(b)  Cloth Production
At 90% efficiency   the new looms will produce a total of 26.6
million meters per year of which 12.1 nillioc meters will be blended fabrics.
Since 2.0 million meters are expected to be produced without the project and
since the equipment now producing theae 2.0 million meters will be utilized
for high valued cotton fabrics, the incremental production of the project
will be 1.1 million meters of blended and 16.5 million meters of cotton
fabrics.
(c) Yarn Production
,Surplus yarn for sales is estimated to reach 1196 tons per year.
Of this, 450 tons would be count 40 and 50 and the remaining 296 tons of
count 60.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 2
(d) Waste
For the polyester plant, the assumed waste factor is 13%, for the
cotton plant 21%, the average comes therefore to 18% of the total fiber
requirements, which equals 22% of the yarn production.
C.   Prices
(a) Polyester Blends
Here an average price of 0.8 LE/m is assumed which would give
the company an internal rate of return of about 15% on it's investment in
the polyester plant. Such a price is substantially lower than the present
price of about LE 1.6/m. To arrive at the average of 0.8 LE/M for all of KED's
polyester/cotton fabrics production, the incremental project output has to be
priced at 0.6 LE/m.
(b) Cotton Fabrics
Price assumptions for each quality for the export and domestic
market are given in Annex 7-1, Table 1.
D.   Operating Costs
(a)  Wages and-Salaries
KED estimates the labour requirements for the project to be
as follows:
Polyester      Cotton
Plant        Plant         Total
Spinning             808            500         1,308
Weaving              h76            h88           96h
Total:  1,284             988        2,272
The average wage is assumed to be about 31.5 LE per month.  The
cost of wages and salaries would therefore amount to 9h1,000 LE per
year.
(b) Raw Materials
The incremental raw material requirements based on an incremental
production of 10.1 million meters of polyester-cotton fabrics and 15.5
million meters of 100% cotton fabrics are as follows:

Total              650.0                  4,272.0
All polyester inputs are to be imported initially, and are expected to
be produced domestically after 1980 at about the same price. DutieB and
Government taxes are shown in indirect taxes.



ANNEX6-1
Page 4
(c) Power
Incremental power requirements are estimated to be 29.8 and 36.7
million kwh for the polyester-cotton and the cotton plant respectively.
The total incremental is therefore 66.5 million kwh at a cost of 0.0056
LEAkwh totalling 372,000 LE per year at full capacity.
(d) Maintenance and Materials
Estimated to be 1.2% of the gross fixed assets costs, or about
320,000 LE per year at full capacity.
(e) Subcontracting
Estimated to be about 16% of the incremental sales revenue. This
is slightly higher than the assumed average for the other products of KED.
This is required in view of the fact that dyeing and finishing for polyester-
cotton requires additional equipment and that all fabrics produced by the
project are wider than the average width of KED products.
(f) Indirect Taxes
In addition to the estimated 16% of the value of raw materials,
which accounts for the yarn production and treasury tax, the import duties
and government tax is included here. At full capacity this amounts tot
(000 LE/year)     Staple          Filament        Total
Tams                 112             239           351

Total         197             272            469
(g) Depreciation and Amortization
The average depreciation charge is 7.2% of the gross fixed assets
value excluding preoperating expenses which are amortized over five years.
From this, depreciation amounts to 2.08 and amortization to 0.72 million
LE per year.
(h) Other Overhead
Assumed to be 6% of total wages and salaries.
(i) Long Term Interest
Assumed to be 10% and 6% for the IBRD and Arab Fund loans respectively
with repayments being made yearly with constant principal payments. The Bank



ANNEX 6-1
Page5
loan would be repayable over 11 years and repayments of principal would start
by the middle of 1980 after the grace period of 4 years. The Arab Fund loan
is assumed to be repaid over a period of 15 years after a grace period of 5
years.

(j) Income Taxes
As a result of the project, the company will be exempted of
income taxes for 5 years after implementation of the project.  In other
years, taxes are calculated as per Annex 2-9, page 4.
(k) Profit Allocations
As a result of implementing the project, the company will not pay
any dividends to the government during the years 1977-1979. Otherwise the
profit allocation is the same as described in Annex 2-9, page 4.

EGYPT: TEXTILES PROJECT
EL BEIDA
INCREMENTAL CASE
Assumptions Made for Calculating Production Revenues
and Operating Costs
A.     General
Assumptions made about the expected inflation of sales prices and
operating costs are the same as those made in the income statement
projections for the company without the project (Annex 2-14). All prices
and costs given below are in mid-1976 prices unless otherwise noted.
Some of the operating costs are expressed as a percentage of another
variable. In these cases, the percentage was either derived from the actual
data of the last five years or estimated by the Bank from data given by the
Company.
Tax calculations and profit allocations are described in Annex 2-9.
B.     Production
Commercial production of this sub-project is expected to start in
January 1979. The assumed efficiency build-up is 50% during the
first six months of 1979, 75% during the second six month period and 90%
thereafter.
C.     Prices
Commission prices for the company after implementation of the project
were estimated in detail by EB and from this the incremental revenues
calculated. As given in detail in Annex 6-5, page 1, the average commission
charges for dyeing and finishing are expected to increase in the following
manner
Without        After
the           the
(LE/Linear Meters)        Project        Project       % Change
Average charge for
Gray                    0.032          0.032           -
Bleaching               0.035          0.039           11
Dyeing                  0.060          0.072           20
Printing                o.o68          0.086           26
Pblyester Dyeing        0.200          0.200           -
The increases result from a considerable change in the company's expected
services. After implementation of the two sub-projects EB is expected to
process much wider fabrics and to dye and print higher quality finishes,
which the company cannot do now to the same extent because of the relatively



ANNEX 6-2
Page 2
large portion of obsolete and unreliable equipment.
D.     Operating Costs
(a) Wages and Salaries
The company estimates the following increases in the number of
employees
Dyeing and Finishing
of Fabrics                   302
of Yarn                       37
Gray store, making up               205
Gaustic soda recovery plant          30
Total                      574
The average wage is assumed to be about LE 40/month resulting in an
annual labor charge of LE 275,000.
(b) Chemicals and Dyestuffs
The cost of chemicals and dyestuffs is estimated at about 30%
of the incremental dyeing and finishing revenue.
(c) Gray Cloth
The amount of gray cloth which has to be purchased for conversion
into PVC coated fabrics is estimated at 110% of the finished product
volume. The assumed price is LE 0.3 per meter.
(d) Utilities
Incremental power and steam requirements are as follows
Quantity      Unit Cost       Annual Cost
(I&/Unit)         (LE)- 
Electricity          12 Mwh          7,000           84,000
Steam              240,000 tons        454          109,000
Total:        193,000
(e) Maintenance Materials
The historically derived percentage of 3% of gross fixed assets
is used.
(f) Packing
Estimated at LE 0.002 per meter of finished fabric.



ANNEX 6-2
Page 3
(g) Indirect Taxes
Indirect taxes are estimated at 19% of the value of imported
cheidcals and dyestuffs (75% is imported) and 15% of the value of
maintenance materiala.
(h) Depreciation and Amortization
The average depreciation charge is 7.2% of the gross fixed assets
value excluding preoperating expenses which are amortized over five
years. From this, depreciation amounts to 0.78 and amortization to
0.35 million LE per year.
(i) Administration
Includes all overhead and is estimated at 20% of the annual cost
of wages and salaries.
(j) Interest
Short-term interest is 6% per annum. Long-term interest on the
1BRD loan is 10%. The IBRD loan is repayable over 11 years starting
in 1980 after a grace period of 4 years. The IBRD debt schedule is
given below:
Outstanding                         Principal
Loan            Interest        Repayment

EGYPT - TEXTILES PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE CALCULATION OF THE
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
The economic rates of return for the two sub-projects are determined
by adjusting the financial cost and revenue assumptions in the manner
described below. The same inflators and deflators as used in the financial
analysis are used here. For calculation of the economic rate of return the
parallel market foreign exchange rate (1LE - 1.56 U$s) is used as an approxi-
mation for the shadow foreign exchange rate. For ease of comparison with
the financial costs and benefits, the following presentation gives the
economic costs and benefits are given at the official rate of exchange
wherever this facilitates such comparison.
A.    Capital Costs
The financial capital costs are used, adjusted by the interest dur-
ing construction and by the shadow foreign exchange rate.
B.    Economic Benefits
For KED, the economic benefits can be divided into two categories.
The first category contains the benefits derived from exports of fabrics
and yarns, while the second category contains the benefits from domestic
sales.
To calculate the export benefits, the same price assumptions have
been made as in the financial analysis.
The value of the cotton fabrics which are sold domestically has been
determined by using the corresponding export prices, which are available
for all types of fabrics (Page 5).
For the polyester-cotton product mix envisaged by KED, a European
consulting firm has supplied the following margins which are compared
below to KED's expected operating cost margins (adjusted to early 1976
price levels):

materials and by eliminating transfer paymeats from the spinning margin.

Average Cost of Fabric  1.35             1.26           1.09
Although the average fabric cost is quite similar for European manu-
facturers and for KED, there are significant differences between them in
each of the categories. The difference in the raw material margin is
explained by the inclusion of import duties on polyester fibers in KED
financial costs. The higher spinning margin for KED is due to the high
depreciation and financial charges for the new spinning equipment which
is considerably more expensive than the average European equipment. At
the same time, any cost reduction because of cheap Egyptian labour is
mostly offset by the much lower productivity which is about half of that
of European manufacturers.  With KED's wages being only about one-tenth
of those prevailing in Europe, weaving costs are substantially lower in
KED than in Europe. This reduction in costs is only partially offset by
the high investment costs required for KED's new facilities. Still, KED's
incremental weaving margin is only about 25% of the average European
margin. The cost of finishing is considerably higher to KI= than to
&ropean textile manufacturers for reasons explained further below.
The value of the polyester-cotton fabrics has been calculated on
the basis of the average cost of these fabrics in Europe, increased by
15% to cover taxes and profits. The average fabric price would then be
$1.35 x 1.15 = $1.55/m2, or, using an average width of about 123 cm, the
average fabric price per linear meter becomes $1.91. This corresponds
to an average price of about $3.00 for the heavy suiting fabrics and
about $1.00 for the lighter shirting and blouse material.
To establish the economic benefits of expanding EB's converting
capacity it has to be taken into account that grey fabrics cannot be
consumed as such but have to be bleached, dyed or printed to become a
consumable final product. Instead of so converting their grey goods to
satisfy the domestic market, Egypt could follow a policy of exporting
them and importing finished fabrics. Such a policy, however, could
only be defended if it could be shown to result in substantial savings
to the economy. It is therefore important to establish whether EB is
an efficient converter of grey fabrics by comparing their average
commission charges to those of large converting houses in Europe and
the U.S. The very nature of the converting business makes such a
comparison extremely difficult because of the very large variety of



ANNEX 7
Page 3
operations, because prices are often adjusted to achieve optimum utilization
of the converting facilities and because they depend very much on the
type of contract that can be obtained. The comparison below can therefore
be only taken as a very broad indication for EB's competitiveness
Comparison of kverage Commission Charges

Printing                         0.17       0.20-0.25       0.34-0.63
Dyeing of Polyester Blends       0.51       0.20            0.15-0.36
From the above comparison it can be roughly stated that EB's conversion
charges seem to be in line with those prevailing in the US and Europe except
for the dyeing of polyester blends which are converted considerably cheaper
outside Egypt. This is the result of the different technology which is used
at EB compared to the one used in the US and Europe. EB, however, is not in
a position to use the more efficient US and European technology because its
production runs are too short and too varied and thus do not justify the
installation of such equipment. It is estimated that for the type of length
and variety of dyeing of polyester blends that EB has to do a comparative
commission charge of about 30 to 35 US cents per meter would have to be paid
if the conversion was done in Europe or the.US. Accordingly, for the
valuation of the economic benefits, EB's commission charges for bleaching
dyeing and printing cotton fabrics have been used, but the dyeing charge
of polyester blends has been reduced by 65% to 33 US cents per meter.
Regarding Egypt's fabric exports, the question can be raised whether
it would not be more beneficial for the country to export grey goods and
not to expand EB's converting facilities. The experience of the exporting
companies has clearly been that it is more profitable to export finished
than grey goods. However, because of the deteriorating machinery at EB,
the quality of finished fabrics has suffered and iMD in particular has
been forced to export more and more of its fabrics to 'vestern Europe in
grey form. To show the difference in export realization between grey and
finished fabrics a number of KED fabrics have been selected which are
exported in grey as well as in finished form. The comparison which is
given in Pe   shows that EB's commission charge is with one exception
well covered by the price differential. It therefore seems desirable for
Egypt to export finished rather than grey fabrics.
A part of EB's major expansion will increase its capacity to produce
PVC-coated fabrics. The assumed financial price of about US$2.00 per
meter has been compared to and has been found in line with world market
prices for similar fabrics.

C.     Economic Operating Costs
The single most important adjustment which has had to be made to
the financial operating costs is in the valuation of cotton for the KED
sub-project. The table below gives the domestic price, the expected
export price and the ratio of these two prices for the three basic
types of cotton required by the project :
----------------- US cents/lb -----------------
Domestic    Excpected Export       Price Ratio
Price          Price          (op  /Domesticl
Cotton Type                               (at ofiTcial rate of exhne
Extra Long Staple: Menoufi          46.3            94.0                2.03
Long staple: Giza 69                41.5            84.4               -2.02
Long Medium Staple: Ashmouni        38.7            70.0                1.81
The expected export price has been obtained by taking the historical
relationship between the three Egyptian types of cotton and the American Sr4
1-1/166" and by maintaining this historical ratio given the lQng-term price
forecast of 52 cents per lb. for the SM 1-1/16".
In the following table, a calculation is jnade of the factor by which
the financial cotton c6sts have to be multiplied in order to arrive at the
export value of the cotton used

Total              100                                  1.97
For polyester staple and filament yarn the same import prices as in
the financial analysis have been used, excluding duties and taxes.
The chemicals and dyes input into the EB project has been taken at
the financial costs since about 75% of this expenditure is for imports.
The remaining 25% represents a very large variety of chemicals and dyes
purchased domestically probably at a price somewhat higher than world
market price.
The heavy, grey fabrics which EB has to purchase to convert them
into PVC coated fabrics are estimated to have a border price of about
65-70 US cents per meter or about 10% lower than the financial cost to EB.
D.     Economic Rates of Return
Pages 7-9  contain a summary of the economic cost and benefit streams
for the KED and EB sub-projects and for the overall economic return on the
proposed project. The tables also give the results of the sensitivity tests
performed.
