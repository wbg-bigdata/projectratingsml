(LOAN 1292-EGT)
PREFACE
The Loan 1292-EGT for Kafr El Dawar (KED) and El Beida
(EB) Textile Project, in the amount of US$52.0 million, was signed
in September 1976 and was closed in Mdarch 1983, with US$51.6 million
disbursed. An amount of US$0.4 million was cancelled.
The nain objectives of the Loan were to finance the
expansion of KED and the expansion and rehabilitation of EB textile
companies, as well as training of the technical personnel, to satisfy
the increasing demand for woven fabrics in Egypt and strengthen the
export potential of the companies.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Industry
Department, based on a mission to Egypt in May 1984. No comments
were received from the Borrower.
This project has not been audited by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

EGYPT - KAFR EL DAWAR AND EL BEIDA TEXTILE PROJECT (LOAN 1292-EGT)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project consisted of a major expansion of KED and EB public
sector textile companies (the sponsors) in Kafr El Dawar near Alexandria.
The objective of the KED project was to increase the company's capacity to
manufacture an additional 26.6 million meters of fine cotton and
polyester-cotton fabrics. The objective of the EB project was to replace
obsolete equipment and to expand by 43 million meters the capacity of the
company to dye, print and finish textile fabrics (PCR, paras. 2.01 - 2.03).
The project was mechanically completed with three and a half
years delay and achieved the full capacity utilization four :ears behind
the appraisal schedule. In spite of the delay, project implementation was
reasonably successful due to the satisfactory project management by the
Project Implementation Units established by the two companies, in view of
the difficult construction environment in Egypt and at the project site,
during implementation. Most of the delay was due to slow progress of civil
works caused by recurring shortages of skilled manpower and building
materials. Other factors which contributed to the length of the
implementation period were an eight months delay in making the project
effective as well as the fire at KED construction site which delayed the
completion of the civil works by about one year (PCR, paras. 3.01 - 3.03,
3.05 - 3.08).
The project met its main objective to provide additional textile
output under conditions of improved efficiency and productivity as well as
training of engineering supervisory and operating staff (PCR, para. 3.06).
The project experienced a cost overrun of 12.8% mostly due to
higher than estimated costs of ci7il works. A US$27.3 million equivalent
overrun in the local costs was partially mitigated by US$7.7 million
underrun in the foreign component due to the benefits of ICB in procurement
of plant and machinery as well as strengthening of US dollar during the
period of the project implementation (PCR, paras. 3.15 - 3.17).
The FRR and ERR for the overall project are calculated at 11.0%
and 17.4% compared to appraisal estimates of 13.3% and 21.6%. The lower
figure in case of the FRR is partly due to the overrun in the capital costs
and delay in project completion, but primarily as a result of the
sector-wide price controls for yarn, fabrics and commission converting fees
mandated by the Government. The lower figure in the case of ERR is due to
the overrun in the capital costs, delav in project completion and lower
than estimated world market prices for textile products (PCR, paras.
5.01 - 5.09). The most important lessons learned from the experience in
this project were:



(a) contracts for civil works should be subject to international
bidding to allow the sponsors to select among contractors
offering a wide variety of building techniques, especially those
using less time consuming prefabricated structures and on a
turnkey basis to allow imports of material and skilled labor in
times of local shortages and to minimize the impact of a
burdensome and slow decision making process in public sector
projects;
(b) special attention should be given to training of the weaving
operators as this stage of textile manufacturing in the
developing countries proves to be most vulnerable to high
turnover and absenteeism of the workers;
(c) the disbursement schedule should take into account the initial
hiatus due to the delays in the loan effectiveness, mobilization
of resources and contract negotiations with building contractors
and consultants; and
Cd) in co-financing operations, a closer scrutiny of conditions
imposed by the co-financier, particularly regarding
disbursements, should be made (PCR, paras. 9.02, 9.03).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT -KAFR EL DAWAR AND EL BEIDA TEXTILE PROJECT
(LOAN 1292-EGT)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      buring nationalization of industrial enterprises which began in
1961, most of the existing textile companies in Egypt became state-owned
and were incorporated into the Egyptian General Organization for Spinning
and Weaving (EGOSV) including all spinning, 70% of weaving, 90% of
converting, 45% of knitting and 30% of garment manufacturing. EGOSW was a
holding company responsible for operating, coordinating and supervising the
textile sector while the responsibility for investment was vested in the
General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI). Both EGOSW and GOFI
reported to the Ministry of Industry.
1.02      By Decree No. 111 all general organizations, except GOFI, were
dissolved effective December 31, 1975 and the shares of the 30 subsidiary
companies of EGOSW were transferred to the Government, with the chairmen of
the individual companies reporting directly to the Minister of Industry.
The purpose of the decree was ostensibly to give greater freedom and
flexibility to the management of the indi.vidual companies but, in practice,
the chairmen were given little authority in the areas of wages, pr._ces and
personnel policies, while lack of coordination and planning led to less
than optimum investment decisions. This result2d in unbalanced growth,
chaotic supply-demand situation, uneven export performance and decreased
profitability in the sector.l/
1.03      In 1974, the Government of Egypt (GOE) requested Bank financing
to cover part of the foreign exchange expenditures for a project involving
two state-owned companies, Kafr El Dawar (KEB) and El Beida (EB) both
located in Kafr El Dawar near Alexandria. The objective of the project was
to expand their production from 107 to 134 and from 143 to 186 million
linear meters (MLM) respectively, to replace obsolete equipment, assist in
introduction of equipment and technology suitable for processing of
polyester-cotton blends as well as sector training and export development.
The operations of the two companies are closely interrelated since all of
KED's grey fabric output is converted by EB on a commission basis and KED
accounts for about 80% of EB's commission business. The project was
appraised in January 1976 and approved by the Board in June 1976. The cost
of the project was estimated at US$153.2 million equivalent.  The plan for
financing the foreign component included the Bank loan of US$52.0 million
to the Borrower (Arab Republic of Egypt) as well as a US$34.5 million loan
from the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (AFSED) to finance
spinning equipment for KED. Local financing was made available by an
increase of the share capital, the companies' own generation of funds and
loans from the local commercial banks. The project was the Bank's first
investment in Egypt's textile sector. At the time the only other
1/   In 1983/84 the sector is expected to break even on sales of LE 1,039
million as compared with LE 44 million profit on sales of LE 4U0
million in 1974.

involvement of the Bank Group in a textile-related sector was a
US$18.5 million IDA credit appraised in July 1973 to help finance
construction of four new, and rehabilitation of ten existing ginneries
(Cr. 423-EGT).
1.04      On December 1, 1983, in view of the deteriorating situation in
the sector, the Government created the Textile Industry Corporation (TIC)
responsible for holding and operating all textile and synthetic fiber
companies in the public sector. TIC also assumed responsibility for
investments as well as import and export of all inputs and outputs of the
sector, except export of raw cotton.

policy to replace obsolete equipment and increase the supply of woven
fabrics for domestic and export markets. KED and EB were identified by the
Bank's mission in 1974 to be the best textile mills in the country, with
satisfactory operating and financial performance, competent and progressive
management, relatively high product quality and good export potential.
Both sponsors submitted to the Bank well-prepared feasibility studies and
the project was preappraised in October 1975 and appraised in January 1976
(SAR No. 1131-EGT dated June 7, 1976). The loan was approved by the Bank's
Executive Directors in June 1976 and became effective in February 1977.
2.02      At the time of project preparatioA and appraisal there were two
major issues of concern to the Bank. The first related to the fact that,
despite the importance of the te tile sector to the Egyptian economy, no
comprehensive sector studies had 1,.--3n done in the past. To overcome this
problem, the Bank financed a detailed study of the sector under the
Agriculture and Industrial Project (Credit No. 524-EGT of December 1974).
The study was completed in May 1976 and provided the basis for a dialogue
with GOE regarding the textile sector and preparation of the subsequent
textile project (Second Textile Project Loan No. 1837-EGT). The Bank was
also anxious to impress upon GOE that a successful economic development
program will depend on competent management, realistic price and wage
policy as well as an expansion of export markets and an increase of the
range of products that are competitive in these markets. Subsequently, GOE
agreed to carry out a study to develop an export promotion program to cover
the whole range of manufactured products, and US$1.0 million was included
in the loan for that purpose.
B. Project Description and Objectives
2. 03     The project was designed to expand and rehabilitate the
xr- facturing capacity of two textile companies: KED and EB. The
objective of the KED project was to increase the company's annual
manufacturing capacities of fine cotton and polyester/cotton fabrics by
16.5 and 10.1 MLM, respectively. About 70% of the cotton fabric output as



-3-
well as all the yarn not used in weaving was to be exported. The EB
subproject consisted of the expansion of annual converting capacity by
43 MLM of fabric and 1,550 tons of yarn, as well as replacement of the
obsolete equipment for converting 30 MIM per year of fabrics and 500 tons
per year of yarn. To house the new facilities KED was to eonstruct about
60,000 m2 and EB about 20,000 m2 of covered floor space. The project also
provided US$1.0 million for the Ministry of Industry (MOI) to develop an
export promotion program (para 2.02), US$0.2 million for training abroad of
technical and supervisory personnel in the textile sector, and
US$0.1 million technical assistance for the preparation of a feasibility
study for the next textile project. The project's objectives also included
providing employment for about 2,850 persons and, through balancing and
rearranging of production schedules, an increase in overall capacity
utilization as well as machine and labor productivity in both companies.
Ill. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The project was mechanically completed in January 1983 with a
delay of over three years. The delay was mostly due to the slow progress
of the civil works caused by severe and recurrent shortages of building
matcrials and skilled construction labor as the period of the project
implementation coincided with the post-war building boom in Egypt after the
1973 war. While the Bank loan included US$2.3 million equivalent for
procurement of the construction materials abroad, only US$0.13 million was
actually utilized for this purpose due to the Borrower's resistance to
using the funds for materials which were locally produced. Other major
causes of delay were an eight-month long administrative procedure in making
the project effective and the fire which gutted the KED construction site
and delayed the completion of the civil works by about one year (Annex 1).
3.02      Commercial production of yarn at KED started in 1983 and reached
the appraisal rate of 6 TMT by the middle of the year. The weaving mill
started commercial production in June 1983 and by May 1984 reached the
production rate of 20.1 MLM or 75% of the appraised capacity utilization.
With addition of the third shift in April 1984, the weaving mill is
expected to reach production of 28.9 MIM in FY85, i.e., about 10% above the
appraisal estimates. The EB component of the project was mechanically
completed in January 1983 but due to the delay in completion of the
additional steam generation unit (i.ot financed by the project), the new
equipment operated at 35% capacity utilization until March 1984 and only in
May 1984 achieved the appr:aisal rate of 90% capacity utilization (43 MLM).
In addition, about 30 MLLM per year of obsolete capacity was replaced by
modern equipment, and is operating satisfactorily.
3.03      Another objective of the project was the training program which
has been fully implemented. Altogether, 48 engineers and technicians were
trained abroad and 70 at the companies' site. In addition, the erecting
personnel of the machinery suppliers trained 43 engineers and 93 mechanics
in the use of the new machinery. Out of the US$1.3 million loan component

-4-
provided to 14I for sector development only US$0.1 million was used for
preparation of a feasibility study for tbe second textile project.  The
US$1.0 million component for export promotion program and the
US$0.2 million component for training abroad of technical and supervisory
personnel from the textile sector (in addition to KED & EB personnel) were
not utilized. Wiile these do not represent major shortfalls in the actual
project, they do indicate that some of the sector objectives were not
fulfilled.
B. Project Scope
3.04      There were no significant changes in the physical scope of the
project. In the RED project, US$2.1 million of the Bank loan originally
included to finance construction materials and polyester fibers, and
US$0.2 million to finance consulting services, were subsequently
reallocated to purchase additional weaving equipment. Because of a
decrease in demand for color-woven fabrics EB decided to forego the
expansion of the yarn-dyeing facilities. Also, in the EB project, US$1.2
million of the Bank loan originally included to finance construction
materials and US$O. 1 to finance consulting services were reallocated to
purchase additional processing equipment, stand-by diesel generators,
vehicles, dyestuffs and chemicals. Altogether, the US$1.2 million of the
MOI component and US$3.6 million of the Bank loan were reallocated. The
reallocation resulted, in the case of RED, in increasing the annual weaving
capacity by an additional 2.3 MLI and, in the case of EB, in increasing the
company's flexibility in providing varying proportions of dyeing, printing
and finishing services.
C.  Project Management
3.05      For the purpose of project implementation, KED and EB formed
separate Project Implementation Units (PIU) comprised of the companies'
senior staff with extensive experience in civil works, engineering, textile
technology, p_ocurement and finance.  All civil work design and engineering
design was carried out in-house by the PlUJs. For the executior of the
civil works both companies entered into contractual arrangements with local
constructior. companies. Originally, the companies retained an experienced
textile consulting firm as a Technical Advisor (TA) from Belgium to provide
250 expert man-weeks of technical assistance. Actually, only 100 man-weeks
of TA's assistance were utilized for development of the machinery
specifications but all subsequent tasks such as the bid evaluation,
procurement, detailed engineering and erection were carried out efficiently
by the PIUs so that it was possible to dispense with the balance of the
outside technical assistance. The PIUs were also responsible for the
control of the project costs, completion schedules as well as monthly and
quarterly progress reports, and discharged these functions to the
satisfaction of the local managements as well as the Bank. The staff
assigned to the PIUs gained valuable experience in international
competitive bidding procedures and project management and subsequently were
promoted to senior executive positions within and outside of FED and EB.
This contributed to strengthening of the management potential in the
sector.

D. Training
3.06      As the result of additional capacity financed by the project, EB
has increased the number of direct production labor by 425 and KED by 2,295
for a total of 2,720 close to the appraisal projections of 2,846
(Annex 2). To cope with their expanded activities, both companies
developed a detailed job-related training program for the operators,
mechanics, supervisory personnel and management. On-the-job training
program for the operating personnel over a three-year pe-iod 1980-1983
covered about 1,500 people. In addition, as a part of a special training
program, about 100 mechanics and 40 engineers were trained on site, and 40
mechanics and supervisory staff attended 2- to 3-week courses at the
European plants of the machinery suppliers, and 25 engineers attended 3- to
9-month textile technology courses at Manchester University (UK). The cost
of the special training amounted to about US$0.3 million equivalent wh-le
the value of the training provided by the machinery suppliers as a part of
the equipment contracts is estimated at US$0.4 million. The training
program can be considered as only partly successful as it has not produced
enough highly qualified weavers, as is reflected in the somewhat lower than
appraised capacity utilization in KED's new weaving mills. An important
lesson for any future textile project is that the problem of training a
sufficient number of highly skilled weavers, in view of a high turnover and
absenteeism, has to receive special consideration in formulation of the
training program.
E. Use and Performance of Engineering Contractors and Consultants
3.07      The project was the first Bank loan to the textile sector in
Egypt and it was selected partly on the basis of the technical and
administrative competence of the management of the two companies. The
feasibility studies, construction design and detailed engineering were
executed by the PIUs of the respective companies. For the technical
assistance during project implementation, the companies employed a Belgian
textile consulting company to act as TA. TA assisted the compaiies to
develop the technical specifications for the spinning, weaving and
converting equipment. The evaluation of the bids and the balance of the
procurement work, erection and production trials were handled by the PlUs
so the input of T& was limited. There was no foreign engineering
contractor, only local general contractors who executed the civil works
under supervision of the engineering departments of the two companies. In
the context of the boom conditions prevailing at the time in the
construction industry in Egypt, resulting in recurrent shortages of cement,
steel and skilled labor, the performance of the General Contractor can be
considered as generally satisfactory. However, in retrospect, an
experienced international contractor with access to imported materials may
well have been able to speed up implementation, although at a higher
initial foreign cost. Even this judgement must be viewed with care since
civil works/construction-related shortages in Egypt were so pervasive at
the time, it is likely, that some delays would have occurred in any event.



-6-
F. Implementation Schedule
3.08      The mechanical completion of the project was 43 months behind
schedule (Annex 1). Most of the delay vwas due to the slow progress of the
civil works caused by recurring shortages of skilled manpower, management
and building materials. Other factors which contributed to the increase of
the implementation period were an eight-month delay in making the project
effective and the fire which gutted the KED construction site in March 1979
and delayed the completion of the civil works by about one year.
Procurement of machinery presented few problems. There was an additional
period of procurement for EB after reallocation of the proceeds of the loan
(para 3.04). The build-up of commercial production in the RED spinning
mill was according to the appraisal estimates, i.e., full capacity has been
-achieved one year after commissioning; in weaving, full capacity
utilization has been attained 18 months after commissioning. The
converting operations of EB, due to a delay in completion of additional
steam generating unit, achieved full capacity 17 months after
commissioning.
G. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.09      Procurement of plant and machinery was carried out in accordance
with the World Bank guidelines. Except for a few items that were
proprietary equipment, over 98% of the contracts (by value) were awarded
through international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. All
specifications, tender documents and instructions to the bidders were
prepared by the PIUs with the assistance of the TA, reviewed by GOFI, and
accepted by the Bank.  The bids were evaluated in a two-step procedure,
i.e., technical evaluation of bids preceded the opening of the separate
envelopes containing prices; bids technically rated below 65% of the
highest score bidder were disqualified. Altogether, about 800 firms
applied for prequalification and about 100 were prequalified by KED in 20
categories and 250 in 35 categories by EB; in addition, about 50 companies
were prequalified by KED in six categories for supply of spinning equipment
financed by AFSED. Equipment contracts were awarded to companies in 11
countries, the top two (Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany)
received over 50% of the orders (Annex 3), which is in line with the share
of supply of textile machinery to the world markets by these two
countries. For the civil works, two contracts (not financed by the Bank)
were awarded through local competitive bidding to local construction
companies, one for site preparation, excavation and piling, and another for
erection of the buildings.
3.10      After an initial delay 2/ in bid evaluations, award of the
contracts and supply of equipment proceeded smoothly and by the end of
1981, practically all machinery and equipment for the project (about 90% by
value) was delivered to the site. At this point about US$47 million of the
Bank loan was committed and the Bank agreed to procurement of additional
2/   The standard form of GOFI's instruction to the bidders, containing a
boycott clause not acceptable to the Bank, was the main obstacle.
This clause was removed before bidding actually started on the items
financed by the Bank.



-7-
equipment, dyestuffs and chemicals using US$4.8 million reallocated from
construction materials, polyester fibers and the MOI component categories
of the loan (para 3.04).
3.11      Only in one category (wide looms) did the equipment procured
fail to reach the expected level of performance. The difference between
the guaranteed and actual production rate achieved was marginal and XED
elected to forego pressing claims against the supplier in view of the
complexity of the technical factors involved. In two categories the bids
were re-tendered because the first bids were not substantially responsive,
and in one category new bids were invited because of a lack of
competition.
B. Environmental Aspects
3.12      KED is a grey yarn and 'abric mill so the process creates no
problems with water or air pollution. The new spinning and weaving mills
have been equipped with air filters. Also, the carding machines have been
equipped with floor waste exhaust filters to minimize the amount of fibers
and dust inside the spinning shed. Humidity and temperature are controlled
for technical reasons and frequent change of air provides comfortable
working conditions. The only problem is a high noise level in the weaving
mill about 10 decibels higher than the accepted maximum. The management is
fully aware of the effect of the noise on the well being and health of the
operators and special ear plugs to be used by the employees are being
proviactd. Otherwise the safety conditions in both mills are satisfactory.
3.13      In March 1983 the Ministry of Agriculture issued Law No. 48
regulating the composition of effluent from industrial plants. EB has made
an extensive effort to conform to the law and good progress has been made
hi  reducing pH as well as the amount of dissolved and suspended materials
which are all now below the prescribed maximum. Further work is being done
to lower the temperature and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) of the effluent
as well as the oil content, and the management expects to be able to
conform to all parameters of the new law before the end of 1984. Also, all
equipment generating heat and/or steam has been equipped with special hoods
with forced exhaust systems to lower the temperature in the working areas.
3.14      The power plants of both companies have been equipped with
automatic regulating devices to ensure maximum combustion so that the
carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide content of the boiler's flue creates no
environmental hazard to the workers living in houses adjacent to the
plants.
I. Costs, Disbursements and Financing
3.15      The total financing required for the project was US$172.8 million
equivalent, i.e., US$19.6 million above the appraisal estimates (Annex 4).
There was a US$7.7 million underrun in the foreign exchange component and
US$27.3 million overrun in the local costs. Lower than estimated foreign
exchange costs were due to the use of ICB procedure which resulted in
vigorous competition among suppliers at a time when the demand for
equipment was weak due to a prolonged recession in the world textile



-8-
industry, and not purchasing imported construction materials. The strength
of the US dollar contributed to the underrun as most of the contracts were
in the currencies which depreciated in value against the dollar during the
period of procurement. Also, the foreign component of working capital was
below appraisal estimates. Consequently, even including the additional
weaving and processing equipment, dyestuffs and chemicals procured from the
funds reallocated within the Bank loan, the foreign exchange costs of the
project remained below the appraisal estimates (Annex 5). Most of the
overrun in the local component (about US$25 million equivalent) was due to
the increased costs of civil works which reflected a dramatic rise in the
cost of cement, steel and construction labor. The cost of covered
industrial floor space soared to LE 385 per square meter or 75% above the
appraisal estimates including contingencies. A comparison of the actual
capital costs with the appraisal estimates is summarized below:

3.16      The appraisal estimates of disbursements of the Bank loan proved
to be too optimistic (Annex 6).  In the first three years following loan
approval, only US$2.1 million was disbursed as against US$50 million
estimated. Subsequent disbursements followed the pattern of the appraisal
estimates and by the end of 1981 practically all machinery and equipment
for the project was procured and the Bank agreed that tne balance of the
loan (about US$5 million) could be used to purchase additional equipment as
well as dyestuffs and chemicals. This extended the disbursement period
through 1983. The last disbursement was made in November 3, 1983 and the
undisbursed balance of the loan account (about US$0.4 million) was
cancelled.
3.17      The financing plan for the project provided that the foreign
exchange component was to be financed by the loans from the Bank and Arab
Fund for Social and Economic Development (AFSED). After the Camp David
Accords in March 1978, AFSED stopped all disbursements and KED quickly
arranged a commercial Swiss bank credit and used its own export revenues,
which they were able to develop in the meantime, to cover the balance of
the foreign exchange expenditures. With this additional financing there
was only a marginal delay in implementation caused by financing problems
and a major potential problem was avoided. A comparison of the actual and
original financing plans is summarized below:

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production
4.01      The operating performance of both companies is closely linked
with the national policy regarding labor. The policy essentially forces
the public sector companies to employ excess labor in rural areas.
Consequently, the number of people on the payroll has been increasing
faster than the actual labor requirements of the enterprises. Also, pay is
based more on seniority than type of work performed, so there is little
incentive for workers to be trained for more difficult tasks such as
operating the weaving looms. Finally, productivity incentives for the
operating personnel are not yet significant and the whole compensation
package is well below the wages paid by the private textile industry and
other industrial enterprises, particularly the construction trade. The
average wage paid by KED and EB is about LE 4 per day,as compared with
LE 10 per day in construction. For skilled workers, tradesmen and
mechanics the pay differential and job opportunities are even greater;
therefore, absenteeism and turnover are highest on the production line,
especially among weaving personnel. Consequently, while the total number
of labor has been steadily increasing, the capacity utilization in weaving
has not, as the looms are stopped frequently because of the shortage of
skilled operators. The managements of KED and EB are well aware of this
problem, but under present government policy, they have a rather limited
scope for instituting the required reforms.
4.02      From 1975 to 1984 the number of operators in the KED spinning
mills increased 3/ by 42.5% while the production of yarn increased by 90%,
resulting in about 30% increase in productivity. However, an increase in
the weaving production by 29% was accompanied by a 79% rise in the number
of weaving personnel, resulting in a 28% drop in productivity. In the new
3/   Including commissioning of the new spinning mill in Kafr El Dawar
financed by the project and another spinning mill in Komhamada.



- 10 -
spinning facilities financed by the project, the number of direct labor
(1,423 operators) is within the appraisal estimates (para 3.06) and the
productivity achieved (about 5 kg per man-hour) is almost twice the KED
average.4/  Also, for the weaving facilities financed by the project, the
number of direct labor (964 operators) is within the appraisal estimates
and resulted in productivity (33.8 km of weft inserted per man-hour) over
100% higher than the KED average. However, while the productivity level
attained in the facilities financed by the project represents an
improvement as compared with the KED average, it is still about 75X lower
compared with the industrialized countries in the EEC and North America.
The project was mechanically completed in January 1983 and twelve months
later KED achieved full capacity utilization of the spinning mill. The
weaving mill operated on one shift only until April 1, 1984 due to a
shortage of trained loom operators. In May 1984 it was operating at about
75% capacity utilization due to high personnel turnover and absenteeism
resulting in reduced technical efficiency. To overcome this difficulty the
management has launched a vigorous training program for the weavers, and
the weaving mill is expected to reach 90X capacity utilization before the
end of 1984.
4.03      The EB project was mechanically completed in January 1983.
During FY84 the new facilities operated at 35% of capacity due to a
shortage of steam as the completion of an additional boiler was delayed by
about 18 months. With installation of the new boiler the facilities
achieved full capacity utilization in May 1984. In the 1975-84 period the
total work force increased by 26%, including 20% in processing. In
connection with the project, 425 new operators were added, well within the
appraisal estimates. Productivity in the new facilities at fun capacity
is estimated at 40 meters of fabric per man-hour as compared with 16
for the company average. Therefore, while the new facilities attained
about 80% of the international productivity standard, the company as a
whole operates at an average level of about 30% of these standards.  The
project had also a beneficial effect on the production volume of yarn and
fabrics suitable for the export market. In the first 9 months of FY84 KED
exports were 3,700 tons of yarn and 23.8 MLM of fabrics, with a total value
of LE 28 million, the highest in the company's history. About 90% of the
yarn and 20% of the fabric exported came from the new facilities. Details
of the operating performance are shown in Annexes 9 and 10.
B. Market Development
4.04      Consumption of textiles in Egypt has been growing with the
increased population but the forecast increase in consumption per capita in
the last decade has not materialized. In 1984, the domestic consumption
was 5.1 kg/per capita 5/ as compared with 5.2 kg in 1974. There are no
official imports of raw textiles, except wool fibers and wool products
which are included in the production figures. The details of production,
export and consumption of textile fibers are shown below:

One of the factors in the development of the market for textiles in Egypt
is that, while GDP per capita has been growing at the rate of close to 9%,
elasticity of demand for textiles has been close to zero. It appears
therefore that the increase in the retail cost of fabrics has exceeded the
residual purchasing power of the population after expenses for food,
shelter and other necessities. Also, while there is no apparent shortage
of textiles in the market, the domestic market consumes the ever increasing
proportion of the country's most valuable export, the cotton crop. To
increase the volume of available fibers, GOE decided in 1976 to increase
production of synthetic fibers, specifically polyester staple, which can be
easily blended with cotton resulting in fabrics superior in durability,
dimensional stability and easy-care characteristics. The first 25 TKT
polyester plant was completed in 1981 but the actual consumption of
polyester in FY84 was only 9.6 TMT, apparently due to price premium on
cotton and a lack of suitable equipment to process polyester-cotton blends
in the textile plants. In this respect the project would have a beneficial
effect as it provided facilities to spin 6 TMT of yarn and to weave and
convert about 30 MIM of polyester-cotton fabrics, but the sector is still
very inefficient in use of synthetics.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Incremental Financial Rate of Return
5.01      During appraisal it was assumed that both sub-projects would
start commercial production by July, 1979, and reach full utilization by
1981. Actually KED and EB started limited commercial production only in
1983. Both companies are expected to reach the appraised capacity
utilization in FY85, almost 4 years later than estimated. The combined
financial rate of return for both components is 11.0% (Annex 7), as



- 12 -
compared to 13.3% at appraisal due to the reasons discussed below for each
company.
5.02      The KED project's incremental financial rate of return assuming
90% capacity utilization in FY85 and thereafter in constant 1976 prices is
12% (Annex 7),.which equals the appraisal estimate. Detailed incremental
costs and benefits are given in Annex 8 and are summarized below:

a/ In current prices.
b/ Budgeted in current pric'es.
5.03      The delay in project implementation (almost 4 years) and
increases in capital costs reduced the FRR by about 2.5%, but this has been
offset mainly by higher than estimated prices of polyester blend fabrics.
Also, prices, for yarn and gray cloth exported, are marginally higher than
estimated. In FY85, KED expects to export 16.6 million meters of fabric
from the new facilities, which is 31% higher than estimated. The export
revenues from the incremental production for the company in FY85 would then
amount to about LE 22 million, as compared to LE 9 million projected at
appraisal.
5.04      The EB project's incremental financial rate of return at full
capacity utilization (FY85 and thereafter) in constant 1976 prices is 9.1%
(Annex 7), compared to 15.5% at appraisal. Detailed incremental costs and
benefits are given in Annex 9 and are summarized below:

5.05      The delay in the project reaching the estimated capacity
utilization and the increase in capital costs reduced the FRR by about 1%,
but the main reason for the difference is the lower than estimated
revenues, as EB's commission charges are controlled by the Government.
Consequently EB has not enjoyed the same pricing benefits as KZ1D, who have
had flexibilit-y to develop new types of fabrics which can be priced
accordingly to costs and market demand.

5.07      Profit after tax as a percent of sales has decreased from 11% in
1976 to an estimated figure of 1.2% in FY85 as compared with 13.9%
estimated at the time of appraisal. During this period the operating
profit of KED as a percent of sales has decreased from 12% to 9.4%, as the
costs of labor and raw materials have incrL..sed faster than the selling
prices. The net profit was further depressed due to the financial charges
associated with the project. Ia order for KED to earn a reasonable return
on invested capital, the company requires more flexibility in setting
prices for their existing products. To reflect their actual costs, about
13% average increase in prices is required to meet the profitability
targets set at the time of appraisal. However, the internal cash
generation which deteriorated in FY81 is improving and should be
satisfactory once the project attains full capacity utilization in FY85.
The current ratio which stood at 2.1:1 in 1976 is now estimated to
stabilize at 1.4:1. The debt/equity ratio as expected during appraisal
reached a maximum of 45:55 in FY83 and in the first year of production at

full capacity is estimated to decrease to 39:61 in FY85 as estimated during

c-/ Projected budget.
5.09      Profit after tax as a percent of sales decreased from 12.6Z in
1976 to an estimated figure of 5.8% in FY85. However, as long as the
Government controls prices and does not allow BB to raise prices to cover
its production costs, EB's financial position is not likely to improve
substantially. A price increase of about 40-45% is required to meet the
profitability targets set at the time of appraisal as the raw materials and
labor costs, as a percent of sales for EB have increased from 67% in 1976
to an estimated 83% in FY85. This level of price increase would be fully
justified, compared to the current commission charges in other countries.
Other factors contributing to the low profit margins are the financial and
depreciation charges associated with the new project.  If the level of the
commission charges were increased by 45% the FRR would increase to about
15.1% and the profit after tax as a percent of sales to about 13.4%. Even
though the internal cash generation has been steady over the past two
years, this has been barely adequate to service the company's debt, as
evident by the low debt service coverage. The current ratio has remained
around 1.3:1, below the level of 1.5:1 specified in the financ1il
covenants. The debt/equity ratio is satisfactory and remains well below
the limit (60/40) specified in the financial covenants. It appears that in
light of its low debt service coverage, EB should refrain from incurring



- 15 -
any additional debt. In order for EB to service its debt out of earnings,
earn a reaeinable return on invested capital and assure efficient
operations, M revision in Government pricing policy is required.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.01      In order to calculate the economic rate of return for both
companies, a number of adjustments to both input and output prices have
been made to reflect their value in terms of the economic costs to the
Egyptian economy. These adjustments are particularly significant for
cotton, since Egypt is a major exporter of cotton and power which is
subsidized by GOE. For tradeable outputs, adjusted European textile prices
have been used.  These prices quoted in US$ have been converted at US$1 -
LE 1.12, the commercial rate at which the export proceeds are exchanged to
LE. The prices and cost ratios used are listed in Annex 11. The economic
rate of return for the total project in constant 1976 prices is 17.4% as
compared to 21.6Z at appraisal.
6.02      For the KED component of the project, the economic rate of return
is 14.6% (Annex 11) as compared to 21.6% at appraisal. The reasons for the
lower economic rate of return are higher capital costs and lower than
estimated world market prices for textile products, produced by KED for the
domestic market. For the EB component of the project, the economic rate of
return is 21.1% (Annex 11) as compared to 22.3% at appraisal. EB's
economic prospects are better than KED's, as the world market prices for
the type of services provided by the company are not as low as for finished
textile goods.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
7.01      The only institutions which were involved were KED, EB and GOFI
as the implementation of the project began after dissolution of EGOSW and
before TIC was created. As described above (para 3.05), the performance of
the sponsoring companies was excellent. Well-prepared feasibility studies
were completed with little de.iay and the PIUs were able to execute the
project with minimum foreign assistance. All the construction design work,
procurement, detailed engineering and erection was done under the
supervision of PIUs. While the personalities have changed (there were four
different chairmen at KED and two at EB during the period of project
implementation) the consecutive management teamr have been most cooperative
in supporting and supervising the effort of the respective PIUs. This
concern for the project has manifested itself in frequent interventions by
the chairmen of KED and EB at the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of
Finance regarding supply of local funds, allocation of construction
materials and, in the case of KED, arranging for a foreign loan to replace
AFSED funds. The management was also instrumental in assisting PIUs in
preparation of the detailed minutes of the meetings with the Bank



- 16 -
supervision missions, monthly and quarterly Progress Reports as well as
follow-up of the actions agreed on during the meetings. Contribution of
GOFI can also be described as substantial and positive as the institution
developed the detailed general conditions and instructions to the
tenderers, rendered valuable assistance in the evaluation of bids,
administered collection and return of tender and performance bonds, as well
as opening and monitoring the letters of credit. On the debit side, KED
and EB did not push for utilizing allocated Bank funds for import of
construction materials which would have helped reduce the implementation
period.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
A. Overall Performance and Relationship with Borrower
8.01      The project was appraised in January 1976 and the Board approval
was given in June 1976, 11 months after the feasibility studies were
received and 27 months after GOE's request. In view of considerably longer
loan processing time for other projects, the time interval from the date of
the request to Board approval indicates that the Bank and staff made a
special effort to respond promptly to the Borrower's needs. This effort is
especially significant as the project was the Bank's first in the Egyptian
textile sector and that the project was identified before the study of the
sector was completed. In order to expedite the implementation of the
project, the Bank insisted that the sponsors retain the services of an
experienced international company of textile consultants as technical
advisor but, as soon as it became obvious the PIUs were capable of
implementing the project, the Bank agreed to the sponsors' request for
dispensing with further foreign technical assistance. The Bank was also
prompt in granting the sponsors' requests for reallocation of funds and
extension of the closing date. Throughout project preparation and
implementation, the Bank's relationship with the sponsors and GOFI was
excellent and the supervision missions enjoyed full cooperation of KED and
EB in providing information, reports as well as logistic support.
B. Performance in Project Preparation, Formulation, and Implementation
8.02      The Bank helped to establish priorities in the sector and
identified KED and EB as the project with the best chance of providing the
needed additional production and export potential at relatively low cost.
The Bank dlso made a valuable contribution to the success of the project by
correcting some of the assumptions of the feasibility study regarding
prices and equipment capacity, labor productivity, technical efficiency, as
well as in reviewing the tender documents, machine specifications and bid
evaluation procedures. The Bank also assisted the sponsors in the final
formulation of the project as well as in preparation of the terms of
reference for the contracts with the Technical Advisor and General
Contractors. Finally, the Bank exercised careful monitoring of the project
progress reports, mounted 12 supervision missions during the period of
project implementation, and assisted the sponsors in establishing
priorities for the reallocated portion of the Bank loan.



- 17 -
8.03      The Bank had played an important and successful role in bringing
in co-financing to minimize the use of the Government's foreign exchange
reserves. The Bank also correctly identified training as a key element of
the project and a substantial training program had been implemented.
However, as indicated earlier, the program for training the weaving
operators should have been more extensive.
8.04      On the debit side, the Bank fai'led to anticipate fully the
problems involved in executing civil works in Egypt, particularly delays
specific to the traditional reinforced concrete method of building
construction, shortages of skilled labor and construction materials, and
the apparent inability or unwillingness to import construction materials.
While provision for import of materials was correctly made at appraisal,
during supervision, the Bank was not able to persuade the project sponsor
to utilize this category.
8.05      At the time of project preparation the Bank correctly raised the
issue of the Government's long-term plans regarding thp modernization and
expansion of the textile industry in the absence of a comprehensive sector
study. To overcome this problem, the Bank financed a detailed study of the
sector (para 2.02) which was completed in 1976. However, the Bank has been
unable in its subsequent attempts to persuade GOE to update the study, and
the policy dialogue with the Bank regarding the structural problems in the
sector and plans for orderly development of the textile industries in
Egypt has shown little progress so far.
IX.  CONCLUSIONS
A. Overall Assessment
9.01      The project can be considered reasonably successful as the
primary objectives of providing additional spinning, weaving and converting
capacity as well as training of the engineering, supervisory and operating
personnel have been achieved. Also, the targets for capacity utilization,
technical efficiency and labor and machine productivity have been met,
alas, with a delay of aboui four years, due to circumstances mostly outside
the control of the Bank and the beneficiaries. Because of the versatility
of the facilities financed by the project, KED and EB have the flexibility
of producing either high-quality cotton fabrics suitable for export or
polyester-cotton fabrics needed for the domestic market, or any proportion
of each. Despite the delay in project completion, the cost overrun was a
modest 12.8%, mostly due to higher than estimated cost of labor and
buii'ing materials. The foreign exchange costs were below the estimates
mainly due to a strong US dollar and benefits of the ICB procurement
procedire. The financial rate of return for KED was exactly as estimated.
For EB the FRR was lower than estimated because of the price constraints
imposed on the company by the Government. Also, the economic rate of
return is lower than appraised due to the delay in completion of the
project and lower than estimated world market prices for KED's outputs.

B. Lessons for the Borrower and the Bank for Similar Projects
9.02      Lessons learned from the experience in this project were:
(a) contracts for civil works should be subject to international bidding to
allow the sponsors to select among contractors offering a variety of
building techniques; in the case of the project, c-.r. choice was limited to
overextended local contractors all offering time consuming reinforced
concrete structures, traditional in Egypt whereas steel structures would
have been cheaper and faster to erect; (b) special attention should be
given to training of the weaving operators as this stage of textile
manufacturing is mDst vulnerable to high turnover and absenteeisut of the
workers; (c) the disbursement schedule should take into account the initial
hiatus due to delays in the loan effectiveness, mobilization of resources,
negotiations with building contractors and consultants.
9.03      Another lesson for the Bank is that cofinancing, especially from
bilateral sources, may be sensitive to political events such as
deterioration of relations between the donor and recipient countries and
conditions of disbursement and/or cancellations may be substantially
different from Bank norms. Also, frequently the covenants agreed with the
Borrower may be difficult to enforce in practice, particularly, if they
happen to be contrary to the subsequent Government's policLes in the
sector, or when the Borrower for all practical purposes is unable to comply
with the covenants because of other priorities. A good example of a
covenant in the first category is the Borrower's commitment (Section 4.03
of the Loan Agreement) not to take any action which would prevent KED and
EB, under conditions of efficient operations, from earning in each fiscal
year a reasonable return on their investment. In practice the Borrower's
policy to control prices of textile products proved to be incompatible with
the covenant. Another example is the Borrower's commitment (Section 3.06
of the Loan Agreement) to take all measures necessary to ensure the
availability of public sector contractors and building materials for the
project. In this case the Borrower, in view of the building boom, was
unable, or reluctant, to reallocate the public sector contractors and
building materials from other apparently more important projects, and RED
and EB were unable to arrange for imports of the building materials
although they had the resources to do so.
