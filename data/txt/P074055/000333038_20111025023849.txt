F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's overall objective is to broaden the base of private participation in Cape
Verde's economic growth, enhance private sector competitiveness and further develop its
financial sector. This would be achieved through: (a) financial sector reform, including
pension reform; (b) investment climate reform, which includes, but is not limited to: (i)
tax reform, (ii) alleviation of administrative barriers, (iii) improved supply chains, and
(iv) legal reform; (c) post privatization and divestiture reforms; and (d) private sector and
institutional capacity building. The project would thus help sustain the Government's
poverty alleviation efforts by generating increased employment opportunities through
improved international competitiveness.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
No changes were made to the original project development objective (PDO).

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     This project was part of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report
considered by the Board on August 28, 2001 (World Bank 2001). The Bank’s support
was meant to position itself to support Government’s measures to: (1) restore
macroeconomic stability and reforms to maintain growth, and (2) private sector
development focused on (i) privatization of state-owned enterprises; (ii) liberalization of
the economy; (iii) capacity building; and (iv) improvement of economic infrastructure.
An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was completed in March 2002;
with its cornerstone being economic growth and employment, in conjunction with
improvements in infrastructure and social services. The original Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) was approved by the Board on May 13, 2003 and a Project Paper (PP)
to support an additional financing was approved on July 3, 2007. The Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) for the original credit was signed on June 3, 2003 and the
Financing Agreement (FA) for the additional financing was signed on July 30, 2007.

1.1    Context at Appraisal

2.      Country background (World Bank 2001). Cape Verde had experienced
remarkable growth and development since the CAS prepared in 1997. Its growth
between 1998 and 2000 was in excess of 7.5 percent annually. Although improvements in
public health may have ebbed, Cape Verde’s social indicators remained among the best in
Sub-Saharan Africa, a reward for its policy efforts to address poverty by fostering private
sector development as well as promoting investments in human capital.

3.      Cape Verde's geographic, social and political characteristics have given it a
unique place in Africa, and have contributed to a strong base for sustained development.
Among other unique characteristics, it faces no ethnic or religious tensions; it is almost
free of devastating endemic diseases; its defense spending is low; its continuously high
emigration has fostered strong ties with Europe and America; it is relatively free of
corruption; the capacity of its institutions is substantial; and the spread of HIV/AIDS
seems to have been slower than on the continent. Cape Verde nevertheless remains a
small economy, with a high vulnerability to external shocks and interruptions in flows of
remittances, foreign aid and tourism receipts – its primary source of export revenue.

4.     From 1997 until 1999 macroeconomic stability was sustained, structural reforms
were deepened, and the performance of the Bank's portfolio was good. The deterioration
in the macroeconomic environment between 1999 and 2001 meant that the context for
IDA assistance changed sharply. Specifically, profligate public spending between 1999
and 2000, without sustainable resources to match, was endangering the country's
achievements with regard to social indicators and macroeconomic stability.

5.       As a result, the new Administration elected in 2001 moved swiftly to address the
fiscal problems. In addition, the government sought to promote private initiative as the
principal engine of economic growth, assuming productive investment in the areas of



                                            1
growth and with the state playing a key role in the overall organization of the growth
effort through, among others, regulating markets and credit, guaranteeing the
performance of private contracts and protecting property, developing basic and economic
infrastructures and supplying social services to the population. The objective, above all,
was to enhance the productivity and internal and external competitiveness of the
economy (Joint Staff Assessment of Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper - IPRSP,
2002).

6.       With government’s objective of supporting private-sector led growth and
broadening of the production base, its priority reforms in these areas centered on 3
pillars: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) modernizing the financial sector and
reforming the pensions system; and (iii) increasing private sector competitiveness
through improving the business environment and developing sectors with untapped
potential. On the macro front, on-going reforms had led to fiscal deficits of 8.0 percent in
2002 from a high of 26.5 percent in 2000, allowing T-bill rates to fall from double digits
to 6.5 percent in 2002, limiting crowding out of private sector lending by commercial
banks. These contributed to commercial banks subsequently lowering their lending rates
to the private sector from 13.7 percent to 12.3 percent, and eventually around 9.8 percent
in 2010.

7.     Other major reforms to help stabilize the macro-economy included ensuring
reduced financial risks as a result of petroleum prices fluctuations and the relatively high
and complicated taxation regime (simplification in the number of import duties, reduction
of corporate income tax). Nevertheless, to sustain the commitment to private sector led
growth, it needed to maintain the momentum generated by these reforms. In parallel, the
government had also been undertaking reforms in the financial sector to attain the
modernization of the sector and further deepen it through increased access, improved
term structure and strengthened capacity of Banco de Cabo Verde (BCV) to better
regulate and supervise the financial sector.

8.      In order to increase the competitiveness of the private sector as part of Cape
Verde’s goal of private sector led growth, studies had been done to identify the key
constraints affecting the competitiveness of the economy (e.g., FIAS Review of
Administrative Barriers to Investment – Oct. 2002 and Regulatory and Administrative
Cost Survey-August 2002). Recommendations coming out of these initiatives underlined
the need to, among others, set rules and regulations guiding entry and operations of
private firms, contracts and property rights enforcements, i.e. legal and regulatory
environment in which firms operate and businesses develop; and continue privatization of
SOEs to further encourage private participation in economic development. To reinforce
these initiatives, it was necessary for the actors leading these reforms to also be
sufficiently capacitated in order to contribute their respective roles and responsibilities
for delivering this growth agenda.

9.     The project was therefore designed with the aim of (i) helping to maintain the
macroeconomic framework through focusing on further tax reforms that would encourage
investment while minimizing economic distortions; (ii) further strengthening the financial



                                             2
sector in Cape Verde with the leadership of the BCV, and in addition supporting the
creation of a more sustainable pension scheme; (iii) enhancing private sector
competitiveness through the removal of administrative barriers to business development,
improving the legal environment for business, consolidating the gains from the
privatization and divestiture process and strengthening public sector structures for
improved private sector interaction; and (iv) ensuring that the private sector (specifically,
the Small & Medium Enterprises), which had become more vibrant and organized.
Nevertheless, the environment for technical learning and assistance in Cape Verde was
still underdeveloped with the mechanisms by which private firms transfer technology and
raise their technical capabilities weak. The private sector strategy thus called for capacity
building for private operators, especially SMEs, which were also eager to accommodate
the proposed competitiveness enhancements.

Rationale for Bank assistance

Contribution to higher level objectives

1.2      Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.     The project's overall objective is to broaden the base of private participation in
Cape Verde's economic growth, enhance private sector competitiveness and further
develop its financial sector. This would be achieved through: (a) financial sector reform,
including pension reform; (b) investment climate reform, which includes, but is not
limited to: (i) tax reform, (ii) alleviation of administrative barriers, (iii) improved supply
chains, and (iv) legal reform; (c) post privatization and divestiture reforms; and (d)
private sector and institutional capacity building. The project would thus help sustain the
Government's poverty alleviation efforts by generating increased employment
opportunities through improved international competitiveness.

11.     In view of one discrepancy in the formulation of a key performance indicator
between the PAD and the DCA,11 this ICR focuses on the indicators listed as project-end
results in Schedule 6 of the DCA (PDO Indicators):

(i)      The amount of total foreign direct investment has increased by US$225 million
         since project effectiveness with 5,000 jobs created;
(ii)     Measures have been adopted to ensure the pension system’s sustainability,
         namely: (a) a strategy is in place to gradually unify the two existing schemes; (b)
         criteria of benefits for the labor intensive work programs (Frentes da Alta
         Intensidade da Mão de Obra - FAIMO) have been clearly defined; (c) parametric
         changes have been made to the structure of the national institute of social security
         (Instituto Nacional da Previdência Social - INPS);



11
  In the PAD it is indicated that “by end-project … (b) six islands are linked with VISA? (A.2. par. 2, page
2) but this indicator is not in the DCA or in Annex I of the PAD. Also, In Annex I of the PAD it is not
always indicated which indicators should be attained by mid-term review and which by end-project.


                                                     3
(iii)  Through the implementation of an electronic VISA system, 950 transactions
       totaling US$8 million have taken place since project effectiveness;
(iv)   Tax reform brings a reduction of the corporate tax rate to 25 percent;
(v)    Tariffs are consistent with international best-practice and regional WAEMU
       norms;
(vi)   The notaries on all islands are electronically inter-connected and the time needed
       to register a business has been reduced from 3 weeks to 72 hours when the request
       file is complete;
(vii) As a result of the Matching Grant facility, on average, the entrepreneurs have:
       (a) an improvement in the efficiency ratios, which will be measured by the
       percentage of operating costs over revenue (sales) of at least 10 percent; and (b)
       an increase in production and/or services of at least 10 percent;
(viii) At least three value added services in the communication sector have been
       developed;
(ix)   The research and studies department at the Borrower’s Ministry in charge of
       finance is established and operational;
(x)    At least two recommended activities from the action plan for reducing
       administrative barriers to investment have been fully implemented; and
(xi)   The commercial banks see a reduction in non-performing loan to seven percent of
       their total loan portfolio.

1.3     Revised Project Development Objective (PDO), Key Indicators and
        Reasons/Justification

12.     The additional financing did not propose any changes to the PDO. The rationale
of the additional financing was to help advance the Government’s reforms, given its good
performance so far, by finishing and/or scaling up deserving activities.

13.    Some of the original key performance indicators and activities were modified
because the Government and project beneficiaries had already exceeded certain project
completion expectations. Given the growth agenda targets, this presented opportunities
for making changes that could further improve the outcomes and impacts of the project.

14.    The additional financing resulted in the modification of one of the original
performance indicators and added four new performance indicators:

(i)     The investment memorandum for the privatization of TACV and ENAPOR has
        been advertised internationally and offer has been launched;
(ii)    Investment climate improved measured by a reduction in the cost of starting a
        business, measured by a percentage of income per capita and time (number of
        days) to start a business which has been reduced by at least 10 percent;
(iii)   Those companies benefiting from the Matching Grant Facility have experienced
        an increase of five percent in their efficiency as defined by the ratio of operating
        costs over revenue generated;
(iv)    All legislation published in the Recipient’s Official Gazette prior to August 31,
        2006, has been made publicly available online; and



                                             4
(v)     The merger of the Recipient’s two social security systems remains on track and
        liabilities are being funded by the Recipient on a regular basis.

15.     The complete list of indicators (original and revised) appears in the Data Sheet of
this ICR. Some of the indicators are presented in the Data Sheet as two separate
indicators for ease of reference.12

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

Original

16.    The primary target groups identified in the PAD are the private sector (enterprises
and promoters), the local population and the Government.

17.     Enterprises and promoters would benefit by a reduction in uncertainties and
transaction costs of doing business in Cape Verde by implementing project activities that
result in: (a) providing transparent commercial legislation and improving the function of
the judiciary on commercial activities; (b) reducing production costs through improved
efficiencies in the administration and tax distortions; (c) better working supply chains in
three targeted sectors; and (d) improved technology and capacity in private enterprises.

18.     The local population would benefit by a welfare increase through project
activities resulting in the strengthening of the pension system to ensure that pension
promises can be kept and that the responsible institution can deliver a fair allocation of
resources between different generations.

19.     The Government would benefit through project activities resulting in reforms of
public sector activities which interface with private sector activities

Revised

20.    There were no additions to the original target beneficiaries as a result of the
additional financing provided under the project.

1.5     Original Components

21.     The project had three components at appraisal:




12
  For example, in paragraph 11 above, indicator mentioned in paragraph (i) was presented in the data sheet
as Indicator 1 (Amount of total foreign direct investment has increased) and Indicator 2 (Number of jobs
created through foreign direct investment).

Component 3: Support for Project Implementation

33.    Provision of technical and financial support to the PCU for the administration,
procurement, financial management and monitoring of the project.

1.6    Revised Components

34.     The project components were revised in view of the need for additional financing
required to (i) fully fund ongoing activities that lacked sufficient funds; (ii) scale up
activities whose implementation under the original Credit had began to show clear and
increased likelihood of contributing to achieving the project’s developmental objectives;




                                            7
and (iii) correct a serious but inadvertent omission of agreed and appraised funding for
payment of government liabilities due the private pension scheme.

35.     These revisions and additional financing in the amount of SDR 2 million (US$3.0
million equivalent) was approved by the Board on July 3, 2007. It must be noted that all
the revisions made to the project and listed below, were not meant to replace any of the
original components, they rather added to the original components, and were to close
identified gaps made clearer after the first few years of implementation.

Component 1: Modernizing, Strengthening and Restructuring the Financial Sector

36.     Pension reform. Payment to INPS of liabilities incurred by the Recipient due to
the transfer of civil servants to the INPS pension scheme.

Component 2: Enhancing Private Sector Competitiveness

Investment Climate Reform

37.     Alleviation of Administrative Barriers to Investment. Support to the Recipient
for establishing a central data center for computer systems, including an architectural
assessment of the building and specification of all requirements for the acquisition and
installation of a safe room.

38.     Improvement of the Legal Environment for Business. Support to the Recipient
for disseminating business laws among the legal profession and the business community,
and establishing a national legal information website.

Post Privatization and Divestiture

39.     Support to the Recipient for finalizing steps required for bringing TACV and
ENAPOR to the point of sale for privatization, including but not limited to the
finalization of the investment memorandum and launching of the sale offer.

Private Sector Capacity Building

40.     Support to the Recipient’s two Chambers of Commerce for: Provision of
Matching Grants to entrepreneurs for business development services and training courses;
strengthening institutional capacity of the Chambers, and nationwide dissemination of
business information.

Component 3: Support to Project Implementation

41.    Provision of technical and financial support for the administration, procurement,
financial management and monitoring and carrying out of audits of the project.




                                           8
1.7    Other significant changes

42.    Fiduciary revisions. Procurement and Disbursement guidelines/procedures were
revised in order to conform to new bank guidelines. This meant prior review thresholds
were amended (increased) to reflect improved capacity to deliver these functions.

43.   Closing date extensions. The project was extended two times, for a period of 30
months, finally closing on June 30, 2010.

44.    Performance Indicators: New key performance indicators were introduced and
one the of the original indicators was modified (indicator on pension reform). See 1.3
above.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

There was no Quality at Entry review.

45.     Project Preparation. Overall project Preparation was thorough with the World
Bank team and Government counterparts bringing to bear on the preparation, not only
project design experiences in Cape Verde and Sub-Saharan Africa, but also in other
developing countries. The preparation team also took cognizance of work done by other
experts such as the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) on business
environment reforms, the International Labor Organization (ILO) on pension reform,
international experiences from Latin America in independent regulatory frameworks and
capacity, and best practice project institutional arrangements for implementing private
sector development projects. In addition, the preparation was informed by Cape Verde’s
Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report of the World Bank Group (2001), National
Development Plan (NDP: 1997; 2002), National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP),
and an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP: 2002). The project’s
Developmental Objectives (PDOs) were consistent with the FY02 Cape Verde CAS
Progress Report and the Government’s poverty reduction program, a key pillar of which
was economic growth and employment.

46.    The Project Appraisal Document and aide memoires for the pre-implementation
missions provided clear overviews of the financial and private sectors and outlined
options for meeting Cape Verde’s economic growth objectives. Additionally, the World
Bank team and the government relied on background work including BCV’s Strategy
(2002-2004), Chamber of Commerce’s (Sotavento) Strategy 2003-2005, the Government
of Cape Verde’s Draft Private Sector Policy statement, FIAS’s Study of Administrative
Barriers (2002), the Ministry of Finance’s Regulatory and Administrative Costs Survey,
and assessments of Financial Management and Procurement capacity to inform project
preparation.




                                          9
47.     Project Design. During project preparation, the World Bank was already
supporting reform in Cape Verde’s economic sector that covered privatization of state-
owned enterprises in the transport sector and regulatory reforms and increasing private
participation in key economic sectors. Other initiatives in private sector promotion and
financial sector reforms had recently closed or were ongoing. In addition, other donors
were involved in SME development, financial sector reforms – capital markets
development, pension reforms, and access to medium-term financing. Lessons learned
from the implementation of these various initiatives were incorporated in the project’s
design and included, among others: (i) strengthening the investment promotion agency to
empower it to lead Cape Verde’s quest to source FDI into the economy; (ii) continuing
the reforms to create a well-functioning financial sector; (iii) continuing judicial reform
efforts which began under the Capacity Building Project for Private Sector Promotion;
and (iv) stakeholder involvement in project design and use of local capacity developed
through other project experiences.

48.     The project as designed sought to comprehensively address the Government’s
objective to ensure macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth while at the same
time embarking on deep-seated actions to ensure private sector development by way of
privatizing key state-owned enterprises; improving economic infrastructure; liberalizing
the economy; and building and strengthening the capacity of the public sector, especially
that which interfaces with the private sector. The comprehensiveness of the solution
needed in order to address the Government’s objectives resulted in a long list of activities,
making the project design complex, but on deeper investigation, the various solutions are
linked, coherent, and feasible.

49.     The project clearly addressed macro and financial sector constraints (such as
government liabilities arising from contingent SOE liabilities and pension contribution
arrears, which could contribute to high interest rates as a result of increased government
borrowing thus squeezing credit to the private sector); liberalization of the economy
(which required the introduction of regulatory agencies to ensure transparency, etc.),
investment climate reforms needed to reduce the cost of doing business for domestic
firms, especially in a liberalized economic environment, and last but no means the least,
the resources for the domestic private sector to strengthen its capacity in order to be
competitive. The design thus, complex, as it may seem, looks to be a better option to
achieving the Government’s objectives.

50.     Thus the government’s objective to broaden the base of private sector
participation in the economy in order to further growth seemed well articulated and
lessons learned from increasing private sector participation through the privatization of a
number of State-owned-Enterprises incorporated in the project’s preparation and design
phases.

51.     Quality at Entry. On the scope of the project and objectives, firstly, the
objectives were appropriate, relevant and clear; secondly, the components were
satisfactorily prepared and designed to significantly improve the likelihood of the
achievement of the project’s developmental objectives. The preparation and appraisal



                                            10
documents however did not elaborate much on the privatization sub-component, which
would have helped to identify clearly the steps to follow to bring the proposed state-
owned enterprises to the point of sale, knowing their readiness for the market and the
political economy on privatization. There were no original performance indicators for
the above sub-component, even though privatization’s impact on macro stability was
fairly known at the time. In addition, the Monitoring and Evaluation framework could
have been better derived. The implementing agencies identified to implement activities
and other institutional arrangements designed to oversee and coordinate implementation
were experienced in project development and implementation of World Bank-financed
projects.

2.2    Implementation

Rating: satisfactory.

52.     The project was implemented over a period of close to seven years, from
effectiveness in October 2003 until closing on June 30, 2010. It was extended two times
to ensure activities undertaken with proceeds from the additional financing provided to
the project were afforded adequate time for implementation. The amount of additional
financing of US$3 million equivalent was added to finance activities that: (i) lacked
sufficient funds to complete (State-owned enterprise privatization); (ii) needed to be
scaled up to reinforce the positive impact on the economy that was already being noticed
(Matching Grant Facility, Investment climate reforms); and (iii) financial sector
deepening/public sector reform (pension reform). The key performance indicators were
also revised.

53.     The Mid-Term review was carried out in May 2006, a mere 3 weeks beyond the
scheduled time at approval, and at which time implementation progress on all
components (except the post-privatization and regulatory reform) was considered “highly
satisfactory.? Close to 70 percent of the original credit had been disbursed at this time,
with a majority of the key performance indicators already achieved. This notwithstanding,
it is not clear why the MTR did not foresee the need for additional financing, when it
seemed reasonably clear that a number of activities (i.e., matching grant facility,
government liabilities to the pension fund and investment climate reforms) were either
starting to show very positive outcomes and needed to be scaled up or addressed urgently.

54.     The project was coordinated by at least four different project managers over the
implementation period; and at least two ministries had oversight responsibilities over the
project at different periods during implementation. There were only two World Bank
Task Team Leaders during implementation.

55.      Component 1: Modernizing, Strengthening and Restructuring the Financial
Sector. While there were no other major changes to activities which were to be financed
under the component, except for the additional financing provided to the pension reforms
sub-component, the best practice collaboration between the Borrower, the BCV, financial
institutions, and the private sector contributed immensely to the current state of Cape



                                           11
Verde’s financial sector. This collaboration and leadership provided by key stakeholders
ensured agreed reforms have been successfully undertaken ensuring a strengthened
supervisory capacity for the BCV, a deepening of the financial sector, covering among
others, an improved legal, regulatory and management regimes for the financial sector
including a modernized payment system, an improved banking system wide non-
performing loans (NPLs), a unified pension scheme, and an improved access to finance
that compares well to that in many middle income countries. The project financed
capacity building activities and legal advisory work which contributed to the
development of new and innovative financial products, provided support for the
development of draft legislation on insurance, anti-money laundering and availability of
electronic banking in all nine islands. Efforts to implement recommendations coming out
of a joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2008/2009
underlined the proactive stance of the leadership in government and IAs. This component
is rated highly satisfactory.

56.     Component 2: Enhancing Private Sector Competitiveness. The number of
implementing agencies and the mix of skills required to coordinate and oversee this
component was very varied and wide. Nevertheless, the project supported the institution
of a number of regulatory frameworks including Agência de Regulação Economica
(ARE) for electricity, water, etc. and Agência Nacional de Comunicaçoes (ANAC) in
communications. The project provided extensive capacity building to staff of these
agencies which enabled these agencies to further support the liberalization of a number of
key economic sectors. In addition, investment climate reforms supported under the
project contributed to the alleviation of administrative barriers, including the completion
of the establishment of the I-Government platform (Cabo Verde Digital) which facilitates
both private sector and civil society interactions with the Government, the “Firm in One
Day? initiative across all islands, improved customs processing, etc. The Matching Grant
Facility, which provided financial resources that decreased the cost of invaluable
business development services required by SMEs which were members of the two main
Chambers of Commerce, led to over 150 SMEs being supported. Support provided
resulted in Cape Verde’s accession to the WTO, setup of an arbitration center for
commercial disputes, setup of regulatory agencies such as the Agencia de Aviação Civil
(AAC), the Agência de Regulação e Supervisão dos Produtos Farmacêuticos (ARFA),
and Agência Nacional de Segurança Alimentar (ANSA). Under this component a long list
of activities were fully implemented including efforts such as the preparation of a
restructuring plan, business plans and a management consultant to direct the affairs of
TACV, the preparatory studies to support the privatization of ENAPOR and the licensing
of cellular phone operators and internet providers. Implementation is rated satisfactory; if
it were not for the difficulties and delays encountered in the divestiture of a number of
state-owned enterprises, the implementation would have been rated highly satisfactory.

57.    Component 3: Supporting Project Implementation. Project implementation,
which was overseen by a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) with the Ministry of Finance
and Ministry of Economy having overall responsibility for project implementation at
various periods. The project was managed by at least four project coordinators and faced
a number of instances where staff/consultants involved in other aspects of its



                                            12
implementation left and replacing them took some time. Continuity in the World Bank
task management function seemed to have contributed significantly to keeping the project
on course. Overall, support provided to implementation is rated satisfactory.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

58.     M&E Design. While the PDOs were very clear and relevant to Cape Verde’s
economic growth and private sector competitiveness program, baselines for the outcome
and input indicators could have been given better attention. The design of the Results
Framework appears to reflect best practice at the time, therefore, data collection and
reporting framework gaps were not fully addressed leading to unclear roles and
responsibilities within the PCU and implementing agencies on overall reporting,
collection and periodic update of indicators. The World Bank team could have ensured
that a more cohesive M&E plan was designed.

59.     Implementation. At some point during the supervision period, and with the
improvements and new insights into developing and implementing an M&E framework,
both the bank team and the Government counterparts should have incorporated changes
in the function such as ensuring that a specialist was included in the World Bank
supervision team and that the same function would have been specifically defined within
the PCU. The MTR period and the additional financing opportunities should have served
to fully address implementation gaps in the M&E framework. In accordance with
Schedule 2, Section 2 of the Project’s Financing Agreement, the Borrower was to
monitor and evaluate progress using the KPIs. This was not done consistently and at
project end getting these indicators proved difficult and in some cases, they were not
provided by the Borrower.

60.    Utilization. The quality of data provided and their sources are deemed adequate,
however, coordination and oversight of submission of key project indicators (KPIs) and
progress reporting could have been done better. There were occasions where updates of
the KPIs encountered severe delays and the outcome and output indicators presented in
various project documents appeared inconsistent, making tracking also very difficult. For
example, data for the Matching Grant scheme was difficult to obtain from the
implementing agencies. Nonetheless, where available, and this was generally the case,
the data provided was reliable and supporting documentation was also made available.
Beyond project completion, there are a number of agencies supported under the project
for which the relevant performance indicators would still be useful and would continue to
serve as important measures of performance. These include the BCV with regard to NPLs
and UCRE with regard to the time and cost to start a business.

61.  Based on the above reasons, the design, implementation and utilization of the
M&E framework is rated moderately unsatisfactory.




                                           13
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management

62.    The PCU kept good records on financial management. The financial audits were
submitted on-time and in line with the dictates of the DCA and issues raised by the
auditors addressed by project management. The project complied with the financial
covenants stated in the loan agreement. The overall performance of the financial
management function is rated satisfactory.

Procurement

63.     The procurement function was overseen by at least two consultants at the PCU.
The departure of the first procurement specialist left a vacuum until filled. Overall, the
procurement function was undertaken satisfactorily. The PCU ensured implementing
agencies followed the agreed procurement guidelines and procedures. Challenges that
arose were quickly resolved with the assistance of the World Bank task team. The
overall performance of under procurement management is rated satisfactory.

Safeguards

64.     The project was classified as a Category C and no safeguard policies were
triggered.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

65.    The project financed the strengthening of the capacities of BCV and INPS which
should contribute to sustaining the reforms in the financial sector and ensure Cape
Verde’s financial sector operates like the MIC that it is. Indicators measured here will
continue to be measured as part of the country’s macroeconomic engagement with the
IMF and the World Bank. To assure investment climate reforms which have contributed
to Cape Verde improving its ranking on the annual Doing Business reporting are
maintained, the Government has set up the Center for Strategic Policy in the Office of the
Prime Minister to oversee Cape Verde’s Competitiveness indicators in addition to the
State Reform Coordination Unit (UCRE) which systematically monitors Cape Verde’s
performance with regard to the IFC-World Bank Doing Business indicators.

66.    Regulatory agencies like ARE and ANAC have been set up and capacity of staff
of these institutions built to transparently and sustainably regulate sectors such as
telecommunications, transport, petroleum, etc. Several legislative instruments have also
been enacted to facilitate private sector competitiveness.

67.    Other state institutions that interface with the private sector and general public,
such as the Customs, have also had their operating procedures streamlined and staff
capacity built in order to facilitate improvements to supply chain linkages within the
domestic and global supply system. The investment promotion agency has been



                                           14
strengthened and the land cadastral improvement studies financed under the project
should serve as a stepping-stone to introduce transparency in land ownership and tenure
that would further facilitate investments. The Chambers of Commerce have been
capacitated to grow their businesses through improved abilities to access credit and
business development services. In addition, the market for private providers of business
development services has been developed to the point where SMEs needing business
development support can now easily avail themselves of this service.

68.    A follow-on operation has been approved by the World Bank’s Board (SME
Capacity Building and Governance Credit) and would contribute to support sustainment
of the achievements of the Growth and Competitiveness Project through continued
support to the government agencies overseeing implementation of investment climate
reforms and the Chambers of Commerce as the Government seeks to further consolidate
the empowerment of the private sector through the subsidized provision of a business
development services scheme for SMEs.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives

69.     The project’s developmental objectives continue to be highly relevant notably
with Cape Verde’s recent graduation to Middle Income Country status. The country’s
priority is to achieve economic transformation based on, among others, its natural assets,
financial and other services. Towards this end, Cape Verde seeks to focus on public
sector governance; human capital development; competitiveness; infrastructure and social
cohesion in its GPRSP I and II. The World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (March
2009), is aligned with the GPRSP II and has as an overarching objective to assist the
government of Cape Verde to sustain high levels of growth and reduce unemployment,
poverty and social cohesion through focusing on, among others, improving
competitiveness and the investment climate for private sector-led growth and promoting
good governance and public sector capacity. Specifically, both strategies focus on
economic transformation through maintaining public sector governance and reducing
unemployment by improving private sector competitiveness and public sector capacity.
The relevance of this project is rated high given that the project clearly identified
enhancements to private sector competitiveness and increased private sector participation
in the economy as key to the economic transformation of Cape Verde.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

70.    The project achieved its developmental objectives as summarized below:

(a)    Financial sector reform, including pension reform with a view to
       strengthening Cape Verde’s financial sector. The project achieved this
       objective, through concerted efforts at continued strengthening of the supervisory
       capacity of BCV staff, progress in building the legal framework essential for
       financial sector development, including the development of a credit risk system



                                           15
      and awareness creation within commercial banks and the private sector. The
      achievement of the component’s developmental objectives was measured by: (i) a
      reduction in the level of non-performing loans of the total commercial banks
      portfolio – the end project target of seven percent was not met, as a result of a
      change in the formula for determining NPLs; at project end, the level had been
      reduced to just under nine percent as determined by the new formula; (ii)
      implementation of an electronic Visa system which has led to all the islands being
      linked electronically with Visa and other point of sales (POS) systems – baseline
      targets appear rather small as compared to seven million and US$68 million worth
      of transactions; (iii) the merger of the two existing pension schemes has been
      completed, unpaid government contributions have been paid and other parametric
      changes introduced to help ensure the sustainability of the pension system. These
      efforts effectively contributed to achieving the development objectives.

(b)   Investment climate reform covering tax reform, removal of administrative
      barriers, improved supply chains and legal reforms. This objective was
      achieved. The project enabled the reduction in the cost of starting a business as
      measured by percentage of income per capita and the time to start a business.
      While the end project targets were not met, the reductions in both cases were very
      significant (from 40 percent to 18 percent against a target of 10 percent; and from
      52 days to 11 days against a target of 10 days). The time to register a business is
      only one day compared to three weeks. Notaries on all islands have been linked
      electronically resulting in a quick turnaround for businesses’ needs as well as
      households’ needs. Total FDI targets were met several times over the target and in
      addition, the targeted number of jobs created through FDI was also exceeded.
      Support under the project to the DGCI (tax office) led to the streamlining of taxes
      and legislation that reduced corporate taxes from 35 percent to the end of project
      target of 25 percent. Cape Verde has become a member of the WTO and its tariffs
      are aligned with WTO standards.

(c)   Post privatization and divestiture reform. The project sought to support the
      privatization of a number of SOEs by financing investment memoranda for
      TACV and ENAPOR. At project close, these had not been achieved; TACV was
      still under Government ownership, and the Government had created a different
      strategy for privatizing ENAPOR: it will become a landlord port with a number
      of port services concessioned to the private sector.

(d)   Private sector and institutional capacity building. The project supported
      provision of technical services and training opportunities for entrepreneurs. The
      matching grants facility (MGF) was fully subscribed midway through
      implementation necessitating additional funding for this activity given the
      outcomes already being realized. Data available confirmed the achievement of
      the increase in production and/or services outcome (87 percent versus a target of
      at least 10 percent). Efficiency ratio targets were not calculated due to unavailable
      data (shortcoming identified in Section 2.3 above) and incomplete data.




                                           16
3.3    Efficiency

71.     A comparison of the results of the cost-benefit analysis at project appraisal (PAD)
and project completion, as shown in Annex 3: Table 10, confirms under each case ERRs
greater than the 12 percent discount rate and therefore positive NPVs justifying the
project's soundness from the perspective of private sector capacity building and
investment promotion, and further indicating a positive impact on Government income.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory.

72.      The comprehensive background analysis preceding and during the design and
appraisal stages, the combined technical advice from various parts of the World Bank
Group, and the IMF provided to the Government of Cape Verde, the deep involvement of
civil society and especially inclusion of stakeholders in the private and financial sectors,
utilization of lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted projects all combined to
respond to the Government of Cape Verde’s economic development program and have
ensured the continued relevance of the PDOs. Based on the project’s NPV, the project’s
efficiency is not in doubt. The overall outcome is rated satisfactory due to the end-of-
project achievement of the project development objectives, continued relevance of the
PDOs, and its efficiency. The project largely achieved its development objectives
notwithstanding minor shortcomings in the collection and evaluation of a number of
outcome indicators. In fact, most of the outcomes achieved are rated highly satisfactory –
for example, FDI topped US$1.5 billion, and contributed to the creation of over 5,300
jobs, introduction of electronic financial services across all islands resulting in significant
improvement in electronic payment systems.

73.     In addition, the review showed that the project resources were efficiently utilized
resulting in an ERR of over 12 percent.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

74.     Poverty Impact. The Project catalyzed the combined efforts of the Government,
the Bank of Cape Verde, the financial sector and private sector stakeholders working
together to substantially strengthen the financial system, leading to the availability of
varied financial products in the country, reducing the levels of lending rates and
contributing to improved access to credit for SMEs. In addition, the project helped create
more employment than initially estimated through improved FDI promotion and
subsequently realized investments, the establishment of a number of regulatory agencies
to regulate key sectors thus encouraging competition. The electronic linking of the
islands which allowed the citizenry to access civil information such as birth, marriage
certificates on-line in addition to the pension system being enabled to adequately cater for
pensioners, and the infirmed, point to the positive impact the project has contributed. The



                                              17
economy has been liberalized, and opened up for all to participate. On gender aspects,
there were no specific initiatives targeted at gender equity.

75.     Social Development. The set up of an arbitration center to adjudicate commercial
disputes and the extension of pension benefits should contribute to the rule of law in
economic transactions, improved labor relationships, and participation of lower income
citizens in gains from Cape Verde’s economic development. All these and others would
engender social cohesion and development through a reduction in conflict among key
segments of society.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

76.     The project has contributed to a significant degree of institutional strengthening
and development within ministries, departments and agencies of government that
interface with the private and financial sectors, regulatory agencies, and the private sector.
Knowledge transfer in the management and operations of state-owned enterprises, sector
regulatory agencies, staff and members of the two main Chambers of Commerce was
substantial. The regulatory agencies which were strengthened and/or established with
project support appear to be stable, on the way to full maturity. A number of agencies
under the purview of the Ministries of Finance, and Economy, such as customs services
has been strengthened and have in turn instituted refined administrative procedures and
legislative instruments that together facilitate trade and reduce the cost trade logistics
through the ports.

77.     Capacity building support under the project to staff of BCV has contributed to a
relatively stable financial sector showing increased access to credit to the private sector
(50.7 percent of GDP at end 2007, 58 percent in 2008, compared to 43 percent in 2002).
The National Institute for Social Security (INPS) has also been strengthened and has
contributed to a well-functioning pension sector that is making adequate provisions for
beneficiaries and would contribute to ensuring social inclusiveness and cohesion.
Opportunities have opened for financial institutions to finance new companies in recently
liberalized sectors in transport, telecoms, and the SME sector.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

78.     In addition to the jobs created from FDI promotion and the deepening of the
financial sector occasioning new jobs, another major unintended outcome has been the
project assistance offered to the Chambers of Commerce which were only present in their
“home towns?. At project closing, the Chambers have a physical presence in most of the
islands, the membership has more than doubled, and their portfolio of services have
improved and increased. The Chambers are today ISO 9001:2008 certified, affiliated or
are representatives of important international private sector development institutions.
Another positive outcome is Cape Verde’s improved position on the Doing Business
rankings (120th on Doing Business 2011).

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate.

79.      The support provided under the project to the Chambers of Commerce to help
build their management capacities and ability to present bankable proposals, strengthen
the lines of dialogue with government is well-grounded and is expected to be sustained.
In addition, key Ministries, government departments and agencies that also received
significant support under project in order to be better able to facilitate private sector
competitiveness and contribute to reducing the cost of business in Cape Verde are very
relevant to sustaining project outcomes. The follow-on project will also contribute to
ensuring sustaining the development outcomes. The achievements will serve as a signal
to the private sector and should contribute to sustaining the gains from the project. The
issue of privatization or incomplete privatization of a number of state-owned enterprises
is not likely to significantly reverse the development outcomes given the current status of
the affected industries.

80.     It is the case that regulation and supervision capacities within the BCV have been
strengthened and have contributed to a stable financial sector, however, there’s still more
to do in view of the changing structure of the sector (new on-shore and off-shore banks
that have been licensed), and the existence of deposit-taking MFI. In addition, the effect
of the global financial crisis is an on-going event, which will require continued vigilance
of the central bank.

81.     The political situation in Cape Verde appears relatively stable and impending
elections should not result in any reversals of the outcomes realized from the project.
Additionally, the strong government ownership of the project and the leadership, for
example, shown through the large number of business environment reforms undertaken
by public agencies, and overseen and led by UCRE, is strong testament to the
Government’s intent on sustaining these reforms, which would continue to be led by the
strong institutions that have been set up. Therefore, the risk to the project development
outcomes is assessed as moderate.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory.

82.     The World Bank project preparation team which looked to be comprised of staff
and consultants with the appropriate skills and experience ensured the Borrower
participated actively in project design and preparation and supported preparation by
providing relatively comprehensive technical, economic and other advice (including from
the IMF, and FIAS) that resulted in a commendably designed intervention that was
responsive to the government of Cape Verde’s economic development program and


                                            19
forward looking in addressing constraints to private sector competitiveness and sustaining
its MIC status. Even though there was no Quality at Entry review, lessons from previous
Bank interventions and experiences from elsewhere were incorporated in the design, and
other stakeholder involvement (private sector) was ensured in the design and preparation
of the project. Institutional development was given the desired attention and has
contributed to the development and strengthening of regulatory agencies and trade
facilitation agencies like Customs. However, the privatization component could have
been more rigorously prepared and implementation risk mitigation measures proposed in
view of the lessons learned from a previous Bank-assisted privatization project.

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory.

83.     The Bank’s supervision/implementation support teams were adequately
constituted with the right skills-mix and continuity was ensured through limiting the
changes in task team leadership, there were in reality only two task team leaders.
Missions were regular and comprehensive, and adequate reporting was done and key
issues and recommendations documented and followed up. The fiduciary specialists
provided professional advice and guidance to both the task team leader and government
thus facilitating and helping reduce bottlenecks in project implementation. Quality of
supervision would have been rated higher than satisfactory if the team would have
included an M&E specialist or advice given to strengthen the PCU through the institution
of an M&E function.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

84.     Based on the Bank’s satisfactory design and appraisal of the project, continuity in
task team leadership and the generally comprehensive implementation support provided
to a project that included many and varied implementing agencies, the overall Bank
Performance is rated satisfactory. The role the Bank played in providing timely advice to
Cape Verde’s fledging private sector development agenda, support to improving public-
private dialogue, the achievements under the project and the forward looking engagement
that has sustained the dialogue with government is commendable. The Bank’s
performance under this project is commendable in view of the relatively small number of
task-team leadership changes, very good collaboration with both government entities and
private sector operators and the generally timely resolution of issues. But for the less
than proactive performance on institution of a fully-fledged M&E function, and the
agreement to undertake privatization of state-owned enterprises which were not fully
ready for the market under the project, the overall Bank performance could have been
rated Highly Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

85.     Given the key role the Government of Cape Verde played during preparation and
appraisal, the Government’s Performance is rated Satisfactory. The Government, mindful
of the need to not only restore macroeconomic stability but also undertake structural
reforms to maintain growth, sought the necessary assistance to develop a national
development plan, which included a key focus on private sector promotion. The high
priority assigned to private sector promotion translated into a commitment that was
manifested in the Government’s consistent support to project preparation and throughout
the project’s implementation period. Nevertheless, the difficulties encountered with the
privatization sub-component, where the Government commitment wavered as evidenced
by the changing dates for the privatization of TACV and ENAPOR, and which at project
end had not been carried-out, raise doubts about the Government determination to resolve
tough issues that arose with regard to its privatization commitments. The Government
performance is rated satisfactory.

(b)    Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

86.     The project was coordinated by a coordinating agency (PCU) staffed with
qualified personnel, who also showed commitment. It is more likely a testament to the
staff’s professionalism and ability to deliver that the project went through at least four
coordinators – a number of them were appointed to higher positions in government - and
yet the project did not encounter significant implementation issues. The quality of project
management contributed to the strong performance of most implementing agencies,
allowing for the submission of reports and encouraging early identification of issues and
subsequent institution of solutions. There were, however, shortfalls in the M&E function
that persisted, affecting improved monitoring.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

87.     The generally high quality of the project management team and the generally
consistent commitment of the Government of Cape Verde were key pillars underpinning
how this project performed. The Overall Borrower Performance is therefore rated
Satisfactory, notwithstanding the borrower’s inability to deliver on the privatization sub-
component, and lapses in the monitoring and evaluation functions.




                                            21
6.      Lessons Learned

88.     The need for the World Bank to provide lead advice on the design and
implementation of a clear monitoring and evaluation framework, including ensuring clear
lines of responsibilities and more robust and challenging performance indicators.

89.     While the Project supported many sub-implementing agencies and hence
activities, it also showed ways to satisfactorily implement a complex project –
commitment and dedication from key implementation “champions? and government
regular oversight are key, in addition to the technical abilities and due diligence of the
World Bank Group team.

90.     Matching Grant schemes implemented and facilitated by private sector
associations appear to contribute significantly to successful implementation and coupled
with robust M&E framework, impact can be measured within the project implementation
period.

                     Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis



1.      The economic analysis of this type of private sector development project is
challenging and presents difficulties in quantifying the economic benefits because there
are indirect relationships between project actions or interventions and the related stream
of benefits.

2.       For the Cape Verde Growth and Competitiveness Project, it is difficult to measure
the economic benefits of the Financial Sector and Private Sector Competitiveness
components because they furnish provision of services to firms indirectly. On the other
hand, for the project's Matching Grants Fund scheme, while there are challenges in
estimating the additional amounts and types of investment, incremental production and
exports generated from the supported firms, with conservative assumptions a cost-benefit
analysis can estimate the Net Present Value (NPV) and Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
of this intervention.

3.      Given the small sample of firms that were tracked before and after the MGFs
were provided, the methodology is simple and conservative. The method answers the
following question: “If we assume that the firms in the sample would have grown at least
as much as the rest of the economy, how much more did firms grow, on average, as a
result of receiving a MGF?? The method subtracts benefits that would have been
garnered as a result of macroeconomic growth and attributes any additional growth to the
MGF.

4.      The numeraire in the derived objective function used is output expected to grow
mainly as the result of improved efficiency of the Matching Grant-supported SMEs, and
also in addition to increased private national and foreign direct investment (FDI).

Assumptions

5.      Given the limitations of the data, due to an M&E system that was found wanting
by this ICR, a more parsimonious set of assumptions than those found in the project’s
Project Appraisal Document have been used under this economic analysis:

   i.   A stable macroeconomic environment is projected for the country;
  ii.   From the project, approximately 150 firms are projected to have benefited directly
        from receiving a matching grant with the total available project and beneficiary
        contributions summing to US$4 million in total;
 iii.   Additional output created by assisted firms is defined as the difference between
        the level of output achieved by firms assisted by the project and the level of
        output these same firms would have achieved in the absence of the project which
        is proxied by the economic growth rate. In terms of changes in revenue, Table 2
        below indicates levels of increases in business revenues from surveyed firms as a
        result of the first part of the project between 2003 to 2007;



                                            27
     iv.     The sample of nineteen (19) firms for which there is data is representative of all
             of the firms that received matching grant funds in the following dimensions; (a)
             the average size of the matching grant fund, (b) the average initial revenue levels
             before the matching grant fund intervention and (c) the final revenue level four
             years after the matching grant fund was received;
      v.     A discount rate of 12 percent is used in the economic analysis as the opportunity
             cost of capital, and the analysis performed in constant US dollar terms with base
             year being the project inception year 2003;
     vi.     Matching grant funds of US$ 1.3 million are distributed at the beginning of in
             2003 and US$ 0.7 million in grants 2007;
    vii.     There is a one year lag in benefits from the grants that last three years. In other
             words, grants given in 2003 accumulated benefits in 2004 and these lasted
             through to the end of 2006 and grants given in 2007 accumulated benefits in 2008
             and these lasted through to the end of 2010;
   viii.     The annual incremental returns to matching grants plus applicant’s match are the
             same rate year to year and based on a four year total returns to revenue; and
     ix.     The economic analysis covered a period of 8 years i.e. the project implementation
             period.

Project Completion – Case 1

7.     The project completion cost-benefit analysis was conducted for the matching
grant sub-component (private sector capacity building) only for lack of data to support
the analysis of the institutional development component of the project.

8.      The total cost or support for the MGF scheme is presented under Table 5 below.
This is made up of a US$2 million support facility from the IDA and an equivalent US$2
million as beneficiary contribution to the MGF. These financial costs were equated to
economic costs in the absence of shadow prices.

9.     Projected benefits under the cost-benefit analysis were derived from the direct
impact on output growth (revenues). However, these were discounted by both the
opportunity cost of capital and the growth in revenue that can be attributed to the
macroeconomic growth of the national economy.

10.     The above-mentioned project costs and benefits were spread as shown below
(Table 6) over relevant periods within the eight-year economic analysis period. However,
since the data provided indicates at most a four-year span, the incremental growth rate
was calculated using a four-year time span.13

11.     Tables 6 and 7 below present the details of the Cost-Benefit analysis and the
resultant NPV and ERR under the Case 1 scenario.

     The annual incremental rate of growth (icrg) is calculated by the following formula:
                                                                       n
                                                             Rt 1 
                                                            
                                                             R   1  icrg
                                                                    
                                                             t 
Where    Rt 1   is the end of four-year revenue,   Rt   is the initial revenues before the grant and   n are the number of years between
initial revenues and ending revenues. In this case,      n is equal to four.    This yields 11.32 percent annual growth.

Conclusion

12.     A comparison of the results of the cost-benefit analysis at project appraisal (PAD)
and project completion, as shown under Table 8 below, confirms under each case ERRs
greater than the 12 percent discount rate justifying the project's soundness from the
perspective of private sector capacity building and investment promotion, and further
indicating a positive impact on Government income. While the ERR across the columns
are not completely comparable, the project completion ERR is biased downward and
includes fewer elements, and focused solely on the MGF economic rate of return.

     Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


Evaluation of Project Design

The GCP was designed based on the results of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed in August 2001, on the National Development Plan (NDP), and several
discussions between IDA and Government staff. The project proved to be instrumental
for Government actions to reduce administrative barriers, to enhance the business
environment and reduce opportunities for fraud and corruption.

Key Performance Measures and Achievements

Component 1: Modernizing, Strengthening and Restructuring the Financial Sector

The project met most of the end-project component key performance indicators:

A. Financial Sector Development. The combined efforts of the Government, BCV, the
commercial banks and the Chambers of Commerce have substantially strengthened the
financial system, expanded availability of financial products and significantly deepened
the financial market.

B. Pension reform. The implementation of the reform was led by the INPS. A strategy
was defined, and since 2007 its implementation completed. The two systems (private
sector workers; public administration workers) have been merged, and all workers are
under INPS pension system. Parametric changes have been completed and all INPS
agencies have been integrated into a single network allowing all pension beneficiaries
information to be centrally housed and available to all agencies and medical receipts
dispensing pharmacies.

Component 2: Enhance Private Sector Competitiveness

This component was designed with the objective to improve the enabling investment
environment, especially by facilitating the policy, legal and regulatory interface, and the
dialogue process between the public and private sectors:

A. Investment climate reform. One of the key activities in the e-Government reform is
making Casa do Cidadão initiative fully operational ensuring Government and Cape
Verde private sector interact and provides a system which is far more efficient and
effective, more transparent, more participatory and less onerous. On the Fiscal front, tax
rates have been reduced, for example, the tax rate was reduced from 35-30 percent in
2003, and in 2008 the Government reduced the Corporate Income Tax further, from 30 to
25 percent (some micro enterprises pay only 15). Reforms have brought the Cape Verde
accounting system to international rules and regulations.




                                            34
A new Customs Code (Legislative Decree 4/2010, dated June 3) was approved and
provides a progressive liberalization of import rules and procedures and is in compliance
with WTO rules. All Customs services are now linked to DGCI (Tax office), DGC
(Commerce General Directorate) and DGT (Treasury Department).

The new arbitration law (Law 76/VI/2005, dated August 16) has been enacted. With
support from the project, the Chambers of Commerce have trained and 23 twenty-three
have been formally certified by the MoJ as arbitrators and the Barlavento Center has been
officially inaugurated and licensed.

B. Post Privatization and Divestiture

Support has led to:
(a)   A fully operational multi-sector regulatory agency capable of handling
      routine issues internally and more complex ones with limited expert support.
      The Government made the decision to set up stand alone independent regulatory
      agencies in five (5) sectors.
(b)   Completion of the private participation agenda, including the port and,
      possibly, the airport; The Government remains fully committed in the
      divestiture program for ENAPOR, the Port Authority and operator, TACV, Cape
      Verde Airlines, Cabnave the State owned shipyard management and operator, and
      Emprofac the drug importer and distributor.

C. Private Sector Capacity Building. Growth has been witnessed in the Chambers’
maturity and capacity to meet their members demand for services. The Matching Grant
Fund (MGF) funded over 170 projects totaling US$1.3M. The overall assessment from
all stakeholders is that the MGF was extremely successful.

Component 3: Supporting Project Implementation

The project was designed to be implemented by the beneficiaries, notwithstanding, a
professional Project Coordinating Unit established. The project was faced with a high
turnover in staffing that led to delays and discontinuation in some activities. Despite these
handicaps, the diligence, engagement, and availability of all PCU staff were critical in
overcoming operational and institutional shortcomings.

Key Lessons Learned from Project Implementation

(a)    The design of a project such as this must always take into account and be in
       perfect harmony with the comprehensive and global program of the Government.

(b)    The Key Performance Indicators should take into consideration the project’s
       capacity to control their achievement.

(c)    The project Steering Committee should be as small as possible, while trying to
       bring together all the most important stakeholders, and try to balance its

       membership’s time devoted to project matters and other priorities due to their
       position in Government.

(d)    The use of project coordinating units as targeted and focused instruments is a
       highly efficient mechanism of change.

Principal Factors Affecting Project Implementation

The project implementation was affected by the following factors: (a) Slow response of
public institutions; (b) delay in the approval of the annual budget by the steering
committee; (c) occasional delay of the World Bank in responding to requests; (d) social
complexity of the companies to be privatized; (e) the Monitoring and Evaluation could be
strengthened.

World Bank Performance

Overall, the relationship and communications with the Bank has always tended to be
most supportive, professional and cordial. However, more could have been done to
provide more policy guidance and closer supervision of substantive decision-making.

Government and PCU Performance

The project was in full agreement with the Government economic policy, and was
supported by the Government in all stages. The difficulties encountered to implement the
divestiture component resulted from uncertainties arising from strong strategic economic
role of these companies.

The Coordination Unit itself was supervised, audited and closely followed by the
Government and almost received approval for its excellent performance. However it
should be noted that staffing turnover (four coordinators, five senior program officers
(including procurement officers, program managers and financial manager) some of
which could not be replaced Also, the Steering Committees could be much more
substantive.

Key Lessons Learned from the Overall Experience

The Government and the PCU should be more diligent in aligning actions plans with the
policy framework, especially when financing private sector.

A pragmatic approach to the allocation of funds to private projects, for monitoring the
implementation and outcomes that is critical to the results sought to be achieved.
This implies instituting a robust framework for monitoring the implementation and
monitoring of outcomes is critical to the results sought to be achieved.

Future Operations

(a)   Improved monitoring and evaluation framework.

(b)   Increased attention on Government program of divestiture, include privatization
      technical assistance to the enterprises that are still to be privatized.

(c)   Continued support for investment climate reforms including ease of doing
      business initiatives.
