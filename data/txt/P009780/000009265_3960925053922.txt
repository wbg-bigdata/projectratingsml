PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1925-IN)
PREFACE
This report presents the results of a performance audit of a Bank
loan to finance part of the cost of the development of the Bombay High oil
field. The loan was made to the Government and onlent to the Oil and Natural
Gas Commission (ONGC), a Government-owned entity. The loan, in the amount of
US $400 million, was approved on December 8, 1980, and fully disbursed in
April 1984, about 12 months behind schedule, but with 92X of the loan amount
being disbursed within the scheduled time. The proceeds of the loan financed
the foreign exchange costs of aeven well platforms, one offshore production
complex, two production platforms (only the jackets and drilling decks), and
pipelines and flowlines. The project, with some modifications in scope, was
completed with a delay of approximately one year (mostly for valid reasons),
but with a significant saving in capital costs. The target production level
of 12 million tons p.a. was reached in March 1982, slightly ahead of schedule.
This Project Completion Report was prepared by the Energy Department,
and was based on information obtained during project tupervision and from the
Appraisal, President's and Svtervision reports, as well as other documents in
the project files. The Borrower submitted a completion report containing its
views on the project implementation and supplied additional data for the PCR.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower and the Executing Agency. Comments received from the
Borrower have been reproduced as Attachment A to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1925-IN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The loan under review in the amount of US $400 million was to finance
part of the cost of Phase IV and the advance action on Phase V of the
development of the offshore Bombay High oil field. The Bank had approved an
earlier loan of US $150 million in June 1977 towards the Phase III development
of the same field (Loan 1473-IN) which was completed in April 1983 (PCR
4139). The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), a Government-owned entity,
was the beneficiary and implementing agency for the previous as well as the
current loan under review.
2.       The main objective of Phases IV and V (Advance Action) was to reach a
production rate of 240,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) by mid-1982 through
primary development of the southern and central areas of the Bombay High
field, and involved development drilling, construction of offshore platforms
and production facilities, laying of subsea pipelines and flowlines and
expansion of onshore terminal facilities (PCR paras. 2.02 and 3.03-3.04).
Other important objectives were the provision of technical assistance to ONGC
to help ensure efficient project implementation and improvement in its
technical capabilities in project management, the timely introduction of
reservoir pressure maintenance through water injection to maximize the
ultimate oil recovery, the strengthening of the financial position of ONGC
through adequate prices for its oil and gas production as well as through
prudent financial practices, and finally, to increase ONGC's use of the
international financial markets to raise funds for the financing of its large
investment program and thereby decrease ONGC's dependence on Government equity
and loan contributions (PCR para. 2.03).
3.       The project was successfully implemented and the objectives met.
ONGC achieved slightly ahead of schedule its main target which was to reacL. a
production rate of 240,000 BOPD by mid-1982 (PCR paras. 3.02 and 3.12).
However implementation delays ranging from four months to one year were
experienced in the construction of offshore production facilities, onshore
terminal facilities and well drilling due to changes in project scope,
problems in the project management of a foreign contractor, drilling
difficulties and shortage of offshore drilling units (PCR paras. 3.05-3.11).
Many of the causes of the delay were beyond ONGC's control, while the rather
tight schedule and the difficulties inherent in planning construction
activities around an 8-month window between monsoons should be appreciated.
Despite these difficulties, the project was completed with a saving of US
$65.3 million in capital costs mainly due to better project management and
higher use of local resources (PCR paras. 3.13-3.17).
4.       The speed with which the project was conceived and implemented had a
significant effect on the Indian economy at a critical time immediately
following the oil price "shock" of 1979. The oil production target of 240,000



- v -
BD which was reached in March 1982, (of which 100,000 BD was contributed by
the Bombay High 1T Project), represented foreign exchange savings of about $3
billion annually; and although OPEC prices have fallen 201 since 1982, the
current oil production of 400,000 BD from Bombay High is worth $4.2 billion
per year in foreign exchange savings (PCR para. 5.03). In addition, the
project accelerated ONGC's move away from reliance on the government for
external financing. Under the previous Bombay High I project, ONGC borrowed
for the first time from foreign commercial Banks - raising about US $50
million to help finance the phase III development of Bombay High. During the
implementation of the project under review (Bombay High II) foreign borrowings
increased about 20 times.  Specifically, during the period 1981-1984 ONGC
borrowed on its own account $965 million from a variety of sources and
negotiated $100 million of suppliers credit in addition to the loans from the
Bank (PCR para. S.04).  Institutional objectives were also essentially
achieved.  As a result of a higher-than-expected petroleum production coupled
with higher prices for oil, gas and LPG, autho-ized by the Government, ONGC's
financial performance and prospects improved dramatically (PCR paras. 7.01-
7.03). ONGC made substantial progress in the areas of organization and
project management throughout project implementation (PCR paras. 6.04-6.11).
S.       Due to both the higher productivity of wells drilled under the
project and higher petroleum prices, the recalculated financial rate of return
of the project is significantly higher than the original estimate. In
addition, the project facilitated the transfer of technology with respect to
sophisticated oil and gas installations, including the eata^^;shment of
domestic capability in the construction and installation of offshore
production facilities, ax.%' in reservoir development and management. From the
sectoral perspective, the project furthered the Bank's policy dialogue with
the Government on energy, especially, the development and utilization of
offshore gas reserves.
6.       In analyzing the project experience, the PCR stresses the expediency
of making recourse to "turnkey contracts" for project components which are on
the critical path, provided the project entity is assisted by an experienced
engineering group (PCR para. 9.04), and the importance of planning and
providing for reservoir pressure maintenance during primary development (PCR
para. 9.03). The report also highlights the importance of-the rapid and
flexible response of the Bank in supporting the development of the Bombay High
oil field which enabled the Government and ONCC to quickly bring this major
resource to the production stage. Without the oil production from Bombay
High, the oil import bill would have severely affected the Indian economy.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1925-IN)
I.       INTRODUCTION
1.01    On December 8, 1980, the Executive Directors approved a US $ 400
million loan to India, to finance part of the cost of Phase rv and advance
action on Phase V of the development of the Bombay High field. The Bank had
given an earlier loan of US $ 150 million for the third phase of the field's
development (Loan No. 1473-IN).
1.02    The Bombay High field, which is the largest oil field in India, was
discovered in 1974. It is located some 160 km west-northwest of Bombay in the
Indian Ocean at an average water depth of 80 m. Oil production from the field
ztarted in May 1976, and the field was developed in successive stages. At the
completion of the Phase III program in March 1981, tLe field had reached a
production potential of 140,000 BOPD. The target of the Phases IV and V
(advance action) was to reach a production capacity of 240,000 BOPD by mid-
1982 by developing the hitherto mndeveloped central and southern sections of
the field. This target was reached at the end of March 1982, slightly ahead
of schedule.
1.03    The development of the Bombay High field is still continuing and the
Phase V program is under implementation. The plan to reach a sustainable
production target of 340,000 BOPD by the mid-e4ghties has been accomplished,
and the water injection program designed to increase the field's recoverable
reserves is under implementation. As a result the Bombay High field will
remain the most important domestic source of petroleum accounting for about
551 of the country' oil production during the next ten years.
1.04    The Bank's involvement in India's petroleum sub-sector has been a
continuous one. Beside the two Bombay High offshore development loans (Loans
Nos. 1473-IN and 1925-IN), the Bank has approved three more loans involving
the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC): one for exploration (Loan No.
2205-IN approved on October 19, 1982), one for offshore gas development (Loan
No. 2241-IN approved on February 24, 1983) and one for onshore development
(secondary recovery and development of heavy oil) including some exploration
of deep horizons (Loan No. 2403-IN approved on March 29, 1984).
1.05    This report is based on the completion report prepared by ONGC and
the findings of a mission which visited India in September 1984.
II.     PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     In March 1980 the Government of India requested the Bank's financial
assistance for further development of the Bombay High field. In June 1980, a
Bank petroleum mission visited India for the appraisal of the project
consisting of the Phase IV and the advance action on Phase V of ONGC's Bombay
High development plan. This was followed by a post-appraisal mission in
September 1980.



- 2 -
2.02     The preparation of the project was based on the reservoir and
conceptual field development studies prepared by ONGC's consultants and the
cost and implementation results of the Phase III development plan. The main
objectives of the project were to complete the primary development of the
southern and central areas of the Bombay High field to achieve a plateau pro-
duction potential of 240,000 BOPD by mid-1982. The project was defined to
iiLclude the following principal components:
(a) a development drilling program comprising the drilling and
completion of sixty four development wells;
(b)  construction of offshore production faciliLies including fifteen
well platforms, one 180,000-BOPD capacity processing platform,
one living quarters platform to accommodate 124 workers and
approximately 133 km of subsea flow lines varying in diameter
from 8" to 20";
(c) expansion of shore facilities by the addition of 60,000 m3 of
tankage and 90,000-BOPD of crude stabilization facilities
including utilities;
(d) extension of tho existing telemetry and telecontrol system to
cover the whole of the Bombay High field; and
(e) engineering and technical services for the preparation of
detailed designs, the supervision of construction and assistance
to ONGC in project management.
2.03     As the consultants' reservoir study indicated that the ultimate
recovery of oil from the Bombay High field could be increased by 8% and 151,
in 20 and 30 years, respectively, by water injection, the Bank sought to be
assured that ONCC would introduce an adequate and timely water injectirn
program in accordance with the results of reservoir studies. Furthermore the
analysis o_ ONCC's financial prospects indicated that its financial
performance would deteriorate after 1983 because the relatively low price it
received for its oil (US $7.80/Bbl equivalent) did not provide sufficient
profits to undertake a normal, much less accelerated, development and
exploration program envisaged for the remainder of the 1980's. As a result,
it was requested by the Bank and agreed by GOI that crude oil and gas prices
received by ONGC would be revised from time to time in a way to permit ONGC to
meet its operating expensea and earn a rate of return on its invested capital
sufficient to meet its debt-service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital, and finance a substantial portion of its proposed investment program.
III.   IMPLEMENTATION
a. Background
3.01     ONGC was responsible for the implementation of the Project through
its Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) organization with the assistance of
international and local consultants and contractors. Because of the tight
implementation schedule, ONCC has awarded turnkey contracts for offshore
production facilities on the basis of basic designs prepared by its
engineering consultant.  Development wells have been drilled using both ONGC's
and contract drilling rigs. The expansion of the shore facilities has been
entrusted to local contractors with local consultants acting as project
managers. The exte;usion of the telemetry and telecontrol system has been done
on a force account basis under the supervision of ONCC's TITAN project team.



-3 -
3.02     Despite the very tight implementation schedule, the offshore
construction and installation procieded relatively smoothly and essentially on
schedule. The average delay experierced in platform construction and
installation compared to th-e original implementation schedule was about 42
days. Considering the logistic problems involved and the difficulty in
planning construction activities around an annual eight-month "window" between
monsoons, this is a commerdable achievement. However, there were major delays
in well drilling and shore facilities expansion (paras. 3.07, 3.11).
Nevertheless, ONGC was able to achieve its target production of 12 million
tons of oil per annum from the Bombay High field in March 1982, slightly ahead
of schedule.
b. Changes in Project Scope
3.03     With the exception of the addition of two production platforms to the
Phase V portion (Advance Action), the scope of the Bank project remained
unchanged (para. 3.04). In February 1981, ONGC submitted to GOI a proposal to
accelerate the development of Bombay High and adjacent oil fields to reach a
production level of 19 million tons per annum by 1984/85, against the Five-
year Plan objective of 13.2 million tons in that same year. As a result of a
detailed engineering and system analysis cerried out _y its engineering
consultant, it also prop sed to expand the onshore production facilities in
Uran by adding 240,000 m  of oil st1rage tanks, two trains of crude
stabilizes, one new LPC plant and 4 captive power plant, instead of only
60,000 m of oil storage and one crude stabilizer originally planned. ONGC
discussed these changes with the BaJk in March 1981. The Bank did not object
to the proposed additions. Howevert, they were not incorporated into the Bank
project since (i) the major portion of the extra units to be added were
required to accommodate the expected production from other fields in the
Bombay offshore area; and (ii) the additional units were part of ONCC's
continuing developmen program in offshore Bombay and, as such, were not an
integral part of the .'hase IV and Phase V (Advance Action) development of the
Bombay High field covered by the Bank project.
3.04     In March 1983, the Government requestea that the scope of the Bank
project be enlarged by the addition of two 100,000-BOPD production platforms
(SHD and NQD) to the Phase V portion (Advance Action) of the development of
Bombay High. As these two platforms were needed urgently to efficiently
handle the higher-than-expected oil and gas production from the field, the
Bank agreed to include the SHD and NQD platforms in the Bank project and the
Loan Agreement was amended accordingly in June 1983.
c. Implementation Delays
3.05     With the exception of slight damage suffered by the jacket of the SD
platform which was quickly repaired, the construction and installation of the
offshore production facilities proceeded smoothly and essentially on schedule
(para. 3.02). However there were important delays in well drilling, hook-up,
testing and commissioning of the Bombay High South Process Complex (BHS) and
the expansion of shore facilities. Also, a major blow out was experienced in
drilling one of the project wells (SJ-5), somewhat tarnishing the hitherto
exceptional safety record of the Bombay High development program (paras. 3.09-
3.10).



-4 -
3.06     The BHS platform complex was fabricated and installed on schedule on
March 31, 1982. However, the hook-up, testing and commissioning activities
could not be completed until October 6, 1982, causing a delay of about four
months compared to the appraisal schedule. The major reason for the delay was
less-than-optimum planning by the lead contractor, which is evidenced by the
difficulties encountered in accommoeating the 340 technicians working on hook-
up and commissioning in offshore Bombay during the monsoon season. The BuS
complex, consisting of one large process platform, one living quarters
platform and one flare tripod, is a major construction work requiring the
inputs 3f suveral contractors and the procurement of materials and equipment
from different countries. Given the difficulties of working offshore during
the monsoon season and the very 8jght implementation schedule (17 months from
contract award to commissioning)- , the four-month delay in commissioning the
BHS complex is not excessive.
3.07     The drilling of the development wells on five well platforms has been
completed essentially on schedule. However, the completion of drilling
activities on the remaining ten well platforms have been delayed from 90 to
330 days compared to the appraisal schedule. The reasons for the delays are
as follows: (i) during implementation ONGC has followed a deliberate policy
of delaying the drilling of those wells which could not be put on production
immediately upon completion because of lack of connection to the process
platforms, vhile at the time of appraisal it was assumed that a well platform
would be drilled immediately after installation; (ii) in some cases, the
drilling rigs working on project wells had to be diverted to working over
other Bombay High wells before completing all the wells on the original
platform; this caused delays in drilling and completing all the wells on a
given platform; and (iii) in keeping up with its accelerated development
program (para. 3.03), ONGC vastly expanded its offshore drilling activities
starting in late 1981 and experienced rig availability problems because of
late delivery of one of its offshore drilling units (Sagar Pragati) and the
damage sustained by another ONGC drilling unit in the SJ platform blow-out
(paras. 3.09-3.10).
3.08     It should be emphasized, however, that the delays in completing
drilling activities on individual well platforms did not materially affect the
benefits expected from the project, since ONGC reached its production target
on schedule by making maximum use of available resources and judiciously re-
ordering its drilling schedule. Under comparable conditions any other prudent
operator would probably act similarly.
3.09     On the other hand the blow-out which occurred on the SJ-5 well was a
major incident. While being deepened to explore the productive potential of
the basal sands which lit below the main producing zones of the Bombay High
field, the well blew out in the night of July 30, 1982. Despite immediate
intervention by ONGC staff, the well could not be brought under control; the
drilling crew of 74 was evacuated and immediate action was taken by ONC to
control and limit the damage, including the mobilization of the world's
foremost blow-out control and firo  ighting experts.  In the morning of
1/       This tight schedule was necessary in order to complete the BHS
complex before the onset of the 1982 monsoon.



-5 -
August 2, 1982, the well caught fire; however the fire died out by itself in
three days. The team of experts was successful in capping the well and
bringing it under complete control by September 30, 1982. As a result of the
blow-out and ensuing fire, ONGC's drilling unit Sagar Vikas suffered extensive
damage, the well No. SJ-5 had to be re-drilled, and the damaged main deck and
helideck of the platform had to be removed and replaced. As the well blew out
mainly gas, no recognizable environmental damage resulted. Total losses were
assessed at US $58.6 million, which, being fully covered by ONGC's insurance
policies, have since been collected by the operator.
3.10     The inquiry conducted by the Indian authorities did not uncover gross
neglect or lack of diligence on the part of ONCC or its staff. The blow-out
was attributed to an operational error of the drilling crew. In retrospect
all blow-outs are preventable; nonetheless they keep occurring. Despite all
the advances in pressure prediction and drilling techniques and blow-out
prevention equipment, even the most successful operators and drilling
contractors are not immune to blow-outs.
3.11     Because of the major changes in project scope (para. 3.03) the shore
facilities had to be re-engineered to optimize the design and operation of the
entire complex. As a result, construction activities lastud until May 1985.
Although there is an apparent delay of 35 months compared to the appraisal
estilmate, this should not be taken at face value, since the expansion program
presently under implementationlts radically different from the program on
which the appraisal was based.
d. Achievements of Objectives
3.12     ONGC achieved its target of increasing crude oil production from
Bombay High to 240,000 BOPD in March 1982 slightly ahead of schedule. The
primary development of the central and southern portions of the Bombay High
field can be considered as completed, and the oil production is currently
running at 400,000 BOPD which is about 73% higher than the appraisal
estimate. Currently, the well platforms included in the Bank project are
supplying 180,000 BOPD and 4.5 million m3/day of gas, which are approximately
76% and 180X, respectively, higher than the appraisal estimate. (However, due
to insufficient compressor capacity at present, only 60% of the produced gas
is actually marketed, the rest being flared in the field. Additional com-
pressor capacity is being installed which should eliminate any significant
flaring by the end of 1986).
e. Project Costs
3.13     The project was completed with a cost underrun of US$ 65.3 million
equivalent (7.9X) compared to the appraisal estimate. Actual and estimated
costs are compared in Annex 1. Annex 2 compares the total actual costs of
major project components with their estimated costs plus the prorated
contingencies.
1/       The crude stabilization unit and the tanks included in the original
project scope were completed in May 1983, with a delay of
approximately one year.



-6-
3.14     The cost comparison in Annex 2 shows significant variances in almost
all items. With the exception of well drilling, expansion of Uran facilities
and reservoir consultancy, the actual costs of all items were below those es-
timated at the time of appraisal, including assigned physical and price con-
tingencies. The reasons for variances are explained in the following para-
graphs.
3.15     Well drilling costs were 66.8X higher due to (i) the general increase
in ONCC's operating costs; (ii) the appreciation of the US $ on which prices
of oil field services are based from Rs 8.4 used for appraisal to Rs 10.8 in
mid-1983; (iii) the costly blow-out in well No. SJ-5 (paras. 3.09-3.10); and
(iv) ONGC's frequent shifting of offshore drilling units from one platform to
another in order to optimize the build-up of oil production (paras. 3.07-
3.08). This practice has resulted in extra mobilization and demobilization
costs (e.g. the wells on the SF platform were drilled in three successive
phases using three different offshore drilling units at an average cost of Rs
53.9 million per well, while the average cost of a well on the SS platform
drilled in one rig move was Rs 19.0 million).
3.16     The total cost of offshore production facilities (well platforms, BHS
Complex and subsea flowlines and pipelines) was 14.1Z lower due to the fact
that, in contrast to the experience of the First Bombay High Offshore Project
(Loan No. 1473-IN), there were only few and moderate change orders in
practically all contracts (e.g., on the basis of the first Bombay High
project, the estimated cost of the BHS Complex was increased by 15% of the
quoted prices to account for possible change orders; the actual cost of the
change orders was only 72).
3.17     The expansion of the Uran facilities cost 4X more than estimated.
The cost of the telemetry and telecontrol was 24.61 lower due to increased use
of local resources and lower-than-expected price inflation as a result of the
slow-down in investments by the international petroleum industry. The cost of
engineering, technical services and project supervision, which was estimated
at 10% of the project base cost, was 82.12 lower due to ONGC's heavy reliance
on local engineering consultants whose charges are substantially less than
those of foreign consultants and to increased involvement of the ONCC staff in
the engineering and technical supervision of projects. On the other hand,
reservoir consultancy cost 21.21 higher than estimated because ONCC sub-
sequently had to pay local taxes imposed on the foreign consultant which was
not the case at project appraisal. The amount allocated to customs duties and
import taxes was not used as a result of the Government's later decision of
exempting the local platform manufacturer from import duties and taxes. Also
the proportion of local currency costs (211) was substantially higher than the
appraisal estimate (12.3X) mostly due to the fact that the cost of the locally
manufactured well platforms was much higher than estimated at appraisal,
although still less than the cost of imported platforms.
f. Disbursements
3.18     At the time of appraisal, the Bank loan was to finance the foreign
exchange cost of six well platforms, BHS Complex and the related undersea
pipelines and flowlines. However, as of March, 1982, about US $ 42.0 million
of the Bank loan remained uncommitted because (i) change orders had been few
and moderate (para. 3.16); and (ii) ONGC had used US $ 15.0 million of US



-7-
Eximbank financing for the BHS turbine-generator packages which were
originally slated for Bank financing within the overall cost of the BHS
Complex. At the request of the GOI, the Bank agreed, in June 1983, to finance
one more well platform (SF) already in the original project scope as well as
the jackets and drilling decks of two production platforms (SHD and NQD) which
had been added to the scope of the project (para. 3.04).
3.19     The table below compares the actual Bank disbursements with the
appraisal forecast:
Cumulative Loan Disbursements
(US $ million)
Actual as a Z of
IBRD Fiscal Year     Actual    Appraisal Forecast  Appraisal Estimate
1980/81              6.6           105.0                    6
1981/82            302.0           370.0                   82
1982/83            369.0           400.0                   92
1983/84            400.0              -                     -
As the above table indicates the rate of disbursements sas very much slower
during the first year but improved substantially and 922 of the loan was dis-
bursed by the original closing date. The major reasons for slow disbursement
are: (i) delays in finalizing contracts for the BHS Complex and the SQ, SS,
ST well platform package by nine and seven months, respectively; (ii) delays
in project implementation; and (iii) late amendment of the Loan Agreement
enabling the Bank to disburse against the costs of the SP, SHD and NQD
platforms (para. 3.18).
g. Performance of Consultants
3.20     ONGC employed two foreign consultants and a local engineering firm
backed up by three foreign and one local consultant to assist in carrying out
the project. In the view of ONGC, the performance of the consultants was
wholly satisfactory, and this is also the conclusion of the Bank staff who
have supervised the project.
h. Performance of Contractors
3.21     With the possible exception of the BHS Complex, all contracts were
executed satisfactorily without undue problems. As explained in para. 3.06
above, the testing and commissioning of the critical BHS platform complex was
unduly delayed due to difficulties experienced by the lead contractor in
planning and coordinating subcontractors. Nevertheless, both ONGC and the
lead contractor cooperated in good faith to overcome the difficulties and the
work was completed with minimum possible delay.



-8-
IV.      OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     All of the project facilities are operating satisfactorily and the
housekeeping on them and the care and maintenance of the equipment are good to
excellent. Operators are well trained, knowledgeable and alert and appear to
be committed to their duties. ONGC is following the established procedures of
the petroleum industry in monitoring the performance of the reservoir. The
production rates, water cuts, gas/oil ratios and wellhead and bottom-hole
pressures are being periodically measured, and reservoir studies are updated
on a yearly basis.
4.02     Great emphasis is placed on safety, and the American Petroleum
Institute (API) recommended practices are being followed to ensure the safety
of personnel and facilities. Emergency equipment are in working order and
adequate fire fighting equipment are maintained on multipurpose support
vessels assigned to the Bombay High area. A safety engineer and his
assistants administer and carry out regular safety drills.
4.03     To prevent pollution, all installations are designed for discharges
within international regulations (API or EPA). Adequate stocks of chemical
dispersants, oil spill collectors and dispersant spraying equipment are being
kept. ONGC has trained a team of officers in charge of spill prevention and
control and has developed a reporting and action system to tackle oil
spills. It is also closely cooperating with the Indian Coast Guard, Port
Authorities, Shipping and Fisheries and National Institute of Oceanography on
environmental protection.
4.04     The initial rates of production of wells drilled under the project
averaged approximately 3,000 BOPD, or 50Z higher than the appraisal
estimate. However, the increase of the producing gas/oil ratios and the local
reservoir pressure drops were faster than originally predicted due to the
heterogeneous character of the Bombay High reservoir. To cope with the
problem, ONGC awarded turnkey contracts for the construction and installation
of a central water injection platform and four injection well platforms for
the northern section of Bombay High in June 1982. These facilities were put
in service in May 1984. In March 1983, the water injection studies for the
central and southern portions of Bombay High were completed and contracts were
awarded for the fabrication and installation of one water injection platform
and five injection well platforms in March 1983. These are expected to be
operational in late 1985.
V.       ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
5.01     Probably no other Bank financed project has had such a significant
effect on India's economy as the Second Bombay High Project. OPEC prices went
up in late 1979 for the second time in the seventies. In current dollars the
prevailing average price in 1980 rose to $30.5/barrel versus $18.6 in 1979.
This increase brought an urgency to the further development of the Bombay High
field. The speed with which the project was conceived and executed in
response to this challenge is impressive as are the economic results. As
mentioned earlier (para. 3.08) the delays in completing drilling activities on
individual well platforms did not materinlly affect the benefits expected from
the project, since ONGC reached its production target on schedule. Appraisal
and actual/estimated production results can be compared as follows:

I/ Actual
5.02     Because of the substantial increase in the domestic price of crude
oil received by ONGC starting in 1981 and the fact that the Bombay High wells
are producing much more oil and gas than was expected at the time of appraisal
the financial internal rate of return is up from slightly more than 17X at
appraisal to 38% at present (Annex 4). The assumptions made at appraisal and
current values can be compared as follows:

Financial Value of LPG          (Rs/Ton)1        1,328           1,830
5.03     In economic terms when Bombay High oil production reached 240,000 BD
in March 1982, (100,000 BD from this project), the annual output represented
foreign exchange savings of about US $3 billion annually; and although OPEC
prices have fallen about 20% since then, the current production of 400,000 BD
represents about US $4.2 billion per year of foreign exchange savings.

VI.      INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
a. Background
6.01     The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) is a Government-owned
statutory body created in 1959 by an Act of Parliament to "plan, promote and
implement the development of petroleum resources and the production and sale
of petroleum products produced by it." ONGC is by far the major producer of
petroleum in India, and carries exploration activities on a large scale all
over the country; however, it is not involved in downstream activities, such
as refining and marketing.
6.02     Until 1973, virtually all of ONGC's activities were concentrated
onshore, where it was producing oil and gas in Assam and Gujarat. Following
the discovery of oil in Bombay High, the Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) was set
up in Bombay to explore for and develop offshore petroleum resources. In the
course of these activities, ONGC has developed sufficient expertise in
offshore exploration and development through judicious use of consultants,
effective recruitment and training practices and actual involvement in all
facets of offshore petroleum technology. At the time of appraisal, ONGC was
judged to be a technically and administratively competent organization. Its
management information system and project management practices were found to
be evolving in the right direction. Consequently, no specific institution
building measures were incorporated into the project.
b. Organization and Management
6.03     The Commission currently consists of a Chairman, six full-time
members (Finance, Technical Services, Personnel, Exploration, Operations and
Drilling) and two part-lime members representing the Ministry of Finance and
the Ministry of Energy.' BOP is managed by the Member Operations. The
administrative and financial functions (planning, procurement and stores,
accounting, personnel, etc.) are centralized in the corporate headquarters at
Dehra Dun, along with the main research and development activities.
Operational staff are divided among three regional offices (Central, Western
and Eastern Regions) and the Bombay Offshore Project.
6.04     The Commission acts very much as a board of directors and is
responsible for setting ONGC's policies. While important policy decisions are
taken at headquarters and the commission members play an active part in
running affairs falling in their areas of responsibility, operational
divisions have operational responsibility and the authority to commit funds
within their approved budgets.
6.05     During the implementation of the Project, ONGC continued to improve
its organizational structure. With ONGC's growth expected to continue into
the 1990's, the issue of organizational efficiency has become a serious
concern to ONGC and the government as well as the Bank. A major restructuring
1/       As the time of appraisal the Commission had four full-time members
(Finance, Materials, Offshore and Onshore) and three part-time
members representing the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers and the Planning Commission.



- 1I -
of ONGC was implemented in 1984 based on the business group or functional
approach in which activities would be grouped into similar functions or
profit/cost centers rather than by geographical location. In addition there
has been a concentration of ONGC resources and efforts in the basic explo-
ration and production activities with a reduction in ONGC's own participations
in areas such as petroleum transportation, drilling and other technical
support services which can be provided by contractors. The Bank has supported
this streamlining of ONGC's organization and operations, and continues to
exchange ideas with ONGC on specific operational aspects of its organizational
framework.
c. Project Management
6.06     ONCC follows the practice of appointing project managers for each
major project and, in the case of BOP, for each important construction
activity, such as the BHS Complex. Project managers are charged with the
responsibility of monitoring the progress of their individual projects from
planning to commissioning, and are responsible for both contractual and
technical aspects.
6.07     Early in 1982, BOP introduced a tighter and more effective system of
project monitoring and coordination consisting of (a) weekly, fortnightly and
monthly progress reports on each project, and (b) weekly coordination meetings
chaired either by the Member Offshore or the General Manager, Engineering and
Production, to review outstanding problems. The decision making process at
different echelons and their authority over expenditures were also clearly
defined.
d. Management Information System
6.08     At the time of appraisal, ONGC's management information system
consisting of monthly reports covering all its activities and providing the
senior management with essential inputs was judged to be satisfactory in
general. The only shortcoming identified at the time was the lack of up-to-
date financial data. In early-1981 this shortcoming was remedied with the
computerization of the accounting system. The periodic project progress
reports (para. 6.07) and detailed reports prepared on construction, safety,
etc. also add to the effectiveness of ONCC's management information system.
e. Staffing and Training
6.09     Between 1980 and 1983 ONGC's staff increased in number from 26,000 to
33,000 (26.9%). Of this increase BOP's share was 2,743 or 39.2% of the total
increase, reflecting the very rapid expansion of ONGC's offshore activities.
If the daily production is to be taken as a rough indice of the efficiency of
staffing, ONGC in 1983 was producing 11.1 BOPD/staff, compared to 7.3
BOPD/staff in 1980. This is a satisfactory development especially since much
of the increase was in the number of the technical/managerial and supervisory
staff which during the same period grew by 5,632 (80.5% of the total
increase). It is, therefore, expected that ONCC will in the near future be
able to alleviate the shortage of middle-level managers with sufficient
experience and reduce the overload of its senior staff which is still
considerable.



- 12 -
6.10     ONGC continued its training efforts throughout project
implementation. In this respect, offshore operations were given greater
emphasis in view of ONCC's rapidly expanding offshore activities. Personnel
were given training by various local institutions (management, finance,
engineering and geology) and were also sent abroad (oil companies,
laboratories and contractors' facilities) for specialized training. Several
courses and seminars were also given in-house to enhance the administrative
and managerial capabilities of the staff.
f. Conclusion
6.11     Overall, ONGC made substantial progress in the areas of organization
and management and institutional strength throughout project implementation.
Nevertheless, in view of the continuously expanding scope of its offshore
activities and the rapid changes taking place in the international petroleum
industry, it will have to continue its institution-building efforts without
relapse.
VII.     FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
a. Operating Results
7.01     A comparison of ONGC's financial results with the appraisal forecast
appears in Annex 3 of this report. Over the 1980-1985 period accumulated
profits have reached Rs28.4 billion versus Rs5.4 billion forecast in the
Appraisal Report. Total revenues in the period was on the order of Rsl2l
billion against Rs48 billion in the Appraisal Report reflecting the
considerable increases in both volumes and prices of hydrocarbons over the
appraisal forecasts.
b. Balance Sheet
7.02     The estimated and actual balance sheets as of March 31, 1985 can be
compared as follows:

c. Financial Covenants
7.03     As the main external parameters affecting ONGC's financial
performance are the prices it receives for oil and gas, the most important
financial covenant under the loan required ONGC to carry out on a periodic
basis pricing studies with a view to meeting a 15% discounted cash flow (DCF)
rate of return target for the project and any subsequent major development in-
vestment . At appraisal, the internal rate of return was assessed at 17%,
while the latest es,imate yields 38%. The higher return is due to the
significantly higher production of hydrocarbons now expected from the project,
(oil up 32%, gas 233% and LPG 145%) para. 5.02, coupled with higher producer
prices for oil and gas.  (Current prices are oil $15.0/Bbl equivalent and gas
$87.75 MNM3 equivalent versus $7.80/Bbl and $74.58/MNM respectively at
appraisal).
VII1.    PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
8.01     The Bank's involvement in the Indian petroleum sector started in 1977
and since then, five loans have been made to ONGC totalling about US $1.2
billion. The first two loans were for the development of the Bombay High
oilfield.  The third loan was for exploration, the fourth for offshore gas
development and the fifth was for improving the operations and production from
an existing onshore oil province that is experiencing declining output as the
reservoir are depleted. In all these operations, the Bank has emphasized some
common as well as different objectives. The common thread has been the
financial and institutional strengthening of ONGC, in terms of petroleum
pricing, mobilization of external finance and technical assistance. However,
there were also unique and important objectives under each operation. Under
the exploration project the Bank encouraged the Government to offer
exploration acreage to foreign oil companies and to assist ONCC implement a
reasonable exporation strategy. Under the gas development project, the Bank
sought to accelerate the development and use of the substantial discovered gas
resources, but which were unutilized, in order to substitute for liquid
petroleum products. Finally, under the onshore production improvement
project, the Bank sought to introduce improved and modern operating and
production methods, as well as encourage the production of the discovered but
under-developed heavy oil resources, through technology transfer, technical
training and technical assistance. Thus, while ONGC was the beneficiary of
all the five Bank petroleum operations in India, the loans cannot be
considered as "repeater" projects because they addressed different policy and
operational issues as well as involved completely different facets of ONGC's
operations.
8.02     Relations between the Bank and COI/ONGC have been good throughout the
implementation of the Project. As required, ONGC has sent quarterly progress
reports and annual reports on financial performance and prospects and general
managerial matters. Because of the extensive use of contractors and
consultants which largely contributed to the smooth implementation of the
Project and ONGC's competent performance in project management, the Bank's
supervision effort has been minimal (8.6 staff-weeks/year during FY 1981-
1983). However, as three more petroleum projects were also prepared during
the same period, in addition to one project performance audit on another
petroleum project, the Bank's contact with ONGC and the project has been
substantially more intensive than suggested by the figure given above. Under



- 15 -
an agreement with the OPEC Fund, the Bank staff have also supervised the US $
30.0 million OPEC Fund Loan.
8.03     Possibly the most significant technical contribution of the Bank took
place during project appraisal through the emphasis placed on pressure
maintenance in the Bombay High field. The project covenant on timely water
injection (para. 2.03) and the Bank staff's constant reminders during
implementation have undoubtedly contributed to ONGC's taking timely action on
water injection which proved to be critically urgent in view of recent
reservoir performance (para. 4.04). ONGC has made very good use of the
lessons learned from the First Bombay High Offshore Project, and has
unerringly continued implementing institution-building measures without
outside prodding.
8.04     ONGC and GOI have confirmed that complying with Bank requirements has
not caused particular problems as ONGC's own procedures, in areas such as
procurement, are in many respects similar to those of the Bank. Covenants
agreed to during negotiations have been complied with.
TX.      CONCLUSIONS
9.01     Overall the project was an unqualified success.  It was completed
with minimum delay and essentially witbin budget. The production target was
reached on schedule and was exceeded by a substantial margin at project com-
pletion. In general, the assumptions made at the time of appraisal regarding
reserves, well productivities and costs proved to be on the conservative
side. On the other hand, the adverse effects of weather (i.e., monsoon) on
the construction and well drilling schedules turned out to be underestimated.
9.02     At the time of appraisal it was recognized that the major project
risk was the possibility that the Bombay High Field may not live up to
expectations. Although the field's oil reserves proved to be about 36Z higher
than estimated at appraisal, the performance of the reservoir and the
attainment of a final recovery of the order of 26% still remains to be seen.
So far the production rate from the Bombay High field has been continuously on
the rise, and the future performance of the reservoir under stabilized
production levels is predicated solely on mathematical reservoir simulation.
Given the heterogeneity of the reservoir, actual production performance data
for the next two to three years are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of
the development strategy on which the project was based.
9.03     The observation regarding the necessity of reservoir pressure
maintenance in the Bombay High field proved to be correct. Currently ONGC is
in the process of implementing the initial phase of a water injection scheme
(para. 4.04). ONGC's future efforts will have to concentrate on improving the
water injection process in order to achieve maximum recovery under stabilized
production rates and minimum operating costs. ONGC will also have to start
investigating the potential application of the more advanced enhanced oil
recovery processes in Bombay High, since these processes normally take a long
time from conception to actual implementation. The Bank which has accumulated
substantial experience in enhanced oil recovery projects could assist ONGC's
efforts in this area.

9.04     The project accelerated ONGC's move away from reliance on the
government for external financing. During PY1977-80 ONCC borrowed about $453
million including $150 million from the Bank (Bombay High I), $50 million on
the Eurodollar market and $14 million from the OPEC fund (onlent to ONCC by
GOI). However, slightly over one-half of the borrowings (US $239 million
equivalent) were either directly from the Government or from the Oil Industry
Development Board, a Govcrnment agency. During FY 1981-84 when this Project
was under implementation, ONCC, on their own account borrowed $965 million
from a variety of sources including $630 million from the Eurodollar market,
$44 million from Singapore's Export Credit Investment Corporation, $19 million
from US EXIM, $78 million from Korea EXIM, $20 million from Bankers Trust, $69
million in French Francs (BNP), $23 million equivalent in Deutsche Marks and
$34 million in Yen. In addition, during the same period ONGC negotiated
suppliers credits totalling about $100 million from Japan, Norway and
France. ONGC's borrowing from the Government (and government agencies) during
this period (FY1981-84) was only about US $197 million equivalent, consider-
ably less than the amounts borrowed during FY1977-80. Thus, the Bank's ob-
jective of diversifying ONGC's borrowing sources and decreasing its reliance
on government financial support have been achieved. ONGC's reputation is now
established. Although private capital is still difficult to attract for high
risk exploration ventures, petroleum development projects, particularly off-
shore, in India, are generally attractive to private as well as public finan-
cing. Also, private borrowings have been easier to secure where a major por-
tion of the project costs is covered by World Bank loans.
9.05     Finally, the experience of the First and Second Bombay High projects
have shown that entrusting the construction of project components which are on
the critical path to contractors on the basis of "turnkey contracts" including
detailed engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning could pro-
mote timely project implementation without unnecessarily increasing project
costs. However, in order to receive the full benefits of such an arrangement,
the project entity must be assisted by an experienced engineering group as was
the case of ONGCC and there should be effective planning, coordination and
monitoring of the various activities.
