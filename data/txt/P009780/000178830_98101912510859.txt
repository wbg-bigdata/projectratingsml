I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01      Commercial primary energy (coal, oil, gas, hydro and nuclear)
accounts for about 46% of total supply in India, with the balance (54%)
coming from noncommercial energy (mainly firewood, agricultural and animal
wastes). Coal and hydroelectricity have an important role in meeting
commercial energy requirements and currently account for approximately 70%
of total demand; the consumption of petroleum is relatively low in comparison
with other developing countries and accounts for less than 20% of total demand
for commercial energy. Over the past ten years total energy consumption in
India has been growing at an annual rate of about 4%. Consumption of commercial
energy has been growing faster than that of noncommercial energy (about 5%
p.a.), thus resulting in a steady decline in the share of noncommercial energy
in total energy consumption.
1.02      Despite the low rate of petroleum consumption, the extensive develop-
ment of domestic energy resources such as coal and hydroelectricity, and the
recent development of offshore petroleum resources, the country has not
attained energy self-sufficiency and remains dependent on imported oil to
meet its primary energy requirements. Moreover, in recent years there has
been a growing demand for petroleum products resulting from inefficiencies in
coal production and in power plant utilization. The impact of the increase
in world oil prices after 1973 on India's balance of payments is evident from
the following: while oil imports grew by 17% (3 million tons) from 1972/73
to 1979/80, the cost of imports rose by some 2,200% from $265 million in
1972/73 to about US$1.5 billion in 1975/76, US$4.0 billion in 1979/80, and an
estimated US$6 billion in 1980/81, equivalent to more than 60% of India's
estimated export earnings. Domestic energy resources such as coal and hydro-
electricity are large enough to supply most of India's future commercial
energy requirements, particularly for industry and power generation. However,
known oil and gas resources would not be sufficient to meet the demand for
oil in sectors where further substitution by other fuels is not possible
(transportation and residential). Therefore, the exploration for new, and
development of existing, petroleum reserves is one of India-s most pressing
priorities.
1.03      Although the potential for oil and gas is significant, India is
largely unexplored, and known oil and gas reserves do not yield a production
large enough to meet India's needs. In 1979/80 over 36% of total consumption
was met from local production while the remainder (16.2 million tons of
crude oil and 4.5 million of refined products) had to be imported. Current
projections indicate that the high cost of petroleum imports will remain a
serious constraint to economic development unless new reserves are discovered
in the near future to compensate for the depletion of existing production and
to meet anticipated growth in demand.



- 2 -
1.04      It is against this background that India is now making a concerted
effort to attract foreign oil exploration companies to help explore for oil
both onshore and offshore, an initiative which has generated considerable
interest within the international petroleum industry (para. 2.09). The
success of these efforts, together with an active exploration program by
ONGC, over the next three to four years will be a key factor in determining
whether indigenous crude oil supplies can be increased sufficiently above
current forecasts to meet the anticipated growth in demand during the present
decade.
Energy Consumption
1.05      In 1975/76 (the last year for which overall consumption figures
are available), energy consumption in India was 254.5 million tons of coal
equivalent. The breakdown by energy source can be summarized as follows:

The household sector accounts for a relatively small share of commercial
energy consumption (6% of coal, 20% of petroleum and 9% of electricity).
However, consumption of noncommercial energy in this sector is high, partic-
ularly in the rural areas where electricity and kerosene are mostly used for
lighting. Although the substitution of commercial energy for noncommercial
energy will continue, noncommercial energy should remain a significant source
of supply for households well into the next century. Measures are urgently
needed to maintain and even increase production of noncommercial sources
(particularly firewood), improve the efficiency of cooking stoves and explore
alternative sources of energy.
1.07      Energy needs in agriculture are mainly for land preparation, water
lifting and transportation; as such they are met mostly by animal power or by
the use of liquid fuels (mainly diesel) and electricity. Commercial energy
consumption in agriculture has been growing rapidly since 1970/71 (about 20%
p.a. for oil products and 7.2% p.a. for electricity), reflecting the efforts
made to modernize the agricultural sector. However part of this growth may
also be attributed to low electricity tariffs which may have encouraged the
use of inefficient equipment and to the increased use of tractors for trans-
portation because of the relatively low price of diesel oil compared to
gasoline. This trend towards commercial energy in agriculture will continue
unless efforts are made to improve the efficiency of irrigation pumps and
tractors, and pricing policies/regulations are introduced to encourage energy
efficiency and conservation.
1.08      The industrial sector is by far the largest user of coal and elec-
tricity. In 1978/79 the industrial sector accounted for 73% of coal consump-
tion (excluding power generation) and for 64% of electricity consumption.



- 4 -
In contrast to most developed and developing countries the share of industry
in total oil consumption is very low and has been declining (6% of total oil
consumption in 1978/79 compared to 11% in 1970/71) as a result of a deliberate
policy to substitute domestic coal for oil wherever feasible. Over the past
twenty years the energy intensity of the industrial sector has increased from
1.86 to 2.40 million tons of coal equivalent per billion rupees of value
added. This was due primarily to the increased use of electricity. In
the future it is expected that the growth of energy consumption in industry
will slow as a result of better capacity utilization, GOI policies to
encourage decentralized industrial development and use of appropriate techno-
logies. The future industrial demand for energy is difficult to predict
since the sector has been affected by recurrent shortages and recent trends
therefore may not be representative. In addition, part of the industrial
plant was built when energy was relatively cheap, and less attention was paid
to energy efficiency. It is believed that there is a considerable potential
for energy savings in the industrial sector by improving the efficiency of
existing plant and equipment, by improving the design and location of future
plants, and by introducing energy efficiency standards.
1.09       The transport sector is the largest user of petroleum products and
the second largest user of coal. Over the past twenty years the structure
of demand has changed considerably as a result of the rapid growth of road
transport and of the substitution of diesel-electrics for steam locomotives
(in 1978/79 oil accounted for 66% of the commercial energy consumed in the
sector compared to 25% in 1960/61; the share of electricity remains small).
Current projections in the transport sector indicate continuing decline
in coal usage, as railways continue to shift to more efficient diesel, and a
growing demand for petroleum products and electricity. The transport sector
represents an area where significant energy savings, especially in petroleum
products, could be achieved over time if measures were taken to encourage the
use of railways for long distance freight and passenger hauls, to improve the
efficiency of road vehicles (mainly trucks), and to optimize the location of
industrial plants.
1.10       In 1978/79 the power sector used about 44 million tons of coal
equivalent of primary energy of which 47% came from hydroelectric and nuclear
plants, 47% from coal and 6% from oil. Over the past ten years the share of
coal in thermal generation has fluctuated between 85% and 90% and this is
expected to continue in the future. The share of hydro and nuclear energy
has varied between 43% and 50%. It is expected that by 1987/88 the consump-
tion of oil in the power sector will be limited to what is required to ensure
the efficient operation of coal-fired plants. Total electricity consumption
has been growing at an average of 7.2% p.a. between 1970/71 and 1978/79, a
rate significantly lower than previously. However, the growth in demand of
electricity has accelerated recently to reach 11% in 1976/77 and 16% in
1978/79. As the power shortages which developed during the 1970s demon-
strated, the growth of demand for electricity has been and will continue
to be supply constrained.

Energy Resources
1.11      Coal constitutes the main domestic source of commercial energy
in India. Coal reserves to a depth of 600 m and of seam thickness of more
than 1.2 m are currently estimated at 85.4 billion tons, of which 17.9 billion
tons are of the coking variety and 67.5 billion tons of the noncoking variety.
The Geological Survey of India has recently estimated that an additional
26.1 billion tons of coal deposits exist at depths below 600 m. According to
current demand forecasts, India's coal resources should be sufficient to meet
the expected demand for about 100 to 140 years.
1.12      From 1953/54 to 1970/71 the share of coal in commercial primary
energy supply has declined from 80% to about 60%, while production increased
from 34 million tons to about 65 million tons. Since 1970/71 the share of
coal has remained constant as production has been growing at an average
annual rate of 5.5% (to 104 million metric tons in 1979/80). Despite the
production increases, shortages developed in 1977/78--reaching an estimated
8 million tons in 1979/80. The main reasons for the shortfalls are poor
capacity utilization due to a reduced and erratic power supply, shortages of
explosives, floods, labor problems, and bottlenecks in the transportation and
distribution systems.
1.13      India's hydroelectric potential is estimated to be 100,000 MW, of
which two thirds is estimated to be economically exploitable. About 11,000
MW is already developed (one third of the total installed generating capacity),
4,700 MW is scheduled for commissioning by 1984, and a further 23,000 MW is
under study for development. Some 70% of the total hydroelectric potential
is in the north and northeast. India also has sufficient reserves of uranium
(34,000 tons equivalent of U 0   of which 15,000 tons is considered economic-
ally exploitable at current  nternational prices) and thorium to meet the
foreseeable requirements of its nuclear power program.
1.14      India's remaining ultimately recoverable reserves of oil and gas
are currently estimated at 6.5 billion tons of oil equivalent as shown below:
Remaining Ultimately Recoverable Reserves
(million tons of oil equivalent)
Oil             Gas             Total
Onshore              500            1,800            2,300
Offshore           1,000            3,200            4,200
Total       1,500             5,000            6,500
Source: ONGC.
These estimates are derived from a geological survey carried out by a joint
Soviet/Indian team. Of these, proven recoverable reserves are about 360
million tons of oil equivalent, of which 294 million tons are oil and 66
million tons are gas. Over 60% of the recoverable oil reserves are offshore.



- 6 -
1.15      Domestic oil production has increased from 0.5 million tons in
1961 to 12.5 million tons in 1979 and currently meets about 40% of India's
internal requirements. Gas production is currently estimated at about
2 million tons of oil equivalent, of which about half is used as fuel or
feedstock, and about half is flared mainly because there is no market to
use it within reasonable distance.
1.16      Renewable energy represents a large, but declining, share of India-s
energy supplies. Wood, charcoal, dung, and vegetable wastes made up an esti-
mated 44% of total energy consumption in 1975/76. The remainder is provided
by hydroelectric power. Renewable energy (especially traditional fuels) will
continue to play an important though decreasing role in rural energy supplies,
particularly if the growth in rural consumption of oil products is to be
contained. The main constraint to the development of renewable energy appears
to be institutional, reflecting the large size and wide distribution of
India's rural population. A sizeable education program would therefore be
required to inform rural populations of new technologies.
Energy Prospects
1.17      Several studies of India-s future energy demand and supply alter-
natives have been carried out by various agencies and committees. The most
comprehensive is the Report of the Working Group on Energy Policy (WGEP),
published in 1979, which assesses (i) whether the availability of energy
may become a serious constraint to India's economic development; and (ii) what
would be the likely impact of an active energy conservation program on India's
future energy balances. Although WGEP recognizes the limitations of such
an exercise, which was based on existing data, it does conclude that:
(i)  commercial energy availability may become a serious
constraint to economic development, either because
domestic resources would be insufficient to meet
the anticipated demand or because the effort required
to develop domestic resources would imply human and
financial resources which are not likely to be
available;
(ii)  a coordinated and all-encompassing energy conservation/
demand management program would have a significant impact
beyond the late 1980s and could possibly reduce commercial
energy demand by as much as 20% (the main reductior being
in the demand for power generation and in the demand for
petroleum and petroleum products across the entire economy,
but especially in the transport sector); and
(iii)  the most critical aspect of India-s future energy policy
will be to contain (within economic limits) the demand
for oil at as low a level as possible. WGEP's estimates
indicate that the import cost of oil by the year 2000
could be as high as US$27 billion (in 1980 dollars, based
on oil prices of US$32/Bbl).

1.18      The Working Group on Energy Policy has studied two demand/supply
scenarios: (i) a Reference Level Forecast (RLF) which is based on the
continuation of past trends and which assumes that no deliberate measures
will be taken to promote energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution
beyond what is currently done; and (ii) an Optimal Level Forecast (OLF)
which assumes that further steps will be taken to promote energy conservation,
to improve energy efficiency and to encourage the development of alternative
energy resources. The two demand/supply scenarious are summarized below:
1979/80      1987/88         2000/2001
Actual     RLF    OLF       RLF     OLF
Coal (million tons) a/            68.8      131.5  129.0    308.0   266.0
Oil (million tons) a/ b/           21.7      33.4   30.4      74.2    54.8
Electricity (billion kWh)          84.4     191.2  173.6    471.0   395.6
a/   Excluding quantities used for power generation.
b/   Excluding nonenergy use (fertilizers, etc.).
The policy measures it recommends to achieve the Optimal Level Forecast are:
(i) improvement in the efficiency of energy utilization; (ii) introduction
of fuel-efficient technologies; (iii) reduction of transportation demand
through an improved planning of production and consumption locations;
(iv) reduction of the energy intensity of industries; and (v) inter-fuel
substitution from commercial energy to noncommercial and renewable energy.
The Working Group considers that such measures, supplemented by appropriate
pricing policies, would permit India to reduce commercial energy consumption
without affecting economic growth. It is hoped that the elasticity of energy
to GDP would decline from 1.8 today to 0.90 by 1992. The energy savings
measures outlined above--supported by detailed implementation plans and an
appropriate pricing policy--would substantially reduce waste and improve
energy availability in the medium and the long run. In its recommendations,
the Working Group has also emphasized the need to plan and update development
programs in the energy sector on a continuous basis and has suggested to GOI
that consideration be given to the creation of a Ministry of Energy in charge
of the whole energy sector.l/   Such recommendations are worthy of support, in
particular when it comes to the identification of least-cost alternatives in
meeting India's future energy requirements and the implementation of effec-
tive demand management policies.
1.19      However, equally bold policies are needed to tackle the current
bottlenecks in the area of energy production. In the short term there is
an urgent need to improve capacity utilization in the coal and power sectors.
But persistence of capacity underutilization in these sectors over the
years points to the fact that the problems are deep-rooted and will take
time to overcome. In the longer term, the Government will have to allocate
significant resources for the development of its commercial energy resources
particularly with regard to coal (to provide for a fourfold increase in

the Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers, and the Ministry
of Energy and Coal (in charge of electric power and coal).

production during the next twenty years), and power (the Optimal Level
Forecast projects an almost fivefold increase in overall demand for
electricity during the next twenty years). Despite the relatively small
share of oil in overall energy consumption (para. 1.05), its significant
impact on the balance of payments will compel India to divert increased
resources to accelerate the development of India's indigenous oil and
gas reserves, as well as to increase petroleum exploration. This is
reviewed in more detail in the next chapter.
II. THE OIL AND GAS SUBSECTOR
Institutional Aspects
2.01      The major institutions in the subsector are the Oil and Natural
Gas Commission (ONGC) (a public sector undertaking), Oil India Limited (OIL)
(presently owned fifty-fifty by GOI and Burmah Oil, but in the process of
being fully nationalized) and the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) (a public
sector undertaking). Both ONGC and OIL are engaged in exploration for
and development of hydrocarbon resources. IOC handles all of India's crude
oil imports, and distributes imported oil products in addition to those
produced by its own refineries. With the exception of the small Assam
Oil Company (Burmah Oil) refinery, all refineries are now in the public
sector.
2.02      ONGC is by far the largest undertaking in the area of oil explora-
tion and development. Initially part of the Geological Survey of India, it
became an independent statutory commission in 1959. ONGC made discoveries
onshore in the 1960s (Assam and Gujarat) and moved offshore in the mid-1970s
to discover the giant field of Bombay High; it is currently active in explora-
tion both onshore and offshore. ONGC is the principal entity through which
GOI intends to explore for and develop hydrocarbon resources. ONGC's organi-
zation is reviewed in Chapter V.
2.03      Oil India Limited's activities are restricted to a small producing
area in Assam, and a small onshore/offshore concession (the Mahanadi basin).
2.04      The Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers is in charge
of policy making in the petroleum sector. It monitors activities in the
oil and gas sector closely and, inter alia, has to vet all the programs
and budgets suggested by ONGC. The Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB),
a public body created in 1974, provides financing to oil undertakings for high
priority projects. Its only source of revenues is a cess levied on domestic
oil and gas production. As of March 31, 1980, it had lent to ONGC Rs 1.8
billion (equivalent to 60% of its total loans extended until that time). Map
IBRD 15207 indicates the main features of India's oil and gas sector.



-9-
Exploration and Development
2.05      The onshore 2sedimentary basins of India occupy an area of approxi-
mately 1.4 2million km . The offshore sedimentary basins have an a ea of
250,000 km to a water depth of 100 m, and an additional 70,000 km to a water
depth of 200 m. So far, commercial production has been established in only
two sedimentary basins: the Assam-Arakan basin occupying parts of Assam and
extending to Nagaland, Meghalya, Tripura, Manipur and Mizoram in the eastern
part of the country, and the Cambay basin in Gujarat with its extension, the
Bombay Offshore. As mentioned in para. 1.14, India-s prognostic 1/ recoverable
hydrocarbon reserves were recently estimated at 6.5 billion tons, of which
approximately two-thirds lie offshore. Proven and probable reserves of oil
initially in place in existing deposits were estimated at 1.6 billion tons as
of January 1978, of which 0.9 billion tons are offshore.
2.06      In view of the continuing rise in oil prices, GOI has requested
ONGC to accelerate the development of its offshore fields. ONGC's program is
reviewed in paras. 3.02-3.04. Unless it discovers oil, OIL is not expected
to engage in development work at a significant level.
2.07      With the exception of Oil India and ChemoComplex (Hungary) which
drilled a well onshore in 1978, and of Natomas (US), Reading & Bates (US)
and Assamera (Canada) which obtained three exploration licenses offshore in
the early 1970s, ONGC has conducted all the exploration in India in the past
few years. Onshore, ONGC accelerated its exploration effort in 1978/79.
As of March 1979 thirty-two land rigs were in operation for exploration and
development drilling and some seventy-five wells were drilled in 1978/79.
Current plans call for about one hundred wells per year by 1982/83. While
most of the onshore operations have so far been confined to relatively shallow
drilling, ONGC is now in the process of launching a deep drilling program
which would require the acquisition of new, more sophisticated rigs of greater
capacity (up to 6,000 m). ONGC recently signed a protocol with the USSR for
exploration in two areas (Tripura and West Bengal). Three wells to at least
16,000 ft (5,300 m) are expected to be drilled in each block. At present
ONGC has five active rigs offshore. During 1978 and 1979 offshore explora-
tion increased to approximately twenty-five exploratory wells drilled,
resulting in several commercial discoveries in the Bombay High area. In early
1980, significant oil and gas shows were encountered in the Bay of Bengal
(Godavari Basin) and near the Andaman Islands. These discoveries which should
be appraised in the near future may open up new promising areas for explora-
tion.   ONGC has also developed a large program of geophysical and geochemical
investigations in most of the prospective offshore areas, but more particu-
larly offshore Kerala, Godavari and the Andaman Islands.
1/   Prognostic estimates of reserves should be considered with caution, as
they are based on a large number of assumptions. They should only be
considered as a broad indication of the total oil resources in the
country.



- 10 -
2.08      On a more modest scale, OIL drilled nineteen wells in 1978, of
which two were deep wells, and planned to drill twenty-eight wells in 1979.
In the next five years OIL is planning to drill 122 wells in the northeast.
In 1978, OIL received an offshore concession; one well was drilled in early
1980, and a second is expected to be drilled shortly.
2.09      Given the size of the prospective areas onshore and offshore, it
would be unrealistic to expect ONGC and OIL to carry the exploration burden
alone, particularly at a time when, the need is immediate to identify new
domestic oil and gas supplies. GOI has recently indicated its interest
in securing the participation of international oil companies in the country's
exploration activities and is in the process of prequalifying interested oil
companies. The response so far has been encouraging as about thirty-five
companies, which could be considered serious candidates, have approached ONGC.
The implications of this new policy (India had not recently encouraged foreign
exploration) are far reaching and a large amount of preparation is now
required to select the location and size of blocks, to determine the type of
contract that would be most suitable, and to effectively negotiate with oil
companies.
2.10      While the participation of foreign oil companies would accelerate
exploration, it is unlikely that the first wells could be drilled until
1982/83 after the necessary geophysical surveys have been carried out and
the results interpreted. It is therefore imperative that both ONGC and
OIL continue their effort begun in 1978/79.  ONGC's investment plan for the
next five years indicates that exploration expenditures will increase from
US$130 million in 1981 to about US$265 million in 1985. Total exploration
expenditures (excluding the purchase of rigs) would total US$1 billion of
which about 40% would be offshore. Exploration expenditures would account for
about 20% of ONGC's total capital expenditures. This allocation of ONGC's
resources appears adequate in light of the involvement of foreign oil
companies, which are more likely to be interested in offshore exploration,
and in light of ONGC's absorptive capacity.

2.12      The salient feature of the demand for oil products in India is
the relative importance of middle distillates which accounted for 65% of all
petroleum products used for energy in 1979/80. Middle distillates consumption
has been growing rapidly--particularly diesel oil, reflecting the rapid growth
of road transport, modernization of agriculture and conversion to diesel-
electric railways. Kerosene consumption, which had been growing at a rate of
about 5% p.a. until 1970/71, has remained almost constant because of signifi-
cant price increases in the mid-1970s. Current forecasts indicate that the
share of middle distillates in total consumption will continue to remain
high, and therefore it is likely that additional hydro-cracking capacity in
the refineries will be required.
Oil Production and Supply
2.13      Supply of crude oil in past years and a corresponding forecast appear
at Annex 2.2 and can be summarized as follows:

a/   One ton of products is equivalent to 1.0638 tons of crude oil.
Source:  Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers and
Bank Staff Estimates.
As the above table indicates, while the demand for oil has been growing
steadily, the production of domestic crude has been increasing at a greater
pace. The bulk of the increased production in the 1970s is attributable
to Bombay High: from negligible amounts in 1970/71 to 4.2 million tons in
1979/80, or 36% of total domestic production. Although the index of self-
reliance could reach 46% in 1984/85, unless new discoveries are made it would
decline again in subsequent years.
2.14      The installed refining capacity of India is approximately 30 million
tons, but an additional 7 million tons of capacity is expected to come on
stream during 1981. The relatively high level of product imports reflects the
current shortage of refining capacity. India's refineries are becoming more
sophisticated with each addition to capacity: they are able to use a wider
range of crude oil feedstocks and can tailor the product mix more closely to
local demand. Plans for new refineries and expansions of existing ones are
now under consideration.
Supply/Demand Outlook
2.15      Known oil fields are expected to be capable of producing the follow-
ing quantities in 1984/85:

Subtotal             9.0
Total               23.0
This compares with a future demand for crude oil estimated by the Working
Group at approximately 35.4 million tons in 1982/83, and 44.6 million tons
(Reference Level Forecast) or 41.0 million tons (Optimal Level Forecast) in
1987/88. Considering past trends, these forecasts appear to be on the low
side and a forecast of some 45 million tons by 1984/85 does not seem unreal-
istic (Annex 2.2) if the demand is to be met in full (there have been serious
shortages, particularly in the late 1970s). In any event, unless new and
important discoveries are made, India will have to resort to growing imports
of oil.
Pricing Policies
2.16      India has consistently followed a policy of maintaining retail
prices of oil products at international levels, with a cross-subsidy from
gasoline towards kerosene (on social grounds) and naphtha (for fertilizers).
This policy of rapidly increasing prices explains in part the fact that
gasoline consumption has remained virtually unchanged over the past ten
years, and the very slow growth in kerosene consumption (1.8% per annum).
Most of the growth in consumption has been for diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel
oil, where demand is less sensitive to price. Prices, last increased in
June 1980, are as follows for the main products:

a/   Based on crude oil at US$32/barrel, factored by recent ratios of crude
oil prices to product prices in the Far East.
b/   Prices in New Delhi, about average for India.
Crude oil and its products constitute substantial sources of revenues to GOI
and State Governments. In 1978/79 GOI received through excise duties, customs
duties, corporate income taxes, dividends, cess and royalties altogether
Rs 17.3 billion (US$2.1 billion). In addition State Governments levied a
sales tax, but overall proceeds are not known.
2.17      Domestic crude oil is sold by the producer at Government-regulated
prices which are substantially below international levels. Such low transfer
prices (para. 6.04) do not act as a disincentive to invest in oil exploration
or development, as the major producers are in the public sector and operating
decisions are based upon the international price of oil.
Role of the Bank
2.18      Most of the Bank's energy lending to India so far has been in the
power sector. In 1977, the Bank made a loan of US$150 million (Loan 1473-IN)
towards Phase III of the Bombay High Offshore Development. When the loan was
made, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission was relatively inexperienced in
offshore programs and lacked experienced technical staff to handle such
projects. ONGC, by attracting competent personnel, by introducing appro-
priate training programs, and with the support of Bank advice on technical
and managerial matters, is implementing the project successfully (ONGC's
performance is reviewed in para. 3.09).
2.19      With ONGC becoming increasingly involved in offshore operations,
the Bank can continue to play an important institution-building role, by
providing advice as needed and by ensuring that development projects are
subjected to thorough feasibility studies and are carried out using the
highest standards of the industry.
2.20      ONGC is about to embark on the development 3of the major South
Bassein gas field capable of producing 18 million Nm /d of free (i.e.
nonassociated) gas over twenty years to supply new fertilizer plants and
petrochemical plants. While consumption of gas is today insignificant



- 15 -
in the overall energy picture, gas will play an increasingly important role
in meeting India's future energy and feedstock needs. The Bank is cooperat-
ing with GOI and ONGC to ensure that the development of the South Bassein gas
field is carried out in an optimal fashion, and that GOI and ONGC prepare the
basis for a longer term gas resource strategy in order to maximize the
benefits of this new source of energy to the economy.
2.21      Another area where the Bank can now assist GOI and ONGC relates to
oil exploration. Until recently, GOI's policy regarding foreign oil companies
had been hesitant, and not encouraging to the oil industry. The Government has
recently announced a major policy change in this regard, and intends to enter
into oil exploration agreements with foreign oil companies. The Bank is now
providing assistance in this respect, in particular regarding (i) Government
approach to negotiations with foreign oil companies; (ii) contractual matters
(model contracts); and (iii) monitoring (probably by ONGC) of the oil companies
exploration and development activities after permits have been awarded.
2.22      In view of the considerable impact on the economy of increasing
oil prices, an important priority remains the acceleration of production
from existing fields, essentially Bombay High. This is the purpose of the
proposed Project. By giving financial support to this priority Project,
the Bank will strengthen its existing relationship with ONGC, help GOI
meet the substantial foreign exchange requirements entailed by offshore
development projects, and, most importantly, help alleviate the substantial
drain on foreign exchange reserves by reducing the need to import oil at
ever increasing prices.
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Introduction
3.01      ONGC prepares annually a five-year rolling plan which sets out
investment strategies for exploration and development, onshore and offshore.
The plan is reviewed, and modified as necessary, by the Ministry of Petroleum,
Chemicals and Fertilizers.
The Five-Year Program
3.02      The 1981-85 plan was reviewed by the Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals,
and Fertilizers in June 1980. It calls for investments amounting to Rs 39.9
billion (US$4.7 billion) over the next five years, as follows:

3.03      The above plan represents a significant overall increase in ONGC's
investments since, in the previous five-year period (1976-80), total invest-
ments were Rs 11,724 million (US$ 1,396 million). The bulk of the increase
can be attributed to development activities offshore and to increased explora-
tion programs. In this regard it reflects the high priority given to an
acceleration of domestic oil production and exploration activities. At the
same time, it reflects ONGC's internal implementation constraints, partic-
ularly in its offshore operations, and the current worldwide difficulties in
obtaining offshore drilling rigs. The plan is reviewed at Annex 3.1 of this
report.
3.04      Of the Rs 19.6 billion allocated for offshore development,
Rs 13.6 billion would be directed to the continuation of the Bombay High
field development. The Bombay High field constitutes the largest oil field
discovered in India.
Main Characteristics of the Bombay High Field
3.05      The Bombay High field is located some 160 km west-northwest of
Bombay in the Arabian Sea at a water depth of 80 m. It is on the largest
structure identified during a seismic survey conducted in 1966. The discovery
well was drilled in 1974. Map 15183 shows the location of the field.
3.06      The sedimentary series of the area is formed by a thick shale
sequence of Tertiary to recent age, with substantial limestone intervals
and minor sand development. Each limestone or sand section is a potential
reservoir interval, and some show significant hydrocarbon impregnation. In
the Bombay High field, the L-III limestone unit of the Miocene is the main
reservoir.



- 17 -
3.07      The Bombay High structure is defined by 3,000 km of seismic lines,
and data from some forty wells are available. Since the inception of oil
production in May 1976, extensive reservoir and production data were collected
and analyzed by Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (CFP), which has been ONGC's
reservoir consultant on Bombay High since 1977. The latest estimate of the
L-III reserves is given below:
Oil in Place       Gas in Place
(million tons)      (billion Nm )
Proven plus probable                 896                91.4
Possible                             344                 2.6
Total         1,240                94.0
The reserves of Bombay High, and the production forecasts are examined
in Annex 3.2.
3.08      Of the 896 million tons of proven plus probable reserves of oil
in place, 11% or some 98.6 million tons are estimated to be recoverable by
primary production over twenty years.  Water injection for pressure main-
tenance would increase the expected oil recovery over the same period to 19%
or 170.2 million tons 1/. Slightly more than half of the proven plus probable
reserves of the L-III reservoir (453 million tons) are located in the as-yet-
undeveloped central and southern areas of the Bombay High field.
The Bombay High Development Program
3.09      The Bombay High field development program prepared by ONGC calls
for the development of the field in five phases. Phases I and II, completed
in late 1977, consist of the construction of production facilities, such as
production platforms, interconnecting subsea pipelines, the installation of
a single buoy mooring (SBM) system and the drilling of development wells
required to reach a production capacity of 80,000 Bbl/d (4 million tons/year).
Phase III was approved by the Government in May 1977 and consists of the
drilling of twenty-four development wells and the construction of six well
platforms to reach a production of 140,000 Bbl/d (7 million tons/year) as
well as the construction of two processing platforms, two pipelines, each 200
km long, for oil and gas transport to the shore, shore facilities at Uran for
the pipelines landfall and at Nhava Sheva for the supply base. The Bank
made a US$150 million loan in FY 1977 (Loan 1473-IN) for Phase III. A
two-year delay was caused by a major shift in priorities (development of the
North Bassein field was postponed on account of lower than anticipated
reserves), changes in production targets, and delays in construction
(major facilities, to be commissioned before the 1980 monsoon, could not
be completed as scheduled, mostly because of delays in equipment delivery
and construction). The Project will be substantially completed,
1/   Since production began, and until March 31, 1980, Bombay ligh has
produced 9.9 million tons of crude oil and 559 million Nm of gas.



- 18 -
and all the facilities commissioned, by the end of 1980. ONGC's performance
has been satisfactory, particularly if one takes into account the fact that it
had virtually no experience in offshore projects only five years ago.
3.10      Phase IV consists of the drilling of forty-four production wells,
the construction of ten wellhead platforms (two in the northern and eight in
the southern area) and one major processing platform with separate living
quarters platform, the installation of the required subsea pipelines, the
expansion of the crude stabilization and storage facilities at Uran, and the
extension of the telemetry and telecontrol facilities to reach a production
potential of 240,000 Bbl/d (12 million tons/year) by mid-1982. Phase V
consists of the installation of water injection facilities required in order
to maintain optimum production rates and to increase ultimate oil recovery.
Currently only an "advance action" program for Phase V consisting of five
production platforms together with twenty development wells has been finalized
pending results of engineering studies now in progress.
3.11      The entire program up to and including Phase V (advance action) is
estimated to cost US$1,658 million, of which US$204 million is for Phases I
and II, US$631 million for Phase III, US$647 million for Phase IV and
US$176 million for Phase V (advance action). No definite cost estimates
are yet available for the entire Phase V.
The Project
3.12      The project comprises Phases IV and V (advance action) of ONGC's
Bombay High development program. The main objective of the project is: to
complete the development of the southern and central areas of the Bombay
High field in order to achieve a plateau production potential of 240,000
Bbl/d (12 million tons/year) by mid-1982.
3.13      The detailed project description appears at Annex 3.3, and can be
summarized as follows:
(a) Development Drilling. Sixty-four directional development
wells, each approximately 1,400 m deep, will be drilled in
the Bombay High field and completed in the L-III reservoir,
using jack-up drilling rigs. Eight of the development wells
will be drilled in the northern area, and the remaining
fifty-six in the central and southern areas. About sixty
of the wells will be directionally drilled with a horizontal
drift from the surface location of 1,400 m to ensure the
development of the field according to a 2 km x 2 km five-spot
pattern.



- 19 -
(b) Well Platforms. Fifteen well platforms will be constructed
and installed in the Bombay High field. Two of the platforms
will be located in the northern area of the field and thirteen
in the central and southern areas. These will be simple
four-leg steel structures with decks to carry wellhead
assemblies, wellhead panels, flowlines and manifolds.
(c)  Processing Platform - Bombay High South (BHS).  One three-deck,
eight-leg processing platform with 180,000 Bbl/d capacity,
similar in design and function to the existing Bombay High
North (BHN) platform, will be constructed and installed in
80 m of water near the existing SA platform in the central
atea. The processing platform will have facilities for the
separation of oil, water and gas, oily water treating, main
oil pumps, gas handling and compression, telecommunications,
telemetry and telecontrol. It will be connected by bridges
to SA, the living quarters platforms, and at a later date,
to a water injection platform.
(d) Living Quarters Platform. For safety reasons and following
the practice adopted in the North Sea, personnel working
in the BHS complex will be accommodated in a separate
living quarters platform to be installed near, and bridge-
connected to, BHS. The living quarters platform will be a
four-leg, two-deck structure with facilities to accommodate
124 workers.
(e) Subsea Pipelines. Approximately 133 km of subsea flow
lines varying in diameter from 8" to 20" will be installed
to connect the well platforms to the processing platform
BHS, and the processing platform to the existing oil and gas
trunk lines from Bombay High to Uran.
(f)  Expansion of Shore Facilities.  One 60,000 m  cone roof
tank and one 90,000 Bbl/d train of crude stabilization
facilities, along with necessary utilities, will be added
to those under construction at Uran.
(g) Extension of Telemetry and Telecontrol. Telemetry and
telecontrol facilities which were introduced in the produc-
tion facilities as part of the Phase III development program
will be extended to cover the additional wells and platforms
included in the project.

(h) Engineering, Technical Services and Reservoir Consultancy.
Consultants to prepare engineering designs and bid documents,
supervise construction and assist ONGC in overall project
management. CFP has been contracted until April 1981 to
assist ONGC in monitoring reservoir performance and in
designing and implementing the water injection program.
Engineering and Construction
3.14      CFP (France) has been engaged by ONGC since 1977 to carry out
reservoir engineering studies of the Bombay High reservoir, with a view to
optimizing its future production. Phases IV and V of the development of
Bombay High result from the conceptual studies carried out by CFP, which
were independently confirmed by ONGC's reservoir specialists.
3.15      Detailed engineering, design, and tendering for the well platforms
are being carried out by Engineers India Limited (EIL). EIL initially used a
foreign consultant (Crest, US) as back-up for similar platforms, but now has
gained sufficient experience in this type of work, which can be substantiated
by the successful completion of several platforms without external assistance.
As all the well platforms have the same basic design, this arrangement is
satisfactory.
3.16      With regard to the major Bombay High South processing platform and
the living quarters platform, EIL has already contracted Fluor (US) as back-up
designer.
3.17      With regard to the Uran terminal, EIL is the main consultant, with
Kellogg (US) as back-up for the LPG plant. Peter Frankel and Partners (UK)
are the consulting engineers for the Nhava Sheva supply base. The extension
of the telemetry and control facilities will be carried out under the advice
of the Electronics Commission, Radar and Communications Project (a public
sector enterprise), which has performed satisfactorily for ONGC in the past.
These arrangements are satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that ONGC will continue to use consultants, whose experience and
terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Bank to assist
in designs engineering, preparation of bidding documents and supervision of
construction of BHS and the living quarters platform.
3.18      With the exception of six well platforms to be constructed by Mazagon
Docks Ltd (MDL), all other contracts for offshore facilities (platforms, subsea
pipeline construction and laying and platforms erection) are expected to be
awarded to reputable foreign contractors and manufacturers. MDL, a public
sector entity, started the assembly of simple well platforms in 1979 under
the supervision of EIL and foreign consultants. Several platforms built by
MDL have already been commissioned, and are now producing satisfactorily.
In the future MDL is expected to supply three to four platforms a year.



- 21 -
Execution
3.19      The ONGC unit in charge of offshore operations is called the Bombay
Offshore Project (BOP) (BOP's organization is described in para. 5.05). The
Offshore Operations Division and the Engineering and Construction Division of
the BOP will be responsible for project implementation and supervision with
the assistance of outside consultants, as described above, and ONGC's support-
ing services. The Operations Division, which will supervise and coordinate
development drilling, is qualified and sufficiently staffed to supervise
drilling contractors and manage the operations of the ONGC-owned offshore
drilling units. The staff of the Engineering and Construction Division is
competent and adequate to meet the workload generated by the project. By
appointing "project managers" for each activity (platforms, pipelines, etc.),
BOP has been able to cope with a continuously increasing workload and is
expected to perform satisfactorily.
Implementation Schedule
3.20      The project would be constructed over a period of approximately
two years, with the major portion of the offshore facilities being com-
missioned in May 1982 before the onset of the monsoon (Annex 3.4 shows the
proposed implementation schedule). All the well platforms will be completed
before November 1982, enabling ONGC to produce approximately 100,000 Bbl/d
from the southern area wells. The construction schedule is prepared on the
basis of ONGC's experience in Phase III of the Bombay High Development Project.
It is tight, but achievable. 1/
Estimated Cost
3.21      The total project cost is estimated at US$823.2 million, including
contingencies and the customs duties on equipment and materials to be
imported for the expansion of the Uran facilities (offshore facilities are
exempted from customs duty). The foreign exchange component is estimated at
US$722.1 million, or 88% of total cost. The detailed cost estimate appears
in Annex 3.5 and can be summarized as follows:
1/   By early 1981, contracts totalling approximately US$350 million
would be awarded.

Development drilling costs were derived from ONGC's historical costs in the
Bombay High field and reflect conditions likely to prevail in the next two
to three years. The costs of well platforms, the processing platform (BHS),
the living quarters platform, and subsea pipelines are based on bids recently
received. The cost for the expansion of the Uran shore facilities is based on
estimates prepared by EIL. The overall cost of engineering services has been
based on 10% of the base cost of the project (excluding reservoir consultancy



- 23 -
services which is a lump-sum contract); the average cost per man-month is
estimated at US$10,000 and US$1,500 for foreign and local consultants,
respectively. In view of the advanced status of engineering, an overall
physical contingency of 10% was applied to the total base cost, excluding
reservoir consultancy charges, for which the cost has been fixed in the
ongoing CFP technical assistance contract. The base cost estimate is
expressed in October 1980 prices. Price contingencies were calculated
assuming an annual rate of escalation of 5.25% in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in
1982, and 7% in subsequent years for material, equipment and civil works. 1/
Items Proposed for Bank Financing
3.22      The proposed Bank loan of US$400.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of (I) under Phase IV, (i) BHS processing platform complex
including the living quarters platform and subsea oil and gas pipeline
connections to the existing trunk lines, and (ii) three well platforms and
subsea connecting pipelines and (II) under Phase V (advance action), three
well platforms together with subsea pipelines. These contracts are suitable
for international competitive bidding. The cost of items proposed to be
financed by the Bank can be estimated as follows:

Financing Plan
3.23      Phases IV and V of Bombay High are within ONGC's overall investment
program of Rs 24.1 billion (US$2.9 billion) over 1981-83. The financing plan
for the Pro&ram is detailed in para. 6.06 and can be summarized as follows:
Rs      US$
Million  Million  Percent
Investment Program              24,088    2,868   100.0

24,088    2,868   100.0
As has been the case in the past, the Government will arrange the balance of
the financial requirements of ONGC. This is not expected to cause special
difficulties. Financing has already been arranged with Japan for three of
the platforms. A two-year financial agreement for US$90 million is being
negotiated with the U.S. ExIm Bank and its affiliate PEFCO; another agreement
for US$100 million is being negotiated with the Japan ExIm Bank. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that GOI will provide ONGC, or cause
ONGC to be provided with, sufficient funds to meet ONGC's financial require-
ments for the project and other investments.
3.24      The proposed Bank loan of US$400.0 million would finance about 49%
of the total cost, and about 55% of the foreign exchange cost of the project,
including contingencies.  The estimated schedule of disbursements appears in
Annex 3.7.  The loan would be made to GOI, at the prevailing Bank lending
rate, over twenty years, including a five-year grace period.  GOI would
onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to ONGC, at an interest rate of 10.75% 1/,
over twenty years, including a five-year grace period.  Execution of the
subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.25      ONGC's normal procurement procedure for foreign supplies requires
worldwide bidding similar to the Bank-s rules. international competitive
bidding procedures, in accordance with Bank guidelines, will be followed
for the Bank-financed items. For the purpose of bid evaluation, a prefer-
ence of 15% or the custom duty, whichever is less, will be applied to any
local bid. Bid invitation and evaluation will be the responsibility of
1/   The interest rate of 10.75% is consistent with market rates to public
entities in India, and is expected to be positive in real terms.



- 25 -
ONGC with assistance from consultants as required. ONGC has indicated that,
in order to save time, it intends to call for lump-sum bids for both the BHS
processing platform complex (including the living quarters platform and subsea
pipelines) and the well platforms. Since this procedure will not restrict
competition, it is acceptable to the Bank. Bid invitations for critical items
with limited availability, which are essential to efficient execution of the
project and are estimated to cost less than US$2 million, may be sent directly
to the qualified available suppliers, provided that the Bank's prior approval
is obtained for such items and for the list of suppliers, and that the aggre-
gate amount procured under this procedure does not exceed US$7.5 million.
3.26      The Bank has already given its agreement to advance contracting for
items for BHS with a long lead-time for delivery (e.g. oil pumps, compressors
and generators). This action was taken because, in order to meet the target
completion date for BHS, it is essential to order these items well in advance.
Not allowing advance contracting would delay project implementation, increase
the project cost, and worsen the nation's oil import burden. Before agreeing
to advance contracting:
(a)  it was ensured that ONGC would adhere strictly to World
Bank procurement guidelines;
(b)  ONGC and GOI were advised that the contracts would be
awarded at their own risk, and did not commit the Bank in
any way to make a loan for this project; and
(c)  the Executive Directors were advised of this possibility
through the monthly operational summary.
The value of the contract for which advance contracting action was taken is
about US$40 million. Retroactive financing for expenditures after September
30, 1980 of up to US$5 million is anticipated.
3.27      Disbursement would cover 100% of foreign expenditures and 100% of
the ex-factory price of local expenditures of the Bank-financed contracts.
Disbursements of the Bank loan are expected to be completed by June 1983.
The closing date of the proposed loan would be March 31, 1984.
Ecology and Safety
3.28      When properly protected, maintained and operated, pipelines pose no
environmental hazards. Accordingly, all necessary precautions will be taken
during design and construction of the subsea pipelines to minimize the chances
of overpressurization, corrosion and third-party damage. The offshore and
terminal facilities will not cause noticeable atmospheric pollution; effluents,
essentially oily water and human waste, will be adequately treated before
disposal. ONGC, which follows North Sea environmental standards, has also
chartered a multi-purpose supply vessel (MSV) outfitted for offshore fire-
fighting and oil spill cleanup, and has started action on the acquisition of
two additional MSVs. ONGC has also engaged as consultants OMISCO (a British
Petroleum affiliate, UK) to advise it on the maintenance of offshore oil



- 26 -
installations. Four ONGC engineers underwent training in UK in the area of
offshore pollution prevention and control in the first half of 1980 under a
UNDP project, and ONGC is in the process of setting up a pollution control
group. In addition, the National Coast Guard service of India has been
assigned the responsibility of assisting in offshore emergen_ies. All manned
platforms will be equipped for fire-fighting and will be provided with proper
emergency escape and survival systems.
IV. JUSTIFICATION
Future Supply/Demand of Petroleum in India
4.01      Despite the expected significant increase in domestic crude oil
production in the coming years, India will continue to rely on imported crude
oil to meet its internal requirements, unless new significant discoveries are
made. The sustainable production level in the mid-1980s can be estimated at
23.0 million tons (para. 2.15), which compares with anticipated product consump-
tions of 33 million tons in 1980/81 and 45 million tons in 1984/85. As a
result, all the incremental output of the Bombay High field will be easily
absorbed by the domestic market.
4.02      Several refineries have been suitably modified or constructed
specifically to handle Bombay High crude. 1/ However, the Bombay High crude
is relatively light (39 API) while the domestic market requires a heavier
crude. 2/ As a result, it is possible that at a future date some of the
Bombay High crude would be exported and a heavier, lower grade crude, imported.
This would be financially advantageous because light crudes, in great demand
in industrial economies, are sold at a premium.
Optimal Development Plan
4.03      ONGC has adhered to generally accepted oil industry practices in
developing the Bombay High field. Production and other reservoir data are
continuously monitored and constitute basic inputs in the phased development
of the reservoir. These studies are conducted independently by ONGC-s own
reservoir group, and by CFP. The scope of each phase is the result of detailed
comparison of alternative development plans based on computerized models of
the reservoir. It can therefore be concluded that the development program has
been fully refined with a view to optimize output over the expected economic
life of the reservoir. Since the full benefits of the project will only
materialize after the water injection facilities have been commissioned
(around 1983-1984), assurances were obtained during negotiations that ONGC
would introduce an adequate and timely water injection program in accordance
with the results of the ongoing detailed reservoir studies.
1/   Refineries in the Bombay area, and Cochin, Baroda and Mathura (to be
commissioned in 1981).
2/   Light distillates account for 15% of the demand and their overall share
of the market has been declining. Bombay High crude yields approximately
40% of light distillates.

Economic Rate of Return
4.04      The benefits of the project were taken to be the savings from
displacement of crude oil and fuel oil imports resulting from the incremental
production of crude oil and natural gas. For the purposes cc this calculation,
investment costs are identical to the base cost estimate (including physical
contingencies), but additional provisions were added for water injection
facilities and well conversion in the future (para. 4.03). All investment
costs are expressed in mid-1980 prices. Operating costs are based on the 1980
costs per unit of production. This is a conservative assumption, as significant
economies would result from building upon past investments (existing infra-
structure, pipelines, etc.). International oil prices are assumed to remain
constant in,real terms during the life of the project, a conservative assumption.
The following parameters were used:
Crude oil price:                                US$32/Bbl
Gas price:                                       US$180/thousand Nm  I/
LPG:                                             US$300/ton
Operating Cost (excluding depreciation)         US$1/Bbl
4.05      At a 10% discount rate, the net present value of the project is
US$6.3 billion. The overall incremental output of crude of 450 million
barrels over twenty-one years represents a saving in oil imports of US$14.4
billion at mid-1980 prices. The incremental production during the first year
alone (18.7 million barrels) would have an economic value of nearly US$600
million, compared to total base cost of the project of US$775 million,
including physical contingencies.
4.06      The economic rate of return of the project is significantly above
100%. A high rate of return is not unusual for an oil development project
with a long history of sunk costs (para. 4.07). The detailed calculations
appear at Annex 4.1. Sensitivity analyses were made for several alternative
assumptions; except when the assumption is made that costs increase by
50% and production decreases by 50%, where the rate of return drops to 67%,
the economic rate of return of the Project remains above 100%.
4.07      An economic rate of return was also computed over the whole life
of the field, taking into account past investments and including secondary
recovery in future investment costs and production forecasts. Under the same
assumptions as above, the economic rate of return of the entire Bombay High
project is still above 100%. Details of calculations appear at Annex 4.2.
This is explained by the substantial difference between the production cost
and the import cost of crude oil; for Bombay High, as a whole, the average
cost of a barrel produced is only US$4.10 at a 10% discount rate over the life
of the reservoir.
l/   The economic value of the gas is based on the calorific equivalent of
fuel oil. On the basis of US$209/ton of fuel oil, the equivalent value
of the gas is US$180/thousand Nm .

Project Risks
4.08      The risks normally associated with hydrocarbon development projects
are compounded for offshore ventures by weather and sea conditions. However,
over the years the industry has developed techniques which, if they do not
eliminate risks, reduce them to an acceptable level. The technical solutions
selected by ONGC have been proven reliable. ONGC's consultants have sufficient
experience in the design and construction of offshore and onshore facilities,
and experienced contractors will be selected for project implementation.
ONGC's staff is qualified and experienced in all the facets of oil and gas
production, processing and utilization; therefore, the risk of errors in
design and/or operation is minimal. Weather conditions, however, are not
predictable and may cause delays despite the precautions taken to avoid major
construction work offshore during the monsoon. The present tightness of
the market for processing equipment and jack-up drilling rigs may delay the
completion of the project.
4.09      There is a risk that the central and southern areas of the Bombay
High field will not live up to ONGC's expectations, especially concerning
the reservoir performance under water injection. ONGC and its reservoir
consultant, CFP, have been careful and conservative in their approach to the
evaluation of the reservoir, and both have extensive experience in assessing
reservoirs and their production mechanisms. Their estimates are consistent
with the industry experience in similar oil and gas fields. During the
development of the central and southern areas, ONGC with the help of con-
sultants will monitor the behavior of the reservoir and will provide suffi-
ciently advanced warning of any problem for ONGC to take remedial actions.
V. THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION (ONGC)
General
5.01      The Oil and Natural Gas Commission is a Government-owned statutory
body created in 1959 by an act of Parliament to "plan, promote and implement
the development of petroleum resources and the production and sale of petroleum
products produced by it." ONGC's statutes provide that it is a corporate body
with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property. ONGC also has authority
to contract and borrow. The Commission consists of a Chairman and not less
than two, but not more than eight, Members appointed by the Government for a
period of five-years.
5.02      At present, the Commission consists of the Chairman, four full-time
Members (Finance, Materials, Offshore and Onshore) and three part-time
Members (representing the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Petroleum,
Chemicals and Fertilizers, and the Planning Commission). All decisions of the
Commission must be approved by the majority of the Members. ONGC owns
Hydrocarbons India Ltd, a subsidiary which is responsible for the Commission's
small ventures abroad (Iran and Iraq).



- 29 -
Organilzationi and Management
5.03      The Commission acts very much as a board of directors and is
responsible for setting ONGC's policies. Its development plan has to be
approved by the Planning Commission, while its annual budget for current
and capital expenditures has to be approved by both the Ministry of Petroleum,
Chemicals and Fertilizers and the Ministry of Finance before it is sanctioned
by Parliament. Over time, the Commission, which was originally part of
the Geological Survey of India, has evolved into a full-fledged oil company.
In some areas, particularly in oil exploration (seismic surveys, well logging,
etc.), ONGC has developed an adequate in-house capability. However, aware of
the rapid technological progress in oil exploration and the development of
oil and gas reservoirs, ONGC continues to use foreign consultants when the
in-house capability is insufficient or to verify critical results obtained
in-house. ONGC has followed a consistent policy to ensure that techniques
recently developed in India reflect the latest technology available worldwide
and are properly applied.
5.04      The administrative and financial functions (planning, procurement
and stores, accounting, personnel, computer activities, etc.) are centralized
in the corporate headquarters at Dehra Dun, along with the main research and
development and training facilities. Operational staff are divided among
three regional offices (Central, Western and Eastern Regions) and the Bombay
Offshore Project (BOP), whose headquarters are in Bombay. Prior to 1974
most of the operational decisions were taken centrally from Dehra Dun and the
Regional Managers had little, if any, operational authority. Over the past
years the decision-making process has been decentralized to the regions,
which now have operational responsibility and the authority to commit funds
within their approved budget. ONGC's Organization Chart appears at Annex 5.1.
5.05      The Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) is in charge of offshore explora-
tion and of the development of the offshore fields, particularly Bombay High.
Headed by the Member (Offshore) (para. 5.02), BOP has been the focus of
intense activity over the past five years with the implementation of the
successive phases of Bombay High Development, and the substantial increase
in offshore exploration activity. The increase in its staff has been par-
ticularly rapid: from 20 in 1974 to 600 in 1977 to 900 at present. The staff
is highly motivated by the importance of the offshore projects to the Indian
economy. The Organization Chart of BOP appears at Annex 5.2; under the Member
(Offshore), two General Managers are in charge of Engineering and Construction
(including all the project managers for different platforms, pipelines, etc.)
and Operations (including drilling programs and civil works onshore). Another
General Manager is in charge of production (including supplies, operations,
maintenance, etc.). Four directors also report to the Member (Offshore) and
look after transport, finance, stores and supplies, and administration and
personnel. While important policy decisions are still being taken at Dehra
Dun and New Delhi, BOP has in recent years been delegated sufficient powers to
be able to run the offshore program effectively and efficiently.

Staffing and Training
5.06      As of January 1, 1980, ONGC had an overall staff of 26,000, including
3,600 engineers and senior technical personnel. ONGC gives strong emphasis to
the training of personnel, particularly in its offshore operations. Personnel
are given training by various institutions operating in India (management,
finance, data processing, geology) and abroad (oil companies, laboratories,
contractors' facilities), in addition to a wide array of courses and seminars
given in-house (ranging from highly technical subjects to "organizational
effectiveness" for senior staff). Particularly in the oil industry, where
techniques are evolving rapidly, courses and seminars are important to
keep the staff abreast of the latest developments.
Management Information Systems
5.07      Under the first Project (Loan 1473-IN), ONGC undertook to engage
management consultants to establish adequate management inform'tion systems.
ONGC did engage a foreign consulting firm (REMI, US), but its performance has
been a disappointment to ONGC. In December 1979, the Bank, with the concur-
rence of ONGC, engaged Price Waterhouse (US) to review and comment on ONGC's
accounting and management information systems. Their report was well received.
ONGC, over the past few years, has developed a reasonably good reporting
system. Financial data are not yet included in these reports, as the account-
ing system is not yet fully computerized.  ONGC has engaged a domestic consult-
ing firm to assist in the computerization of general accounts (stores have
already been computerized), and in the implementation of financial reporting
systems.
5.08      During the implementation of the first Project, ONGC submitted
quarterly technical progress reports and annual reports covering financial
and training matters. A completion report is now under preparation. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that ONGC will continue to provide the
Bank with periodic progress reports during project implementation, and a
Project Completion Report when the Project will be fully commissioned.
Accounts and Audit
5.09      Each project unit has a Finance and Accounts Section reporting to
the Project Manager and to the Member (Finance) at ONGC's headquarters. The
Internal Audit Section is under the Director of Finance in New Delhi, and
performs satisfactorily. ONGC-s accounts are audited by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, which is acceptable to the Bank. 1/ While ONGC's accounts
are generally available four months after the end of the fiscal year at the
latest, ONGC's rules and regulations provide that audited accounts cannot be
made public before they have been approved by Parliament. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Commission's audited accounts will
1/ Price Waterhouse (US), which carried out a quick review of ONGC's
accounting system under Bank sponsorship (para. 5.07), qualified the
accounting system as "well conceived and fully documented."



- 31 -
be submitted to the Bank not later than twelve months after the end of the
fiscal year. As was the case in the past, provisional accounts will be
made available to the Bank not later than four months after the end of the
fiscal year.
Insurance
5.10      ONGC has adequate insurance coverage with several insurance com-
panies in India which are reinsured in the international market. Insuring
of offshore equipment follows the international practice, whereby designs
are certified by independent agencies. ONGC's insurance coverage is
satisfactory.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction.
6.01      ONGC's financial and accounting systems, while governed by GOI
regulations, are gradually becoming similar to those of a commercial oil com-
pany. While key financial parameters (selling prices, investment programs)
are decided upon by GOI, the present framework enables ONGC to operate in a
financially responsible and reasonably autonomous fashion. Past policies have
enabled ONGC to perform satisfactorily thus far, and it is expected that this
will continue in the future.
Past Performance
6.02      ONGC's Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Sources and Applications
of Funds Statements over 1977-1980 appear at Annex 6.1. Accounts for 1977-79
have been audited; 1980 accounts are provisional. Over the past four years,
ONGC's performance has been satisfactory. Its Income Statements can be
summarized as follows:
Summary of Past Income Statements

As the above table indicates, ONGC has experienced a rapid growth in its
activities, primarily because of the expanding offshore production. In
the 1977-80 period ONGC's overall investments amounted to Rs 10.0 billion
(US$1.1 billion), of which Rs 4.9 billion (US$0.6 billion) was financed
from internal cash generation.
6.03      The Balance Sheet as of March 31, 1980 can be summarized as follows:
Summary of Balance Sheet as of 3/31/80
Rs million       US$ million         %
Net Fixed Assets                  6,550               780          69
Work in Progress                   1,713              204          18
Long Term Investment                250               30            3
Current Assets        2,373
Current Liabilities (1,454)         919              109           10
Total              9,432           1,123          100
Represented by:
Equity                          5,704              679           60
Long Term Debt 1/               3,728              444           40
Total              9,432           1,123          100
As the above table indicates, ONGC is in a sound financial position with a
Debt/Equity Ratio of 40:60 and a current ratio of 1.6. Over the past three
years, ONGC has obtained Rs 961 million (US$ 114.4 million) in equity contribu-
tions from GOI towards the financing of exploration expenditures. Most of the
balance of its financing requirements was obtained from GOI in the form of
long-term loans (including the IBRD Loan 1473-IN onlent by GOI to ONGC), and
from the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB). Its debt coverage ratio is
satisfactory (6.8 in 1980).
Prices
6.04      The prices at which ONGC sells crude oil and natural gas to refining
companies and gas consuming industries are regulated by GOI. Prices to ONGC
have not changed significantly in recent years and are currently as follows:
Oil and Gas Prices (Inclusive)
Crude Oil                          Rs/ton           US$/Bbl
Offshore                       495               7.75
Onshore                      300-350           4.69-5.48
Gas                             Rs/1000 Nm        US$/thousand SCF
Offshore                     575-619           2.05-2.20
Onshore                      100-300           0.35-1.07
1/   The first Bank Loan (Loan 1473-IN) accounted for approximately 20% of the
long-term indebtedness of ONGC as of that date.



- 33 -
The price of offshore crude of Rs 495/ton includes Rs 102/ton (US$ 1.60/Bbl)
of cess and royalties and Rs 45/ton (US$0.70/Bbl) of pipeline tolling fees.
While these prices are low when compared to international prices, ONGC has
nevertheless been able to perform satisfactorily. 1/ Since they are not used
as a basis for determining the ultimate selling prices of petroleum products
in India (para 2.16), they should be considered as transfer prices within the
economy.
Financial Prospects
6.05      Financial projections over 1981-85 appear at Annex 6.1; supporting
assumptions are at Annex 6.2. Important assumptions made in the forecast
are as follows: (i) prices of crude oil and natural gas remain constant;
(ii) the bulk of external financial requirements would be met by borrowings so
that GOI would no longer provide equity financing; and (iii) no discovery of
additional oil or gas would be made during the period under review. Salient
features of the forecast are as follows:
FINANCIAL PROSPECTS
Year Ending March 31
1981   1982   1983    1984    1985
Crude Oil Sales (Million Tons)   11.0   14.7   17.8    18.4    18.9
Revenues (Million Rs)             5,036  7,104  9,493  10,344  11,408
Net Profit (Million Rs)             864  1,329  1,410      609      472
Operating Ratio:  Offshore          72%    62%    65%      72%      72%
Onshore          82%    86%    91%      98%    108%
Combined         76%    69%    71%      78%      79%
Debt to Debt Plus Equity            52%    63%    65%      67%      69%
Debt Service Coverage (Times)       5.7    4.4    3.5       2.4     2.1
The forecast indicates that until 1983 ONGC's performance should continue to
be satisfactory, but that beyond that year it will deteriorate, essentially
because of unsustainable losses on its onshore operations, unless its sub-
stantial exploration program onshore leads to sufficient increases in pro-
duction from new discoveries. 2/ Therefore, during negotiations assurances
1/   Viewed from another angle, ONGC made a net profit in 1980 of Rs 73.8
per ton of crude oil sold, equivalent to US$1.16/Bbl. Such profits
per barrel are not unreasonable, even by international standards.
2/   The diminishing operating income of the onshore activities is essentially
due to the high amortization costs associated with the exploration
program.



- 34 -
were obtained that (i) GOI will, from time to time, carry out a review
of the prices of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, which will determine the
level of prices required to enable ONGC to meet its operating expenses and
earn a return on its invested capital sufficient to meet its debt service
requirements, maintain adequate working capital and finance a substantial
portion of its proposed capital expansion; and (ii) ONGC will submit
annually to GOI and the Bank an economic and financial evaluation of the
Project and of any subsequent major developments, which will indicate the
level of prices which would be required by ONGC to earn a DCF return of at
least 15% for the project and any such subsequent major developments. Such a
DCF return calculation on the basis of present prices was recently prepared by
ONGC, and reviewed by the Bank, which concluded that the DCF return on Bombay
High is presently 17% (Annex 6.3). Similar covenants were applied under the
first project but no pricing study (item (i) above) was carried out as ONGC-s
performance had remained satisfactory over 1977-80. It is expected, however,
that a study will be carried out in 1981. ONGC is expected to continue to be
able to finance 30-50% of its investment program from internal sources in the
future.
Financing Plan
6.06      ONGC-s financing plan over 1981-83 can be summarized as follows:
Financing Plan 1981-83
Rs      US$
Million Million Percent
Operating Income                 6,191      737     25.7

- 35 -
Included in the long-term borrowings are US$49.0 million yet to be disbursed
under the first IBRD loan (Loan 1473-IN) and the proposed IBRD loan of
US$400.0 million. As discussed in para 3.23, GOI will arrange the balance
of the financing required by ONGC.
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from GOI that:
(a) It will provide ONGC, or cause ONGC to be provided with, sufficient
funds to meet ONGC-s financial requirements for the project and
other investments (para. 3.23); and
(b) it will, from time to time, carry out a review of the prices
of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, which will determine
the level of prices required to meet its operating expenses
and earn a rate of return on its invested capital sufficient
to meet its debt-service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital, and finance a substantial portion of its proposed capital
expansion (para. 6.05).
7.02      Assurances were obtained from ONGC that:
(a) it will use consultants whose experience and terms and conditions
of employment are satisfactory to the Bank to assist in designs
engineering, preparation of bidding documents and supervision of
construction of BHS and the living quarters platform;
(b) it will introduce an adequate and timely water injection program
in accordance with the results of the ongoing detailed reservoir
studies (para. 4.03);
(c) it will provide the Bank with periodic progress reports during
Project implementation, and a Project Completion Report when the
Project is fully commissioned (para. 5.08);
(d) ONGC's annual accounts will be submitted to the Bank not later than
twelve months after the end of the fiscal year (para. 5.09); and
(e) ONGC will submit each year to GOI and the Bank an economic and
financial evaluation of the Bombay High Project and of any subsequent
developments, which will indicate the level of prices which would be
required by ONGC to earn a DCF return of at least 15% for the
Project and any such subsequent major developments (para. 6.05).
7.03      Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and ONGC, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of effec-
tiveness (para. 3.24).
7.04      Satisfactory assurances on the above having been obtained, the
Project would be suitable for a US$400.0 million loan to GOI for a term of
twenty years, including a five-year grace period.

SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ONGC'S INVESTMENT PROGRAM
Background
1.        ONGC prepares annually a five-year rolling investment plan which
is subsequently reviewed, and amended as necessary, by the Government. The
plan, discussed in this Annex, was initially prepared in May 1980, and modified
following discussions with the Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers
in June 1980. The financial projections are also based on this plan. As
capital cost estimates are expressed in the plan in mid-1980 prices, they
have been revised in this Annex to reflect future price escalation at 5% in
1980, and 10% in subsequent years.
2.        Certain early assumptions were necessary for the plan; in parti-
cular, the plan does not assume any discoveries of oil and gas in the period
under review. Recent developments have shown this to be a particularly
conservative assumption. 1/ Further, the plan cannot incorporate the conclu-
sions of ongoing studies of existing reservoirs (based primarily on production
data), which can radically affect the scope and cost of development programs.
As a result, the plan should be considered as a broad outline of an expenditure
program which is likely to be significantly affected, with relatively short
notice, by the continuous gathering of newer, firmer data. The Investment
Program appears at Appendix 1 to this Annex.
Exploration
a.   Onshore
3.        The Western Region (essentially the Gulf of Cambay area) has been
extensively explored, and recoverable reserves of oil are now estimated
at 52.7 million tons. Yet a large number of structures remain to be examined
in deeper zones, and in the vicinity of existing fields. ONGC therefore
proposes to carry out seismic surveys (totalling 13,000 line-km), and drill
100 exploratory wells (altogether 25,000 meters). In the Eastern Region
(Assam, Nagaland and Meghalya) recoverable reserves are estimated at 44.8
million tons. However, thirty structural prospects identified by seismic
surveys have yet to be drilled. As a result, ONGC intends to continue its
program of seismic surveys (5,000 line-km), and drill approximately one
hundred wells (altogether 300,000 meters). In the Central Region (defined as
the balance of the onshore area, but where exploration has only been carried
1/   In June 1980, oil and gas finds were disclosed in the Bay of Bengal and
near the Andaman Islands. The discoveries are particularly significant
as this is the first time that petroleum was discovered in the eastern
offshore area of India. ONGC will now drill appraisal wells in those
areas to ascertain whether these discoveries have commercial potential.
This was not incorporated in the five-year plan.

out extensively in Tripura, West Bengal and in the Krishna Godal7ari basin), no
discoveries of significance have been made so far, but encouraging prospects
have been identified. ONGC proposes to continue its program of seismic
surveys (25,000 line-km), and drill approximately fifty wells (200,000 m).
b.   Offshore
4.        Exploration of the offshore areas, which only began on a significant
scale five years ago, continues to bring tangible results. Offshore recoverable
reserves are now estimated at 230 million tons. The first part of the seismic
program is to complete the reconnaissance and semidetailed surveys on the most
promising areas, and subsequently study less known areas (in particular, the
deeper offshore). In all about 65,000 line-km of seismic surveys are planned.
ONGC also intends to drill fifteen exploratory wells (in total, 275,000
meters), both in known areas which are promising and in unexplored zones.
Development
a.   Onshore
5.        Many of the onshore fields have now reached a stage of decline in
primary production. As a result, extensive and sophisticated programs of
secondary recovery are under way, including water flooding and polymers injec-
tion. Additional wells are also required to increase the output of the fields
in the Eastern Region. Approximately three hundred development wells are
planned. Because of the political disturbances in the Eastern Region, crude
oil production from certain fields has been totally shut down, and development
activities brought to a sudden halt; additional operation and maintenance work
will be required to rehabilitate these fields. There has also been a signi-
ficant lag in work-over jobs.
b.   Offshore
6.        The development of the Bombay High field is treated separately
in Chapter III.
7.        The program also calls for the development of twc, smaller structures
in the vicinity of Bombay High, R-12 and B-37/38. It is proposed initially
to install a relatively simple production system consisting of a well cum
processing platform with a flare tower, and single buoy mooring system for
tanker loading. Further investments would be based on production data.
8.        A major item in ONGC's offshore investment program is the development
of the South Bassein gas field. Sout] Bassein's gas reserves are estimated to
be capable of producing 18 million Nm of gas per day over a twenty-year period.
It is intended to use this gas as a feedstock for new fertilizer plants in

Maharashtra, 1/ Gujarat and Northern states, and for new petrochemical plants.
Conceptual studies are currentlv under way to optimize the development of
the field, and consultants for the gas pipelines are to be appointed shortly.
The timing of the field's development would depend upon the build-up of
fertilizer plants.
c.   Research and Development
9.        ONGC has three technical institutes:  (a) Petroleum Exploration,
(b) Reservoir Studies, and (c) Drilling Technology. These institutes provide
support for the ongoing activities of ONGC, both onshore and offshore.
Important activities that they undertake are, for instance, basic geological
studies, the review of exploration programs in various areas, reserve assess-
ment studies, economical studies, pilot studies for secondary recovery, deep
drilling and directional drilling studies, drilling fluid and mud/cementing
technology, etc. The institutes collaborate with various universities and
research institutions in India and abroad.
General Strategy
10.       ONGC has been and remains a key institution in the development
of oil exploration and development in India. ONGC is also subjected to close
Government scrutiny. While it operates as an autonomous entity, its invest-
ment priorities are reviewed in great detail by the relevant authorities.
11.       While using local resources to the maximum feasible extent, ONGC and
GOI recognize that, because of the rapidly evolving technology of the oil
industry and the very advanced techniques involved in some of its operations,
ONGC has to rely on foreign expertise and foreign technology to meet many of
its requirements. Further, its own manpower and technical resources, while
growing at a fast pace, are insufficient to meet the objectives it has
established.
12.       As a result, ONGC has had to achieve a delicate balance between
the overall objective to use local personnel and the realities of the oil
industry's requirements. This balance has been achieved through an effective
learning process which can be illustrated as follows:
(i) using foreign consultants for all new projects
-involving a new technology;
(ii) using local consultants, whose findings and recommendations
are to be supported by "back-up" consultants;
(iii)  promoting the local manufacture of simple offshore
platforms, with adequate supervision by local and
foreign consultants;
1/   The Bank made a loan in FY1979 for the Thal Fertilizer Project (Loan
1743-IN), which will be the first fertilizer plant based on South
Bassein gas.

ANNEX 3.1

(iv) acquiring vessels (seismic ships, drilling rigs) to be
initially operated by foreign crews under contracts,
and replaced, at a suitable time, by nationals.
ONGC has been able to take these steps without incurring an excessive
financial penalty and without reducing the quality of its facilities.
13.       While one could have anticipated larger investments, particularly
in offshore exploration, there is a current worldwide shortage of drilling
rigs, and ONGC is already using five drilling rigs, including four under
charter. Some of these rigs had to be diverted to higher priority development
drilling on Bombay High. ONGC has, however, placed orders for two drilling
rigs which are to be delivered in November 1980 and April 1981. These invest-
ments are justified (ONGC estimates that its drilling costs offshore are 30%
cheaper using its own rig).
14.       On the whole, however, the program can be considered well balanced,
taking into account the various constraints on the organization.

SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Reserve Estimates and Production Projections
a.   Geology
1.        The main hydrocarbon accumulations in the Bombay High field are found
in a Miocene limestone section referred to as the L-II zone. Lesser accumula-
tions of oil and gas are present in the overlying L-II zone which is not
included in the initial development plans. The L-III zone is a multi-layered
structure consisting of several limestone stringers separated by shale and
marl beds. These limestone stringers are referred to as A1 and A2 zones. There
are other hydrocarbon-bearing beds in this field:  the M zone which is some-
times developed between the A1 and A2 zones, and the B, C, D and E zones which
underlie the A zone. The S-I sand and silt section which is developed between
the L-II and L-III zones is a 2as reservoir with tentatively estimated in-place
reserves of some 70 billion Nm . Present development plans envisage only the
exploitation of the L-III (A1 and A 2) reservoir.
b.   Reserves
2.        During the course of appraisal and initial development, ONGC has had
various organizations evaluate the reserves of the Bombay High field. During
the preparation of the Bombay High Offshore Development Project (Loan No.
1473-IN) the Bank, with the agreement of ONGC, hired DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(D & M) to obtain an updated and independent assessment of the field's reserves
and production potential. The results of D & M-s appraisal were reported in
January 1977. In October 1979, CFP (ONGC's reservoir consultant on Bombay High)
produced revised estimates for the field's reserves and productive potential.
The results of the aforementioned studies are summarized in Attachment I
to this Annex. The reserve figures produced by CFP in October 1979 are the
most conservative.
c.   Production Potential
3.        Following a practice generally accepted in the petroleum industry,
CFP determined Bombay High field's production potential between 200,000
and 300,000 Bbl/d, depending on the percentage of oil initially in place
(OTIP) produced in one year. The results of the CFP study are summarized
below:



- 44 -
ANNEX 3.2
Page 2 of 2
Production Potential, Bbl/d
at 1.0% OIIP/year    at 1.5% OIIP/year
L-III Northern Area                            90,000               135,000
L-III Central and Southern Areas               90,000               135,000
Subtotal           180,000               270,000
L-II                                           20,000                30,000
Total              200,000               300,000
Thus, even if the L-II reservoir was left totally undeveloped, a plateau
production of 240,000 Bbl/d would correspond to a withdrawal rate of
approximately 1.33% of the oil reserves initially in place. This is
consistent with industry practices.
d.   Production Forecasts
4.        To forecast the future production performance of the central and
southern areas (L-III reservoir) CFP carried out a three-dimensional section
model study. The results of this study are summarized in Attachment 2 to this
Annex. Both depletion drive and pressure maintenance by water injection were
simulated in the model study. The model showed that the final oil recovery
would be increased from 11% for depletion drive to 19% at the end of twenty
years, and further to 26% at the end of thirty years, by water injection.
Under depletion drive, the model indicated that with time the field production
rate declined very rapidly and the producing gas/oil ratios (GOR) sharply
increased.
5.        During negotiations, ONGC agreed to implement the water injection
program in accordance with the results of the ongoing detailed reservoir
studies. Therefore, in order to estimate the oil, gas and LPG production
rates during the economic life of the project for the fifty-six wells to be
located in the central and southern areas, water injection was assumed in the
forecast. Since no water injection is presently contemplated for the northern
area, depletion drive performance data were used to forecast the oil, gas and
LPG production from the eight development wells to be located in the northern
area. It was further assumed that the conversion of the producing wells
included in the project into water injection wells in the future would follow
the same pattern as foreseen in the CFP model study. 1/ The current Bombay
High field producing gas/oil ratio (GOR = 100 vol/volA and the design parameter
of the Uran LPG plant (196.5 thousand tons/million Nm ) were used to estimate
future associated gas and LPG production, respectively. The results of the
calculations are summarized in Attachment 3 to this Annex.
1/   The number of production wells converted into injection wells would be
as follows: nine wells in 1983/84, nine wells in 1984/85, two wells
in 1986/87, one well in 1987/88 and seven wells in 1988/89.

SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Details of Engineering Evaluation
a.   General
1.        The Bombay High development program is the first large-scale offshore
oil project undertaken in India. The discovery well was drilled in 1974, and
development began shortly thereafter. Phase III, which will be completed in
December 1980, will virtually complete the primary development of the L-III
reservoir in the northern area of the Bombay High fieid. A production poten-
tial of 140,000 Bbl/d of oil and about 2.5 million Nm per day of gas will
then be reached. The Project comprises Phase IV and Phase V (advance action)
of the Bombay High development program and includes the development of the
central and southern areas of the field. It includes the construction of well
platforms and drilling of wells, installation of one processing and one living
quarters platform and the associated subsea pipelines, expansion of the Uran
oil storage and crude stabilization facilities and extension of telemetry and
telecontrol facilities. A schematic diagram of the Bombay High offshore
facilities, already established and to be built under Phase IV and Phase V
(advance action), is given in Chart 1.
b.   Main Components of the Project
(i) Development wells and well platforms
2.        It is estimated that the full development of the central and southern
areas of the Bombay High field will require about 140 wells to be drilled from
thirty-five well platforms. The project includes sixty-four development wells
and fifteen wellhead platforms. Two of the wellhead platforms and eight
development wells will be located in the northern area of the field, the rest
being located in the central and southern areas.
3.        All the wellhead platforms included in the project will be four-leg,
single deck steel structures and will be installed in about eighty meters of
water. After the installation of the wellhead platforms, four directional
wells, approximately 1,400 m deep (vertical depth) and having some 1,200 m
of drift from the surface location will be drilled from each platform and
completed in the L-III Zone. Through Christmas tree assemblies and wellhead
panels located on the platforms and connecting subsea pipelines, the wells
will flow oil and associated gas to the processing platform.
(ii) Offshore processing platform
4.        Only one processing platform (BHS) capable of handling 180,000 b/d of
oil and its associated gas, as well as the produced water, will be installed

ANNEX 3.3

in the central and southern areas of the Bombay High field, near the existing
SA well cum production platform. The oil, gas and water produced from the
wells will be collected, separated, treated and pumped or compressed into the
oil and gas trunk lines extending to the Uran terminal. Facilities to be
installed on the BHS processing platform will include those required for
(i) the separation of oil, gas and water, (ii) the treatment of oily water,
(iii) the pumping of oil, (iv) the handling and compression of gas; and (v)
the generation of the electric power required for BHS and the future water
injection platform. Summary specifications for the BHS platform are given in
Attachment 1 to this Annex. Schematic flow and process diagrams of the BHS
platform are shown on Charts 2-4.
(iii) Living quarters platform (LQ)
5.        For safety reasons, personnel working in the BHS complex (including
BHS, SA and the future water injection platforms) will be accommodated on a
separate living quarters platform (LQ) which will be installed near and
connected by a bridge to BHS. The living quarters platform will include all
the facilities required for accommodating 125 workers and officers. Summary
specifications for the living quarters platform are given in Attachment 2 to
this Annex.
(iv) Subsea pipelines
6.        To collect the oil and gas produced from the production wells subsea
flow lines with risers at both ends will be installed between the well platform
and either BHS or an intermediate platform. BHS will also be connected by two
subsea pipelines to the existing oil and gas trunk lines to Uran. A summary
list of the subsea pipelines required in Phase IV and Phase V (advance action)
is given in Attachment 3 to this Annex.
(v)   Expansion of terminal, telemetry and telecontrol facilities
7.        The crude stabilization facilities at the Uran terminal provided
in Phase III consists of three parallel trains of 90,000 Bbl/d capacity each.
As one of these trains is always on standby for maintenance and cleaning, a
fourth train identical to the Phase III trains will be constructed and utili-
ties expanded to meet the requirements of the new train, in order to enable
the terminal to process 240,000 Bbl/d of Bombay High crude on a continuous

basis.  Additionally, one 60,000 Nm  cone roof tank will be constructed at
Uran to support the increased oil production. The telemetry and telecontrol
facilities comprised in Phase III will be extended to the installations which
will be established in the central and southern areas.

INDIA
SECOND BOMBAY HIGH OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Projections
I.   Background
1.01      The financial projections are based on the five-year rolling plan
submitted by ONGC to the Government in June 1980. As the prices at which
ONGC sells oil and gas are determined by the Government, they were maintained
constant throughout the forecast. On the other hand, all costs were escalated
at (i) 5% in 1981, 10% in subsequent years, for capital items, and (ii) 7% for
staff costs.
II. Income Statements
2.01      Offshore crude oil is priced at Rs 495/ton 1/, equivalent to US$7.40/Bbl
at the wellhead, including cess and royalties of Rs 102/ton (US$1.68/Bbl).
Tolling fees to the shore are Rs 45/ton; the fees are based on operating
expenses plus a 15% return on net assets averaged over a five-year period.
2.02      Offshore gas is priced at Rs 619 per thousand Nm  (equivalent to
US2.31 per million BTU) for the fertilizer industry, and Rs 575 per thousand
Nm (equivalent to US$2.15 per million BTU) for power generation (this is an
interruptible supply). The wellhead value is calculated by deducting the
transportation cost; a 10% tax is levied on tMe wellhead value, which is
presently equivalent to Rs 45 per thousand Nm
2.03      Onshore prices for crude oil and gas vary from field to field.
In the case of gas, the rates are based on the nature of the consumer; for
instance, in the case if the Eastern Region, gas is presently priced at3
Rs 100 per thousand Nm for power generation and Rs 240 per thousand Nm
for a paper mill.
2.04      LPG is priced at Rs 1,328.47 per ton.  All the LPG is sold to
a refinery, which in turn resells it to users.
1/   The exact basis is as follows:  Rs 45/Bbl for 34  API crude oil plus
Rs 0.16 for each additional API0/Bbl plus taxes equivalent to Rs 102/ton.
For 390 API crude oil the price, based on this formula, turns out to be
Rs 45.80/Bbl or Rs 348/ton (excluding cess and royalty).

ANNEX 6.2

2.05      Detailed calculation of revenues appear in Appendix 1 to this Annex.
Operating Expenses
2.06      Operating costs for both the onshore and offshore operations
include salaries and wages, stores and spares, operating costs of various
capital items on lease (supply vessels, helicopters, rigs), selling expenses,
and overhead.
2.07      Sales Tax/Royalty/Cess is calculated on the basis of actual quanti-
ties of oil and gas produced. Various rates are in effect onshore and offshore.
In the case-of onshore gas, the royalty rate is based on the nature of ultimate
utilization. Detailed calculations appear in Appendix 2 to this Annex.
2.08      Depreciation/Depletion reflect ONGC's current practices:
a.   Exploration
Until a decision to develop or abandon an area is made, expenditure
is written off over fifteen years at a constant rate. If the area is aban-
doned, the balance is written off over three years beginning in the year in
which the decision was made. If, on the other hand, the area is declared
commercial, the balance of exploration expenditure is written off over ten
years beginning in the first year of production. Subsequent exploration
expenditures are written off in equal installments over the remaining period
between the beginning of production, and the tenth year (for instance, explora-
tion expenditures in the second year would be written off over nine years,
while expenditures in the ninth year would be written off over two years). In
the case of seismic surveys (which cannot be attributed to a particular area),
expenditures are expensed immediately.
b.   Fixed Assets
Fixed Assets are depreciated by the reducing balance or straight
line methods. Rates for main capital items are as follows:
Pipelines and machinery - 10%
Platforms - 30%
Development wells - 10 years
Stabilization and processing plants - 15%
c.   Income Tax Provisions
The depreciation provisions described above apply to all accounts.
The income tax provisions enable ONGC, in certain circumstances, to accelerate
depreciation further. An important incentive under the Income Tax Act is
that 25% of the cost of a new asset can be deducted, in the first year only,
for tax purposes. Because of these provisions, and taking into account its
sizeable investment program, ONGC will not be liable to pay income tax in the

period under review. 1/ The detailed depreciation schedule prepared by the
Joint Director (Budget) appears in Appendix 3 to this Annex.
2.09      The schedule of interest and principal payments appears in
Appendix 4 to this Annex.
III. Balance Sheets
3.01      Gross Assets buildup and their depreciation schedule appear in
Appendix 3.
3.02      Long Term Investment refers to ONGC's subsidiary (Hydrocarbon India
Ltd) which undertakes ventures abroad; no further investments are contemplated.
3.03      Debtors were forecast at thirty days of sale, which is reasonable
since ONGC's main consumer, India Oil Corporation, is required to pay within
fifteen days of invoice date.
3.04      The Debt Schedule appears in Appendix 4.  New borrowings were
assumed to be at an average interest rate of 12.5% over seven years, a
very conservative assumption. The proposed IBRD loan is assumed to be over
twenty years, including a five-year grace period, and at an effective interest
rate to ONGC of 10.75%.
3.05      Grants, in small amounts, are expected from the Oil Industry
Development Board (OIDB). No provisions are being made for an increase
in Government equity.
IV. Sources and Applications of Funds Statement
4.01      The Investment Program is reviewed in detail in Annex 3.1.
4.02      Dividends would continue to be paid to the Government at a rate
of 6% of equity.
1/   However, provisions were made for income tax in the financial evaluation
of the project (Annex 6.3).
