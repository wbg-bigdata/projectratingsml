INTERNATIONAL DEVEILOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOIT]MENEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVEIDPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A FISHERIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of
US$2 million on standard terms to help finance a coastal fisheries project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's first operation
in fisheries in Tunisia. The Bank began lending to Tunisia in 1962.
It has been active in certain sectors such as transportation and educa-
tion, with a view also to improving their institutions, stimulating
industrial and tourism development through DFC loans and attempting to
encourage the implementation of satisfactory economic policies. A sum-
mary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Tunisia is attached as
Annex I.
3.        Execution of projects has generally been satisfactory, with
some exceptions.  My memorandum to the Executive Directors on August 2,
1971 (IDA/R71-57) indicated that a substantial part of the Second Educa-
tion Project of 1966 (Credit No. 94) would be unexpendod as a result
mainly of savings in the cost of construction and equ:cp;aent and recom-
mended a reallocation of the proceeds of the credit. This reallocation
is being worked out with the Tunisian authorities.
4.        A detailed account of the problems encountered in implementing
the Cooperative Farm Project of 1967 (Loan No. 484 and Credit No. 99)
was contained in my memorandum to the Executive Directors on November 5,
1970 (R70-213). The Executive Directors approved amendments to the ori-
ginal Loan and Credit Agreements on November 17, 1970. These amendments
became effective on March 24, 1971, and disbursements have been resumed
and are on schedule.
5.        After initial delays, primarily due to the exceptional flood
damage which had to be made good, the Railroad Project of 1969 (Loan
No. 606 and Credit No. 150) is now proceeding satisfactorily and is
expected to be completed by the end of 1973, approximately one year
behind the original schedule.



-2-
6.        The third loan to Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI)
of 1969 (Loan No. 648) has been almost completely committed. Disburse-
ments on all three loans made to SNI are running on schedule. Prepara-
tion of a fourth loan is under way.
7.        IFC has made four investments for a total amount of about
$14.6 million in a fertilizer plant, SNI and Cofitour, a hotel finance
company. It has no projects under active cansideration but Tunisia's
new economic orientation provides scope for further operations.
8.        The main objective of Bank Group lending is to hasten the
implementation of the new policies of economic liberalization introduced
in 1970 and, within this framework, to provide external finance on rea-
sonable terms, reducing Tunisia's dependence on medium and short-term
borrowing. The projects now under study seek to increase production
in crucial sectors such as agriculture, industry and tourism and to
lp attain certain social objectives, for example, in education, fam-
ily planning and urban infrastructure.
9.        The proposed project fits logically in Tunisiats development
program. It would aim at increasing the supply of animal protein for
domestic consumption and of quality fish for a growing tourist industry,
and for export.
10.       A reconnaissance mission of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program
in January/February 1968, was followed by a project identification
mission in July/August 1968, and by a project preparation mission in
May 1969. The project request was finalized in November 1969 and ap-
praised by Bank Group staff in December 1970. Negotiations were held
in Washington in July 1971. The Tunisian delegation was headed by
Mr. Brahim Douik, Directeur des Services des Pgches (Director of
Fisheries) of the N4inistry of Agriculture and included representa-
tives from the Ministries of Agriculture and Planning, from the Banque
Nationale de Tunisie (National Bank of Tunisia) and from the Embassy
of Tunisia in Washington.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
11.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Tunisia" (EMA-38a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
August 18, 1971. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
12.       The report stresses the need for implementing new pclicy cbjectives
introduced by the Government in November 1970, which provide for reducing
direct Government involvement in economic decisions, decentralizing eco-
nomic responsibilities, encouraging private initiative and relaxing eco-
nomic regulation. It notes that production prospects for 1971 are favor-
able because of higher agricultural output. Total demand may grow faster
than real GDP and imports will rise, but foreign exchange earnings are alm
likely to be higher than before and would thus prevent a further increase in
the current account deficit of the balance of payments. As capital inflow is



- 3 -
expected to grow, the gradual improvement in reserves achieved during the
past three years is likely to continue. The future outlook for the balance
of payments depends largely on the discovery of new oil deposits, further
expansion of tourism and continuing external aid at a high level.
13.       I'unisia's foreign debt burden is high:  in 1970 the debt service
ratio was about 22 percent. This ratio (including service of new borrowing)
is likely to decline slightly to about 19 percent during 1973-76 and then to
rise again to about 22 percent by 1980. The debt structure has improved thanks
to the restraint over the past few years in short and medium-term borrowing
and the availability of foreign aid at favorable conditions. Tunisia can
be considered creditworthy for some conventional long-term borrowing provided
that a large proportion of new external assistance is made available on
concessional terms.
14.       The Consultative Group for Tunisia, established in 1962 under the
chairmanship of the Bank, will meet again next October and will exchange
views on Tunisia's economic position and prospects. It will discuss in
particular two documents prepared by the Tunisian authorities on the results
and possibilities of development aid to Tunisia and on the promotion of
export-oriented industries.
PART III - THE PROJECT
15.       Agriculture is still the mainstay of almost half the population
and accounts for about one fourth of exports. However, production has
stagnated in the 1960's because of poor management of the government-sponsored
cooperatives.  Furthermore, there have been large year-to-year fluctuations
due to weather. Agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined from 21
percent in 1964/66 to 16 percent in 1968/70. As a result of this trend and
the rapid increase in population, Tunisia changed from a net exporter to a
net importer of agricultural commodities; shortages and substantial price
increases have occurred since 1970, particularly for meat. The new economic
policies give high priority to raising agricultural production.
16.       Fisheries play a small part in Tunisia's economy.   Total catch is
about 28,000 tons per year and the per capita consumption is about 6 kilo-
grams per year. The proposed project wiould help to increase total productior.
by about 10 percent. Tunisia claims all sea within 6 miles of its coast as
its "territorial sea", bu-t extends its fishing limit out to 12 miles, as do
most other countries with Mediterranean coasts. This limit has not given
rise to any major disputes. The inshore fishing vessels being financed under
the project would fish mostly within this 12 mile limit.
17.       Inshore fishing, which would be assisted by the project, accounts
for 35 percent of Tunisia's total annual catch, while trawling accounts for
26 percent and other production, mainly light attraction fishing, for a
further 39 percent. Including dependents, almost 20,000 people are supported
entirely by inshore fisheries. Overall data on 1-lediterranean fisheries



resources are scanty. To strengthen fisheries research, and in particular
to improve trawling efficiency, Ui\LP is financing a three year fisheries
survey and development project which is being executed by FAO. HTew invest-
ments in trawling would depend on the findings of this survey. In the mean-
time, investment is being concentrated on inshore fishing, the traditional
sector, which appears to have good development potential.
18.       Inshore fishing produces high quality fish for which hLigh prices
are paid throughout the year. ALmost all the inshlore catch is marketed as
fresh fish and consumed mainly by the urban population and tourists. FAO
has projected that per capita demand per annum for fish iJill increase from
about 6 kilograms in 1969 to about 13 kilograms in 1980, assuming no signif-
icant fish and meat price changes, mainly as a result of income increases.
The market outlook for fresh fish for local consumption is favorable, and
ex;sting marketing arrangements are satisfactory.
19.       Up to 1969, the Government concentrated on the formation of
cooperatives in all sectors of the economy, including fisheries. Because of
the failure of agricultural cooperatives to increase production, the Govern-
ment introduced sweeping changes in the orientation and emphasis of economic
policies in September 1969. Since then state eni-terprises, cooperatives and
private enterprises have been permitted to exist side by side.   The liberal-
ization of economic activity gave fresh encouragement particularly to inshore
fishermen who presently operate a fleet of 2,4.00 inshore craft, 600 of which
are motorized. Host fishermen left production cooperatives and service
cooperatives have been disband_d.
20.       Since 1968, the Goverr1nent has provided subsidies through special
Government funds (like the Fonds Special d'Encouragement a la Peche, FOSEP)
administered by the Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BTIT). Fishermen received
low interest loans and Government grants for the purchase of fishing vessels,
and the Government assumed the credit risk. Although fisheries development
provides high economic return, such concessionary credit to fisheries can be
justified over the short term because fishermen lack capital and incur hinh
risks due to catch fluctuations. Under the proposed project, credit would
continue to be made available on concessionary terms, but to a lesser degree
than is being provided from Government funds at present as described in
para. 31 below.
Description and Organization
21.       A detailed report entitled "Appraisal of a Fisheries Project" (PA-91a)
is being distributed separately. A credit and project summary is attached
as Annex III.
22.       The proposed project would be extremely important for Tunisia's
fisheries development. It aims at increasing annual inshore fish production
by about 2,600 tons (valued at about D .65 million or US4$1.2 million) thus
raising supplies of animal protein, mainly for domestic consumption.



23.      The "Direction des Services des Peches" (Directorate of Fisheries)
of the I-inistry of Agriculture would be responsible for the execution of the
project and would be strengthened by a new Fisheries Project Division which
wzould include a fisheries specialist as chief of the project, a naval
architect and a master carpenter, all of whom would likely be recruited abroad
because kniowledge of these fields is not available in Tunisia. The newT
division would be responsible for providing suitable boat designs;  super-
vising boat construction; executing international bidding for motorized
boats;  advising fishermen in the use of newi boats;  providing BMT with
technical appraisals of loan requests and subsequent teclmical supervision
of borrowers; and testing of improved boat designs. The nelw boats would be
similar in general appearance to the type of craft now used by Tunisian
fishermen, but wxould be more efficient. The naval architect would prepare
the newi design.
24.      Throughout the period of project implementation, the Fisheries
Project Division wJould organize short term training courses for fishermen,
particularly for the skippers of new-r boats, in order to improve their skill
and competence. Prior participation in such training courses ol^uld be a
condition of effectiveness of sub-loan agreements between BWT and fishermen.
To introduce modern boat design technioues in Tunisia, the project would
finance overseas training of the Tunisian counterpart of the naval architect
for twelve months at shipyards in the ilediterranean area.
25.      To ensure effective lending operations for the fisheries sector,
BMT's fisheries credit administration would be strengthened.  To this end,
BNT wrill nominate under the project one of its senior officers to be respons-
ible for the lending program and employ an adequate number of fisheries loan
appraisers and supervisors. This staff wiould work in close cooperation
with the Fisheries Project Division in the Directorate of Fisheries.
26.      The project wlould, over a four year investment period:
(a) provide credit (through B-:T) to fisher:uen for replacemen-t
of obsolete inshore craft by about 335 fully equipped
motorized  wooden boats, including fishing gear;
(b) staff and equip a Fisheries Project Division in the
.iinistry of Agriculture;
(c)  reinforce I31T's staff to carry out financial appraisals
of loan applicants and to ensure satisfactory loan
repayments; and
(d) train skippers and provide overseas training for selected
Tunisian staff in the Fisheries Project Division of the
Iiinistry of Agriculture.

Cost Estimates and Financing
27.      Project cost estimates are summiarized in Annex III.  Boat
construction costs are based on quotations from local boat yards, including
CIF cost of diesel engines, wood, nails and accessories, since it is expected
that Tunisian boat yards would win construction contracts under international
competitive bidding. Cost of fishing gear and spare parts is based on CIF
and local costs on imports. Total project costs are estimated at about
D 1.6 million (US&3.1 million) of wihich about D 1.1 million (US$2.0 million)
or 64 percent of total project cost, would be in foreign exchange.
28.      An IDA credit of US$2 million would finance the foreign exchange
costs of the project. The proposed project financing is summarized in
Annex III.
29.      To encourage inshore fish production, Government would make grants
to fishermen to cover 15 percent of investmnents in fully equipped motorized
inshore boats. In all, the Government would contribute about D 370,000
(US$706,000) to project costs, including D 206,300 (US&393,000) for grants
to fishermen and about D 164,200 (US-p313,000) for supporting technical
services.
30.      Fishermen would provide about D 137,500 (USp262,000) from their
own resources equivalent to 10 percent of investments in boats and gear.
The cost of diesel spare parts, to be procured. through spare parts importers,
would amount to D 47,000 (US$,89,00) including con-ingencies and import
duties.  (See Annex III, page 3, footnote 1).
31.      The Government would be the borrower of the proposed US,2 mil-
Jioncredit and wiould assume the foreign exchange risk.  As indicated in
paragraph 20 above, Banque iHationale de Tunisie (3UT) would be the channel
for credits to fishermen. Under a subsidiary loan agreement, the Government
would:
(a)  relend about US$l,830,CC0 of IDA funds to BTIT;  and
(b) lend about USdl30,000 of its own funds to BiNlT;
all for 15 years, including 5 years grace, at 3 percent annual interest.
This subsidiary loan of about USl.96 million would cover 75 percent of the
cost of fishing boats, including gear, i.e. 100 percent of BiIT's loan to
fishermen, which would carry not less than 6 percent annual interest instead
of the average current BIT and FOSEP lending rate of 3 to 4 percent. Under
the subsidiary loan agreement, Government would assume 50 percent of any
losses due to default by sub-borrowers, rather than the current 100 percent.
The balance of the IDA funds, about US?170,000, would remain with the Govern-
ment and wiould be used to finance supporting services. Any savings on
project costs would be used to provide additional credit for inshore boats,
subject to the approval of the Association. It would be a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA credit that the subsidiarr loan agreement satisfactory
to the Association between the Government and BT72 had been concluded.



- 7 -
32.      BNiT fisheries loan policies and procedures under the project would
be substantially changed from those now in effect, as indicated above.
Furthermore, it w-as agreed that the var-ous subsidy elements, e.g. direct
grants, interest rates, subsidies and assumption of default rislc by
the Government, would be regarded as transitory measures. H condition of
effectiveness of the credit would be that FOSEP (Fonds Special d'Encouragement
a la Peche) terms (see paragraph 20 above) would be brought into line with
the project terms.
Procurement
33.      The 335 inshore fishing boats to be procured under the project would
be about 9.5 meters long at water line, carry a crew of 4 to 5 men, skipper
included, and make trips of about two days. Bulk procurement of these boats
would be handled by the Directorate of Fisheries on behalf of fishermen
participating in BIJT's lending program, following international competitive
bidding procedures. Participation in bidding for boats is expected from
countries bordering the iiediterranean Sea. However, Tunisian boat builders
are expected to win all boat bids, mainly because they would avoid expensive
sea freight costs. Bid documen-ts, including detailed boat designs, standards
and specifications, would be prepared by the naval architect in the Fisheries
Project Division, who would also assist in bid evaluation and supervision of
construction. Tunisian bidders would be allowed a preference margin equiv-
alent to the existing level of customs duties on imported boats (presently
11 percent) and marine diesel engines (presently 13 percent) or 15 percent
of CIF values, whichever is lower.
34.      The Directorate of Fisheries wQuld invite bids for the delivery of
about 335 inshore boats spread over a period of three years, according to
expected inflow of loan applications by fishermen as estimated at the time of
bid issue. Initially, firm bids would be invited for a total of not less
than 50 boats, but, in order to encourage participation by the smaller
Tunisian boat builders, bids wjould be accepted for less thar the total number
of boats provided the boat builder could supply not less than 10 boats within
a 12 month period. In order to help ensure effective local bidding and
standardization of diesel engines - the latter being important for setting
up satisfactory maintenance and spare parts services in the likelihood that
Tunisian boat yards would win all the boat bids - the following bids would
be invited simultaneously:
(a) internationally, including from Tunisia, for complete
inshore fishing boats;
(b) from Tunisian boat yards only, for inshore fishing boat
hulls, including cost of installing marine diesel engines;
and
(c) internationally, including from Tunisia, for marine diesel
engines to be installed in Tunisian hulls.
Contracts would be awarded so as to obtain the cheapest evaluated complete
boat.



35.       Suppliers wJould be carefully screened as there is no international
market for, nor large-scale production of, wooden inshore boats in the
Mediterranean area. This would involve evaluation of suppliers' construction
capacities, technical abilities and financial standing. Conditions for
qualifications would include firm assurances by suppliers to provide a one-
year warranty on hulls and engines; and adequate hull and engine repair
facilities and spare parts inventories for diesel engines at suitable
locations in Tunisia throughout the period of the lending program. Any
prequalification of suppliers as well as bid documents and contract awards
would be subject to prior IDA approval. One of the bidders for diesel
engines is expected to be a state-controlled firm, which will participate
on the same basis as private bidders (see Schedule 5 of the Development
Credit Agreement).
36.       As fishing gear has to suit varying local conditions and fish
resources, it is not suitable for bulk procurement. Fishermen would therefore
obtain imported fishing gear of their choice through existing trade channels.
Also, the vehicles for supporting services would be locally purchased as
there would be too few for an international contract. Suppliers of fishing
gear and vehicles from member countries and Switzerland are sufficiently
represented in Tunisia, assuring satisfactory competition. The Government
would promptly take all measures to permit importatibn of boats, boat building
materials, equipment, gear and spare parts on certification by the KIinistry
of Agriculture that the imports are required to carry out the project.
Disbursement
37.       Disbursement of the proposed credit would be made against 90 percent
of disbursed subloans for the purchase of motorized boats and gear by BNT,
equivalent to foreign exchange costs of boats and gear; and against 100
percent of foreign exchange costs of:
(a) personnel recruited abroad and overseas training;
(b) vehicles imported by the Direction des Services des
Peches and BNT; and
(c) diesel engine spare parts imported by suppliers' agents.
The proposed credit would be likely to be disbursed over a period of 4h½ years,
as shown in Annex III.
Economic Benefits and Justification
38.       The economic rate of return of the project is expected to be about
21 percent, and the financial return to fishermen (net of Government's
contribution) about 31 percent.  The project would offer improved income
opportunities to some 1,300 fishermen at present engaged in less efficient
inshore operations and generate about 300 new- jobs. It would also provide
valuable training and professional experience to skippers, r,mechanics and
crewJs for further expansion of inshore fisheries after project termination.
Under expected domestic awards, the boat construction program, with technical



- 9 -
assistance provided to boatbuilders under the project wfould enable Tunisian
boat yards to operate in a balanced and efficient manner for a period of
about 3 years. This would ensure satisfactory utilization of existing boat
construction capacities during this period and generate a total of about
225 man-years of employment for supervisory, skilled and semi-skilled jobs.
At termination of construction, the benefits of irmproved techniques Twould
remain With local boat yards.
39.      The project wJould provide a valuable addition to animal protein
supplies, substituting for imports. It w-ould also increase production,
although in smaller quantities, of high valued species for export and
consumption in Tunisia's tourist industry-.
40.      Finally, through strengthened management and organization, the
project would provide valuable experience to BAT as the lending channel in
the fisheries credit operation. It would help to introduce credit discipline
in an important part of Tunisia's fisheries, thus preparing the sector for
expanded credit on a financially sound basis.
