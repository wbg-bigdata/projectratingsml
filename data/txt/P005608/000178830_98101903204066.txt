FISHERIES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a coastal fisheries project for private
fishermen in Tunisia. Total project costs would be about US$3.1 million
and the proposed IDA credit of US$2.0 million would be equal to the foreign
exchange component. The project would form an important part of Tunisia's
fisheries development progran aimed at increasing the supply of animal protein
for domestic consumption and quality fish for a growing tourist industry.
ii.       Tunisia's coastal fisheries sector has immediate development
potential and high investment demand for new equipment. Favorable develop-
ment aspects include underexploited fish resources, efficient shore facilities
and marketing arrangements, satisfactory institutional arrangements, an
enterprising fishermen's community and growing demand for fish products.
iii.      The project would provide credit to fishermen for the replacement
of about 335 obsolete motorized coastal fishing boats, 5-il m long, which
would otherwise discontinue production. New boats, each about 9.5 m long,
would be constructed from wood and powered with diesel engines, according to
designs and specifications to be prepared specifically for the project. Their
improved features would enhance production by about 40-50% over catch rates
of traditional vessels of comparable size. Total production of the project
fleet would be about 4,800 tous of highly valued inshore fish at full devel-
opment, of which about 55% would be additional production. In addition,
financing would be provided for technical assistance to boat builders and
fishermen, for strengthening credit supervisory se-rices, for training skippers,
and for initial stocks of spare parts for maritime diesel engines. The
project investment period would be about 4 years.
iv.       About US$1.83 million of the IDA credit and about US$130,000 of
Government funds would be on-lent by Governnent to the National Bank of
Tunisia (BNT) at an interest rate of 3%, with a repayment period of 15 years,
including 5 years grace. BNT is the lending channel of a previous Bank/IDA
agricultural credit project for cooperative development (484/99-TUN, US$12
million Bank loan and US$6 million IDA credit, 1967). This Bank/IDA project
was revised and a reduced project approved in November 1970. BNT is also
the lending channel for a further agricultural credit project approved in
July 1971 (779/263-TUN, US$5 million Bank loan and US$3 million IDA credit).
BNT would on-lend the IDA and Governnent funde to private fishermen at an
interest rate of 6% and at terms of 8 years, with a grace period of three
months, for the purchase of motorized inshore boats. Because of the risk
involved in fisheries loans, Government would assume 50% of any losses due to
default by subborrowers. The interest rate spread and the different repayment
periods for subloans and the Government loan would help BNT to build up
reserves for risk coverage and to cover unforeseen slippage in repayments by
fishermen.



v.        The remainder of the IDA credit, about US$0.17 million, would be
maLde available by Governnent to the Directorate of Fisheries to finance
supporting services. The Directorate of Fisheries, a Government organization,
is responsible for implementing Goverument's fisheries policy and research.
vi.       Motorized fishing boats would be procured under international
ccmnpetitive bidding procedures by the Directorate of Fisheries on behalf of
fishermen participating in BNT's credit program. Participation in bidding
is expected from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, including
Tunisian boat builders, who are expected to win all bids as their prices are
expected to be lower than foreign quotations. Local bidders would be allowed
a preference margin equivalent to the present customs duties on imports
(presently 11% on boats and 13% on diesel engines), but not exceeding 15% of
ClF values.
vii.      The success of the lending program would mainly depend on a
satisfactory repayment discipline by fishermen. To minimize the default
risk, specific organizational and managerial provisions have been included
LrLder the project to strengthen its credit operation. Successful implemen-
tation of this project would provide experience for expanded investment in
Ttnisian fisheries development. The economic rate of return of the proposed
ir'vestments would be about 21%, which is satisfactory; financial returns to
fishermen vary from about 26% to 31% and are attractive.
viii.     The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.0 million,
orl standard terms. The borrower would be the Government of Tunisia, which
would carry the foreign exchange risk.



TUNISIA
FISHERIES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia has requested an IDA credit of US$2.0
million to meet the foreign exchange costs of a project to help replace
obsolete motorized inshore craft 1/, owned by private fishermen, by modern
fishing boats of improved design, over a 4-year development period. Tunisia's
inshore fleet landed more than 9,000 tons of fish in 1968, or about 35% of
the total catch of about 28,000 tons. Much encouragement has been given to
inshore fisheries through the liberalization of the economy in 1969, result-
ing in a high demand by fishermen for new equipment.  The project forms an
important part of Tunisia's fisheries development program and would help to
increase urgently needed animal protein supplies and meet increasing demand
for quality fish by the growing tourist industry and domestic consumers.  The
proposed project would eventually increase landings of highly valued inshore
fish by about 2,600 tons per year.
1.02      The Bank/IDA has previously assisted Tunisia's agricultural devel-
opment through an agricultural credit project for cooperative development
(484/99-TUN, US$12 million Bank loan and US$6 million IDA credit, 1967). Up
to 1969, government policy Was to promote the cooperative sector. However,
this policy vas reversed in September 1969, when a law was enacted stipulating
that, henceforth, state farms, cooperatives, and private farmers would coexist.
The change in the basic situation instigated a review of that project by a
Bank/IDA mission in October 1969 which, in turn, led to a reduction of the
loan/credit from US$18 million to US$9.2 million. The change in the project
was approved in November 1970. A further agriculturai credit project was
approved in July, 1971 (779/263-TUN, US$5 million Bank loan and US$3 million
IDA credit).
1.03      This project vas prepared by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, which
finalized its report in November 1969. This appraisal report is based on
the above report and findings of an appraisal mission, comprising Messrs.
G. von Gontard, P. Esmiol, R.H. Golkowsky, W.A. Ward (IDA) and W.D. Nardelli
(Consultant), which visited Tunisia in December 1970.
Il. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Tunisia, situated on the North African coast of the Mediterranean
Sea, between Algeria and Libya, has a coastline of about 1,300 km (see Map)
1/   Inshore boats fish in coastal waters within sight of the coastline --
in Tunisia, up to 20-25 km offshore under favorable veather conditions.



and is the smallest of the North Afr±c.an counzrles in land area (about
160,000 km2).  Its rapidly growing population reached an estimated 5 million
in 1970, and the GDP per capita amounted to about US$240.
2.02      Agriculture 1/ is still the nainstay of almost half the popula-
t:Lon and accounts for about a quarter of exports. Fluctuations in agricul-
tural output continue to have a major impact on the country's economic per-
formance. Due to adverse weather, disappointing performance of cooperatives
and lack of confidence of private enterprises, agriculture's contribution to
GDP declined from 25% in 1965 to 15% in 1970, accompanied by a deteriorating
balance of trade in agricultural products.
2.03      Cereal exports have ceased during the past decade, whereas food-
grain imports have grown substantially to more than half of Tunisia's
requirements, about 480,000 tons in 1969. The value of Tunisia's leading
agricultural export commodity, olive oil, has also declined, while quantities
of imported vegetable oil have increased. In coming years, the imbalance
v-111 be further aggravated by increasing domestic demand for fresh food
products, such as vegetables, fruits, meats and fish.
2.04      Tunisia has a low per capita consumption of fish, about 6 kg per
year. Government seeks to increase supplies of animal protein and the pro-
posed project would assist in achieving this objective.
2.05      Up to 1969, Goverument concentrated on the formation of coopera-
tives in all sectors of the economy. Because of the failure of agricultural
cooperatives to increase production, GovernLent introduced sweeping changes
in the orientation and emphasis of economic policies in September 1969.
S:Lnce that time state enterprises, cooperatives and private enterprises can
exist side by side.
2.06      Because of the new policy, most fishermen left production coopera-
tives rapidly, service cooperatives broke up and state and cooperative con-
trolled fish marketing was reduced. The liberalization of economic activity
gave fresh encouragement particularly to inshore fishermen, as indicated by
their high demand for new fishing equipment (para 2.26).
B. Fishing Operations
FLsh Resources
2.07      Overall data on Mediterranean fisheries resources are scanty, but
several studies have been initiated by the General Fisheries Council of
1/ Further discussion of agriculture is contained in Current Economic
Position and Prospects in Tunisia; IBRD Report No. EMA-38a; August 18,
1971.



- 3-
the Mediterranean (FAO) that will increase available information during the
next decade. Because of high saîinity and comparatively low nutrient levels,
the Mediterranean fauna is generally less abundant than resources in richer
waters. The fauna, however, is highly diversified and composed of a large
variety of valuable fish species. Tunisian fisheries statistics distinguish
38 major categories, while landed fish comprise 50-60 different marketable
species. This poses problems in estimating Tunisian fish resources. Detailed
studies would involve time-consuming investigations (up to 10 years) into the
life cycles of a multitude of species. However, long-term observations of the
ecology of Tunisian waters and surveys of catches indicate that Tunisia's
inshore fish resources are underexploited, in particular along the northern
region from the Algerian border to Cape Bon (see Map). Based on these
observations and surveys it is conservatively estimated that current catches
landed by about 600 existing motorized inshore boats (para 2.12), about
3,500 tons in 1969 (Annex 1), could be doubled without risk to sustained
production. The proposed project would increase production by about 2,600 tons.
Types of Fishing
2.08      The catch landed by Tunisian vessels in 1968, about 28,000 tons, was
produced as follows: trawling 26%; light attraction fishing (known as lamparo
fishing) 31%; tuna trap net, sponge, coral and lagoon fishing 8%; and inshore
fishing 35%. These percentages have not varied significantly over the past
4 years (Annex 1).
2.09      Fish landed by trawlers include mullet, whiting, dab, cuttle
fish, shrimp and squid.  ShrL?p figure importantly, accounting for about
one-quarter of the value of the catch.  The trawler fleet comprises about 150
vessels, most of them wooden boats of less than 30 tons displacement. About
50 of the small- and medium-sized trawlers convert to seining during the
lamparo season.  Since 1965 Government has purchased 35 steel trawlers
(90-110 tons displacement), most of them operixced by the National Office of
Fisheries (Office National des Peches - ONP), a commercial government enter-
prise, established in 1958. Annual landings per trawler are poor, due to
inadequate training, low standards of maintenance and insufficient fishing
days. Improvement of trawling efficiency is the major scope of a recently
implemented UNDP/FAO project (para 2.23); new învestment in trawling would
depend on its findings.
2.10      Lamparo fishing involves the use of light to attract fish in
connection with seining. Sardine, sardinella and mackerel are the most
important species taken. The fleet comprises about 50 seine vessels, 50
converted trawlers (para 2.09), anc numerous small craft; the latter may
seine or act as auxiliary boats. -âe lmparo season is during April-
November and is concentrated around Madhia and Sfax (see Map). Expansion
to other areas is possible; however, there is not yet enough local demand
for sardine, sardinella and mack- -el to justify it.
2.11      Although some tuna a;in turn .-IXke fishes are taken by other gear,
the main catch (600-900 tons annua_y) /, from trap fishing in May-June
when tuna migrate to their spawaing grounds in the eastern Mediterranean.

Expertence has shown that additiona'.. nets in t-he migration paths do not
s:Lgnificantly increase y!eId.  Some s2,g. _  Lsh±ng (70 tons in 1969) is
done from Sfax southward.   oxompetition from s;'r:hetic sponges is an
adverse factor.  Lagoon f!shing yielJs àhbcut POC-1,200 tons annually and
is a government concession to ON? w!th '4im'4ed exDans!on potential.
2.12      lnshore f ishing, the traditional secter of Tunisian fisheries,
has good development potential. Smal1. wooden craft owned by private fisher-
men fish all along the coast and catch mostly bottom fish for fresh con-
sumption. In addition, the inshore fleet accounts for most of the highly
priced lobster catch (about 30 tons in 1969). Of about 2,400 inshore craft,
àbout 600 (5-11 m long) are motorized; the remainder are propelled by oar
or sail. More than half the motorized inshore fleet is older than 10 years,
obsolete and in need of early replacement (Annex 2).  New boats would enhance
fishing efficiency and catch rates. Primary gear used by inshore craft are
trammel nets (10-25 pieces per boat, each 50-60 m long and 1.5 m deep) and
lines.
2.13      The inshore fleet is unequally distributed along the coast.  About
15% of the inshore boats are based along the northern coast (Algerian border
to Cape Bon; see Map). Because weather is more uncertain in the north than
in other areas, a high proportion (about 50%) of the boats is motorized.
About 1/3 of the inshore boats (about 35% motorized) operate from the eastern
coast (Cape Bon to Sfax; see Map), while more than half the fleet is based
in the area south of Sfax to the Libyan border. The percentage of motorized
boats in the latter area is low, about 10%. Inshore fisheries employ about
6,900 fishermen of which about 34% are authorized skippers, in most cases
boat owners; the remainder are crewmen. Including dependents, about 20,000
people depend entirely on inshore fisheries.
C. Shore and Marketing Facilities
Fishing Ports
2.14      The Tunisian maritime catch is landed at 8 developed fishing ports
and more than 30 protected anchorages and landing grounds. Some fishing ports
have been improved recently and various schemes are planned or under execution
to develop more shore facilities.  Administration and development of fishing
ports are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works. Existing and
planned shore facilities would be fully adequate to support the development
proposed under this project.
Fish Marketing
2.15      About 95% of Tunisia's maritime catch is locally marketed; the
remainder is exported. ONP has successfully set up an extensive fish marketing
Esystem and increased fish consumption throughout the country, even in remote
areas (Annex 3). Marketing facilities established by the agency in the last
clecade include a network of fish collection centers with holding rooms for



- 5 -
temporary storage, strategically situated ice-making plants, refrigeration
plants, frozen fish storage and refrigerated depots. In addition, ONP has
acquired a fleet of insulated and semi-refrigerated trucks to deliver fresh
lish to main depots and some 300 retail points in the interior of the country
(see Map).
2.16      Through its extensive marketing system and government price
regulation ONP monopolized fish marketing prior to liberalization in 1969.
ONP then transferred part of its facilities and nearly its entire retail
system to local bodies or private ownership. Importantly, most landed fish
is now offered by producers, ,ncluding ONP, through regulated daily auctions
to wholesalers, retailers, hotels and restaurants all along the coast. In
spite of reduced marketing operations, ONP is still the major Tunisian fish
producer, processor and exporter. Its fleet of fish trucks continues to be
t:he backbone of fresh fish transportation.  To summarize, Tunisia's fresh
inshore fish marketing arrangements are satisfactory.
2.17      Since 1969 the fish trade has been free, the price of fish is no
longer fixed and prices to both fishermen and consumers have increased
significantly (about 20-30%). The price rise is partly due to decreased
supplies of other types of animal protein and to increased demand for quality
lfish from the growing tourist industry. Because of growing demand for animal
protein, fish prices are not expected to decrease.
Boat Maintenance, Construction and Supplies
2.18      Maintenance of inshore boats and gear is generally satisfactory.
l'here are numerous carpenter workshops scattered along the coast which
miaintain existing boats and construct small inshore vessels. Motorized
iLnshore boats are constructed from local and importe- wood by 7 enterprises.
Ail of them have good experience in the construction of traditional inshore
boats by labor intensive methods, but they 1asv experience in construction
of modern vessels. Local boat builders would receive technical assistance
umder the project. Tunisian boatyard8 are presently underutilized and have
an estimated construction capacity of about 190 motorized inshore vessels per
year. A public boatyard at Menzel Bourguiba would be able to construct about
1OO boats per year; ONP has 3 boatyards at Bizerte, Sousse and Sfax (see Map)
with an estimated annual construction capacity of 60 motorized inshore boats;
3 private boatyards have a capacity of about 30 boats per year. ONP's boat-
yards are being reorganized with help from Tunisia's Institute of Productivity.
2.19      Another public enterprise, also with workshop in Menzel Bourguiba,
is assembling Danish and German diesel engines under licenses. These engines
are mainly for stationary agricultural purposes, but are also used in inshore
boats. They are unsophisticated and sturdy and one model is likely to be
suitable for use in project boats. In general, repair and spare parts
arrangements for diesel engines need improvement. Several European maritime
diesel engine manufacturers are represented in Tunisia. Imports have been
restricted in the past to protect tne local producer.



2.20      Some netting is produced local'y by ONP, but most fishing gear,
such as complete nets, lines and hooks, is impor-ted.  Supplies can be bought
by fishermen at most fish collection centers along with boat paint, diesel
oLl, lubricants, basic diesel engine sDare parts and other items. Diesel
oil and lubricants are sold free of tax to fishermen.
D. Supporting Services
Directorate of Fisherles
2.21      Within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Directorate of Fisheries
(Direction des Services des Peches-DSP) is entrusted with formulation of
fishing policies, enforcement of fishing regulations, issuance of fishing
permits, collection of production statistics, training, fisheries research
and development. The director is board member of ONP and Tunisian represen-
tative on various international fisheries bodies. The head office of DSP
comprises 4 divisions - secretariat, fisheries administration, training and
legislation-arbitration. In addition there are 8 regional and 18 local of-
fices at important fishery centers, with a total staff of about 130. Training
standards of DSP's staff are satisfactory.
2.22      DSP's fisheries school at Kelibia (assisted by Swedish grants and
personnel) provides 2- to 3-year courses for fishermen, mechanics and boat
carpenters, while 4 training centers (Bizerte, Ghar el Melh, Madhia and
Zarzis; see Map) have l-year courses for fishermen in fisheries techniques
and maintenance of gear, boats, and engines. Training facilities are effi-
ciently managed and have a total enrollment of about 350. Basic fisheries
research is carried out by INSTOP (Institut Scientifique et Technique
d' Oceanographie et de Peche), an institute which has vell equipped laboratories
near Tunis and is supervised by the Director of Fisheries. INSTOP maintains
3, research vessels and has been involved in exploratory trawling and shrimp
study.
UNDP - FAO Assistance
2.23      To strengthen fisheries research and to improve trawling, lamparo
and lagoon fishing, UNDP is financing a 3-year fishery survey and development
project which is being executed by FAO. An expatriate project manager has
been selected and project activities are to start early in 1971.  Further,
FAO is providing a grant to DSP for the construction of 3 wooden motorized
inshore craft 6-9 m long, according to designs of FAO's Fisheries Department,
for training purposes.  In addition, FAO assists Tunisia through the General
Fisheries Council of the Mediterranean with general data on fisheries re-
sources, fish marketing and other related information.
I,eRislation
2.24      Tunisian fisheries are adequately regulated through a multitude of
acts, laws and administrative decrees. Important lava protecting inshore
fisheries regulate the use of certain types of nets and prohibit trawling



within a zone 6 mi offshore and shrimp trawling in the Gulf of Gabes sea-
sonally (see Map). Enforcement of laws seems adequate. Tunisia claims all
sea within 6 miles of its coast as its "territorial sea", but extends its
fishing limit out to 12 miles, as do most other countries with Mediterannean
coasts. This limit has not given rise to any major disputes. The inshore
fishing vessels being financed under the project would fish mostly within
the 12-mile limit.
E. Fisheries Credit
2.25      Concessionary credït to fisheries has been made available since
1968 through a special government fund (Fonds Special d'Encouragement a
la Peche - FOSEP) administered by the National Bank of Tunisia (Banque
Nationale de Tunisie - BNT; Annex 4). BNT is Tunisia's major agricultural
bank with experience in fisheries lending through 11 of its coastal branch
offices (see Map). Government's initial contribution to FOSEP was D 200,000;
however, after the change of economic policy (para 2.06), FOSEP's operation
was reviewed and undisbursed loans were partly canceiled. Of the initial
FOSEP arrangement, loans for 44 motorized inshore boats are still effective.
Performance of these loans has not been impressive; a cooperative loan of
D 80,000 is a bad debt and repayment of amounts due from individual fishermen
is low, less than 18%.
2.26      Lending policies for fisheries were revised by a widely publicized
administrative decree in April 1970. Since that time Government provides
10% - 20% of investment costs as a grant for the purchase of motorized
inshore vessels. The minimum downpayment was fixed at 10% - 20% and loan
amounts were up to 70% of investment costs at 3% annual interest over an
8-year period. BNT continues the administration of FOSEP, without partici-
pation in the default risk, but may reject loa  applications on grounds of
creditworthiness. DSP makes the technical evaluation of applicants and a
committee chaired by the Minister of Agriculture gives the final approval.
FOSEP's resources were supplemented by Government in 1970 (Annex 4, Table 1).
As of December 15, 1970, a total of 90 inshore fisheries loans vere granted
by FOSEP; and some 76 applications for motorized inshore boats were under
consideration (Annex 4, Table 3). Effective inshore craft loans (90) and
pending applications (76) indicate a high demand for new equipment by inshore
fishermen. Pending applications are mainly for longer boats, about 9 m long.
2.27      As discussed in paragraphs 2.25 and 2.26, Government has followed
a policy of subsidies. It has (a) set interest rates for loans to fishermen
at a low level; (b) assumed the default risk on loan repayments; and (c) pro-
vided grants for the purchase of fishing vessels. Under the proposed project,
credit would continue to be made available on concessionary terms, but to a
lesser degree, and FOSEP financing would be brought into line with the
project terms (paras 4.07 and 4.08). Fisheries development provides high



economic returns, but s4nce fisiermen lack capital and incur high riæks due
to catch fluctuations, cont!nuat4n. oe such rovernment concessions can be
iustified in the short term.
2.28      While it is Government's policy to involve BNT financially in credit
to fishermen, BNT believes that !t cannot take the full default risk, because
fisheries boans carry a high credit risk, due to the limited security that
fishermen can offer.  Moreover, the remuneration for administering present
fisheries credits (2% of repaid amounts) barely covers BNT's expenses; and
the volume of business .would not warrant employment of specialized staff for
fisheries credit supervision. Loan policies and procedures would therefore
be adopted under the project which would make fisheries credits more
attractive to BNT, the proposed lending channel, and minimize the default
risk (para 3.14).
2.29      Since inshore craft operate all along Tunisia's coastline, it is
difficult to define areas of high credit demand.  Iowever, the majority of
motorized boats (para 2.13) needing replacement are based along the northern
and eastern coasts, from the Algerian border to about Sfax (see Map). This
area has underexploited inshore fish resources (para 2.07) and the highest
concentrations of well developed fishing ports, anchorages and landing grounds
and other vital shore facilities. About 85% of the project's credit operations
would take place in the northern and eastern areas and about 15% along the
coast from Sfax southward.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The proposed project is an important part of Tunisia's fisheries
development program.  it aims at increasing annual inshore fish production
by about 2,600 tons (valued at about D 0.65 million or US$1.2 million) to
increase supplies of animal protein, mainly for internal consumption. Over
a. 4-year investment period the project would:
(a)  provide credit to fishermen for replacement of obsolete
inshore craft by about 335 specifically designed motorized
wooden boats, including fishing gear;
(b)  staff and equip a Fisheries Project Division within the
Directorate of Fisheries, including recruitment of
specialists to provide know-how in modern inshore fishing
techniques and design and construction of inshore boats,
and to carry out technical appraisals of loan applicants
and supervision of subborrowers;



- 9 -
(c) provide and equip fisheries credit staff within the
National Bank of Tunisia to carry out financial
appraisals of loan applicant8 and to assure satisfactory
loan repayments; and
(d)  provide training of skippers and overseas training for
selected staff from the Fisheries Project Division.
B. Detailed Features
Inshore Craft, Gear and Spare Parts
3.02      Based on existing replacement needs (Annexes 2 and 5) and expected
credit demand (para 2.26), the project would provide about 335 boats approx-
imately 9.5 m long at waterline, to carry a crew of 4-5 men, skipper included,
and make trips lasting about 2 days. Because of unsatisfactory financial and
economic returns, Government's request for investments in smaller boats (about
6.5 m long) has not been included (Annex 6). The proposed boats would be
similar in general appearance to the Mediterranean type craft used by Tunisian
fishermen. New design criteria would be a cut-off stern (transom stern) to
increase propeller efficiency; centered engines and cabins and wide beams
to improve handling at sea and enable fishing from the stern as well as the
bow; lowered decks to protect crews adequately; and insulated holds to
improve quality of landed fish. Proposed boats would be provided with 30
pieces of trammel net to catch bottom fish; but seasonal use of other types
of gear, such as long lines and purse seines for lamparo fishing (para 2.10)
and small trawl nets would also be possible.
3.03      Detailed boat designs would be prepared 'Dy a naval architect re-
cruited under the project (para 4.03). It is .cxpected that boats would be
built in Tunisia (para 3.15). Hull construction would be in wood (mainly
imported), aiming at lightweight vessels powered wîth specialized marine
diesel engines of 35-40 hp (Annex 5, Drawing I). Assurances have been ob-
tained during negotiations that boat designs and specifications would be
satisfactory to IDA.
3.04      Adequate and timely supply of diesel engine spare parts would be
vital for continued and economic operation of the proposed project fleet.
Provision of initial inventories of spare parts is therefore part of the
project and appropriate assurances from suppliers would be obtained during
the procurement process (para 3.17).
Fisheries Project Division
3.05      DSP's services to fisheries would be strengthened by establishing,
staffing and equipping a Fisheries Project Division (FPD) within DSP, in-
cluding a fisheries specialist, a naval architect and a master-carpenter, all
of whom would need to be recruited abroad because knowledge in theîr fields
would not be available in Tunisia (para 4.03). FPD would be responsible for



- 10 -
providing suitable boat designs; super%4.s!ng boat construction; executing
international bidding for motorized boats, advisi.ng fishermen in the use of
new boats; providing BNT with technical appraisals of loan requests and sub-
sequent technical supervision of borrowers; aen testing of improved boat
designs. Establishment and appropriate staffing of FPD are essential for the
success of the project. Government acknowledges the need for improved inshore
techniques and welcomes such assistance to the industry.  Further details are
given in paragraphs 4.01 through 4.04.
BNT Credit Staff
3.06      Because BNT has no specific fisheries credit staff, it would
employ under the project additional credit supervisors and equip them with
miotor vehicles to carry out creditworthiness apDraisals of applicants and
subsequent loan supervision for enforcement of tïmely repayments. More
details are outlined in paragraph 4.06.
Iraining
3.07      The skipper, in most cases the boat ovner, is the key to successful
f4±shing. He must be acquainted with his new boat and know how to handle and
maintain it for increased and sustained production. To improve the skills
and competence of skippers, short-term training courses for project benefi-
ciaries would be organized regularly by FPD throughout the project period.
Earticipation in training courses would be a condition of effectiveness of
loan agreements between BNT and fishermen (para 4.07).
3.08      To improve local knowledge of modern boat design, the project
would provide for overseas training of the Tunisian counterpart of the
rtaval architect in FPD. The duration of training would be 12 months and
would take place at appropriate shipyards in the Mediterranean area. Assur-
ances have been obtained during negotiations that overseas training arrange-
nients satisfactory to IDA would be made by DSP.
C. Cost Estimates
3.09      Tunisian boatyards are expected to win boat construction contracts
tmder international competitive bidding (para 3.15)  Project cost estimates
are, therefore, based on domestic awards for all boats to be constructed
under the project. According to the most probable outcome of bids, total
project costs are estimated at about D 1.6 million (US$3.1 million), of which
about D 1.0 million (US$2.0 million), about 64% of total project costa, would
be in foreign exchange. Project cost estimates, shown in detail in Annex 7,
are summarized below:

3.10      Estimates of boat construction costs are based on quotations of
local boatyards. They include CIF costs of wood, nails, accessories and
diesel engines, to which have been added duties and local costs of handling,
transport, installation and labor. Costs of fishin- gear, vehicles for
supporting services and spare parts are based on CIF and local costs incurred
on imports. Costs of local staff reflect preserLc government pay scales;
those assumed for specialists recruited abroad are considered adequate to
attract suitably qualified and experienced men. Contingencies (about 10%)
have been added to allow for likely price increases of about 4% per year over
the 4-year investment period. In the unlikely event that all awards go to
foreign bidders, estimated foreign exchange costs would go up by about US$0.46
million (Annex 7, Table 3).
D. Financing
3.11      An IDA credit of US$2.0 million would finance the foreign exchange
costs of the project. The proposed project financing is summarized in the
following table:

3.12      To encourage inshore fish production, Government would provide
grants to fishermen to cover 15% of investments in fully equipped motorized
inshore boats. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
Government would contribute to project costs about D 370,500 (US$705,800)
as follows: about D 206,300 (US$393,000) in grants to fishermen and about
D 164,200 (US$313,000) to DSP for technical supporting services.
3.13      Fishermen would provide about D 137,500 (US$262,000) from their
own resources, equivalent to 10% of investments in motorized boats and gear.
The cost of diesel spare parts, about D 47,000 (US$89,000), would be financed
by spare parts importers out of their own financial resources. The funds
which IDA would disburse for the import of spare parts would, therefore, not
be on-lent to spare parts importers. Part of these IDA funds would be kept
by Government to finance technical assistance, while the remainder would be
part of Government's loan to BNT.



- 13 -
IDA Contributiàn
3.14      GovernLent would be the borrower of US$2.0 million of IDA funds
on standard terms and would assume the foreign exchange risk. Under a sub-
sidiary loan agreement, Governnent would (a) on-lend about US$1,830,000 of
IDA funds and (b) lend about US$130,000 of Government's own funds to BNT
for 15 years, including 5 years' grace, at 3% annual interest. The total
of about US$1.96 million would cover 75% of the cost of fishing boats, in-
cluding gear. BNT would on-lend these IDA and Government funds to fisher-
men at not less than 6% annual interest. Under the subsidiary loan agree-
ment, Government would assumte 50% of any losses due to default by sub-
borrowers. These conditions should make fisheries credits sufficiently
attractive to BNT (para 2.28). Detailed terms and conditions of subloans
are given in paragraph 4.07. The balance of the IDA funds, about US$170,000,
would remain with Government and would be used to finance supporting serv-
ices. Any savings on project costs would be used to provide additional
credit for inshore boats. It would be a condition of effectiveness of the
IDA credit that the subsidiary loan agreement between Goverument and BNT
had become effective in a form satisfactory to IDA.
E. Procurement
3.15      Bulk procurement of inshore fishing boats would be handled by DSP
on behalf of fishermen participating in BNT's lending program, following
international competitive biddi.ng procedures.  Participation in bidding for
boats is expected from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. However,
Tunisian boat builders (para 2.18) are expected to win all boat bids, mainly
due to avoidance of expensive sea freight costs.  B-4 documents, including
detailed boat designs, standards and specifications (para 3.03), would be
prepared by the naval architect in FPD, who woWld also assist in bid evalua-
tion and supervision of construction. Assurances have been obtained during
negotiations that Tunisian bidders would be allowed a preference margin
equivalent to the existing level of customs duties on imported boats (pres-
ently 11%) and marine diesel engines (presently 13%) or 15% of CIF values,
whichever is lower.
3.16      DSP would invite bids for the delivery of about 335 inshore
boats, spread over a period of about three years, according to
expected inflow of loan applications by fishermen as estimated at
the time of bid issue. (The estimated time schedule for executing the
project is shown in Annex 8.) Initially, firm bids would be invited for a
total of not less than 50 boats, but, in order to encourage participation
by the smaller (but not too small) Tunisian boat builders, bids would be
accepted for less than the total number of boats provided the boat builder
could supply not less than 10 boats within a 12 month period. In order to
help ensure effective local bidding and standardization of diesel engines -
the latter being important for setting up satisfactory maintenance and
spare parts services in the likelihooa that Tunisian boat yards would win
all boat bids - the following bids would be invited simultaneously: (a)



- 14 -
internationally, including fr_o Tunisia, for complete inshore fishing
boats; (b) from Tunisian boat yards only, for inshore fishing boat hulls,
including cost of installing marine diesel engines; and (c) internationally,
£ncluding from Tunisia, for marine diese' engines to be installed in
Tunisian hulls. Contracts weuld be awarded se as to obtain the cheapest
evaluated complete boat.
3.17      Suppliers would be carefully screened as there is no interna-
tional market for, nor large-scale production of, wooden inshore boats in
the Mediterranean area. This would involve evaluation of suppliers'
construction capacities, technical abilities and financial standing.
Conditions for qualifications would include firm assurances by suppliers
to provide a one-year warranty on hulls and engines; and adequate hull and
engine repair facilities and spare parts inventories for diesel engines at
suitable locations in Tunisia throughout the period of the lending program.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that procurement pro-
cedures would be as outlined in this paragraph and paragraphs 3.15 and 3.16;
and that prequalification of suppliers, if any, and bid documents and
contract awards would be subject to prior IDA approval.
3.18      As fishing gear has to suit varying local conditions and fish re-
sources, it is not suitable for bulk procurement. Fishermen would therefore
obtain imported fishing gear of their choice through existing trade channels.
Also, the vehicles for supporting services would be locally purchased as
there would be too few for an international contract. Suppliers of fishing
gear and vehicles from Bank Group countries and Switzerland are sufficiently
trepresented in Tunisia, assuring satisfactory local competition. Assurances
have been obtained during negotiations that Government would promptly take
ill measures to permit importation of boats, boat building materials,
equipment, gear and spare parts on certification by DSP that the imports are
required to carry out the project.
F. Disbursement
3.19      Disbursement of the IDA credit would be made against 90% of dis-
bursed subloans for the purchase of motorized boats and gear by BNT, equiva-
lent to foreign exchange costs of boats and gear; and against 100% of
foreign exchange costs of:
(a) personnel recruited abroad and overseas training by DSP;
(b) vehicles imported by DSP and BNT; and
(c) diesel engine spare parts imported by suppliers' agents.
Disbursement requests would be supported by either certified statements and
documents of BNT's subloan disbursements; or certified statements of forelgn
exchange expenditure; or import documents for vehicles and spare parts.
BNT's disbursements to subborrowers would take about 3 years (Annex 4, Table 5).



- 15 -
3.20      Disbursement of the IDA credit is expected to take 4-1/2 years,
approximately as follows:

A schedule of estimated disbursements, by quarters, is given in Annex 9.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Fisheries Project Division
4.01      Standards of inshore fisheries technology and training would be
improved through advisory services provided by DSP. The technical personnel
required for the advisory services would be recruited by DSP to work in a
Fisheries Project Division (2Pf) under the direct responsibility of the
Director of Fisheries Services. DSP, its field organization and training
institutions are efficiently managed (para 2.21). The Project Organization
Chart is presented in Annex 10.
4.02      FPD would have important functions.  It would be responsible for
the technical examination, approval and supervision of loan applications,
while BNT would execute the financial appraisals. Technical loan supervi-
sion would also improve use and maintenance of boats and gear provided under
the project. FPD would also be responsible for preparing detailed boat de-
signs (para 3.03), tendering and awarding bids (para 3.15) and supervising
boat construction. In addition, FPD would organize training courses for
project beneficiaries (para 3.07). An important feature of the training
of fishermen would be teaching of responsibilities and obligations under
the proposed credit scheme.
4.03      To ensure introduction of modern inshore fisheries techniques,
FDP would be staffed initially by three qualified experts, assisted by local
counterparts and support staff. The Chief of the project who would report
directly to the Director of Fisheries, would be a production-oriented in-
shore fisheries specialist, having practical experience in modern inshore
fishing technology, training, organization, and operation, with particular
emphasis on fisheries credit development. He would be assisted by a naval
architect, having experience in designing inshore boats, organizing boat



- 16 -
building, selecting suitable construction. materials and equipment, and ex-
ecuting tendering procedures; and a master-carpenter with practical ex-
perience in boat building methods and supervision of construction. The
Tunisian counterpart of the naval arch4tect would receive overseas training
(para 3.08). Three experienced fisheries officers would be responsible for
technical field appraisal and supervision of subborrowers.  Estimated periods
of employment are indicated in Annex 8.
4.04      Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that qualifica-
tions and terms of employment of the Chief of the project, the naval
arChitect and the master-carpenter would be satisfactory to IDA.  It would
be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit that FPD had been esta-
blished; and that the Chief of the project, the naval architect, their two
counterparts and the three fisheries officers had been employed.
B. National Bank of Tunisia
4.05      BNT would be the channel for credit to participating fishermen
under the project. BNT is encountering difficulties in the administration
of government-guaranteed fisheries loans and collection of amounts due (FOSEP
- see para 2.25). These deficiencies would need correction prior to com-
mencement of lending under the proposed project involving scrutinizing ex-
isting securities, taking additional guarantees whenever possible, enforcing
insurance of boats by subborrowers and introducing strict repayment criteria
similar to those proposed under the project (para 4.07 and Annex 11). As-
surances have been obtained during negotiations that BNT's existing fisheries
loans under government guarantee would be reviewed and rectified, with
emphasis on enforcing early repaynents of amounts overdue prior to commence-
ment of the lending program under the project.
4.06      To ensure effective lending operations for the fisheries sector,
BNT's fisheries credit administration would need strengthening through em-
ploynent of additional loan appraisers and supervisors (para 3.06). They
would review and rectify existing fisheries loans; appraise loan applications
under the project; and closely supervise repayments by subborrowers. As-
surances have been obtained from BNT during negotiations that:
(a)  a senior officer in BNT's head office would be charged
with responsibility for the fisheries lending program;
(b) full-time loan appraisers/supervisors, of assistant branch
manager authority, would be appointed to the program
throughout its life and would be provided with suitable
motor transport -- there would be one such officer for each
100 fisheries loans under the project with a minimum of
two; and



- 17 -
(c) an agreement satisfactory to IDA would be entered into
with Government whereby the Fisheries Project Division in
DSP would carry out technical appraisals of all fisheries
loan applications and subsequent technical supervision
of subborrowers under the project.
It would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit that the
senior officer and two loan appraisers/supervisors had been appointed by
BNT, and that the agreement had been implemented between BNT and Government.
4.07      BNT's fisheries loan policies and procedures under the project
would be substantially changed from those now in effect.  In conjunction with
FPD's technical appraisal, BNT would make the final decision on loan ap-
proval based on a detailed appraisal of each applicant's creditworthiness,
including cash flows of his current and future operation, based on operating
costs, catch rates and fish prices at his home base. Loans would become
effective only when applicants had participated in a DSP training course
(para 3.07); had made a downpayment of 10% of investment costs; and Govern-
ment had made available its 15% grant contribution towards investment costs
(para 3.12). Loans would not exceed 75% of proposed investments, with a
maximum term of eight years, including a 3-month grace period, and at an
annual interest of not less than 6%; Government would carry 50% of the
default risk of outstanding amounts (para 3.14). Repayments of principal
and interest would be in monthly installments. Covenants of loan agreements
between BNT and subborrowers would include that boats would be mortgaged to
BNT and adequately insured by subborrowers during the loan period, naming
BNT as beneficiary.
4.08      Assurances have been obtained during ne;v_1ations that BNT would
follow appraisal and lending procedures and cerms for inshore fisheries
loans as outlined in paragraph 4.07 and detai.ed in Annex 11, paragraphs 5
through 8. Further, an understanding was reached with Government during
negotiations that the various subsidy elements - e.g. direct grant, interest
rates, assumption of default risk by government - are to be regarded as
transitory measures. Prior to the end of ;;l-e disbursement period of the
credit, Government would review inshore fisheries credit policies in con-
sultation with IDA and in the lîght of the experience gained under the
project, for the purpose of revising all subsidy elements in the inshore
fisheries sector, with a view to implementing market oriented credit policies
and to increasing reliance on the private sector for financing fisheries
development. It vould be a condition of effectiveness of the credit that
Government had taken legal action to bring the credit terms and conditions
under FOSEP for motorized inshore boats into line with those under the
project, as outlined in paragraph 4.07.
C. Accounts and Audit
4.09      BNT's accounting methods are satisfactory, and accounts are audited
by two independent auditors, presently Messrs. Abdelhamid Bouricha and
Abderraouf Sanhaji, Tunis. In addition, BNT is supervised by the Central



- 18 -
Bank and a financial controller represents Governnent in BNT board meetings.
Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that:
(a)  separate accounts would be kept of loans made under the
project;
(b)  independent auditors, satisfactory to IDA, would continue
to audit BNT's accounts; and
(c)  audited accounts, and the auditors' reports thereon, would
be forwarded to IDA within 4 months of the close of
BNT's financial year.
V. PRODUCTION, PRICES, MARKETS AND OPERATING RESULTS
A. Production, Prices and Markets
5.01      The expected average catch rate for a 9.5-m boat would be about
14.5 tons per year. This estimate is based on about 130 trips, each of
about 48 hours duration, and an average catch per trip of about 112 kg.
The expected catch rate has been based on recorded rates achieved by exist-
iLng motorized boats of comparable size and estimated increments due to im-
proved efficiency of new boats (Annex 5, para 7 and Table 1). For the
i-irst year of operation a lower catch rate of 12.7 tons has been estimated
to account for an adaption period. Based on these assumptions, annual fish
production of the project fleet would develop as follows:
Year 5 and
Year 1   Year 2   Year 3   Year 4   Thereafter
Boats in Operation                -        65       190       335          335
Production (tons)
Replacement                    -        112       790     1,672        2,211
Additional                      -       136       946     2,004        2,647
Total                       -        248    1,736      3,676        4,858
Value of Total Production
D (thousands)                   -        61       425       901        1,190
US$ (thousands)                -        116       810     1,717        2,267
rhe additional production of new boats, about 2,600 tons at project maturity,
would be due to increaaed boat sizes, about 38%; and improved efficiency,
about 62% (Annex 5, Table 1). Almost all of the production would be for
immediate local consumption; a small portion, mainly highly valued species,
is expected to be exported (Annex 3).



- 19 -
5.02      Based on fish auction records, a  producer price of D 245 (US$467)
per ton of inahore fish has been coneervatively estimated for the project's
financial rate of return calculations(Annex 12, Table 1). Because of rising
demand for animal protein, increasing income and expanding tourism, present
price levels of Tunisian inshore fish are not expected to fall during the
next decade and no marketing constraints are expected to arise (Annex 3).
B. Financial Returns
5.03      At the estimated catch rate of 14.5 tons per year and the ex-
pected producer price of D 245 per ton of inshore fish, the financial rate
of return on the investment in a modern motorized 9.5-m boat would be about
26%, over an expected operating life of 10 years. Even at a producer price
as low as D 200 per ton of fish, the financial rate of return would still be
about 14%. As Government would provide grants to fishermen equal to 15% of
investment costs in motorized inshore boats, the real investment by fishermen
vould be lower. Financial rates of return on investment net of Government's
contribution, would be 31% at the expected fish price of D 245 per ton and
19% at the low price of D 200 per ton. These returns should encourage con-
tinued growth of the inshore fishing industry. Cash flow projections show
that boat owners would be able to repay investment credits without undue dif-
ficulty over an 8-year period at 6% annual interest. Details of rates of
return calculations and statements of income and sources and application of
funds are in Annex 12.
5.04      The 2-1/4% interest differential accruing to Government from on-
lending about D 0.96 million (US$1.83 million) of iDA funds to BNT (IDA rate
3/4%, on-lending rate 3%) and proceeds from ;mport duties (about D 120,000 or
US$230,000) collected during the project development period would help to
cover costs of Government's contribution to investments by fishermen, sup-
porting services and the foreign exchange risk. The financial implications
for Government are detailed in Annex 13. The 3% interest differential accru-
ing to BNT (borrowing rate 3%, lending rate 6%) would make it possible for
BNT to build up adequate reserves for risk coverage. Cash flow projections
(Annex 4, Table 5) indicate that fishermen's repayments would generate suffi-
cient inflow to repay to Government the IDA funds within 15 years, including
5 years' grace, and to cover a reasonable degree of unforeseen slippage in
commitments and repayments. Further, BNT would make a net profit of about
D 0.112 million (US$0.213 million) from reinvesting accumulated surplus funds
during the loan period.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The motorized boats to be constructed under the project would re-
place about 335 obsolete boats. If no investments were made, either to re-
place these boats or to overhaul them completely, which would be more costly,
the number of these boats in working condition would decrease practically to



- 20 -
zero within the next four years. The rate of construction of new boats
under the project matches as closely as possible the rate at which the
existing boats to be replaced will become unserviceable (Annex 5).  The full
catch of the new boats has therefore been allocated as an economic benefit
to the project.
6.02      The economic rate of return of the project is 21% when labor is
fully costed according to the prevailing catch-share system at 45% of net
sales revenues (after deducting food and fuel expenses) of an expected
annual catch of 14.5 tons per new boat. The economic rate of return in-
creases to 36% if the labor share is calculated on a catch rate of 10.0 tons
per year, which has been recorded by existing traditional boats, comparable
in size to proposed modern boats. A detailed economic evaluation is in
Annex 14.
6.03      The project would offer improved income opportunities to some
1,300 fishermen at present engaged in less efficient inshore fisheries and
generate about 300 new jobs. It would also provide valuable training and
professional experience to skippers, mechanics and crews for further
expansion of inshore fisheries after project termination. Under expected
domestic awards, the boat construction program, with technical assistance
provided to boatbuilders under the project, would enable Tunisian boatyards
to operate in a balanced and efficient manner for a period of about 3 years.
Ihis would ensure satisfactory utilization of existing boat construction
capacities during this period and generate a total of about 225 man-years
cf employment for supervisory, skilled and semi-skilled jobs. At termination
cf construction, the benefits of improved techniques would remain with local
boatyards.
6.04      The project would provide a valuable addition to animal protein
supplies, substituting for imports. It would also increase production of
21 small quantity of highly valued species suitable for export and consumption
in Tunisia's growing tourist industry. At full development, the project
would result in a net foreign exchange saving of about US$2 million per year.
6.05      Finally, through strengthened management and organization the
project would provide valuable experience to BNT as the lending channel in the
fisheries credit operation. It would help to introduce credit discipline
in an important part of Tunisia's fisheries, thus preparing the sector for
expanded credit on a financially sound basis.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following prin-
cipal points:



- 21 -
(a)  designs and specifications of motorized inshore fishing boats
would be satisfactory to IDA (para 3.03);
(b)  bulk procurement of motorized inshore boats, boat hulls and
diesel engines would be as outlined in paragraphs 3.15 to
3.17;
(c)  qualifications and terms and conditions of employment of ex-
perts recruited for the Fisheries Project Division in DSP
would be satisfactory to IDA (para 4.04);
(d)  existing fisheries loans would be reviewed and rectified
prior to commencement of the lending program under the proj-
ect (para 4.05);
(e)  BNT would employ staff for financial appraisal and supervision
of fisheries loans as outlined in paragraph 4.06; and
(f)  BNT would follow appraisal and lending procedures as outlined
in paragraph 4.07 and Annex 11, paragraphs 5-8; and, prior to
the end of the disbursement period of the credit, inshore
fisheries credit policies would be reviewed in consultation
with IDA for the purpose of revising subsidy elements and of
implementing market-oriented credit policies (para 4.08).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit would be
that:
(a)  a subsidiary loan agreement between Government and BNT had
become effective in a form satisfactory to IDA (para 3.14);
(b)  a Fisheries Project Division had been established within DSP;
and the chief of the project, the naval architect, their two
counterparts and three field officers had been appointed
(para 4.04);
(c)  a senior officer of BNT's fisheries lending program and
two loan appraisers-supervisors had been appointed; and
arrangements satisfactory to IDA had been finalized whereby
DSP would carry out technical appraisals for BNT (para 4.06);
and
(d)  Government had taken legal action to bring the credit terms
and conditions under FOSEP for motorized inshore boats into
line with those under the project (para 4.08).
7.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$2 million, on
standard terms. The borrower would be the Governnent, which would carry the
foreign exchange risk.

ANNEX 2
Page 1
TUNISIA
FISHERIES PROJECT
Existing Motorized Inshore Fishing Boats
1.        Most of the motorized boats range from 5 to Il m in length.
They make up 46% of the total fleet in the northern coastal area, and only
9% in the south. The motorized boats are almost all of the same shape and
arrangement: the so-called "Martigane" or Mediterranean type, double-ended,
with continuous deck, a long hatch-opening for the engine, and with crew
space over the middle portion. This boat type is a direct development from
sailing boats.
2.        All the boats are built of wood, with sawn frames and rounded
bottom.  Frames and deck beams are made of naturally bent eucalyptus from
Tunisia, and often the keel stem and stern pieces are also made of eucalyptus.
The hull and deck planking is made of red fir imported from Scandinavia or
Russia.
3.        According to the type and duration of fishing operations, most
of the motorized fleet can be roughly divided into two groups:
(a) The small boats, 4.5 to 7 m in length, which stay at sea less
than a day, generally carry a crew of 3 including skipper.
They fish usually with tra mel nets on average composed of 10-18
pieces of net 1/. The yearly catch of this type of boat averages
about 3 to 5 tons.
(b)  The larger boats, from 7 to 11 m in length, stay at sea usually
one day, but never more than two days, and carry 4 to 5 men.
They use trammel nets composed of 18-25 pieces, some of them
long lines composed of 7 baskets with 120-125 hooks each. Catches
by these boats average 6 to 9 tons a year.
Defects
4.        Construction.  Fastening of planks is with galvanized round nails
and without bolts between frames and keel, which is generally unsatisfactory.
The shape of the stern, although suitable for a sailing boat, is too narrow
for engine installations; this means that the engine has to be placed too
far forward and as a result the propeller is often not properly immersed.
l/   A trammel net is a flat net that has sinkers on one edge and floats on
the other suspended vertically in the water, having 3 layers with the
middle one fine-meshed, so that fish passing through either outer net
are pocketed and entangled as they seek to withdraw. Dimensions: 50-60 m
long and 1.5 m deep; mesh size about 24 mm.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        Engine power.  Many boats have too powerful engines.  Boat owners
believe that extra power is a safety factor and gives more speed. But in
fact, when, for instance, a 10.5-m boat receives a 55-hp engine instead of a
30-to 40-hp engine, speed increase is marginal, while investment and operating
expenses are higher. In addition, the danger of swamping the stern when
breakers come from aft is increased, since stronger engine pull makes the
stern sink deeper.
6.        Accommodation.  Existing boats have no crew accommodation.  Living
quarters for crew are not required on the smaller boats which stay no more
than a day at sea, but on the larger boats, where the crew sleeps on board,
this is inconvenient and the lack of proper accommodation increases the
tendency of fishermen to shorten their trips at sea.
7.        Eguipment.  The boats have no mechanical hauling device for their
lines or nets. For smaller boats this is not necessary, as deck space is
small and would not allow the handling of more fishing gear than is now
carried. For larger boats, however, the lack of mechanical haulers restricts
t:he number of net units which can be set.
8.        Fish Storage.  None of the existing inshore boats store their
c:atches below deck. Instead of a fish-hold, the boats carry on deck a roughly
made wooden box with a capacity ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mn3 in which fish is
stored.  The box is not insulated and hardly any ice is left when the boats
return to port.  This arrangement has obvious disadvantages.  The large box
clutters the working area on deck and its lack of insulation affects the
quality of the landed fish.
I)istribution of Boats by Age
9.        Based on a 1968/69 survey, the distribution by age of the motorized
iLnshore fleet is as follows:
Age Class
Less than   5 to 10   10 to 15  15 to 20 Older than
5 Years     Years      Years      Years   20 Years   Total
…----- ------------Number of Boats---------------------
118        186       104          77      109        594
Forty-nine percent of existing boats are over 10 years old and the average
replacement rate over the last 5 years has been only 3.9% per annum.
10.       The reasons for this are as follows:
(a)* Until 1966, the action of ONP to improve marketing of the catch
of inshore boats had not yet made its full impact on inshore
fisheries development.
(b)  Since the time when marketing probleis vere solved, credit
facilities for boat replacement have been insufficient.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(c) The trawling and light attraction fisheries were organized into
production cooperatives.  At the same time, the inshore fishery
was organized into service cooperatives, but most boat owners
feared that this was only a first step toward collectivization of
inshore boats.
Overhauling and Replacement
11.       Motorized fishing boats such as those which comprise the Tunisian
inshore fleet have a normal operating life of 10 years, provided boats and
engines are carefully maintained. After this period, a major overhall
becomes necessary if the boats are to be kept in operating condition. Such
an overhaul may include extensive repairs to hulls and involve the replace-
ment or rebuilding of the engines. To naintain the inshore fishing fleet in
operating condition, the average rate of renewal or of complete overhaul
should therefore be 10%.
12.       In some cases, it may be more economical to the boat owner to
overhaul the boat, but more often overhauling proves more costly than
complete replacement. It is difficult for boat owners to appreciate which
of these alternatives is more profitable, and credit operations for over-
hauling boats are risky. For this reason, a credit scheme for the rehabili-
tation of the Tunisian inshore fleet should include only provisions for
complete boat replacement and should exclude boat overhauling or engine
replacement.
13.       The age of a boat hull, which may have received extensive repairs
and have been completely overhauled, is not a good indication of the operating
condition of a motorized boat. Age of engine provides a better indication
because generally, when an engine is replaced, the hull is also overhauled.
Distribution of the boats in the fleet, according to engine age, is as
follows (1968/69 survey):
Engine Age
Less than 5 to 10 10 to 15 15 to 20 Older than
5 Years    Years     Years      Years   20 Years   Total
…___________----…Nunber of Boats…---…---------------
151       245       133        42        23        594
(a) lhe less-than-5-year class is composed of 118 new boats
and 33 old boats which have received a new engine. It can
be assumed that their hulls have been overhauled at the same
time.
(b)  The 5-to-10-year class comprises 181 boats constructed 5 to
10 years ago and 64 boats which have been overhauled during
the same period.
(c) The other classes are composed of boats whose engines and hulls
have been repaired (othervise they would not be in operating
condition), but whose engines have not been replaced.

TUNISIA
FISHERIES PROJECT
Fish Marketing
1.        Inshore fishery production leads all other types of fishing in
value and weight of Tunisia's landed catches (Annex 1). Nearly all inshore
fishery produce is classified as luxurious flsh for which high prices are paid
throughout the year. Almost all of the inshore catch is marketed as fresh
fish and consumed mainly by the urban population and tourists.
2.        From 1958 to 1969, fish marketing vas practically controlled by
the National Office of Fisheries (Office National des Peches-ONP). Only a
small part of the total production escaped ONP's marketing monopoly. Sub-
sistence production and fish sold directly by the fishermen to restaurants
and consumers probably did not exceed more than 10% of total production
between 1960 and 1966. In 1967 and 1968, marketing through other channels
increased to about 20% because a few service cooperatives were authorized to
market their catch directly.
3.        From 1964 to 1969, producer, wholesale and retail fish prices vere
set by Governmient twice a year. Prices varied according to species and
quality. A margin of 30% of retail prices was allocated to ONP (14%), the
service cooperatives (10%), the Government (3%) and municipalities (3%).
The latter two shares vere taxes, used partly for financing fishermen's
training. In some cases service cooperatives received a margin of 24%
between producer and retail prices.
4.        In spite of its modest margin, ONP managed to develop a modern,
countrywide marketing system. A network of collection centers vas established
all along the coast where ice and other supplies vere sold to fishermen on
easy terms and where holding rooms vere built for temporary storage. The
agency secured a fleet of trucks that picked up fish from the centers for
delivery to central points, its main depots and retailers. In addition,
ONP built up an extensive retail network throughout the country, comprising
more than 300 retail shops or stalle in municipal markets or elsewhere
(see Map).
5.        The shift in Tunisia's economic policy towards free enterprise led
to a complete liberalization of the fish trade in September 1969. Wholesalers
and exporters of fish who had discontinued their business 10 years earlier
immediately entered the market again. ONP disposed of its retail system, in
most cases to its sales employees.
6.        Fish price controls vere also removed and landed fish is nov sold
at daily auctions, where both ONP and private buyers bid. The auction places



ANNEX 3
Page 2
are controlled by municipalities or other local bodies. Average prices to
both fishermen and consumers have increased by 20-30%, mainly because
fixed prices did not reflect the market situation under constant shortage
of supply. In addition, the price rise has been attributed to decreased
supplies of other types of animal protein and to increased demand for quality
fish from the growing tourist industry.
7.        Although ONP's marketing activities have decreased considerably
since the end of 1969, the marketing system built up by ONP continues to
provide the backbone of fish marketing in Tunisia. Table 1 shows, by
province, the capacity of existing cold storage. Table 2 shows location
and production capacity of 22 existing ice-making plants (see Map). Also,
ONP continues to operate twenty 20-ton insulated trucks, twenty-one 10-ton
refrigerated trailers and ten 1.5-ton delivery vans.
8.        The 1969 per capita fish consumption in Tunisia vas about 6.0 kg.
lhere is, however, a significant difference in fish quantities consumed
per capita in urban areas and rural areas, where meat consumption dominates.
The per capita consumption of animal protein related to the per capita
income ranks very low. Assuming that there will be no significant fish and
meat price changes, FAO estimates the income elasticity of fish demand in
1unisia at 1.0 for the decade 1970 to 1980. Taking into account anticipated
income increases, the demand per capita per annum is projected to increase
- rom 6 kg in 1969 to 12.7 kg in 1980. The market outlook for fresh inshore
fish for local consumption vould be favorable and no marketing constraints
are expected under the project.
9.        The outlook for exports of inshore fish is more difficult to predict.
During past years exports of fresh inshore fish included some selected species,
lobster and squid, mainly to Italy and France, comprising about 5% of the
landed catch in terms of veight and about 20% in terms of value. There is,
however, growing demand from the tourist industry for quality fish which is
now exported. This might lead to lower exports of fresh inshore fish in
fEuture. There have been no imports of inshore fish into Tunisiea.

FISHERIES PROJECT
National Bank of Tunisia
General
1.        The National Bank of Tunisia (Banque Nationale de Tunisie-BNT) was
established by government initiative in 1959. Its primary objective is to
promote agricultural development by providing short-, medium- and long-term
loans, but it also carries on all normal banking and financial operations.
It can also make equity investments in industrial and agricultural enterprises.
BNT's share in agricultural credit was 92% in 1969. BNT has expanded rapidly
over its l1-year existence; it has taken some risk during this period of
growth.
2.        BNT's initial capital of D 0.4 million has been increased to D 2.0
million, of which D 1.6 million was paid-in by 1970 as follows:
Government                                       25.0%
Public Corporations and Cooperatives             35.7%
Mutual Credit Institutions                       23.7%
Private Shareholders                             15.6%
100.0%
Resources
3.        BNT relies on the following resources:
(a) Own resources. They include its paid-in capital of D 1.6
million and reserves, which reached about D 1.2 million as
of December 31, 1970.
(b) Deposits. They have increased each year since 1959. As
of December 31, 1970, they amounted to D 17.9 million de-
mand deposits and 7.1 million term deposits.
(c) Rediscounting. BNT had D 1.3 million of outstanding dis-
counted bills as of December 31, 1970.
Special Funds
4.        BNT administers several funds for various agricultural activities,
including fisheries, made available by Government or external agencies and
guaranteed by Government. As of December 31, 1970, the total amount of
special funds was D 17.7 million (Table 1).



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Uses of Resources
5.        Since demand deposits form its largest single resource, BNT follows
a policy of investing its own resources essentially in short-term loans. An
exception to this policy was, however, made in favor of STIL 1/, a corporation
largely controlled, managed and financed by BNT until the end of 1969. As
cf March 15, 1970, loans outstanding to STIL amounted to D 2.7 million, of
which D 1.0 million was for short-term and D 1.7 million for medium- and
long-term lending.
6.        As of December 31, 1970, BNT's equity participations amounted to
iD 0.393 million.  Of this amount, D 54,320 of bad investments is fully covered
by reserves and D 38,000 is 50% covered. According to the regulations of the
Central Bank of Tunisia, bank equity participations should be limited to 20%
of the capital of any single enterprise. BNT exceeds this percentage for
STIL and for another corporation. This situation would be rectified under
the recently approved Bank/IDA agricultural credit project. Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations of that project.
7.        Special funds are generally invested by BNT in medium- and long-
term loans. There is a difference between the total amount borrowed
(D 17.685 million) and investments (D 14.921 million), as shown in BNT's
1970 statements, which is due partly to a USAID loan (Table 1). The total
owed to USAID on December 31, 1970 was D 1.5 million, while outstanding loans
made with these funds amounted to only D 0.4 million. This low utilization
results from the conditions of this loan under which BNT's clients pay 7%
annual interest, the highest rate charged by BNT for agricultural loans.
Other loans made from special funds are extended on concessionary terms to
stimulate various developments. They include a special fund for the fish-
eries sector (Fonds Special d'Encouragement a la Peche-FOSEP) which was set
up in 1967. As a whole, repayments of loans granted from special funds have
been poor, including fisheries credits made available through FOSEP (Table 3).
8.        Farming cooperatives were financed with BNT's normal resources,
USAID, Government and Bank/IDA funds (484/99-Tun, 1967; US$ 12 million Bank
and US$ 6 million IDA). Following the reduction in number of cooperatives in
September 1969, the Bank/IDA and Government agreed in November 1970 to
reschedule the debt to be repaid. A D 2.6 million debt of dissolved coopera-
tives will be repaid by Government according to BNT's needs. A D 3.4 million
debt of the remaining cooperatives will be repaid partly (D 1.5 million) by
Government in 5 annual installments, commencing June 30, 1971 and partly
(D 1.9 million) by cooperatives, also in 5 annual installments.

marketing, fruit and vegetable canning and marketing, and related activ-
ities.



ANNEX 4

Interest Rates
9.        On average, BNT lends its own resources at 6% per annum.  Overdrawn
current accounts pay 7% per annum and BNT charges an additional 2% on delin-
quent balances. Interest rates on special funds' loans are generally low,
3-4%, vary from fund to fund and do not reflect the real cost of capital.
Further, under present FOSEP arrangements BNT's remuneration for fisheries
credits amounts to 2% of actual repayments, which is inadequate. In 1969,
BNT received the extremely low commission of D 57 for the administration of
FOSEP, which did not even cover its stationery expenses.
BNT's Financial Structure
10.  BNT has been able to increase its demand and term deposits from
D 16.6 million in 1966 to D 25.1 million in 1970, but these resources have
been used, in part, to finance short-term loans to cooperatives, and long-
term loans to STIL. BNT's liquidity position was not satisfactory as of
December 31, 1970 (Tables 1 and 2). Short-term liabilities exceed current
assets by D 1.9 million (ratio 0.95:1). BNT's financial situation as of
December 31, 1970 (Table 2) is summarized below (D millions):
Current Assets                   34.1    Current Liabilities              36.0
Medium- and Long-term                     Medium- and Long-term

14.9                                    17.7
62.9                                    62.9
Financial Results
11.       In spite of low interest rates, BNT has had good earnings mainly
because of the low costs of its resources. Also, most high risk lendings
were guaranteed by Government under special funds. Five percent dividends
on capital have been paid consistently since BNT's inception and balances of
net profits were transferred to various reserves. There was a small decline
in earnings in 1969 and 1970 due to an increase in operating expenses and a
change in accounting procedures, whereby interest on loans is not charged
until collection. In addition, since 1969, BNT has to pay an income tax
(Table 4).



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Proj ect Requirements
12.       The cash-flow projections (Table 5) assume that Government would
on-lend to BNT, at an interest rate of 3% per annum, 100% of the funds
required for loans to fishermen. Government would lend these funds for
15 years including a grace period of 5 years. BNT would lend to fishermen
at 6Z, for 8 years.  Consequently, from year 4 to year 10, BNT would have a
substantial annual surplus. It is assumed that BNT would invest these
funds at least at 5% interest, equal to the discounting rate of the Central
Bank. At this rate BNT would get about D 210,000 in profits from having the
cimulative surplus at its disposal. This would be adequate to cover the risk
of fisheries loans and unforeseen slippage in repayments by fishermen.
Administration, Management and Loan Supervision
13.       BNT is administered by a 9-member board whose members serve for
6--year periods. The Board is chaired by the general manager, 3 members
represent Government, 3 are from government controlled corporations and
cooperatives, and 2 are private members. Lines of authority are well
defined and personnel conditions are stable. BNT is a well established
inistitution with a good coverage of the country through its network of 25
branches including 2 in Tunis. BNT has 522 employees -- 289 at headquarters,
130 in its branches and 103 on loan to other credit institutions (Caisses
Locales de Credit Mutuel).
14.       BNT has substantial experience in short-term agricultural lending,
but its capabilities in project evaluation are limited. This is mainly
be!cause it has used mostly government funds at Government's risk for medium-
arLd long-term lending operations, and because project evaluation and final
atLthorization have been handled by Ministry of Agriculture technicians. The
loans to fishermen, granted on FOSEP resources, have not been properly ap-
praised and supervised and repayment procedures are not appropriate (Annex
11). Under the project, additional staff of loan appraisers and supervisors
specialized in fisheries credit would be employed.
Account and Audits
15.       BNT has a satisfactory accounting organization; a computer was in-
stalled in 1969 which allowed the introduction of new controls to follow up
loan repayments. Internal audit is carried out by a separate BNT section
whLich is directly responsible to the Chairman. Shareholders elect 2 auditors
(Commissaires aux Comptes) at their annual general meeting. Government
appoints a financial controller (controleur financier) charged with the
protection of Government's interest in BNT. As a bank, BNT is subject
to the usual Central Bank supervision.

/1   Based on survey 1968/69; see Annex 2.
/2   Loans for motorized inshore boats by BNT, effective and approved as of
December 15, 1970.
The project would provide about 335 new boats over a four-year investment
period, thus covering most of Tunisia's urgent replacement needs.
Proposed Inshore Boats
2.        Size and equipment of boats to be constructed under the project
would be standardized. This would result in lower costs, simpler procure-
ment and easier maintenance. Boats now ranging from about 5-11 m in overall
length will be replaced by boats about 9.5 m long at waterline (about 9.0 m
keel length) powered with diesel engines of 35-40 hp. This is somewhat
larger than the average size of existing boats (Table 1), but the new boats
will have increased speed and give better performance. Further, more than 90%
of loan applications approved or pending with BNT request credit for boats
in the 9-10 m range. Also, an analysis has shown (Annex 6), that motorization
of small boats would have marginal financial and economic viability.
3.        The proposed boats would make trips lasting about two days.  Most
of the boats under the project would use trammel nets, some of them long



ANNEX 5
Page 2
lines or a combination of both. The fishing gear would be similar to the
gear used by existing boats and consist of at least 30 pieces of trammel net,
which will be handled by simple haulers 1/. The new boats would carry a
crew of five, skipper included, have adequate crew accommodation and an insu-
lated underdeck fish hold of about 1.5 mJ capacity.  Depending on findings of
the FAO-UNDP fisheries project (para 2.23 of the main report), fishermen may
ac:quire fish detection equipment and simple navigational aids later on.
4.        Hulls would be constructed of suitable wood, aiming at lightweight
vessels and equipped with vibration proofed low speed marine diesel engines.
A locally assembled marine diesel engine is likely to qualify under the proi-
ect. Almost all locally produced wood, other construction materials, and ac-
ce'ssories and gear are either not suitable or not available from local sources.
Therefore, construction material and equipment would mainly be imported even
if, as expected, boat-building contracts are awarded locally.
5.        The basic design of existing boats would be retained, but with
improved fastening methods for frames and planking. The stern would be
shaped in a way to allow the engine to be centered, improving buoyancy and
ernsuring proper immersion of the propeller. The deck area would be arranged
tci provide more working space than at present. A sketch of proposed boats is
in Drawing 1.
Other Construction Materials
6.        Although wood is selected as building material, two prototypes
wculd be built in ferrocement and fiberglass to test suitability of these
materials for inshore fishing boats in Tunisia.  Although ferrocement and
fiberglass construction would need the same amount of manpower and material
as wooden boats, they would be cheaper to maintain and last longer, but
would cost more than wooden boats.
Catch Estimates for New Boats
7.        A new boat under the project would carry 30 pieces of trammel net
and catch about 14.5 tons of inshore fish per year, assuming about 130 trips
per year, each of about 48 hours duration at full operation. Allowing for
an adaption period, a rate of 12.7 tons has been assumed during the initial
year of operation. The catch rate estimate has been based on recorded catches
of existing motorized boats of comparable size, older than 10 years. Recorded
catches would increase because of: increased size of new boats compared to
existing average boat sizes; increased numbers of nets that can be set at a
time; extended duration of individual trips due to increased speed by new
boats and provision of crew accommodation; and improved handling at sea. A
comparison of existing and estimated future production is in Table 1.
1/   Existing boats of comparable size carry only 18-25 pieces of net (Annex
2).



ANNEX 5
Page 3
Boat Construction
8.        There is no international market for small wooden inshore boats
and no large-scale production in the Mediterranean region, including Tunisia.
Boatyards building inshore boats are working at artisan level and seldom keep
material and cost records. Within the same country prices may vary consid-
erably from one yard to another. Project cost estimates have been based on
quotations from three Tunisian boatyards for comparable boats (Annex 7, Table
2).
9.        Based on data received from FAO, estimated Tunisian ex-boatyard
prices are about 15-20% higher than Italian and Spanish prices. However,
if boats were constructed outside Tunisia, delivery would be a problem.
Boats would have to be loaded on the deck of a freighter; or would have to
cross by their own means, waiting for favorable weather, carrying extra fuel
tanks, navigation aids and special crews and be specially insured for the
trip. Delivery costs to Tunisia from Italy (Naples) have been estimated by
forwarding agents at US$500-800 per boat, absorbing more than the difference
in ex-boatyard costs. Hence, Tunisian boatyards are expected to win all
construction awards under international competitive bidding.
Need for Technical Assistance
10.       Workmanship of small boatyards constructing wooden inshore boats
is usually adequate in the Mediterranean region, but would need supervision.
Use of detailed construction drawings and plans is generally inadequate.
To ensure standardization of boat design and construction, a qualified naval
architect and a master-carpenter would be employed under the project part-
time. The naval architect would prepare detailed boat designs and specifi-
cations; and be responsible for prequalification of suppliers and procurement
of boats under international competitive bidding. Assisted by the master-
carpenter, the naval architect would also supervise boat construction and
see to it that prescribed specifications are implemented.
Tunisian Boatyards
11.       There are seven relatively well equipped Tunisian boatyards which
construct motorized inshore boats from wood, including larger boats such as
trawlers. They are at present underutilized, but have an estimated total
construction capacity of about 190 motorized inshore boats per year. This
would be sufficient to construct a total of 335 project boats phased over

ANNEX 6
TUNISIA
FISHERIES PROJECT
Financial and Economic Viability of 6.5-m Inshore Boats
1.        In addition to the 9.5-m boats to be constructed under the project,
Government had requested that the project also provide for the construction
of 6.5-m boats. However, the financial and economic rate of return calcula-
tions for the smaller vessels showed them to be financially risky and of
marginal economic viability. The financial rate of return on the small
vessel was computed to be approximately 14%; the economic rate of return was
only 11%. The economic rate of return is lower than the financial rate of
return, because a small boat needs the same allocation for investment in
supporting services as a larger boat with superior production capacity.
2.        This calculation was based upon an expected fish price of D 245
per ton and a catch rate of 7.5 tons per year. The catch rate was based on
the assumption that small boats would be adequately managed. However, since
good management of smaller vessels is less likely than for larger vessels,
a sensitivity test was made in which the catch rate was reduced to 6.8 tons
per year. The financial rate of return at 6.8 tons and D 245 per ton was
8.2%.  The financial sensitivity tests which were run regarding fish prices
and catch rates are summarized below:
Ex-vessel                            Annual Catch
Fish Price                ---------------tons-------------
per Ton                  6.8            7.5             8.1
Dinar                       Financial Rates of Return
200                    (-)            3.1%            7.9%
245                    8.2%          13.7%           17.7%
3.        These returns indicate that the financial viability of smaller
boats is much more subject to small variations in catch and price than that
of bigger boats (Annex 12). This fact, coupled with a low net revenue
flow for smaller boats (approximately D 450 per year before debt service)
led to the exclusion of smaller boats under the project.

FISHERIES PROJECT
Lending Policies and Procedures
A. Present Procedures
1.        Under existing procedures, fishermen apply for loans to local
branches of the National Bank of Tunisia (BNT) on printed forms, describing
their activities, the boat they own, their collateral and income. Appli-
cations are supplemented by pro forma invoices of equipment they plan to
purchase. BNT's branches make a preliminary creditworthiness appraisal,
based essentially on securities offered and character information from local
administrative authorities. Branch managers then forward applications with
their recommendations to BNT's head office, which accepts or rejects appli-
cations exclusively on the basis of creditworthiness.
2.        Accepted applications are forwarded to local representatives of
the Directorate of Fisheries (DSP) for technical appraisal of proposed
investments. DSP's recommendations, which may include changes in investments,
are sent to the Credit Committee in the Ministry of Agriculture. The
Committee, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, makes the final decision
on fishermen's loan applications.
3.        Existing procedures are unsatisfactory.  As BNT does not take any
risk in fisheries loans, applications are often superficially
reviewed and lack reliable information. The sharing of responsibilities
between BNT and DSP is not clearly specified; also, the method of loan
repayment is inappropriate. Borrowers must repay loans in annual install-
ments, although they get their income in small multiple amounts each time
they sell their catch.
4.        It would be a condition of the IDA credit that loans previously
granted from FOSEP 1/ be reviewed and rectified. This would include that
securities would be scrutinized, and additional collateral and guarantees
taken whenever possible. Further, boats would be insured by subborrowers
and BNT named as beneficiary. Finally, methods of repayment similar to those
proposed under the project would be adopted (para 8).

ANNEX 11

B. Proposed Appraisal and Lending Procedures and Policies
5.        Under a subsidiary agreement, BNT and DSP would cooperate closely
in the evaluation of loan applications. Application forms for loans would
be available to fishermen at BNT's branches and at DSP's field offices.
6.        Loan applications would first be appraised on technical grounds
by the Fisheries Project Division within DSP. Applications which are
technically sound would be forwarded by DSP to BNT, which would conduct
financial appraisals. Special attention would be paid by BNT to the esti-
mation of expected operating costs and values of catches, taking into
account local fishing conditions, fishermen's aptitudes, and fish prices
paid at home bases of subborrowers. BNT's fisheries loan appraisers and
supervisors would make the financial evaluation of loans, which would
include calculations of returns on proposed investments and examination of
applicants' repayment ability. The senior officer in charge of the fisheries
lending program would review appraisal reports and make recommendations to
BNT, which would be responsible for final loan approval or rejection.
7.        Loans to fishermen would not exceed 75Z of the investment cost of
fully equipped motorized boats; and have a maximum term of 8 years, with a
3-months grace period, at an annual interest rate of not less than 6%. Loans
would become effective when:
(a)  subborrowers have participated in a training course
organized by DSP;
(b)  subborrowers have made a minimum downpayment of 10% of
the investment cost; and
(c)  Government has made available its 15% contribution to
investments.
B3oats would be mortgaged to BNT and insured by subborrowers during the loan
period with a company acceptable to BNT. BNT would be named beneficiary
and would keep originals of insurance policies in its files.
8.        Fishermen would repay each year a uniform amount (principal and
:Lnterest) in monthly installments. They would open a deposit account at a
]3NT branch and make monthly payments of about 8-10% of the annual repayment
amount. An adjustment of loan accounts would take place at least once during
a 12-month repayment period. BNT's loan appraisers and supervisors would
supervise repayments closely by making frequent field visits. If monthly
payments do not take place as scheduled, necessary steps would be taken by
13NT, including enforcement of guarantees and confiscation of boats.

Financial Evaluation
Assumptions
1.        A new 9.5-m inshore boat would have a useful life of 10 years and
make about 130 trips per year of about 48 hours duration each. The boat
would carry a crew of five, skipper included, and fish with 30 pieces of
trammel net. The expected annual catch rate would be 12.7 tons in the
initial year of operation and 14.5 tons thereafter (Annex 5).
2.        Based on Tunisian auction records, a producer price has been
conservatively estimated at D 245 (US$467) per ton of inshore fish and used
in the calculations (Table 1). This price corresponds with forecasts made
for Tunisia by FAO for the next decade.
3.        The investment cost in a fully equipped 9.5-m boat would be D 3,735
(US$7,115). Detailed cost estimates are in Annex 7, Table 2. Government
would contribute 15%, boat owners would provide 10% from own resources and
BNT would advance a loan of 75% towards the investment cost. The loan term
would be 8 years, including 3 months grace, at 6% annual interest. Because
of adequate boat maintenance provisions made under the project, a boat could
be usefully employed as an auxiliary vessel in other types of fishing after
10 years of operation as an inshore craft. Accordingly, a residual value has
been assumed, equivalent to 35% of the initial investment cost, about D 1,129
(US$2,150).
4.        Items of boat operating costs would be crew remuneration, fuel,
ice, food and boat maintenance and insurance. In Tunisia, a catch-sharing
system is used by which 45% of net sales revenues (gross sales less expenses
for fuel and food) is allocated among the crew. On a motorized inshore
boat carrying a crew of five, the catch shared by the crew is divided into
13 parts. The skipper takes four parts, the mechanic receives three parts
and each deckhand gets two parts. The remainder of catch proceeds is allo-
cated to the boat owner.
5.        Estimated fuel and lubricant costs are based on manufacturers'
figures for types of marine engines to be used under the project (Annex 5).
An engine would run for about 12 hours per trip at about 75% of maximum
capacity. Maintenance costs for hull and engine would increase from 5% of
investment costs for the first three years of operation to 10% during the
following four years and to 15% during the last three years. Fishing gear
would be replaced every three years; based on Tunisian quotations, annual
insurance costs would amount to 2.5% of the book value of hull and engine.

Financial Results
6.        Based on the foregoing assumptions, financial rates of return to
boat owners have been calculated at the full investment cost and net of Gov-
ernment's contribution, equivalent to 15% of the investment cost (Table 2).
To test sensitivity to price changes, financial returns assuming a low pro-
ducer price of D 200 (US$380) per ton of inshore fish were also calculated
as follows:
Producer Price            Full              Net of
per Ton             Investment         Governnent's
Dinar                 Cost            Contribution
200                  14.3%               19.1%
245                  25.5%               31.3%
These rates of return indicate a satisfactory financial viability of the
project.
7.        Projected net revenue flows have been calculated and are given
in Table 3. They indicate that a boat owner would be able to repay his loan,
equivalent to 7S% of the investment cost and carrying a 6% annual interest,
without undue financial difficulties over an 8-year period. In most cases,
however, the skipper and owner would be the same person. When the skipper's
share in the catch, about D 400 (US$762), is added to annual cash surpluses,
these would go up by about 50-90% over surpluses achieved by a boat owner
who employs a skipper.

ANNEX 14
TUNISIA
FISHERIES PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
1.        The project's quantifiable contribution to Tunisia's economy
would be net benefits generated by motorized inshore fishing vessels financed
under the project, over the project's 14-year life. About 335 boats of
improved production capacity would replace existing obsolete boats and boats
which would become unserviceable during the 4-year project development
period. Without the project, boats needing replacement would discontinue
inshore fishing and production would diminish proportionately. Total
net catches of new boats have been allocated as benefits to the project
in the economic rate of return calculation (Table 1).
2.        Projected catch rates, revenues and operating costs remain the same
as those used for the financial project evaluation and are explained in
Annex 12. Project investments are net of duties and include the costs of
motorized boats, gear and supporting services for the life of the project.
3.        Labor costs were fully costed in the economic calculations, based
on the prevailing catch-share system (Annex 12), the projected catch rate
of 14.5 tons per year and a producer price of D 245 per ton. Alternative
employment opportunities would, however, offer inshore fishermen substantially
lower remuneration.  These alternative employments could be on inshore craft
having a lower productivity than improved project boats, or in agriculture.
To come as close as possible to the opportunity cost of alternative employ-
ments, labor costs were also based on a catch rate of 10.0 tons per boat.
Catches of this weight have been recorded by traditional motorized inshore
boats comparable to the improved boats. Under this assumption, the annual
cash income of a semi-skilled crewman on a traditional boat would be about
D 130 (US$250), or about equal to the estimated cash income of semi-skilled
agricultural labor in Tunisia. This compares with a deckhand's estimated
cash income of about D 210 (US$400) under the project.
4.        Based on these assumptions, the project's economic rate of
return would be 21% when labor is fully costed; and 36% when the estimated
opportunity cost of labor is used in the calculations. Further details are
in Table 1.
