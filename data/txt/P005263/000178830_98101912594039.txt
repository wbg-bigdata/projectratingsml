HASHEMIIE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ZARQA/RUSEIFA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWLRAGE PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
1.01     Jordan is a semi-desert country with a land area of about 81,000 sq.
km.  Its only access to the sea is along a 25 km stretch of coastline in the
soutn on which is situated the seaport of Aqaba.  The country may be divided
into four geographical regions:  (i) the Jordan Valley which varies in width
from 4 to 16 km and stretches from Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea falling a
total of 200 m over its 124 km length to an elevation of 400 m below sea
level; (ii) the Highland region where ground elevations rise to above 1,000 m
thus providing a more temperate climate to the region; (iii) the Wadi Araba
region, which stretches from the Dead Sea scuth almost to the Gulf of Aqaba;
and (iv) the Desert regions which cover the remainder of the country.
Administratively the country is divided into five governorates: Amman,  Irbid,
Balqa, Karak and Ma'an.
1.02     Results of the latest census (November 1979) conservatively estimated
the population in the country at 2.15 million and growing at a rate of 3.5%
per  annum.   About  91%  of  the  population  is  estimated  to  live  in  the
northwestern quadrant of the country with the largest concentration in the
area of Amman, the capital city of the country.  Jordan is rapidly becoming an
urban nation.  In 1979 over 62% of the population lived within the political
boundaries of urban areas with population of 10,000 or greater, increasing
from about 56% in 1961.  Population in urban centers is expected to continue
to grow at a rate higher than the national average rate for some time.
Water Resources
1.03     Water is one of Jordan's scarcest resources.  80% of the country is
steppe  and desert,  where water  is only minimally  available.   Most  of  the
municipal water supply systems and industry in Jordan presently depend upon
groundwater anc springs.   Although  some surface water sources exist on the
nortnern border, in the Jordan Valley, and in some of the wadis flowing into
the Jordan River, exploitation of surface water for municipal and industrial
water supply has not so far occurred to any great extent due to sporadic flow
patterns, proprietary use for irrigation, and relatively long distances from
population centers.
1.04     Water resources in Jordan originate mainly from precipitation within
the country.  This provides surface flow as well as recharges ground water
supplies.  Average rainfall in Jordan is about 50 mm/year in the desert areas
rising up to 600 mm/year in the highlands.  Average annual volume of rainfall



is estimated to be 8,300 million cubic meters (MGM), but with high evaporation
losses,  the net yield is only about 1,100 MCM, of which 880 MCM is surface
water and 220 MCM is groundwater.  Studies by consultants have conclusively
pointed out that Jordan's water resources will not be adequate to fully meet
the potential future demands for irrigation, municipal and industrial uses,
parti>11arly  in north-west  Jordan.   The  Government's  present  water  policy
gives  priority  to municipal  and  industrial  use  while  at  the  same  time  it
exerc_ses a high degree of water conservation through a steep increasing block
rate tariff structure,  and the use of return  flow for agriculture.  Recent
efforts by the Government to provide water to major urban areas in Northwest
Jordan are described in the following paragraph.
1.05     The Government's water projects to help relieve water shortage in the
Amman, Zarqa, Ruseifa conurbation include the construction in 1979 of a 80 km
pipeline to transport some 10 MGM per annum from groundwater sources in Azraq
to Amman, and a proposed pipeline project (about 50 km in length against a
pumping head of some 1,300 m) to transfer 45 MCM per annum from the East Ghor
Main Canal (EGMC) to the Greater Amman area including Zarqa and Ruseifa, with
a pump storage scheme at Wadi Arab to augment dry weather flow in the canal.
The return flow will drain into the King Talal Reservoir and then be released
to a lower  section of the EGMC.   The EGMC water  carrier  project  is being
financed  by the United  States Agency  for International  Development  and the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social  Development.   Tenders  for this work have
already been awarded.  A schematic diagram of this system is shown in Annex
1.  At the same time, the Government plans to protect the King Talal Reservoir
(49  MCM  capacity)  for  irrigation  purposes.   To  achieve  this  aim,  it  is
preparing a project to increase the impounded capacity of tnis reservoir by
about 30 MCM,  and taking  active measures to reduce pollution in the Zarqa
River, which receives wastewater discharges from Aiman and the Zarqa/Ruseifa
area.  Other sources for development could include the Maqarin Dam to harness
the water resources of the Yarmouk River, transporting water from the
Euphrates River, and desalination of underground brackish water, all of which
are going to be very costly.
Sewerage
1.06     Domestic  and  industrial  wastewaters  in  Jordan  are  treated  and
disposed  of primarily  in on-site  facilities.   Only  three  central municipal
sewage treatment facilities exist at present, the largest serving Amman, and
smaller  installations  serving Salt and Aqaba.   In rural areas, human wastes
are generally disposed of in pit latrines and privies serving individual
housing units or groups of units.   In most urban areas, household cesspits or
septic  tanks  are  commonly  used.   Liquid  effluents  are  discharged  into
surrounding soil via open-jointed pipes or openings in pit walls. Accumulated
sludge, following varying degrees of anaerobic digestion, is pumped out by
municipal or private tank trucks for disposal in approved dumping areas.
Industrial wastewater is often discharged into nearby streams or ponds, with
little or no treatment.   Jordan has recently  issued  regulations  (Industrial
Effluent Standard 202) requiring industries to treat their effluent to a high
degree of purity before discharge to a water course or to cesspools in areas
where  groundwater  is  used  for  municipal  purposes.   Enforcement  of  these
regulations has been entrusted to the Ministry of Trade and Industry.



- 3 -
1.07     Of the three cities which at present have sewage collection systems,
Amman has a treatment plant which utilizes the activated sludge process; Salt
operates  aerated   lagoons;   and  Aqaba  uses  only  primary  treatment  with
stabilization ponds under planning.  The three systems serve a user population
of about 350,000 covering about 18/o of the total Jordanian population.   Other
communities (towns and villages) with piped water systems have their wastes
treated  in septic  tanks,  cesspools  and other  similar  facilities,  and  they
account  for about  60%  of  the  total  population.   The  remaining  22% of  the
population use pit privies and latrines or have no system at all.
1.08     Rapid  growth  in  urbanization,  rising  standards  of  living,  and
extensive but uncoordinated land development have caused individual wastewater
disposal  facilities  to become  inadequate  in many  large urban  centers.   In
cities such as Zarqa and Ruseifa, the soil is no longer capable of disposing
of the increasing amount of effluents from cesspools and septic tanks: these
have to be pumped out regularly to prevent overflows.  As the cost of septage
pumping is very high, residents frequently empty sullage water into streets to
relieve the load on their cesspools, an act which is subject to municipal
fine. Overflows from cesspools occur when maintenance is lacking, giving rise
to  serious  health  hazards.   Severe  outbreaks  of  cholera  have  occurred  in
Jordan, the latest in 1981, although the extent that these can be attributed
to poor sewage disposal has not been established.
1.09     Serious  contamination  occurs  in  groundwater  in  the  upper  aquifer
underlying communities using cesspools.   While this  groundwater  is not used
for potable water supply, the danger of this polluted water entering potable
water mains during periods of depressurization (for whatever reason) exists.
The quality of the groundwater in the lower aquifer, which is principally used
for potable water supply, has not been impaired.
Sector Organization
1.10     The  Natural  Resources  Authority  (NRA)  has,  in  principle,  overall
responsibility for water resources studies and planning throughout Jordan.
Responsibility for community water supply and sewerage is at present divided
between  the  Water  Supply  Corporation  (WSC),  the Amman  Water  and  Sewerage
Authority (AWSA), the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA), all three of which were
created in 1973, and a number of larger municipalities.   AWSA is responsible
for water supply and sanitary and stormwater sewerage in the city ot Amman
serving in 1981 some 650,000 people.   JVA is responsible  for development  in
the Jordan Valley and provides water supply to communities in the valley.
WSC, in 1981, supplied and operated the water systems in some 350 large and
small  communities,  and provided  bulk water  supply  to some 432  communities
which operated their own systems.  WSC's charter also requires it to provide
sewerage  to  communities  as  part  of  its  service.   Eight  municipalities,
including Zarqa and Ruseifa operated their own water systems with independent
groundwater sources.   The Government has recently announced  its intention to
have all municipality-run systems except Amman and those in the Jordan Valley
managed by WSC.  The process of taking over the municipality systems by WSC is
already in progress and systems in the cities of Irbid, Madaba, Aqaba,  Salt
and Tafila have already been taken over.   Takeover of the Zarqa and Ruseifa
systems is scheduled for completion in January 1, 1983.  This matter is dealt
with in more detail in Chapter V.



1.11     Water  Geve--pment  activities  are  coordinated  and  assisted  at  the
national  leveL by the National Planning Council  (NPC) which  is the central
planning  authority  of  the  country.   With  growing demand  for  the country's
critically  scarce  water  resources,  and  the  perceived  need  for  inter-basin
water  transfer,  additional  co-ordination  at  an  execution  level  of  water
development efforts of the three major water agencies becomes desirable.  NPC
has requested advice from the Bank regarding the form and functions of a
national water organization which would provide this coordination, as well as
formulate policies and plans for equitable resource development, allocation
and management, and the Bank has made recommendations to the Jordanian
Government.    Draft  review  copies  of  the  proposed  legislation  for  this
organization have been submitted  to  interested  agencies  for comments.   The
establishment of this national water organization has been included in the
current five-year plan (1981-85).
Constraints to Sector Development
1.12     While  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  are  relatively  well
developed in Amman, and concrete plans for further improvement have already
been formulated, these services are still deficient in most other parts of the
country.  To assist the Government to formulate a plan for the development of
these services, the Bank has agreed to the Government request to undertake a
sector study which will identify the water supply needs of communities outside
Amman, assess the strategy to develop available water resources in the country
to meet  these  needs  as  well  as  other  competing  needs,  establish  general
recommendations on appropriate means for wastewater disposal, and formulate
and  recommend  a  feasible  investment  program.   Timing  for  the  study  is
tentatively scheduled for FY 1983.
Performance in Previous IDA Credits
1.13     The Bank Group involvement  in the water supply and sewerage sect-r
was  initiated  in  1961  and  has  continued  through  IDA's  participation  in
financing the following water supply and sewerage projects:
(a) Credit  18-JO,  1961:    US$1.5  million   for  financing  foreign
exchange  costs  for  improving  and  augmenting  the  Amman  water
supply.  Total project cost was US$3.5 million.
(b) Credit 43-JO,  1963:   US$2.5  million  for financing water  supply
projects  in  Ramallah  and  El-Bira  (Jerusalem),  Nablus,  Azraq,
Irbid and Zarqa.  Total project cost was US$4.0 million.
(c) Credit 385-JO,  1973:   US$8.7 million  for  financing  75% of  the
foreign exchange cost of extension and improvement of the Amman
water  supply  and  sewerage  systems.   Total  project  cost  was
US$13.9 million.
(d) Credit 780-JO,  1978:  US$14.0 million for financing expansion of
Amman water supply and sewerage services. Total project cost is
estimated at US$33.9 million.



- 5 -
The first two projects were implemented prior to the separation of the West
Bank almost twenty years ago.  The two more recent projects were for expansion
and improvement of water supply and sewerage services in Amman. Credit 385-JO
was instrumental in building up the institutional capability of the then newly
formed Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) during a period of
serious water  shortage and high  inflation.   The  completion report  of this
project noted that while substantial effort had been taken to ameliorate
institutional  problems,   some  inherent  weaknesses,   particularly   in  the
financial   department,   still   remained   unresolved.    This   institutional
development effort is continued in the follow-up project financed under Credit
780-JO, which is now near completion. Recent increases in operating costs due
to high fuel prices have affected somewhat the financial performance of AWSA.
However, this was rectified with the tariff increases which came into effect
on April  1,  1982.   AWSA  is now  a well  established  institution,  and  its
performance can be expected to improve further with time. General performance
of the technical aspects of the project has been good with contracts awarded
on time at very competitive prices.
Bank Objectives for the Sector
1.14     The Bank's objective in the sector is to continue to (i) help the
Government to rationalize utilization of water resources, and (ii) develop the
institutional and operational capabilities of major institutions to enable
them to provide effective water supply and sewerage services to the urban and
rural population in Jordan.  The proposed water sector survey (para. 1.12) is
part  of  the  Bank's  effort  towards  achieving  the  first  objective.   IDA's
efforts on institutional development for AWSA in Amman have proved to be
fruitful.   The  Bank will  now  focus  its  attention  on WSC,  another  major
institution in this sector. This institution will, in the near future, assume
responsibilities for water supply, sanitary and stormwater sewerage for all
municipalities outside of Amman and the Jordan Valley, as an effort by
Government to centralize water supply responsibility to achieve economy of
scale, as well as permitting greater freedom for more efficient distribution
of water  resources  within  WSC's  service  area.   The  technical  assistance
provided in the project will help strengthen the management of WSC and assist
it to establish sound financial and tariff policies.

II. PROJECT AREA
General Features
2.01     The project area covers the adjoining cities of Zarqa and Ruseifa
which are located about 20 km northeast of Amman.   These cities rank second
and fourth in size in Jordan and are included in the Greater Amman Region for
planning purposes.  The Zarqa/Ruseifa area is one of the principal industrial
centers in Jordan.  Major industries include breweries,  soft drink bottling
plants, food industries, weaving industries, phosphate production, tannery and
various chemical industries.  The two cities are linked to other parts of the
country by a good system of highways, and a railway link exists with Aqaba,
the only seaport of the country.
2.02     Households in the two cities have an average size of seven persons
and are generally characterized as low and middle income families.  About 60%
to 70% of the households are owner-occupants.   Based on an income survey in
1974 by the Royal Scientific Society and a more recent survey by consultants
in 1980, the 1980 household income distribution for the two cities is
estimated to be as follows:
Percentile                1980 Household Monthly Income
JD             US$ Equiv.
20th                        82                 237
40th                        107                309
60th                       135                 390
80th                       205                 592
Heads of households are mostly unskilled or semi-skilled workers employed in
the construction industry, in local manufacturing industries, retail shops,
the civil service, or at the army base.
Existing Water Supply
2.03     Nearly  the entire  population of the two cities derives  its water
supply from the public water systems which are presently operated by the
municipality departments but will be taken over shortly by WSC.  There is no
public standpipe supply: residents who do not have their own metered
connections depend on the metered connections of their neighbors.   A small
number of the population, who lives at elevations higher than the water
storage reservoirs, is supplied from municipality owned and private tank
trucks.  While water supply is available to most parts of the cities, water
pressure is low.  The distribution system does not reach many newly developed
areas and these are now served by long temporary connections, most of which
are laid above ground.  The water supply distribution systems in both cities
therefore need strengthening, and rehabilitation in some places, in order to
cope with existing needs as well as future growth.



2.04     The present water supply comes from three wells in Zarqa and two in
Ruseifa, and the total allowable extraction, estimated at about 28,000 m3/day,
is adequate to meet the demand up to year 1986.  The aquifer of these wells
also  provides  water  supply  to  industries.   WSC  plans  to  take  over  this
industrial groundwater source and providing a supply to industry through the
municipal systems.  Demand in Zarqa/Ruseifa  beyond 1986 will likely have to
be met from new sources. The Government of Jordan is constructing a pipeline,
pumping stations, and treatment facilities (with financial assistance from the
United States Agency for International Development and the Arab Fund) to
transport some 45 million cubic meters per year of water from the East Ghor
Main Canal (EGMC) in the Jordan Valley (para. 1.05) to the Greater Amman area
which includes Zarqa and Ruseifa. This project is expected to be completed in
1986 and will be linked to the Azraq water supply system, to which the
Zarqa/Ruseifa system will be connected.   The Yarmouk River which feeds the
EGMC has a base flow of about 218 MCM per annum, and an average annual flow of
about 400 MCM. The Government has confirmed that the flow in the EGMC will be
adequate to sustain the supply to the Amman area with the proposed flood
pumping arrangement at Wadi Arab. Electrical energy will be used for pumping,
and the power requirements for the EGMC Carrier Project (estimated to be about
30 MW at full capacity) has been included in planned expansions for plants in
Amman (264 MW to be added by 1984), and the Bank financed Fifth Power Project
in Aqaba (260 MW) which provides also for power to be transmitted to Amman.
Industrial water consumption may also be supplied from recycled wastewater.
During loan negotiations assurance was obtained that Government will allocate
sufficient water resources for the Zarqa/Ruseifa system to ensure prevailing
water consumption levels.
2.05     The systems are at present managed by water departments of the two
municipalities.   The  operations  are  governed  by  the  National  Municipal
Ordinance, while the Municipal Council issues necessary administrative
regulations and has responsibility for water rates.  Present operation of the
water supply systems in the two cities is deficient.  Because of the absence
of  an  adequate  distribution  system,  long  lengths  of  house  services  are
constructed at the expense of house owners to obtain connections.   Most of
these lines are of easily corrodable material and are laid above or very close
to ground surface, resulting in extensive leakage which the house owners have
no incentive to repair, because the water is lost prior to metering.   All
services in both cities are metered, with unaccounted for water estimated at
46% of which about 15% is probably attributed to leakage and the remainder
from improper or inaccurate meter readings and unauthorized connections or
use.   In  Zarqa  the meters  are municipality-owned  and  are  serviced  in  a
workshop which can handle 25 to 30 meters  per day.   In Ruseifa,  however,
meters are owned by the customers and, only when a meter stops recording is
the customer required to have it repaired at a private workshop.  Privately
owned meters are of inferior quality and not standardized in manufacture.
During loan negotiations assurance was obtained that WSC will replace for the
purpose of standardization all service water meters in Ruseifa, and will
ensure that it has the right to inspect, repair and replace these meters by
December 31, 1983 at the latest.  Replacement of these meters as well as part
of the municipality owned meters in Zarqa is envisaged in the project (para.
4.10).



-8-
Sewage Disposal
2.06     All sewage in the two cities is at present disposed of in cesspools.
The  density  of  the  population,  coupled  with  the  nature  of  the  land,
characterized by shallow soils underlain by rock of very limited permeability,
not only make this method of sewage disposal no longer adequate but also give
rise to serious health hazards.   Newly constructed  cesspools  fill up  in a
relatively short period of time and begin to overflow if not pumped out
periodically, causing very unsanitary conditions.
2.07     There are approximately 32,000 cesspools in the two municipalities.
Cesspool emptying operation is carried out by eight municipality-owned tankers
and some 50 private tankers to an approved dumping site about 25 km north-east
of Zarqa.  It is estimated that about 90,000 tanker trips are made in a year
at a charge to consumers of JD 2.5 to JD 3.0 for municipality-operated
tankers, and JD 3.0 to JD 5.0 for private tankers.
Stormwater Drainage
2.08     No underground stormwater drainage system exists at present  in the
two cities.  During rainfall, stormwater flows over streets and roads (which
are provided with a good gradient because of the steep terrain) to wadis
(natural  watercourses),   some  of  which  still  run  through  the  limited
undeveloped parts of the cities.   Flooding occurs during rainstorms  in low
areas of the cities at the end of long watersheds which are improperly drained
causing inconvenience, danger to life and property damage.  While underground
stormwater drainage in the majority of the streets and roads is not considered
essential at this stage, the need to improve stormwater drainage in these
lowlying frequently flooded areas is pressing.

III. DEMAND ASPECTS
Population
3.01     Population data for Zarqa and Ruseifa are obtained from the results
of  a  national  census  conducted  in  November  1979  which  estimated  the
populations of the two cities at 215,687 and 61,700 respectively.  The census
also reported that populations of the two cities had grown significantly in
the past 20 years, with an average growth rate of 4.5% in Zarqa and nearly 13%
in Ruseifa, the former growth supported by the presence of a large army base
and the latter growth prompted largely by the development of a phosphate mine
which provides one of the country's main sources of export.
3.02      Future growth is expected to continue due to the following factors:
(i) the strong industrial base coupled with the potential for further indus-
trial development, (ii) proximity to the capital city, (iii) presence of good
communication links, (iv) availability of land for development, and (v) the
Government's policy to improve infrastructural services in the two cities.
The population in the two cities is expected to grow at a rate of 4.5% per
annum from 1979 at least to 1989.  Growth in Zarqa may moderate to around 3.5%
per annum after 1989.
Forecast of Demand
3.03     Present demand projections are based on measured production and sales
in 1979 for Zarqa and in 1977 for Ruseifa for which reasonably accurate
figures are available.  Unaccounted for water is estimated to be about 47% in
Zarqa and 39% in Ruseifa (average of 46% in the two cities).  It is considered
that of this only about 15% is from leakage, the remainder being due to
incorrect meter readings and unauthorized usage.   Normal annual  increase  in
per capita production is assumed to be about  1.0  liter per capita per day
(lcd), a figure which is considered reasonable and is supported by data in
other similar cities of the region.   In addition, consumers who are connected
to the sewer system are assumed to have a one time increase of 15 lcd.  The
basis of the demand projections is summarized below:
liters per Capita per day (l.c.d.)

1990                 103               88               76              61
1995                 109               94               81              66
2000                  114              99               87              72



- 10 -
It is further assumed that unaccounted-for water will be reduced gradually to
30% in 1990 following takeover by WSC, and as a result of the institutional
development efforts of the project to reduce waste and improve meter readings.
The results of the demand analysis are shown in Annex 2.
Forecast of Sewage Flows and BOD5 Loads
3.04      Domestic sewage flows are estimated  from water use with reductions
due to uses such as gardening and car washing and increased by an estimated
amount of groundwater infiltration.   The per capita sewage flow in the analy-
sis is shown below;
Liters per capita per day (l.c.d.)

1990       88        70         8        78             65        51         8        59
1995       93        73         9        82             69        54         9        63
2000        97        77         9       86             74        58         9        67
3.05     There is no sewage flow at present in Zarqa and Ruseifa and measure-
ments  of  sewage  strength  and  pollution  loads  are  therefore  not  possible.
Reports on test samples collected in the Amman sewerage system indicate a per
capita BOD5 (five day biochemical oxygen demand) of 60 grams per day, but
these results are not conclusive because of difficulties in estimating actual
per capita water use and suspected dumping of cesspool emptier contents into
city  manholes.   For  the  purpose  of  forecasting  BOD5  load,  a  per  capita
BOD5 load of 40 grams per day is used.   This  figure  is more  in line with
values found in major cities in the region. In addition, the sewage treatment
plant will be designed to treat also septage from cesspools used by the still-
unconnected  population.   The  BODs  load  contribution  from  this  source  is
assumed to be 10 grams per capita per day.
3.06     The  sewage  flow  and  BOD5  load  received  at  the  proposed  sewage
treatment plant will build up over a period of six years (1986 to 1992), which
is the time estimated to be required to complete the house plumbing for the
roughly 30,000 connections provided in the project.   To accelerate the use of
the facilities it is envisaged that houseowners or residents in areas where
1/ Army base has separate water supply, but its sewage will be disposed of in
the Zarqa/Ruseifa system
2/ Water use is based on 85% of per capita production.



- 11 -
collection  sewers  have  been  constructed  will  be  asked  to  convert  their
plumbing systems and be given dry connections with a line break as of 1985, a
year  before  the  sewage  treatment  plant  is  ready  for  service.    These
connections can then be completed speedily as soon as the treatment plant is
put into service.   WSC intends  to notify the residents early in order  that
they can make arrangements to connect to the sewer system as soon as the
sewers are ready and it is likely that the connection program can be further
accelerated.  These arrangements are covered in the provisions of WSG's sewage
ordinance.    During  loan  negotiations   assurance  was  obtained   from  the
Government that it would arrange for financial assistance if required to
enable low income families in Zarqa and Ruseifa to be connected to the sewer
system. Projected sewage flows and organic loadings are shown in Annex 3.



IV THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The project will provide the much needed improvement in water supply
and will  eliminate  inadequate cesspools  in Zarqa and Ruseifa.   This  should
lead to general upgrading of health and environment of the two cities.   The
project will in addition help to alleviate pollution in the Zarqa River, thus
resulting in better quality water in the King Talal Reservoir.
4.02      The project will also attempt to attain the important sectoral goals
of improving the operating and financial performance of a major institution in
this sector, and of achieving more efficient allocation and use of scarce
resources through the introduction of appropriate pricing and management poli-
cies.   The technical assistance provided in the project will strengthen the
management of WSC and a new organizational unit that will be set up to operate
the Zarqa/Ruseifa system, and to help establish sound financial and tariff
policies.
Project Description
4.03      The water supply component of this project is the first phase of a
staged program to strengthen the distribution system in existing populated
areas of the two cities and to expand the distribution system to rapidly
developing areas.   In Zarqa these developing areas are principally south and
west of the existing population center. In Ruseifa new development is expect-
ed to be eastward and south of the old Amman - Zarqa highway and northward in
the Jebel Al Shamali area, and north of the Musheirfeh area.  Included in the
project will be a 600mm supply line to connect the Zarqa and Ruseifa distribu-
tion systems to the East Ghor Main Canal Water Carrier/Amman/Azraq pipeline in
order to provide additional water supplies to meet the growing demands of the
two cities.   The  improved  networks  are  designed  to meet  the needs  of  the
saturation population in the areas to be served, which is expected to be
reached before 2020.   The next phase of distribution works will be required
between 1990 and 2000, when the distribution systems will be further expanded
to new areas which are expected to continue to develop to the west of Zarqa
and to the north of Ruseifa.
4.04      The sewerage component is also the first phase of a staged sewerage
program and will serve 11 districts (subareas) out of the 21 districts into
which  the project area is divided.   Served districts  include the commercial
centers and the more densely populated areas of the two cities with a total
population in these areas of 288,000 in 1982, which is  expected to increase
to 324,300 in 1990 and 442,100 in 2000.
4.05      Under  the project,  sewage  from the districts  in Zarqa and Ruseifa
will be collected by a system of sewers into trunk sewers.  In Zarqa two trunk
sewers ranging in diameter from 300 mm to 1,100 mm will be constructed,
running northwards on the east and west of the city center.   Sewage from the
east trunk sewer will be pumped at the northeast corner of the city to the



- 13 -
west trunk which continues northwards another 1.5 km to the proposed treatment
works. A trunk sewer will be laid along the Zarqa River from Ruseifa and will
convey sewage from the Ruseifa districts and industries located at the fringe
of this city and Zarqa to the west Zarqa trunk sewer.  The effluents from a
number of industries will require pretreatment prior to discharge to the sewer
system, and this will be enforced through the WSC Sewage Ordinance.
4.06     The trunk sewers will eventually also carry future sewage from other
districts for which sewers are not yet provided through this project.  They
are sized to carry sewage flows from the two cities up to year 2020, i.e. for
a 40 year design period.  A present worth analysis comparing this with a two
stage proposal with sewers at half the year 2020 capacity shows the two stage
proposal to be more expensive for discount rates up to 13%.
4.07     The treatment plant,  in view of the strength of  the sewage,  will
consist  of primary  settling  followed  by  biological  treatment,  which  will
upgrade the quality of the effluent so as to allow its use for irrigation in
the Jordan Valley under controlled conditions.   Sludge after thickening will
be digested in heated anaerobic digestors.   Gas  from the digestors will be
used to generate electricity for use in the plant, a measure which is found to
be cost effective because of the high cost of energy in Jordan.
4.08     The stormwater drainage component will provide underground culverts
and sewers in six low-lying heavily inhabited areas in Zarqa and one area in
Ruseifa to relieve flooding which occurs annually in these areas. These areas
also contain important road and highway intersections.  The work comprises the
construction of the principal stormwater drainage outlets in the two cities
and serves to carry away rapidly the accumulated runoffs from higher parts of
the respective watersheds.
4.09     Institutional development assistance will be provided in the project.
There will be a component for training of WSC operating staff (para. 5.10).
In addition, consultants will continue to be retained during the start-up of
the treatment plant to provide hands-on training to plant operators.  Experts
to be funded from the project will be recruitea to assist in developing and
implementing a public utility accounting system, to study the long term
organizational needs of WSC, to recommend operating procedures and to help
implement recommended organizational proposals.  Consultants will be provided
to work out water and sewerage tariff proposals for WSC and for the
Zarqa/Ruseifa water supply and sewerage branch.
4.10     The   project   will   also   provide   for   the   construction   of   a
depot/workshop to serve as a base for WSC's Zarqa/Ruseifa operating crews and
to carry out necessary maintenance work.   Included in the workshop will be
facilities for meter repair and testing.  About 12,000 supply and production
meters will be procured in the project.  These will be used to replace many of
the privately owned meters in Ruseifa which are found to be of poor
construction and not functioning properly.  In addition a number of defective
meters in Zarqa also needs replacement. Operational equipment such as leakage
detection devices, sewer cleaning equipment, trucks and tankers will also be
procured in the project.

other work carried out by WSC.  Base costs have been adjusted in the above table to
reflect costs at the end of December 1982. Physical contingencies of 15% have been
allowed on project costs (excluding land).  To provide for price increases through
the expected date of project completion the following rates for price contingencies
have been used for both local and foreign cost components: 8.0% for 1982 and 1983,
7.5% for 1984, 7.0% for 1985 and 6.0% for 1986.  The cost estimates do not include
import duties and taxes as WSC is exempt from these.

- 17 -
4.15    Project financing arrangements are well advanced.  At NPC's invitation
representatives of the co-financing institutions (United States Agency for
International Development, Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau of the Federal
Republic of Germany, and Islamic Development Bank) were present in Jordan at
the time of the Bank's project appraisal to review project preparation and Lo
identify components for their financing.   The various components proposed to
be financed by the different co-financers are shown on page 2 of Annex 5, and
the components proposed to be financed by the Bank are further elaborated on
page 3 of the Annex.   During negotiations,  the Project  Financing Plan was
confirmed  by  the  Government.   In  view  of  the  future  debt  of  WSC,  the
Government contribution of JD 10.4 million (US$ 29.9 million) would be passed
onto WSC in the form of equity.
4.16    The Bank loan would be made to the Government of Jordan (GOJ), which
coordinates all foreign financing for public sector investments through NPC,
on standard terms for Jordan, i.e., for 17 years including 4 years of grace.
GOJ will onlend the Bank loan to WSC with a repayment period of 17 years
including a 5 year grace period at a fixed interest rate substantially in line
with that applicable to the loan, under a separate subsidiary loan agreement.
These on-lending terms conform with the Government's general practice for
on-lending to comparable public sector institutions in Jordan.  WSC will bear
the foreign exchange risk. Interest and other charges during the construction
period over a maximum of five years and the front end fee will be added to the
subsidiary loan and be paid for by GOJ.  The execution of the subsidiary loan
agreement related to the Bank loan shall be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Furthermore, signing of loan agreements between the Government and the
co-financiers for the agreed amounts would also be a condition for Bank loan
effectiveness.  Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government
would meet any project cost overruns.
Status of Engineering
4.17    Consultant services for the preparation of design and contract docu-
ments were provided under USAID assistance.  The work is now essentially com-
pleted with the exception of minor additional work required  to update  the
design to include recent rapid development that has taken place in the two
cities and to modify contracting documents to accomodate the procurement
requirements of the various financing agencies.  Funds for this remaining work
will be provided under the USAID financed component of the project.  The USAID
financed project component will also be used to obtain foreign and local
consultant services required for the supervision  of the construction work.
Additional consultant and expert services, totalling about 50 manmonths at an
average manmonth cost of $11,200, including salary, costs, fees, international
travel and subsistence, will be provided from the Bank-financed component to
conduct  the  tariff  and  organization  studies.   For  the  entire  project,
altogether 380 manmonths of foreign consultant time at an estimated manmonth
cost of $12,000, and 210 manmonths of local consultant time at an estimated
manmonth cost of $6,000, will be required.

Procurement
4.18    The physical project components to be financed by the Bank include the
sewage treatment plant, collection sewers, sewer laterals and water distribu-
tion pipes in 4 subareas,  the workshop and consultant  services.   All major
contracts financed by the Bank would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for procurement.
Prequalification of bidders will be required for the sewage treatment plant
contract because of the special nature of this work, and for other contracts
expected to exceed US$ 10 million, in order to ensure that bidders have the
required financial capabiLity to carry out the work.  For all civil contracts
expected to last more than one year, a price adjustment clause is considered
to be essential.   During negotiations,  understanding was  obtained  from the
Government and WSC that for civil works contracts financed by the Bank
expected to last longer than 12 months, bid documents will allow inclusion of
a  price   adjustment   provision   for  major   construction   materials   with
administered prices.  Provision would be made for other major materials to be
procured within 12 months, or in a manner to be agreed between the Government
and the Bank.  For bid evaluation purposes, a 15% margin of preference or an
amount equal to customs duties, whichever is lower, would be applied in the
case  of  equipment  manufactured  in  Jordan.   Contracts  for  civil  works,
materials and equipment of less than JD 121,000 (US$ 350,000) aggregating to
not more than JD 347,000 (US$ 1,000,000) would be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding according to WSC's guidelines which were found by
the  appraisal  mission  to  be  acceptable  to  the  Bank.   Prior  review  of
procurement documents by the Bank will be required for all contracts which are
estimated to cost the equivalent of JD 347,000 (US$1,000,000) or more.
Disbursements
4.19    The proposed Bank loan of US$ 17 million would be disbursed over a
period of approximately six years as follows:
1.   Sewage Treatment Plant           100% of foreign expenditures.
and other workshop equip-        85% of expenditures for
ment (US$ 8,400,000)             locally procured items.
Annex 4, items II(g),
IV(a)
2.   Civil Works                      38% of total expenditures
(US$ 6,400,000)
Annex 4, items I(c), II(b)
II(g), IV(a)
3.   Consultant services               100% of foreign expenditures
((US$ 500,000)
Annex 4, items V(c), V(d)
4.   Unallocated (US$ 1,700,000)
4.20    The forecast disbursement schedule (Annex 6) is based on the Project
Implementation Schedule and takes into consideration the standard disbursement
profile for Jordan.  Although there are some differences between the forecast
schedule and the standard profile for Jordan, the differences are minor and



- 19 -
are the result of advances in design and rather straightforward project imple-
mentation.    All  disbursements   will   be  made   against   fully  documented
expenditures. The loan closing date would be June 30, 1989.
Project Implementation
4.21    The project would be executed in the years 1983 to 1988.  WSC will be
responsible for project execution and has agreed to set up a project manage-
ment unit for this work. Early establishment of this unit and adequate staff-
ing by experienced personnel in project work are essential to ensure success
of project implementation. During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained
from WSC that all key administrative and technical personnel for the project
management  unit will be employed not  later  than  September  30,  1983.   The
setting up of this unit together with the appointment of the project manager
will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Land Acquisition and Access
4.22    The land required for the sewage treatment plant, the sewage pumping
station and part of the trunk sewers is on privately owned land presently used
for agriculture.   A law on Expropriation (Law No. 6 of 1980) exists which
allows land to be expropriated against equitable compensation for projects
giving public benefit.   Entry  can be made  as soon as  the application  for
expropriation is approved by the Council of Ministers, a process which usually
takes about six months.  WSC has already commenced taking active  steps  for
land acquisition.  No problem in gaining access to the land for construction
purposes is expected.
Monitoring Criteria
4.23    The proposed  project  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in Annex  7.
This schedule includes construction activities as well as activities required
for WSC's  institutional development  which  form part  of this  project.   Key
indicators for the measurement of the technical, financial, institutional and
training objectives for the project are shown in Annex 8.  During negotiations
the project implementation schedule and the key indicators were discussed with
WSC and agreement on an acceptable schedule and set of key indicators was
reached.   These would serve as targets which WSC would  strive  to achieve.
Assurance was obtained during negotiations that WSC will prepare quarterly
progress reports on all aspects of project work and in sufficient detail to be
reviewed by and discussed with the Bank, and that WSC will carry out promptly
any agreed remedial actions resulting from the review.
4.24    Assurance was also obtained  that,  within  six months  following  the
closing date of the Loan, WSC will prepare and submit to the Bank a project
completion report reviewing the planned objectives and the achievements of the
project, including: costs and benefits derived; performance and contribution
of all parties associated with project execution and system operation.

V.  THE BENEFICIARY
Introduction
5.01    The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan will be the Borrower of the proposed
loan of US$ 17 million and will on-lend the loan to the Water Supply Corpora-
tion (WSC) which has been designated as the project implementation agency as
well as the agency responsible for the operation of the Zarqa/Ruseifa water
supply and sewerage system.  Presently the water supply activities of the two
cities are carried out by the city municipal departments.  Responsibility for
WSC to carry out water supply and sewerage services in Zarqa and Ruseifa has
already been assigned by the Prime Minister and takeover is scheduled to be
completed by January 1, 1983.
Organization and Management
5.02    WSC was established in 1973 under Temporary Law No. 56 as a Corpora-
tion enjoying independent financial and administrative status reporting to an
eight member Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister of Municipal and
Rural affairs.  The original function of WSC was to provide cities, villages
and other population groups outside of Amman and the Jordan Valley with
potable water supply, sanitary and stormwater drainage services through Water
Councils  to  be  overseen  by  WSC.  Throughout the  years  this  practice  has
changed, and WSC is now providing direct service to many municipalities, which
it is empowered to do under Article 17 of Temporary Law No. 56, and providing
bulk  water  supply  to  some  larger  municipalities.   WSC's  water  supply
distribution system is shown on IBRD Map 16427.  As mentioned  in para. 1.10
WSC is in the process of taking over the operation of these latter systems, as
well as those that are operating with their own water sources such as Zarqa
and Ruseifa.
5.03    The  present organization  of WSC  is  shown  on  page  1  of Annex  9.
Operations of WSC are presently conducted through four regional offices (to be
increased to five in the near future), one in each governorate of the country.
While heads of regional offices report to WSC's Director General, they are
also responsible informally to the governors of the respective governorates on
matters  relating  to  the  provision  of services.   Reporting  directly  to  the
Director  General  are  also  eight  WSC  departments  stationed   in  Amman  -
Administration, Finance, Design, Follow-up, Operation and Maintenance, Legal,
General Inspection  and Planning.  In addition  the  Director General directly
supervises the heads of project implementation units set up for large
projects.   The  function  of  the  Deputy  Director  General  is  not explicitly
defined.  He acts for the Director General in his absence and assumes other
responsibilities assigned to him by the Director General.  Currently, the WSC
Director General is a new appointee from another organization, and the Deputy
Director General is presently taking up most of the responsibility  of day to
day  running  of the  organization.   Up  to  now, planning  and  preparation  of
projects is being carried out by NPC for WSC.  As an independent entity WSC
should  be  expected  to  carry  out this  function  on  its  own.  WSC  has  just
recently established a Planning Department, with the top two positions already
filled.   Development  of  this  department  will  be  followed  up  through  the
project monitoring system suggested in para. 4.23.



-21 -
5.04     For the operation of its future Zarqa/Ruseifa system, WSC plans to
establish a management unit reporting initially to the regional office for
Amman Governorate, to be upgraded to regional office status at a later date.
Accounts for this operation will be kept and processed in Amman. The proposed
organization chart for the Zarqa/Ruseifa Branch is shown on page 2 of Annex 9.
The takeover by WSC and effective management of the Zarqa/Ruseifa water supply
and sewerage operations are necessary to ensure achievement of anticipated
project benefits, and this will be monitored as outlined in para. 4.23.
Management Assistance
5.05     With WSC's increasing responsibilities and the expected organization-
al growth made necessary to cope with these responsibilities, it is vital for
WSC to re-examine and study how its organizational structure should be modi-
fiea to meet the requirements brought about by these changes.  This organiza-
tional study would:
(i)    identify and define WSC's present and future role and responsibili-
ties in the framework of national and sector goals, and propose in
broad outline the Corporation's organization;
(ii)    develop detailed organization structures  for all WSC's departments,
regional and branch offices, and assess staffing needs;
(iii)   prepare job descriptions and statements of objectives for all mana-
gerial positions;
(iv)    review personnel policies and procedures and recommend needed changes;
(v)    develop administrative procedures and reporting systems; and
(vi)    develop operating and maintenance procedures.
The project will provide the services of a management and a technical expert
who will  assist  in  the  execution  of  this  work.   The  schedule  for  these
activities was agreed during loan negotiations and will be monitored as
outlined in para. 4.23.
Staffing
5.06     The staff of WSC numbered about 1,200 in 1981 benore the takeover of
other municipal systems, corresponding to about 20.8 employees per one thou-
sand connections served by its distribution systems.  This is due to the fact
that WSC is operating water supply systems with a wide geographical spread and
low population densities.  The absorption of larger urban systems into WSC's
operations in the near future should help reduce WSC's employee/connections
served ratio.  WSC's salary levels are comparable to those of the national
airline company which are among the highest in the country, and pay levels
should not therefore be a deterrent to increased productivity.  It is consid-
ered that by 1985 when WSC would have taken over the majority of the larger
municipal operations, its employee/connections served ratio for water supply
should fall to about 12.4 employees per thousand and is expected to continue
to improve with time.  The proposed organization study (para. 5.05(ii)) will
address this issue.



- 22 -
5.07     The present municipality  staff responsible  for operating the Zarqa
and Ruseifa water systems number 162 and 32 respectively, and correspond to
6.2 and 4.2 employees per one thousand connections served.  These ratios are
low, and coupled with unattractive municipal employee salary levels are partly
responsible-for the present inadequate level of water supply service to the
two cities.  With takeover of the systems, WSC has the opportunity to select
and retain only those municipality staff that are productive and to supplement
this with its own staff or new recruits of good caliber. Together with higher
salary levels improvement in service levels can possibly be achieved without
any significant increase to the number of employees.
5.08     For  the  future  Zarqa/Ruseifa  sewerage  operations  the  number  of
employees estimated to be required in 1986, when the system becomes operation-
al, is 90.  This number is expected to increase as more users are added to the
system and is estimated to reach 150 in 1992 when the accelerated program for
sewer connection ends.  At that time the employee/connections  served ratio
should be about 4.1.
5.09     The major staff capability needs of WSC are in the managerial, engi-
neering and accounting areas.  Such skills are not easy to find in  Jordan.
In particular, experienced sewerage managers and operators are not easily
available as sewerage operations are at present still very limited in the
country.   The training component  of this project will  partly address  this
issue. WSC staff employed in project implementation will also be able to gain
useful knowledge of the systems as they are constructed, and training by con-
sultants will be provided during system start-up (para. 5.10).
Training
5.10     Training for WSC staff will be provided by the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID).  A sum of about US$ 200,000 has been
allocated from project funds for the training of 12 managerial and profes-
sional staff abroad and about 100 other operating staff at local training
institutions.  Excellent facilities exist at the Amman Polytechnic Institute
which now provides training for up to 600 technicians per year in the mechan-
ical (including hydraulics), chemical, electrical and civil engineering
fields.  Training in water supply and wastewater engineering is being planned
and will be offered shortly. In addition, consultants will be retained during
the start-up phase of the treatment plant to advise on sewerage and sewage
treatment operations, and to provide "hands-on" training to plant operators.
Accounting staff will also receive on-the-job training from the financial
advisor to be recruited in the project (para. 5.15).
Billing and Collection
5.11     WSC will take over the water systems in Zarqa and Ruseifa by January
1, 1983.  Billing and collection will then be carried out by WSC.   WSC is
billing industries and large volume consumers on a monthly basis, and others
on a two-month  cycle.   WSC  recently  signed  an agreement  with  a computer
service bureau, a subsidiary of a large bank, to have all transactions affect-
ing the billing cycle including file maintenance performed by this bureau.



- 23 -
The staff of this service bureau is experienced and the physical facilities
are up-to-date.   Billing programs  for WSC have already been established and
are presently being tested.  According to a schedule, which was found realist-
ic by the appraisal mission, billing for all of WSC's accounts will be per-
formed by the service bureau by the end of 1982.
5.'      Collection  from private  customers  poses  no difficulty.   Bills  for
services provided to government agencies are also settled within a reasonable
time.   In the event that such bills become overdue,  either the Minister of
Rural Affairs and Municipalities for agencies under his supervision or the
Minister of Finance for all other agencies can authorize payments  from the
operating budgets accounts of these agencies.  In this way, bills are normally
settled within 120 days after rendering.  During negotiations,  assurance was
obtained from GOJ that it will continue to see to it that water/
sewer bills of government agencies will be settled within 120 days.
Accounting
5.13     WSC's  present  accounting  system  follows  the system  prescribed  for
government agencies which is on a cash basis.  Although all transactions are
recorded properly  and  allow  identification  of  expenditures  by major  cost
categories,  branch  offices  and  projects,  this  system  does  not  meet  the
accounting requirements for managing a public utility providing water and
sewerage services throughout Jordan.  WSC is aware of this deficiency and is
considering steps to introduce a public utility accounting system that would
be based on accrual accounting.   Such a system would have to be operated in
parallel with the government system, and this can be achieved through appro-
priate coding.
5.14     Public utility accounting systems are presently being developed for
computer use in neighboring countries.  It should, therefore, not be too dif-
ficult to adapt these to a system for WSC, which could become operational by
the end of 1984.  This new computer based accounting system will in future
provide expeditiously data required for WSC's operations.   Implementation and
operation of this system would be carried out with the computer service bureau
which handles WSC billing operation. This service bureau has sufficient capa-
city both in manpower, as well as in hardware for operating the WSC accounting
system.  With this approach, WSC would be able to benefit  from a staff of
experienced programmers without having to devote sizable resources to estab-
lish a computing department of its own initially.
5.15     As details and programs of an appropriate utility accounting system
can be made available and because an experienced computer service bureau can
be used, WSC would not have to retain the expensive services of consultants to
design and thereafter to implement a new accounting system. Instead, engaging
a financial advisor experienced in public utility accounting and management is
more  appropriate.   WSC  has  already  contacted  prospective  candidates  and
intends to have this position filled by January 1983.

5.16     WSC will over the next  few years take over a number of municipal
water and sewerage services.   WSC's assets are already inventoried and some
efforts were made at the time of takeover of the various systems to establish
values at depreciated  replacement  costs.   Whilst  Aor part  of these assets
proper values have still to be determined the values of the remainder will
only need confirmation. It is estimated that this valuation will be completed
by the end of 1984, thus allowing its incorporation into the accounting sys-
tem, which is now scheduled to become operational by January 1, 1985. Comple-
tion of the valuation of the assets by December 31, 1984 and operation of the
new accounting system by January 1, 1985 will be monitored through the project
implementation reports.  The accounting system will be set up in such a form
that it will separate the activities of the various branch offices, including
those of the proposed Zarqa/Ruseifa Project.
Audit
5.17     Like  all  government  agencies  and  government  corporations  whose
investment program forms part of the government budget, WSC is subject to an
interlinking system of expenditure controls and final audit by the Auditing
Department.   The apriori control by the agent of the Auditing Department as
well as the one of the Ministry of Finance ensures that payments are made only
against established budgets and that all existing rules and regulations have
been observed.  The final audit by the Auditing Department is an expost con-
trol to ensure that all laws and regulations have been observed.
5.18     The Auditing Department  is independent  as  it reports  only  to the
Consultative Council  (Parliament).   Scope and direction of its audit differ
from audits normally undertaken  for  public  utilities.   Also,  the Auditing
Department faces difficulties in recruiting qualified and experienced auditors
that not only can audit the accounts established on the basis of an accrual
system but also make recommendations concerning the accounting system itself.
It therefore would be advisable that in future WSC's accounts be audited by
auditors experienced in public utility accounting systems once sufficient
progress has been made in implementing the public utility accounting system.
During negotiations assurances were received from WSC that (i) from fiscal
1985 onwards WSC's accounts will be audited by auditors experienced in public
utility accounting systems and acceptable to the Bank; (ii) that the audited
financial statements including the auditors report will be received by the
Bank within six months after the end of the fiscal year; and that (iii) for
the intervening time, the Government Auditing Department would continue to
audit WSC's account and WSC will forward to the Bank not later than six months
after the end of the fiscal year, copies of the audited financial statements,
as well as its audit report.
Insurance
5.19     WSC carries insurance adequate to cover the risks of a public utili-
ty.  The policies are with a Jordanian insurance company and relate to work-
man's compensation and third party liability of operating its vehicles.   In
view of the future expansion of WSC's operations, it would be appropriate that
the extent of insurance coverage be assessed at least once a year.   During
negotiations agreement was obtained from WSC that it would assess annually the
adequacy of its insurance coverage and make adjustments if necessary and
forward such report to the Bank before the end of the calendar year.

VI. FINANCE
Past and Present Position
6.01      WSC's past and  present financial position  reflects  its  operations,
which consist of providing water in bulk to municipalities and operating rural
water systems and desert water wells.  These rural water systems are operated
by WSC on behalf of the Government, as part of its program to enhance living
conditions in those areas.  Unit production costs  for some of these  systems
are up to ten times higher than those found in the urban agglomerations
because of the lack of economies of scale.  Tariffs in line with  these costs
would be prohibitively high and costs of these operations exceeding the
corresponding revenues are covered by the Government.
6.02      Because of shortcomings in WSC's existing accounting system which is
on a cash basis and follows the one prescribed for Government Agencies, only
the results of the past three years (1979-1981) could be compiled with some
degree  of accuracy  (Annex  12).  These results  have  to  be  interpreted  with
caution and serve primarily statistical purposes. WSC's overall net cash flow
including Government subsidies for rural areas was adequate to meet its opera-
tional requirements and to provide some limited financing for works under
construction.  The Zarqa - Ruseifa  municipal water  systems  achieved  better
results due to lower operating and capital costs associated with economies of
scale, and a larger portion of new works were financed out of the net cash
flow.
6.03      The low debt/equity ratio  (WSC 15:85  in 1981 Zarqa/Ruseifa  10:90  in
1981) shows that a large portion of the assets was constructed with Government
contributions  .  Although  the municipalities  of Zarqa/Ruseifa  have  over the
years obtained a number of loans for their water systems, the amounts were
small and their servicing will in future pose no difficulty.  The increase in
WSC's debt between 1979 and the end of 1981 is primarily due to four borrow-
ings related to the construction of the Aqaba water system.
Tariff - Cost Recovery
6.04      WSC's tariffs  are  subject to approval by the Council of Ministers.
Annex  10  provides  detailed  information  on  existing  tariffs.   Whilst water
tariffs for urban areas are in line with the cost of water supply services,
cost of these services in rural and desert areas which cover a population of
about 150,000 are supported by GOJ (para. 6.01).  The structure of the water
tariff is adequate with an average tariff for municipal areas estimated at JD.
0.205 per m3, after the last tariff increase in May 1982.
Sewerage
6.05      WSC has a schedule of sewerage tariffs.  However, these were set with
little reference to current operating cost as to date WSC is not operating
full scale sewerage facilities  including treatment plants.  This, will change
in the future as WSC will not only operate the Zarqa/Ruseifa sewer and sewage
disposal system but also those of Irbid, Jerash and Aqaba, which  are either
being built or where construction is about to start.



- 26 -
6.06     Existing laws provide that, once a municipality has taken the deci-
sion to construct sewerage, landlords must contribute to its cost by paying
for 20 years a tax of 4% on the annual rental value of the property which is
based on the prevailing annual rent.  The one time contribution together with
the annual 4% assessment on the rental value aggregated over 20 years based on
1981 data totalled to JD 95.500 (US$ 276) for a typical plot which is deemed
to be affordable.  In addition, at the time of connection to sewers, landlords
have to make a onetime contribution amounting to 25% of the annual rental
value.   The rental value  is established or adjusted  either  once  a rental
agreement is concluded or a major structural improvement has been made.  Due
to these infrequent adjustments the rental value is not the most appropriate
basis for making the benefitting population participate sufficiently in the
cost of constructing sewers.  However, increases in land value will accrue in
the  future  from sewerage.   This  is particularly  the case  in Zarqa/Ruseifa
where sewerage would replace the existing system of cesspools and would
relieve users from having to bear the cost of frequent and costly cesspool
emptying.  It would, therefore, be appropriate to recuperate at least part of
the increases in land value through an adequate combination of specific
charges or levies.  Such a combination of levies, together with user charges
and tariffs would have to be developed within the framework of a tariff study
(draft terms of reference, Annex 16), the execution of which will be monitored
through the project implementation schedule.
6.07     As some of these charges (para. 6.06) may be collected by the Govern-
ment, measures should be taken to ensure the financial viability of WSC's sew-
erage operations.  Minimum financial performance should therefore require WSC
to set its tariffs and its user charges for sewerage at such levels that the
combined revenues, including payments by Government collected in the form of
direct assessment on the beneficiaries, cover at least operating and
maintenance expenses including depreciation or debt service whichever is
higher.   This  objective  should  become  applicable  for  all  WSC  sewerage
operations once fully commissioned, which, in the case of Zarqa/Ruseifa would
be by January 1, 1986.
Water Services
6.08     WSC's tariffs for water services in urban areas should over the med-
ium term cover the full cost of service and provide 10% of the respective
investment program.  For the rural areas where WSC is providing basic water
services on behalf of the Government full cost coverage of this operation is
not feasible due to the high cost of these operations.   Likewise it is not
possible for WSC to achieve financial viability through cross-subsidization
because of the relatively small number of urban consumers that WSC is servic-
ing.   Consumers  in  rural  areas,  with  the  exception  of  the  desert  areas,
contribute towards the operating and maintenance cost.   The extent to which
these costs are covered cannot at present be established due to the absence of
an adequate accounting system (para. 5.13).  Once this system becomes opera-
tional, it should provide the necessary data base.
6.09     Existing water tariffs for WSC's urban services, in particular those
prevailing in Zarqa/Ruseifa, meet in general the aforementioned objective.
Nevertheless, the proposed tariff study (para. 6.06) would also reassess the
adequacy of WSC's water tariffs.



- 27 -
Agreements reached
6.10     Agreement was reached during negotiations  that upon completion and
review of the tariff study, WSC would implement for its sewerage operation, an
appropriate combination of user charges and tariffs that would, together with
payments by Government collected in the form of direct assessment on the
beneficiaries, cover in full operating and maintenance costs and debt service
or depreciation on properly valued assets, whichever is higher, and that such
combination of user charges and tariffs for the Zarqa/Ruseifa operation would
be applicable from the time of full commissioning.   In order to ensure that
beneficiaries contribute to the investments in sewerage, agreement was
obtained from the Government that: (i) upon review of the tariff study, it
will, after consultation with the Bank, implement a system of sewerage user
charges and fees related to benefits due to the provision of sewer services
including increases in land value; and that (ii) such user charges and fees
would become applicable for the Zarqa/Ruseifa system by January 1, 1986, at
the latest, and for all other systems where significant benefits including
increases in land value due to sewerage are observed once these systems are
fully commissioned.
6.11     As  far as WSC's  future water tariffs are concerned,  agreement was
reached during negotiations that WSC will: (i) for its urban water services
maintain or adjust water tariffs that: (a) would in each of its fiscal years
till the end of its fiscal year 1985 produce revenues sufficient to cover its
operating and maintenance costs as well as debt service or depreciation on
properly valued assets whichever is higher; and (b) would from fiscal year
1986 provide revenues sufficient to cover operating and maintenance expenses
(excluding depreciation), debt service and increased working capital, and to
finance not less than 10% of the average investment cost in each consecutive
three-year period comprising an actual and two forecast years; and (ii) for
its rural water services review tariff levels and implement adjustments as
needed to cover from January 1, 1987 a reasonable percentage of operating and
maintenance expenses to be agreed upon with the Government.   Also assurances
were received from the Government that it would continue to provide sufficient
funds  for  operating  the  rural  water  systems.   The  aforementioned  cash
generation covenant would be monitored by annual reviews. During negotiations
agreement was reached from WSC that it would provide the Bank three months
before the beginning of each fiscal year with copies of its proposed forecast
budget for such fiscal year and financial projections for the following two
years, as well as the proposed tariff actions.
Financing Plan
6.12     The table below shows WSC's estimated financing requirement and the
sources of funds for the construction period (1983-1989) of the Zarqa/Ruseifa
system. WSC's overall financing plan is shown in Annex 11.

The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government which would onlend it
to WSC on substantially similar terms and conditions including capitalized
interest and commitment charges. Similar arrangements are assumed to apply to
the other loans related to the project.   In view of the sizeable investments
in sewerage, which will be fully utilized only over a long period of time,
internal cash generation will be modest.   Customers'  contributions collected
in the form of a special tax on rental values (para. 6.06) will over the
construction period provide about 6.1X of the funds needed.
Future Financial Performance
6.13    Forecast  financial  statements  including  the  underlying  assumptions
both for the Zarqa/Ruseifa operation, as well as for WSC as a whole are shown
in Annex 12.  In view of WSC's formative phase projections longer than three
years beyond the current Government Five-Year-Plan (1981-1985) would not be
meaningful.  The financial statements for WSC, therefore, go to 1988.  As the
Zarqa/Ruseifa operation is straightforward the financial statements were
projected through 1992.  The principal assumptions used in these projections
are that: (i) tariffs would after project start-up be adjusted annually for
meeting the proposed covenants; (ii) the Government would cover part of the
operating losses associated with the rural water systems; and (iii) operating



- 29 -
costs would increase reflecting higher inputs due to greater production levels
and adjustment for inflation which is assumed to be 8% for 1982, decreasing to
6% for 1986 and thereafter.   Financing of overall annual investments out of
internally generated funds would be rather limited for WSC as a whole.
6.14    Internal cash generation should cover debt service adequately, both
for WSC as a whole as for the Zarqa/Ruseifa operation.  Debt service coverage
is projected to be around 1.0 from 1989 onwards.

VII. ECONOMICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS
Health Benefits and Environmental Impact
7.01    The present level of public water supply service in Zarqa and Ruseifa
is generally unsatisfactory.  Many inhabitants are unable to obtain an ade-
quate supply because of low water pressures, and polluted groundwater finds
its way into the system through leakages in the system endangering public
health. The project is designed to correct this situation by improving the
distribution system and reducing pollution in the groundwater through replac-
ing present cesspools with sewerage.
7.02    Sanitary conditions in the two cities will be greatly improved by the
proposed system which will eliminate the present health hazards caused by
overflows  from cesspools.   Removal of cesspool effluent  from the soil will
also remove the threat of contamination of the lower aquifers below the two
cities, which are presently used for public water supply.  Direct discharge of
untreated sewage into the Zarqa River will also be curtailed, and with the
treatment facility provided in the project the quality of water in the Zarqa
River as well as in the King Talal Reservoir will be improved.
Least Cost Solution
7.03    The proposed project is the least-cost solution for the improvement of
the water supply distribution and for proper disposal of wastewater in the
cities  of  Zarqa  and  Ruseifa.   Consultants  have  conducted  a comprehensive
hydraulic analysis of the water distribution networks for the two cities and
have studied various configurations of the sewerage system to come up with the
present  proposal which  is considered  to be optimal.   The  sewage  treatment
plant and pumping station will be staged and the size of the present proposed
phase is found to be the least cost alternative.   The trunk sewers will be
built to their ultimate capacity as this is the most economical and feasible
solution.
Economic Analysis
7.04    For the purpose of economic analysis, financial costs and benefits are
expressed in constant December 1982 prices, and project costs were adjusted
for duties and taxes.  Since unemployment is low and there is no minimum wage
in the country, shadow pricing of labor was not considered to be necessary.
In fact, Jordan employs a substantial amount of imported labor, particularly
in the construction field, and this has the effect of keeping labor wages at
very competitive levels.  There is no foreign exchange control in Jordan and
the Jordanian Dinar is allowed to float in the open market.  For this reason,
shadow pricing of foreign exchange was not needed.
7.05    The water supply component constitutes about 14 percent of the total
project cost and is only part of the costs required for future water supply
(see Annex 13, page 1). The major cost of meeting future water demands of the
two cities will be in the purchase of additional water required after 1986,
when the allowable groundwater extraction from the aquifer is expected to be
reached (para. 2.04).  This external source of water, which is assumed to be



- 31 -
from the East Ghor Main Canal, is estimated to cost about JD 0.300/m3 and its
use would about  triple  the  present  cost  of water  production.   It  is not
possible to estimate meaningful benefits for water supply, and so an internal
rate of return for the water supply component of the project cannot be
computed.  The average incremental cost (A.I.C.) of water supply has however
been calculated and is found to be JD 0.341/m3 at a discount rate of 10
percent (Annex 13), of which about JD 0.240/m3 is attributable to future water
purchases.  Thus, prior to the need of WSC to purchase water from an external
source around 1986, WSC's average tariff (JD 0.140/m3 in 1982, Annex 12, page
3) will be more than adequate to recover costs (the A.I.C. excluding the cost
of water purchase from the East Ghor Main Canal is estimated to be about JD
0.100/m3).  Looking ahead beyond 1986, WSC's tariffs with a highest block rate
of JD 0.400/m3 (Annex 10) already reflect the A.I.C. and will therefore
promote conservation and economic water use.  The proposed tariff study (para.
6.06) will further examine the appropriate tariff structure that will allow
adequate cost recovery also beyond 1986.
7.06    Costs for the sewerage component are shown in Annex 14.  Benefits will
accrue from improvement in health, both in the Zarqa/Ruseifa area and, as a
result of a general upgrading in the Zarqa River, providing better quality
water  for downstream usage such as agriculture.   In addition,  savings will
arise from reduction and eventual elimination of costly cesspool operations in
the two cities.   Sewerage will also provide more reliable service, and will
make it possible to avoid the nuisance and inconvenience associated with
cesspool  operations.   However,  the  majority  of  these  benefits  cannot  be
quantified, and so it is not possible to compute a meaningful rate of return
for  the  project.   It  is nevertheless  possible  to  compute  the  A.I.C.  for
sewerage and this is found to be JD 0.286/m3 at a discount rate of 10%.
7.07    For  the  purpose  of  determining  consumers'  willingness  to  pay,  an
attempt was made to estimate what residents are now paying for cesspool
operation.   Based on the size  of  the  tanker  fleets  operating  in  the  two
cities, a total amount of about JD 450,000 is estimated to be spent by city
residents  annually  for cesspool  emptying  alone.   In order  to maintain  the
service even at the present less-than-satisfactory level it is estimated
conservatively that cesspools will have to be reconstructed every 20 years,
otherwise  cost  of cesspool  emptying will  become  excessive.   Even now some
residents have to have their cesspools emptied almost every two weeks, paying
an equivalent of about JD 1.00 per mi3 of water consumed.  At an average cost
of JD 450 (in December 1982 prices) for constructing an 18 m 3 cesspool,  the
average  size  in  Zarqa/Ruseifa,  the  annual  cost  for  reconstructing  32,000
cesspools  in the cities  is JD 720,000.   The total annual cost of cesspool
operation  for  the two cities  amounts  therefore  to JD  1,170,000.   With  an
estimated  water  consumption  of  4,500,000  m3  in  1982  residents  are  thus
paying for their cesspool operation an equivalent of about JD 0.260 (in 1982
prices) on every cubic meter of water consumed. In light of this analysis the
users should be willing to pay for sewerage at least JD 0.260/m3 of water
consumed, and up to the A.I.C. of JD 0.286/m3 in view of the better quality
service they would be receiving (para. 7.06).
7.08    The  amount  that  a  family  in  the  20th  percentile  income  level  is
currently paying for water supply, based on existing water tariffs (Annex 10),



- 32 -
on the assumption that consumption is approximately 30 lcd., is about 0.9% of
the household income.  For the same family sewerage charges as determined in
para.  7.07 will take up about 2.1% of the household income.   The combined
water and sewerage charges will therefore amount to 3.0% of household income
and are considered to be within the affordability to pay of the population in
the two cities.
Institution Building
7.09    The Government has recently announced its intention to have all water
and sewerage systems outside of Amman and the Jordan Valley to be managed by
WSC in an effort to better utilize scarce managerial resources in the sector
and to provide improved services.   In the next few years WSC will be in a
stage of rapid expansion in order to cope with its enlarged responsibilities.
The project will offer the opportunity to help develop the managerial and
financial  capabilities  of  this  very  important  sector  organization.   In
addition WSC's staff, through association with the supervision consultant and
Bank  staff,  will  be  able  to  acquire  skills  in  project  preparation  and
analysis, project management and construction supervision, all of which will
be invaluable for the development of further projects.
Risks
7.10    There will be some risks involved in the execution of the proposed
project.   Only a limited amount of construction work on sewerage and sewage
treatment plants has been executed in Jordan and WSC, the executing agency,
has no experience with largeseweragesystems at all.  There is therefore a risk
of delay in project construction and cost overrun.  WSC staff, as well as the
municipality staff that it will be taking over, have no experience in the
operating of sewerage systems and sewage treatment plants and will have to be
trained for this work.  A very intensive program for sewer connection will be
needed upon commissioning of the sewage treatment plant.  This will require
good administrative procedures as well as dedication of staff, to enable this
program to be accomplished in the time planned, in order that project benefits
may be achieved as expected. Much effort will be required of WSC to enable it
to develop institutionally into an efficient well-run organization.   Success
of this will rest heavily on the commitment of WSC's management and on its
ability to overcome the present serious shortage of experienced staff.
However, these risks are worth taking in view of the good record of the
Jordanian Government in implementing projects.
7.11    The measures recommended in this report, such as (i) the assistance of
consultants for construction supervision and conducting tariff studies; (ii)
experts to assist in the development and implementation of an appropriate
accounting system; (iii) experts to assist in conducting the organization
study and to implement organizational changes; (iv) the proposed training for
WSC staff; (v) the Bank's monitoring of key performance indicators for WSC and
the Zarqa/Ruseifa system and providing necessary advice during supervision,
should help to minimize the project risks.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01    During negotiations, agreement was reached on various issues referred
to in Chapters II through VI of this report.
8.02    The Project Financing Plan was  confirmed  by  the Government  (para.

ZARQA AND RUSEIFA WATER SUPPLY & SEWERAGE PROJECT
MAJOR ASSUMPTION USE!) IN FINANCIAL PROJECTION
Income Statement
Income
Revenues from water and sewerage tariffs are assumed to be increased
to meet over the projection period the proposed financial covenants, i.e.,
water tariffs would be established so as to cover operationg expenses, debt
service, or depreciation, whichever is higher and working capital increases
and provide 10% of the investment costs; sewerage tariffs would cover
operating and maintenance expenses and debt service. A bad debt provision
applicable to water sales and sewerage services of 2.5% was assumed.
Operating Expenses
All operating expenses are assumed to be subject to the following
inflationary increases: 1983 8%, 1984 7.5%, 1985 7%, 1986 and thereafter 6%.
Salaries and wages are based on WSC's salaries and wages scales prevailing in
1982. Adjustments have been made in the number of staff because of the future
increases in WSC's activities. Also payroll was adjusted to allow for general
salary adjustments and for inflation. The quantity of energy/fuel and
chemical was projected on the basis of operating requirements.
Routine maintenance excluding major replacement was estimated to
average about .9% of fixed assets values relating to the water activities and
.3% of fixed assets values for sewerage. General and administrative expenses
were projected in line with the expanded activities. They are, however,
assumed to decrease over time in proportion to sales. Capitalized expenses
include the cost of preparation and supervision of major construction projects
by WSC's staff. Assets were depreciated on a straight-line basis which
averages at 2.9% of fixed assets for water works and at 2.7% for sewerage
works.

Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet
The Government's contributions consist of contributions to WSC's
investment program which are included in the draft five year plan (1981 -
1985), as well as of grants for the construction of water works and sewerage
to be operated by WSC. Customer's contributions include the amount collected
in line with current legislation which provides for payment over a period of
20 years of 4% of the annual rental value of the property in each year as well
as a one time fee of 25% of the annual rental value payable at time of
connecting to sewage. In addition some minor contributions referred to in
WSC's regulation as application fees are included hereunder. Accounts payable
include two months of consumable operating materials and provision for
retention money. Inventories are assumed to be at 6 months value of supplies
of materials, chemicals and fuel. Accounts receivables are assmued to average
at about 2 months of sales to private customers and government agencies.
The onlent proceeds of the Bank loan are assumed to carry an interest
rate of 11.6% p.a., a commitment charge of 0.75% on the undisbursed balance,
and would be repayable over 12 years after an initial grace period of 5 years.
Other loans for the project which include the proceeds of the KFW and USAID
loans are assumed to be repaid over 20 years after an initial 10 year grace
period and to carry an interest rate of 6% per annum. The loan of the
Islamic Bank is projected to be for 15 years including 5 years of grace and
bears interest at 3% p.a.
Other loans from different lending agencies which are still under
discussion are assumed to be made available to WSC over 30 years including 10
years of grace at an interest of 4%. Other non-identified loans for the
Zarqa/Ruseifa system are supposed to come after 1988 from presently
unidentified sources and are assumed to be made available to WSC on
concessionary terms, i.e., repayment over 16 years after an initial 4 year
grace period and at an interest rate of 8% per annum.
Interest during construction and the Bank front end fee were capitalized
and transferred to fixed assets in operation at the time of commissioning. During
the construction period interest payments to the various lenders will be made
by the Government and added to the onlent proceeds of the various loans. These
capitalized charges are shown as a Government loan.

FINANCIAL ADVISOR
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Background
The Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
is in charge of water services and sewerage for all areas outside Amman and
the Jordan Valley. WSC is a corporation owned by the Government of Jordan and
managed along the lines of a public utility by a general manager and
supervised by a Board of Directors. WSC is in the process of taking over a
number of municipal water systems, which are or are about to be rehabilitated
and expanded. In most of these cities also sewerage will be constructed. All
capital works are executed by outside contractors.
The present accounting system is on a cash basis and follows the
Government system prescribed for its agencies. This system will, however, in
future not meet the accounting requirements for managing a public utility.

Financial Officer of WSC. As such he would be expected to cooperate directly
on all matters related to WSC's finance and accounting activities with the
Chief Financial Officer, and other officers of WSC and to participate WSC's
top management team.
The financial advisor would specifically be responsible to:
(i) adapt with appropriate modifications one of the computer based public
utility accounting systems used in similar areas and which inter-alia
operates on an accrual basis;
(ii) implement such accounting systems on a computer in close collaboration
with a computer service bureau;
(iii) implement and maintain efficient accounting and cost procedures;
(iv) assist in the preparation of annual and other periodic financial
statements;



- 67 -                            Annex 15

HASHMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
ZARQA AND RUSEIFA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
TARIFF STUDY
TERMS OF REFERENCE
BACKGROUND
The Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
is in charge of water services and sewerage for all areas outside Amman and
the Jordan Valley. WSC is a corporation owned by the Government of Jordan and
managed along the lines of a public utility by a general manager and
supervised by a Board of Directors. WSC is in the process of taking over a
number of municipal water systems, which are or are about to be rehabilitated
and expanded. In most of these cities sewerage will also be constructed. All
capital works are executed by contractors.
For a number of these systems feasibility studies have been prepared
which not only provide data on estimated construction costs but also outlines
of tariff proposals.
CONSULTANT'S QUALIFICATIONS
It is essential that the consultant has successfully completed a
tariff study of similar scope and degree of anlysis for a public utility. The
consultant has to be fully familiar with the economic and financial concepts
underlying prices of public services. As the tariff study is not limited to
the design of tariff structures but will also require studying the
introduction of possible user charges in the form of frontage fees and or
taxation of increases in land values, familiarity with administrative
procedures would be an asset. Familiarity with Middle East Countries would
also be of value.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of the tariff study is to establish the basis for a
system of water and sewerage tariffs and appropriate user charges that would
not only recover the cost in full the economy incurs in providing these
services but also provide a mechanism geared at water conservation. In
proposing various sets of tariff structures and user charges the study would
have to take into account the ability to pay. These tariff structures and



- 69 -
Annex 16
Page 2
user charges would also have to ensure the financial viability of WSC. User
charges in this context would not have to be limited to those charges that
could be directly assessed and collected by WSC but could also be in the form
of taxation, or levying of frontage fees by the Government to recover benefits
from increased land values due to projects. The consultants would therefore
have to assess likely increases in land values brought about by water supply
and sewerage projects.
Apart from proprosing tariff structures and user charges, the
consultant is expected to provide WSC with the basis for updating this study
through appropriate documentation of the work method.
ASSISTANCE TO BE PROVIDED FOR BY WSC
WSC will provide the consultant with the following assistance:
(i) logistics: office, ground transport, secretarial services in English,
language interpretation to the extent required;
(ii) data collection: studies, reports, census data, tax data, maps,
cadastral surveys, cost estimates and actual costs concerning
projects under construction or in operation, operating expenses;
(iii) counterpart staff: at least two full time counterpart staff with
knowledge in engineering, finance, economics and statistics to assist
consultant in his work.
SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of work involves the following activities:
(i) data gathering including review of existing tariff studies and
proposals and assessment of increases in land values due to the
project;
(ii) analysis of data;
(iii) establishing principles for pricing water services including
connection and other charges for urban as well as rural users: for
urban users the objective will be to achieve overall full cost
recovery, for rural users tariffs will be geared to the affordability
of the consumers;
(iv) establishing principles for pricing sewerage charges, including
connection charges, customer contributions, user charges, levies on
increased land values due to the project;



- 70 -
Annex 16
Page 3
(v) preparation of a system of user charges and levies to recover
benefits due to increased land values for the Zarqa/Ruseifa operation
of WSC and for all other branch offices;
(vi) based on pricing principles established, preparation of financial
projections for the period up to 1992 for the Zarqa/Ruseifa operation
and up to 1990 for each of WSC's major branch offices and for WSC as
a whole for different scenarios of financial objectives to De
achieved, including the ability to generate funds internally for
future investments, to be done separately for water supply and
sewerage operations;
(vii) preparation of financial projections for WSC's rural water operations
for different scenarios of charges for rural customers;
(viii) preparation of alternative tariff proposals and structures for water
supply in urban areas which will reflect the long run incremental
cost and meet the various scenarios of financial objectives
considered;
(ix) preparation of alternative tariff proposals and structures for water
supply in rural areas;
(x) preparation of alternative proposals for a system of sewerage charges
which will include tariffs and other user charges to be collected by
WSC, other user charges and levies to be collected by the Government
or its agencies, and transferred by the Government to WSC;
(xi) establishing principles and eligibility criteria for granting credit
facilities to low-income customers for covering the charges for
installing house connections to fronting mains and sewers based on an
assessment of affordability; and
(xii) training of WSC staff whilst preparing the tariff study to ensure
that WSC staff can in future update these studies.
In determining the tariff structure, the consultant shall distinguish
between economic and financial costs.
EXECUTION OF STUDY
Review Existing Situation
In reviewing the existing situation, the consultant will consider
among others the following sources of information:



- 71 -
Annex 16
Page 4
(i)  Feasibility Study for Zarqa/Ruseifa Water Distribution, Sewerage and
Stormwater Systems;
(ii) Final Master Plan Report and Engineering Design and Economic Analysis
Report for wastewater disposal for Greater Amman Area;
(iii) Feasiblity Study for Irbid Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
(iv) Staff Appraisal Report for the Zarqa/Ruseifa Water Supply and
Sewerage Project.
Future demand for water supply and sewerage
Having reviewed the aforementioned reports and studies, the
consultant will update the projections for future demand for water supply and
sewerage.
In updating these demand projections, the consultant shall take into
consideration development plans, envisaged growth of industries and other
important commercial activities.
The demand projections will have to be made by segmentation i.e.,
industries, public services, commercial households, and will be expressed in
terms of numbers of connections, volume of production and consumption of
water, volume and strength of sewage flow.
Having completed these projections, the consultant will discuss these
and the bases thereof with officals of WSC and the Government to obtain an
agreement for further progress of the study.
Review of Capital and Operating Costs
The consultant will use for estimating capital cost, the information
provided in awarded water supply and sewerage contracts. In consultation with
WSC's consulting engineers, the consultant will determine appropriate levels
of operating costs and together with WSC working capital requirements
including inventories of spare parts and materials as well as levels of
debtors and creditors.
DEVELOPING TARIFFS
Having collected, reviewed and analysed all data as outlined in the
previous paragraphs and discussed with WSC, the consultant will formulate a
proposed tariff policy which would conform to WSC's objectives as well as to
the covenants laid down in the lending agreements with its lending agencies.
Among other things, the tariff policy should consider charges and levies to be



- 72 -
Annex 16
Page 5
borne by the user and related to the project to ensure full cost recovering,
pricing in all its forms as a vehicle for rationing scarce resources, and
financial performance objectives as laid down in lending agreements.
Consideration should also be given to the special needs for providing
low-income families with concessionary tariff for a life line supporting
volume of water or other concessional charges, including facilities for paying
connection charges by installments. The criteria for establishing eligibility
for such concessions should be outlined by the consultant.
The consultant shall also make proposals for the basis of charging
for connections, meter rent, deposits, disconnections, etc. He would review
and propose modifications if deemed advisable of the existing system of
contributions towards the capital costs of sewerage which consist of specific
one-time charges by the owners of the building at the time of the connection
and recurrent contributions.
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Having established the projected capital and operating costs of the
water supply and sewerage systems, and having established the tariff
structure, the consultant shall make financial projections for WSC's in
general and its major branch offices in respect of the following:
(a) income and expenditure;
(b) balance sheets; and
(c) cash flow, showing the funding required each year to meet projected
cash flow deficits, or the surplus available each year to meet the
investment needs of WSC as a whole.
PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The consultant shall clearly document how the projection and
estimates were arrived at, and the source and basis of all assumptions. The
tariff calculations and projected financial statements shall be discussed and
agreed with WSC. The consultant shall furthermore provide guidelines to
enable WSC to periodically update the tariff calculations and financial
projections.

Background
1.       The Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
is in charge of water supply and sewerage services for all areas outside Amman
and the Jordan Valley.  WSC is a corporation owned by the Government of Jordan
and managed along the lines of a public utility by a General Manager (Director
General of WSC) and supervised by a Board of Directors.  WSC is in the process
of taking over a number of municipal water systems, which are or are about to
be rehabilitated and expanded.  In most of these cities sewerage will also be
constructed. All capital works are executed by outside contractors.
2.       WSC's operational responsibility will experience unprecedented growth
in the next few years. This study is intended to examine WSC's organizational
requirements during a period of high growth, identify and resolve manpower and
other  resource  constraints,   and  develop  administrative  procedures  and
reporting systems to help streamline operations.  Concurrent with this study,
WSC will be implementing a computer based public utility accounting system in
its Financial Department, as well as streamlining procedures for accounting,
costing,  financial  reporting,  revenue collection and budgeting.   This work
will be carried out with  the assistance  of a financial  advisor.   Also,  a
technical advisor will be engaged to provide advice on project planning and on
the  technical  aspects  of  operations  and  maintenance.   These  aspects  are
therefore not included in the tasks of the Management and Organization study.
Due account should however be taken of the impact of the proposed changes in
WSC's Financial Department and of the work of the technical advisor on the
recommendations of this study.
Scope of Work
3.             The  main  tasks  of  this  study  are,  but  are  not  necessarily
limited to, the following:
(A) Organization and Management
(i)    define WSC's present and future role in the water supply and
sewerage sector in the light of recent Government policies, and
determine expected growth pattern of WSC's operations;
(ii)    define the main functions and geographical divisions and level
of management talent required to head these functions;
(iii)    define the main procedures to be used  for planning,  decision
making and reporting;
(iv)    design  organizational  structure  for WSC  headquarters  and  for
each WSC department and regional and branch office;
(v)    prepare  job descriptions  and statement  of objectives  for all
managerial positions down to Branch Office Manager level;

(i)    assess  WSC's  manpower  requirements  based  on  the  proposed
organizational structures and projection of WSC's operational
activities over the next ten years;
(ii)    assess  gap  in  staffing  needs  in  terms  of  number,   job
classification and expertise and experience required (account
should be taken of better utilization of existing staff together
with associated training needed);
(iii)    establish recruitment plan in accordance with the build-up of
WSC's operations;
(iv)    review  existing  recruiting  practice  and  make  proposals  for
improvement;
(v)    assess training needs and prepare training proposals to include
possible in-house training and training at appropriate training
institutions;
(C) Personnel Policies and Procedures
(i)    review existing personnel policies, including salary structure,
position classification, staff performance review procedures,
bonus sytems, incentive method and procedures and propose
necessary improvements;
(ii)    review and propose improvements to personnel record procedures.
(D) Administrative Procedures
(i)    develop internal administrative procedures  for liaison between
WSC headquarters and operational units;
(ii)    develop administrative procedures for communications, transport,
security and all other matters related to operations;
(E) Reporting Systems
(i)    develop  management  reporting  systems  to  include  reporting
formats, type of reports, periodicity, timing and responsibility
for preparation and report distribution (reporting requirements
of the Financial Department will be dealt with separately, but
the study should tie these in with the total management
reporting system for WSC).
Consultant's Qualifications
4.       The consultant must have  completed  in the past  a management  and
organization study of similar scope and complexity for a public utility in
which the proposals of the study have been successfully implemented.  As the
consultant's proposals may involve changes in work habit, familiarity with
customs and practices in Middle East countries is a requirement. Knowledge of
labor regulations and established Government administrative regulations and
procedures in Jordan will be an asset.

HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
Zarga/Ruseifa Water Supply and Sewerage Project
Technical Advisor
Draft Terms of Reference
Background
1.       The Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
is in charge of water supply and sewerage services for all areas outside Amman
and the Jordan Valley.  WSC is a corporation owned by the Government of Jordan
and managed along the lines of a public utility by a General Manager (Director
General of WSC) and supervised by a Board of Directors.  WSC is in the process
of taking over a number of municipal water systems, which are or are about to
be rehabilitated and expanded.  In most of these cities sewerage will also be
constructed. All capital works are executed by outside contractors.
2.       WSC has recently established a Planning Department which will, among
other things, be responsible for long term planning and preparation of pro-
jects.  WSC's water supply and sewerage operations are carried out by five
regional offices which report to the Director General.
Scope of Work
3.       The Technical Advisor will provide assistance and advice to the Dir-
ector of the Planning Department to establish a mechanism for planning and
preparation of projects to meet the future water supply and sewerage needs in
WSC's service areas. He will also have to review major operating and mainten-
ance functions in WSC and propose such measures as are necessary for the
improvement of WSC's operating efficiency and the services it provides.  He
will then assist in the implementation of these proposals after they have been
approved by the Director General of WSC, including the provision of any train-
ing needed.
4.       The tasks of the Technical Advisor will be, but are not limited to,
the following:
(A)  Planning and Preparation of Projects
(i)    review present system for collection of data on water production,
water consumption and sewage flows and other data required for
planning purposes in WSC's service areas, and propose improve-
ments;
(ii)    assist WSC to develop a system to assess demand for water supply
and sewerage in its service areas which will allow future updat-
ing;
(iii)    assist WSC to identify water supply and sewerage projects in the
next ten years;
(iv)    prepare schedule for development of projects including drafting
terms of reference for engineering studies required.

Annex 18
Page 2
(B) Water Supply and Sewerage Operations
(i)    review of WSC's water supply and sewage regulations and suggest
improvements.  Particular attention should be given to measures
to enforce pretreatment of strong industrial sewage and treat-
ment of toxic wastes;
(ii)    propose system for preparing and maintaining record (as-built)
drawings of WSC's water supply and sewer systems for use in its
operations;
(iii)    propose measures to streamline operations including preparation
of operational manuals for, but not restricted to, the following:
a.   procedures and actions required for water supply and sewer
connections;
b.   routines for water network operation;
c.   measures to ensure water meter accuracy, including system-
atic meter replacement, meter repair and testing;
d.   network repair and sewer cleaning;
e.   sewage treatment plant operation;
f.   establishment of a preventive maintenance program;
g.   stores management;
h.   water quality control.
(iv)    propose system for leakage detection and control and measures to
detect illegal connections.
(v)    propose measures to ensure proper use of water supply and sewer-
age by the public to include, but not to be limited to:
a.   programs  to raise  public  awareness  of need  to  conserve
water;
b.   incidences requiring disconnection of water service;
c.   cases when legal action is required and necessary procedures
to take.
Qualifications Required
The technical advisor must have considerable experience in the opera-
tion of water supply and sewerage systems, and must have worked in a water
supply and sewerage utility in a technical managerial capacity. While experi-
ence in both water supply and sewerage is desirable, in the absence of a can-
didate who excels in both subsectors, experience in water supply will be given
priority consideration, since the major part of WSC's present activities is in
water  supply.   The technical  advisor must also have experience  in project
planning and prior exposure to project design and preparation.  Knowledge of
customs and practice in Middle East countries will be an asset.
