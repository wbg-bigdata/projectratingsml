BURMA
APPRAISAL OF THE TIN AND TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Burma and the No. 2 Mining Corporation (formerly
the Myanma Tin Tungsten Corporation) have requested a US$16 million credit
for a project to reintroduce dredging to the tin mining industry of Burma.
The project would include a dredge and associated beneficiation and infra-
structural facilities, gravel pump mining equipment, and a central concen-
trating plant designed to upgrade tin and tungsten ores from various mines.
The project is located about 300 km south east of Rangoon in the Tenasserim
Division of Burma. Output of tin concentrates (about 75% tin) would be ex-
panded by about 800 long tons per year (LTPY) and the improved upgrading
facilities would produce better quality, higher grade tin and tungsten con-
centrates than are presently produced, thus making them more marketable
and able to bring higher prices. Also included in the project is a study of
the future development of the mineral sector, with a view to the identifica-
tion of further projects. Financing requirements for the project are estimated
at about US$28 million.
ii.       Burma's mineral sector has considerable potential for expansion,
but it has experienced a long period of decline due to war damaged facili-
ties, nationalization of private mining interests, a lack of technical ex-
pertise and investment capital, and the smuggling of mineral products, an
activity made attractive by the distorted exchange rate for the Burmese
kyat. Nearly all of the sector's output is exported, and although foreign
exchange revenue for minerals presently constitutes only about 7% of total
export earnings, it has significant potential for expansion, particularly
in tin, tungsten, copper, lead, zinc, gems, jade and antimony.
iii.      At present, no foreign investment is allowed in mining.  There
has, however, been increased sector activity in recent years, particular-
ly with technical assistance from Germany, Japan and the UNDP. Numerous
studies have been done but few projects have as yet entered the execution
stage. The best prospects include the proposed tin and tungsten expansion,
and development of the existing Bawdwin lead/zinc/silver mine, which is
the country's largest mining operation, but which has serious operating
and financial difficulties. Large projects are difficult to put together
due to the lack of project preparation experience in the country, the prob-
lem of obtaining sufficient funds given the shortage of domestic resources,
and the reluctance of the Government to come to firm agreements on project
priorities, financing sources, and the extent and nature of foreign partici-
pation. Otler problems affecting investment in the sector are insurgency
activities in certain parts of the country, the above-noted distorted ex-
change rate for the kyat, and the high tax levels which have recently been
introduced on imported equipment and production. Projects which may have very
attractive returns to the economy tend to be somewhat marginal financially, a
situation which could act against stimulating the interest of prospective



- ii -
financing institutions, and which could lead to a misallocation of resources
in the economy.
iv.       There are five mining corporations; they are all Government owned
and operate under a system of highly centralized financial and managerial
control, with all policy decisions being made at the level of the Minister
of Mines or the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers. There have
been some recent measures to extend more autonomy and responsibility to the
corporations but steps to put these intentions into practice will likely be
slow and cautious, since both the Government and the corporations are so
accustomed to close control that it will likely be some time before much
autonomous behavior results.
v.        The No. 2 Mining Corporation is the best prospect for IDA partici-
pation in the mining sector at this time. Its senior staff are technically
competent and experienced in tin mining. The Corporation has adequate
proven reserves for further expansion and it is in a financially sound posi-
tion. Furthermore, its operating costs are in the lower range of inter-
national tin and tungsten mining costs and should continue to be at a competi-
tive level even after some capital intensive mechanization, which is a pre-
requisite for obtaining a higher value product. The technology being used in
the project represents a degree of modernization appropriate to the Burmese
situation, and will be introduced in conjunction with a reasonable level of
outside technical assistance. With the start-up during 1977 of a KfW-
financed expansion of one of its major tin mines, the Corporation is expected
to be in a strong position to continue its expansion with the IDA-financed
project.
vi.       It is expected that tin demand will show modest growth, supply/
demand will be in reasonable balance, and that there will be continuance
of a modest long term upward trend in real tin prices. International Tin
Council buffer stock operations should also, in the future, moderate interna-
tional price fluctuations, especially on the downside. Demand for tungsten
is expected to continue strong and the price outlook is good. Prices may
well be more stable in the future, with some prospects for producer coopera-
tion on stabilizing prices. Even with the proposed expansion, Burma will
still be a very minor supplier to the international markets for both tin and
tungsten. With the improved product quality that will result from the project,
the country should be able to market its concentrates readily.
vii.      The project is not overly complex, and is based on feasibility
studies which incorporate Malaysian experience under very similar operating
conditions and with very similar ores. Although the Corporation is inex-
perienced in dredging and the operation of more modern facilities, the
involvement of experienced consultants throughout the project, and opera-
tional supervision for a minimum of two years after start-up should mini-
mize the technical risk. Also included in the project will be overseas
training of the key Burmese technicians. Ore reserve estimates are conser-
vative, and operating assumptions make due allowance for Burmese conditions.



- iii -
The project execution time is fairly short (about 3 years with the gravel pump
mining components perhaps coming on-stream sooner), and all facilities are
expected to be in operation by early 1980.
viii.     The project will be financed by the proposed IDA credit (US$16.0
million), the Corporation's internal cash generation (US$5.8 million), and
Government funds (US$6.0 million) to be provided either in the form of equity
or debt. The credit will finance the c.i.f. value of imported equipment and
machinery and the foreign exchange costs of the consultancy assistance, but
no local expenditures, which will all be covered by Government/Corporation
resources. All imported goods will be subjected to international competi-
tive bidding, except for some small items of highly specialized equipment,
estimated to total about US$1.0 million, for which international shopping
will be used.
ix.       The financial situation of the Corporation is projected to be sound
both during and after project execution, although the financial rate of re-
turn is expected to be only 10% after the commodity tax on production value
(13.7% before the tax). These low returns are due to the very high tax
burden, the distorted exchange rate, and lower grade reserves which will be
encountered by the dredge in the later years of operation. Nevertheless, the
economic rate of return is estimated at 21%. Net foreign exchange benefits to
the economy are projected to average US$4.6 annually (in real terms) over the
project life and substantial additional revenues will accrue to the Government
through import and production taxes and from interest on the on-lending of the
credit proceeds. Wider economic benefits will result through some increased
employment, the technical training involved, and the inclusion of infrastruc-
tural facilities in the project. Overall, the project will represent a
substantial forward step in the rehabilitation of Burma's tin industry, and
make a valuable contribution towards reversing the long downward trend in the
sector, which has the potential for a greatly expanded contribution to Burma's
economic development.
x.        The risks of this project are basically threefold and acceptable.
First, the Corporation is inexperienced in dredging and the more modern
concentrating operations to be introduced and certain weaknesses exist in
project implementation management; these are intended to be overcome by the
provision of experienced assistance in these areas. Secondly, tin and tungsten
prices could be lower than projected. Offsetting this risk is the influence
of the International Tin Council, the prospects of increased cooperation
among tungsten producers, and the important fact that the Corporation is
a producer of both tin and tungsten whose prices do not necessarily follow
identical trends and have good long term prospects. Thirdly, potential
insurgency activities present some risk, but these have been kept under
control in the area and the nearby KfW project has not been affected adversely.
xi.       Based on the agreements summarized in Chapter IX of this report, the
project is suitable for an IDA credit to the Government of Burma of US$16
million equivalent, with onlending to the No. 2 Mining Corporation of US$15.8
million equivalent for a period of 15 years, including 5 years grace, at 10%
interest per annum, and US$0.2 million equivalent used by the Government to
finance the mineral sector study.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Burma and No. 2 Mining Corporation (MC2), the
Government-owned tin and tungsten mining company, have asked IDA for a credit
of US$16 million equivalent, US$15.8 million equivalent of which would finance
the foreign exchange costs of a project to expand production of tin concen-
trates by 800 long tons per year (LTPY). The remaining US$0.2 million is for
a study of the future development of the mineral sector. The tin/tungsten
project, which is estimated to require financing of US$27.6 million equivalent,
is located in the Tenasserim Division of Burma (Map IBRD 12322) about 300
km. south east of Rangoon.
1.02      The project was appraised in Burma in March and August 1976 by
missions consisting respectively of Messrs. H.E. Wackman (Chief) and
R. Rodger of the Industrial Projects Department and Mr. A. Freyman (Con-
sultant), and Messrs. Wackman and Greig (Industrial Projects). A glossary
of technical terms is contained in Annex 1.
II. THE MINERAL SECTOR
A.   Present Position and Recent Trends
2.01      Based on official statistics (below and Annex 2), Burma's mineral
production is presently less than one-tenth of pre-World War II levels. While
inclusion of smuggling activities in the figures would increase reported pro-
duction in recent years by perhaps as much as 40%, the long-term sectoral
decline is obvious.

/a   Not available.
2.02      Burma holds a very minor position in the world production and
trade of mineral products although nearly all of its non-fuel mineral output
is exported. It currently accounts for less than 1% of world tin production,
about 1.5% of world tungsten production, and under 0.2% for zinc, lead and
silver.



-2-
2.03      Despite considerable potential for development, much of the mineral
sector remains in the decimated state which resulted from the War. No signi-
ficant new mines have been opened for 40 years, reflecting the progressive
Government take-over of private activities (especially during the 1950's
and 60's), which are now limited to illegal mining and tribute mining 1/ of
tin and tungsten by small groups of individuals. Overall, the Government
has emphasized investment in other sectors which, combined with the shortage
of foreign exchange, has left the mining sector with poor and outmoded plant
and spare parts shortages which hamper operations. Other factors contributing
to the decline of mining in Burma include: the lack of experience in project
preparation and execution; extensive insurgency activities in large areas of
the country where minerals can be produced; labor shortages at some mines due
to low wages and more attractive alternatives including illegal mining and
trade; and a distorted exchange rate for the kyat which is partly responsible
for the financial weakness of mining corporations, results in marginal finan-
cial returns for most new projects, and encourages diversion of a significant
proportion of sector output into illegal trading. The Bank is discussing with
the Burmese authorities steps, including price adjustment, by which the
illegal flow of tin and tungsten can be directed to official purchasers.
2.04      Government policy does not allow direct foreign or private partici-
pation in development of the sector -- an exception has been the recent advent
of joint ventures in petroleum exploration involving foreign oil companies.
In the non-petroleum mining sector, however, foreign participation has been
limited to bilateral and multilateral technical assistance and financial aid.
This has picked up in recent years and should result in a reversal of mining's
long-term downtrend. Agencies which have been particularly active are: KfW
of Germany, Metals Mining Agency of Japan, UNDP, Canadian International De-
velopment Association (CIDA) and, with the proposed project, IDA. While a
reasonable degree of technical competence exists at various levels in the
sector's institutions, management abilities are limited by a lack of innova-
tion and initiative. Substantial projects in the sector could not be ade-
quately prepared and implemented without extensive outside technical assis-
tance in addition to the essential outside financial resources.
B.   Impact on the Economy
2.05      While the mineral sector in Burma contributes slightly over 1% of
GDP and less than 1% of official employment, mineral exports average about
7% of total export value. Domestic consumption of the metallic minerals
produced is negligible. There are no substantial smelting, refining or
other value-adding facilities other than an antiquated lead/zinc smelter.
Despite the relatively low level of employment (about 28,000 workers), the
sector provides employment opportunities in areas of the country where these
are often limited. Although there is little scope to increase the relative
impact of the sector on employment, the opportunity for increased foreign
exchange earnings from expanded sector output is substantial (para 2.15).
1/   Tribute miners are independent individuals who work tin/tungsten deposits
under the loose supervision of MC2's staff, and sell their production to
the Corporation. Part of their output is undoubtedly smuggled out, however.



-3-
C.   Structure
2.06      A small number of government corporations, which are essentially
part of the Ministry of Mines, are responsible for all official production
of minerals. These include: the Myanma Bawdwin Corporation (now No. 1 Mining
Corporation or MCI) responsible for lead, zinc and silver production, with
.50%-60% of sector output; the Myanma Tin Tungsten Corporation (No. 2 Mining
Corporation), responsible for tin and tungsten production with 30%-40% of
sector output; the Myanma Mineral Development Corporation (No. 3 Mining
Corporation), responsible for production of antimony and coal and the de-
velopment of copper deposits; the Industrial Minerals Corporation (No. 4
Mining Corporation), responsible for production of limestone, gypsum and
other non-metallic products; and the Gem and Jade Corporation, responsible
for production and marketing of jade, rubies, pearls and other gems.
2.07      There are two main supporting entities within the Ministry:  The
Department of Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration (DGSE), responsible
for exploration and geological studies; and the Department of Planning and
Works Inspection, responsible for mine inspection, safety, planning and
statistics. The Myanma Oil Corporation (MOC) is charged with oil and gas
exploration and production. The Myanma Export Import Corporation (MEIC), a
part of the Ministry of Trade, was responsible for all export sales of
metallic products until late 1976, but this function has now been vested in a
Minerals Marketing Committee which is jointly administered by the three
metal producing corporations; i.e. Mining Corporations Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
2.08      Although called corporations, their status as separate legal enti-
ties is vague and they have extremely limited autonomous power. There are
no shares or similar instruments, ownership is by the people, and effectively
control is vested in the State. In the past, all revenues have gone to the
Union Government Consolidated Fund (UGCF), with operating and capital expendi-
tures being drawn from the Fund under extremely rigid budgets approved by the
Government. Overall, the corporations have had little effective control over
their financial resources and the UGCF has been the sole source of finance
other than a few bilateral credits on-lent through the Union Bank of Burma.
The responsibilities and powers of the mining corporations have been purely
operational and all policy decisions have been taken by the Minister of Mines
or the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers. Some liberalization of
this highly centralized management and financial control is envisaged under
new guidelines described below.
D.   Legislation and Operational Guidelines for the Sector
2.09      When the agency formerly responsible for all mining activities in
Burma (the Mineral Development Corporation) was subdivided in 1972, legisla-
tion was approved for each new corporation, outlining its powers and respon-
sibilities. In MC2's case (the entity responsible for executing the proposed
project), this was contained in the Myanma Tin Tungsten Corporation Act of
1974. In May 1975, "Standard Guidelines for the Operation of State Economic
Enterprisest' were issued by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Under
these guidelines, more autonomy and financial responsibility is intended to
rest with the corporations and new fiscal and financial measures are being



-4-
introduced. While the system of annual budgets is to be maintained, the UGCF
fund has been discontinued. Corporations now have their own bank accounts
and will meet operating expenditures out of their own receipts.
2.10      Part of net cash generation can now remain with the corporations to
offset a portion of fixed and working capital needs. Capital expenditures
will no longer be met through interest-free budgetary allocations; necessary
funds must be borrowed from the newly-formed Myanma Economic Bank. Each
enterprise is set an annual operating ratio target (defined as the ratio of
operating expenditures to revenues) to be used as one of the bases for the new
employees' bonus system. Producing corporations also now have more influence
over their own marketing (para 4.15). There will also supposedly be more
recognition of foreign exchange earners in the allocation of the country's
scarce foreign exchange resources. The changes are being introduced cautiously.
Although implementation commenced in April 1976, the Government and the
Corporations are so accustomed to close control that it will likely be some
time before much autonomous behavior results.
E.   Mineral Potential and Exploration
2.11      Burma has a highly varied and favorable mineral endowment which
justifies a strong effort in mapping and exploration. There have been
numerous foreign technical assistance missions in this respect adding to
the resources assessment from the pre-War Geological Survey of India work
and post-War work by the DGSE and forerunner organizations.
2.12      Due to insurgency problems, however, large tracts of the countuy
have not been geologically mapped or prospected in any detail, and geological
missions are assigned only "secure" areas for exploration. A systematic in-
ventory of mineral reserves which would certainly aid sector development
strategy thus has not been developed. The priorities for exploration are
tin/tungsten, lead/zinc, copper and nickel, a ranking consistent with the
exploitable potential of Burma's known mineralization. Known reserves alone
have an estimated potential export value of some US$1.5 billion at present
mineral prices.
F.   Planned Sector Investment and Needs
2.13      Given mining's potential for augmenting Burma's foreign exchange
earnings, the Government has given high priority to the sector and recent
policy has opened the way for external technical assistance and finance.
Significant contributions have come from the Federal Republic of Germany
(Heinda Tin Mine Expansion, exploration and geological work in tin and lead/
zinc, and appraisal of a project at the Bawdwin mine); Japan (appraisal of a
copper mining and concentrator project at Monywa); and the UNDP (a number of
projects in exploration, feasibility studies and training). A number of other
countries have also provided technical assistance, but apart from the Heinda
expansion, no significant new development has resulted so far.
2.14      The Government's near-term development strategy is to:  rehabili-
tate old tin tungsten mines and the Bawdwin lead/zinc/silver mine; exploit



-5-
the Monywa copper deposit; commence tin dredging at Heinze Basin (the project
here considered)  and carry out a number of smaller projects in antimony,
gemstones and tin/tungsten. These priorities are sound but realization is
likely to be slow due to shortcomings in project preparation and execution
abilities, the limited foreign exchange resources that can be attracted, and
the limited local funds available. The distorted exchange rate for the kyat
compounds the above difficulties. For example, following a recent appraisal,
a bilateral institution decided to scale down drastically its financing of a
limited modernization project at Bawdwin, partly for security reasons, but
also due to its poor financial return. In addition, both Monywa and Heinze
Basin are financially marginal projects even though reasonable shadow-pricing
of foreign exchange costs and benefits produces very attractive economic
returns. For significant redevelopment of the sector to take place some means
of augmenting the foreign exchange revenues of export-oriented projects and
institutions may have to be found.
2.15      Despite the above-mentioned difficulties, the sector has the poten-
tial t6 approach an export level of US$35 million (1976 prices) by FY 1981,
from US$19 million in FY1974, assuming the envisaged expansion and product
quality improvement in tin/tungsten, tighter security over gem production,
improved gem marketing procedures, and some expansion in antimony. By the
mid-80's, exports could approach US$100 million annually assuming two major
projects like Monywa or Bawdwin are executed, or one of these is done in
parallel with minor improvements in, for example, tin/tungsten, gem stones,
jade, or antimony. Growth of this latter magnitude is not conditional on
new mineral discoveries but would require sector investment of at least
US$200 million (1976 prices) over the next 5-10 years combined with tech-
nical assistance for project preparation, execution and early operation.
Potential would be substantially greater if illegal exports could be brought
into the official sector and more active foreign participation were allowed.
2.16      While the development impact of larger sized projects is greater,
execution could overtax Burma's limited financial, technical and managerial
resources and require a level of outside technical participation which would
be unacceptable to the Government. The Government intends to push for imple-
mentation of a number of projects, both large and small, but the limitations
outlined may force it to be very selective in those chosen for advancement.
Also, despite the expressed interest of certain bilateral financing sources,
the Government has been slow in pushing potential projects to the execution
stage.
2.17      The Bank's role in sectoral development could be threefold.  First
priority should be in financing specific projects such as the proposed tin/
tungsten expansion, thereby establishing a record of successful experience in
the sector. Second, the Bank can, through consultants, help to identify and
select development priorities from the longer term alternatives. Part
(US$200,000 equivalent) of the proposed credit will be used for this purpose
(para. 5.16). Third, the Bank could act as a catalyst for other sources of
finance to enable larger projects to be undertaken, quite possibly under
joint/parallel financing arrangements. The newly-formed Aid Group for Burma
is expected to serve as a useful coordinating mechanism in this respect.

III. THE MARKFT
3.01      The international markets -or tin and tungsten, including mineral
reserves, uses, and past and future trends in production, consumption and
prices are described in detail in AunL-xes 3-1 and 3-2 respectively.
A.   The International Tin Market
1.   International Demand and Supply
3.02      Demand:  Tin is a malleable and ductile white metal primarily
used in improving the properties of other materials.  About 95% of tin con-
sumed is in metallic form, with developed countries accounting for 75Z of
world consumption. Tinplate and solders are the most important outlets
for tin metals, accounting for about 47% and 23% of all tin consumed in
industrialized countries. Between 1955 and 1972-74, consumption of tin grew
at 1.7% per annum. This low rate of growth reflects, in part, the substi-
tution of tinplate in cans by tin-free steel and aluminum. Also, technical
innovations have reduced the amount of tin contained in tinplate. Of the
other important end-uses, solder expanded quite slowly in the post-war period,
while the use of tin in bronze and brass declined sharply.
3.03      Future demand will continue to depend to a large extent on tinplate
for containers. In developed countries, it is expected that the container
industry will continue to grow steadily, but technological substitution
will allow only a modest growth in tin use. In developing and centrally
planned economies, the substitution effect will be more moderate and tin
demand growth should be proportionately greater. Overall, world demand
is projected to increase at only 1.5% per annum between 1972-74 and 1985,
and will likely be below this trend rate until the late 1970's. There-
after, the effect of lower real prices (para 3.06) should stimulate demand
growth.
3.04      Supply:  Tin is mainly found in placer or alluvial deposits, derived
from the weathering and erosion of primary tin ores. Over 90% of global re-
serves are concentrated in developing countries, which account for about 75%
of world production. Malaysia has remained the dominant producer, with 37% of
world mine production of 173,000 tons in 1975 (excluding centrally planned
economies). Bolivia, Indonesia and Thailand are the other major producers,
with 17%, 14% and 10% of mine production respectively in 1975. South-East
Asian production is almost entirely from alluvial mines, employing dredging,
gravel pump mining and other hydraulic mining methods, but Bolivian produc-
tion is mostly from high-cost hard rock underground mines. In the past, tin
supply has been affected by sales from the U.S. Government stockpile, which
is presently equivalent to about one year's world consumption. In addition,
scrap represents a significant portion of supply, especially in the U.S.
where old scrap accounts for 15% of tin supply.
3.05      As Malaysian reserves are gradually being depleted, that country's
output is expected to decline as a proportion of world production, with
Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and Brazil increasing their share accord-
ingly. As for Burma, even with the planned increase in official output



-7-
over the next five years, it will still account for only 1% of world supply.
Moreover, the output associated with the project will amount to only 1/4 of
1% of world supply and 10% of the annual incremental world' consumption at
the time the project comes on stream.
3.06      Historically, tin production has followed (with a certain lag)
movements in real prices. Based on the relatively high prices of the past
three years, tin production is forecast to increase at an annual rate of
2.0% from the 1972-74 base through 1980. This, combined with slow demand
growth, could result in a supply surplus in the late 1970's and a consequent
decline in real prices at that time. Beyond 1980, demand growth is expected
to outstrip supply (which can be assumed to decline slightly in response to
the decline in real prices) with possible tin shortages developing by the
mid-1980's, as shown below.

/a   Including estimates for Centrally Planned Economies.
2.   International Tin Agreements
3.07      The Fifth International Tin Agreement came into force July 1,
1976, under the auspices of the International Tin Council, seated in London.
This event was particularly significant as the U.S. is included for the first
time, thereby increasing the proportion of world consumption represented by
consuming members to over 90%--it had only been 66% during the Fourth Agree-
ment (1971-76). Tin producing members produce 90% of world tin output.
For the time being, Burma has elected not to become a member of the ITC.
Since the country represents such a small proportion of world output, non-
membership has not had in the past and is not expected in future to have a
material impact on its ability to sell its production, even in periods of
over-supply. The Bank has informed ITC of its consideration of the project.
3.08      Through the ITC buffer stock, and with the cooperation of the
producing countries in the control of exports, the amplitude of potentially
violent price fluctuations in the world tin price is reduced. The present
buffer stock ceiling price is about US$3.93 per lb. and the floor price about
US$3.19 per lb. The Buffer Stock Manager must always sell tin when the market
price reaches the ceiling and always buy when it reaches the floor. These
activities probably had an effect in lessening the impact of the recent world
economic decline on international tin prices. For the future, it is expected



-8-
that ITC buffer stock and export control operations will continue to have a
moderating influence on tin price fluctuations, and, particularly in down
markets, in defending floor prices.
3.   Price Structure and Projections
3.09      Tin is traded in variously processed forms on the Penang or Straits
Market (Malaysia), the London Metal Exchange (LME), and the New York Commodity
Exchange (COMEX). Concentrate prices are based on the traded prices for
contained metal, less adjustments for smelting charges, shipping, impurities,
and assay costs.
3.10      The tin price has generally trended upwards in real terms over the
past 15 years, with extreme upward fluctuations occurring during the Malaysia-
Indonesia confrontation (1964-65) and the surge in energy prices and world
inflation (1973-74). The LME tin price averaged an all-time high in 1974
but, since then, prices have eased somewhat both in real and current terms.
For the future, prices are expected to increase moderately in real terms
from 1976 to 1978, as world demand recovers from the 1974-75 slump. On
account of the small excess supply expected for the late 1970's (para 3.06),
real tin prices could decline briefly. During 1980-85, prices should again
move upward in real terms, reflecting the lagged response of mine production
to the downward price movement in the late 1970's. Past and projected prices
are given below:
Historical and Projected Average Tin Prices

4.   Marketing Arrangements
3.11      Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand all have sufficient tin smelting
capacity to handle their own mine output of concentrates. Of the major pro-
ducers, only Bolivia is an exporter of concentrates, although it is presently
expanding its smelting capacity. In the past, tin mining countries have added
smelting capacity to treat their own concentrate output, with the result that
there is considerable excess tin smelting capacity in the world. This, com-
bined with reasons of economies of scale, makes it more economical for smaller
producers of concentrate, such as Burma, to export tin in concentrate form.
The most advantageous marketing method is generally to arrange smelter con-
tracts for a year's or more concentrate production, but the ability to do
this successfully depends partly on the reliability of supply and the level
and reliability of the concentrate grade and quality. The proposed project
would enable Burma to meet these requirements and thus market its tin concen-
trates to greater benefit than in the past.



-9
B.   The International TunRsten Market
1.   International Demand and Supply
3.12      Demand:  Tungsten is a heavy, hard, heat and corrosion resistant
metal, with the highest melting point and tensile strength of all metals.
It also has good electrical and thermal conductivity and a low thermal ex-
pansion coefficient. Tungsten's major uses are in carbide form (e.g. 45%
of U.S. consumption) for machine tool cutting edges, dies, rock bits, ball
point pen tips, gas turbine blades, and tire studs. In steel alloy form (25%
of U.S. consumption), it is used primarily in metal working (drilling and
cutting), grader blades, rock crusher jaws, and teeth for excavators. Other
applications include: tungsten alloys for incandescent lamp filaments and
electrical contact points, and tungsten chemicals for textile dyes, paints
and pigments, and glass manufacture.
3.13      Demand is closely linked to levels of activity in the steel and
machine tool industries. The U.S., Japan, and Western Europe account for
80% to 90% of tungsten consumption outside the centrally-planned economies.
Despite wide fluctuations (e.g. a 23% decline in 1975 consumption) with
changes in economic activity, world consumption has grown at about 4% per
annum from 1966 to 1974. Demand is expected to recover over the next
couple of years, with the 4% growth rate to resume, given the low substi-
tutability of the metal in its major applications, even at higher prices.
3.14      SupPly:  Tungsten mainly occurs in nature as wolframite or schee-
lite, and is commonly found in association with other metals such as tin,
molybdenum, copper, and bismuth. Most of it is mined in hard rock under-
ground mines, but some is also obtained by alluvial methods in conjunction
with tin mining, as is the case in Burma.
3.15      The centrally-planned economies account for about half of world
tungsten production of 38,000 tons and hold about 70% of known reserves.
The People's Republic of China accounts for about half of world reserves
and produces about 25% of world supply. Among the non-centrally planned
economies, the leading producers are the U.S., South Korea, Bolivia,
Thailand, Portugal, Canada and Australia.
3.16      Production in market-economy countries, together with imports
from China, has not been sufficient to meet demand in recent years. The
shortfall has largely been met by sales from the U.S. Government stockpile,
where disposals over the past ten years, though fluctuating widely, have
averaged 12% of annual world production with a peak of 53% in 1969. Under
these circumstances, fluctuations in supply from China can and have had a
major impact on price. Recently, price levels have stabilized at fairly high
levels, partly due to some attempts at increased cooperation between producers,
with China's support. Expansion of mine production should result. New or
expanded mines are being developed in the U.S., Australia and Turkey, and
there are possibilities in other countries, including Bolivia, Canada, and in
the longer term, in Burma. While data is incomplete, old scrap probably
accounts for 15% of annual tungsten supply.
3.17      Producers' Association:  In recent years, an ad hoc committee
on tungsten under the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development



- 10 -
(UNCTAD) has become more active, with some movement toward an international
agreement aimed at stabilizing prices. To this end, the Primary Tungsten
Association (PTA) was formed in 1975, involving producing companies from
Peru, Portugal, Australia, France and Bolivia. Significantly, China was a
participant in multilateral government meetings on tungsten held in Bolivia
in 1975 and is participating on the UNCTAD tungsten committee, which last met
in Geneva in November, 1976. The UNCTAD commitee members hold disparate views
on the approach to stabilization measures. Obstacles to some form of final
agreement revolve around the fact that tungsten is traded in several forms, as
well as the need to achieve consensus between market and centrally-planned
economies.
2.   Price Structure and Projections
3.18      International trade is often on the basis of prices quoted in the
London Metal Bulletin (LMB). The LMB publishes a tungsten ore-users index
which is a weighted average of the prices of all purchases made by a group
of European tungsten carbide manufacturers. The LMB quotations are given
for wolfram and scheelite (65% W03 and 70% W03 respectively). It also pub-
lishes price ranges based on surveys of representative sales usually through
metal trading companies. This is widely used as a basis for spot sales or
longer-term contracts. Production is commonly sold in pounds sterling per
metric ton unit (MTU) or U.S. dollars per short ton unit (STU) of 65% W03
content. The approximate value of a ton of ore or concentrate is obtained
by multiplying the price per ton unit by the percent W03 content (or grade).
A ton unit is one hundredth of a ton.
3.19      Prices historically have shown erratic movements with fluctua-
tions of 100% or more in a year not uncommon. Overall, however, the trend
in real prices has been upwards reaching a peak in 1970 (see below). With
high prices and poor economic conditions in the latter part of 1974, con-
sumers of tungsten reduced their inventory levels. In response, China cut
back exports sharply thereby maintaining prices. Even at present levels,
real prices are well below those reached in 1970 and equivalent to those
prevailing in 1967-69.
3.20      With recovery in world economic activity in 1976, tungsten demand
has been increasing during the year. As a result, prices can be expected to
maintain their level of the last two years, or increase slightly. Over the
longer term, the prospects of increased Chinese cooperation with other pro-
ducers look favorable, and would serve to attenuate the violent price fluc-
tuations of the past. This assumes that sales from U.S. Government stock-
piles will roughly reflect market requirements. The long term price trend
is thus projected to be slightly upward in real terms as illustrated below:

3.   Marketing Arrangements
3.21      The volume of trade in tungsten is small, and there is no univer-
sally acknowledged marketing system as there is for many other metals. Fur-
thermore, there is no real trade in tungsten metal itself but rather in
various forms such as concentrates or carbides. Concentrates are mainly
bought and sold through brokers or metal trading firms, and small suppliers
such as Burma generally market their concentrates on a negotiated basis for
each sale to metal trading companies. Even Chinese sales and purchases by
major consumers are done substantially through traders. However, provided
that reliable supply, quality and grade can be maintained, there is some
scope for longer-term contract sales of tungsten concentrate, as for tin.
IV. THE CORPORATION
A.   Operations
1.   Mining Facilities and Output
4.01      No. 2 Mining Corporation (MC2) conducts mining operations in two
separate parts of the country -- the Tenasserim Division in extreme south-
eastern Burma (major mines: Heinda, Hermyingyi, and Kanbauk), and the Mawchi
area northeast of Rangoon (Mawchi Mine). Overall, MC2 operates 7 mines with
a number of scattered smaller sites being worked exclusively by tribute
miners. Primitive concentrating facilities exist at 6 mines and additional
upgrading plants are located at Rangoon and Tavoy (Annex 4-1). Over 75% of
the concentrates produced by MC2 are purchased from tributers. These concen-
trates generally contain a minimum 65% tin-ore/wolfram and are further upgraded
by MC2 before sale.
4.02      Production is well below what it was many years ago and has been
declining further in recent years. The causes have been the same as for the
rest of the mineral sector (para 2.03), i.e. war damage, ousting of private
operations, deterioration of plant and infrastructure, shortage of spares and
capital, and increased leakage of tributor output through smuggling. The
table below illustrates the trend in recent years:

- 12 -
4.03      Mining methods vary from location to location and comprise gravel
pumping, underground, and ground sluicing operations. Most of the mines are
in alluvial-type deposits, the main exceptions being the hard rock under-
ground operations at Mawchi and Hermyingyi, which are the principal sources
of the tungsten ores. Concentrating facilities are generally primitive
and in poor running order, both at the mine sites and at two small upgrading
plants in Tavoy and Rangoon. As a result, most of MC2's concentrates are
low grade, and contain high levels of impurities, thus reducing their sales
value. Mixed tin/tungsten ores, such as those from Mawchi, are not separated
and recoveries are poor. Outmoded facilities also contribute to MC2's high
product inventories. Products often flow from mines to concentrators in
Tavoy and back to utilize available wet and dry upgrading facilities and thus
bring the products to a more marketable state.
4.04      Mines in the Tenasserim Division are connected to Tavoy by road.
In the wet season, sections become impassable for days due to flooding,
and even during favorable weather, delays arise due to the necessity of
organizing military escorts for security reasons. Concentrates are shipped
from Tavoy to Rangoon by boat and then exported. Mawchi and Rangoon, on the
other hand, are connected by both rail and road but because of the security
situation, the most direct route cannot be taken.
4.05      Infrastructural facilities, such as power and water supply at the
mines, are generally poor and unreliable. Water shortages in the dry season
and frequent power shut-downs hamper production, with generating and pumping
facilities both suffering from shortages of spare parts and maintenance mate-
rials.
2.   Production Costs
4.06      Production costs for tin and tungsten concentrate vary by mine, but
are generally somewhat below levels in other countries, reflecting the highly
labor intensive low-wage aspects of Burmese mining, with depreciation and
financial charges well below those of more modern or mechanized operations
elsewhere. Moderately more capital intensive production methods are warran-
ted, even if total costs per ton mined are increased, in order to ensure that
output can be more closely controlled, and to prevent deposits from being
inefficiently and harmfully exploited by the haphazard high-grading operations
of the tribute miners.

/a   Six months, due to change of year-end from September 30 to March 31.
4.08      Despite production declines and unfavorable operating conditions,
MC2 has shown a reasonable level of profits over the period under review.
Revenues per ton of concentrate have increased 138% since FY72 with the
Corporation benefitting from substantial increases in international tin
and tungsten prices and 1975's 30% devaluation of the kyat. Also, the
charging of up to 15% in bank commissions on sales were discontinued in
FY75, contributing to a further gain in net revenues.
4.09      Operating costs per ton have risen 96% since 1972, with most of
this rise occurring in FY75. A large part of the 1975 increase was due to
a 70% increase in the average price paid to tributors for ore purchased by
MC2 (60% of MC2's mining costs). The increase in the tribute price was
intended to act as an incentive to stimulate sales to the Corporation.
However, since the new price was still well below that prevailing in the
black market, the actual impact on ore receipts from tributors was marginal.
Among other costs, freight, fuel and materials have increased, particularly
in the last two years. Wages, on the other hand, have remained virtually
unchanged in Burma since 1948. As a result, labor costs account for only
20% of MC2's own mining costs and 8% of total production costs including
purchased ores.

4.11      MC2's financial position is characterized by a strong working
capital ratio and a low level of debt relative to equity. On the negative
side, at March 31, 1976 inventories amounted to almost one year's production
and receivables to about four months sales. Excessive inventories and receiv-
ables arise partly due to marketing practices (para. 4.15) but also because
of poor quality concentrates which often have to be set aside awaiting up-
grading or mixing with higher grade ores before sale. The situation should
improve somewhat with control of MC2's marketing now passed from MEIC to
the newly-formed Marketing Committee. The Government has agreed that MC2 will
prepare a satisfactory plan, to be submitted to IDA by August 31, 1977, for
reducing its inventories and receivables to an appropriate level. The project,
which will provide MC2 with better quality concentrates and allow the Corpora-
tion to enter into smelter contracts, will result in further reductions in
inventories and receivables.
4.12      About 40% of MC2's equity base is represented by intangible assets.
These include: deferred expenditures (costs of keeping the Mawchi mine open
during the period of insurgency activities), and goodwill (which arose when
MC2 acquired liabilities in excess of assets from the MDC in 1972). It is
questionable whether these amounts should be carried forward in the Balance
Sheet, and the Government has agreed that MC2 will take the necessary measures
by March 31, 1978 to correct this situation to reflect sound accounting
practices. Writing off the intangible assets would increase MC2's present
debt/equity ratio from 16:84 to 24:76.



- 15 -
C.   Organization and Management
4.13       Like other state organizations in Burma, all policy decisions
and many managerial functions have been outside MC2's immediate control.
Decisions on production plans, marketing, investment, employment, wages,
and financing are decided mainly at the level of the Minister or the Economic
Committee of the Council of Ministers. The Managing Director of MC2 is
appointed by the Government to carry out plans set by the Ministry of Mines
and to supervise the day-to-day operations of the Corporation. Reporting
to him are four Directors (Administration, Production, Planning and Projecting,
and Engineering) and a Chief Accounts Officer (Annex 4-3). It is the Gov-
ernment's intention to transfer more managerial and financial autonomy to
the various state economic enterprises through newly-formed Management
Committees. This, however, will be a gradual, cautious process. In MC2's
case, the Committee includes: the Managing Director, the Director of Produc-
tion, the Chief Accounts Officer and two members representing the work-
ers, one of whom is the Director of Administration. All are competent people,
with good technical qualifications and many years experience in the industry,
but with little management experience other than in a highly centralized
decision-making environment.
4.14       MC2 employs about 2,700 persons, including 73 officers.  Wage
levels are low, being equivalent to US$15 per month for laborers, US$70-150
per month for engineers and geologists, and US$200 per month for top manage-
ment. In some cases, inadequate wages have resulted in high rates of turnover
and absenteeism at MC2's mine sites, especially where other opportunities such
as tribute mining or illegal trade exist. A recently-established bonus
system and a cost-of-living allowance may help to relieve growing dissatis-
faction in the face of rising prices. Overstaffing exists at some locations,
largely due to output declines not being fully reflected in a reduction or
relocation of manpower, e.g. at Mawchi mine. The Government has agreed that
MC2 will prepare a manpower plan, with the assistance of the project consul-
tants, which will include steps to establish employee levels consistent with
changes in output and profitability at its various operating locations. Also
included in the plan, to be submitted to IDA by December 31, 1977, will
be a system of bonuses, incentive schemes and special allowances to augment
wages where appropriate.
4.15       As noted above, MC2's activities are presently limited to produc-
tion; exploration, geological work, and, until recently, marketing, being
carried out by other agencies within the Ministry of Mines. MC2 has now
gained closer control over marketing operations with this function transferred
from the MEIC to the Minerals Marketing Committee in late 1976. The Committee
is jointly administered by representatives from the three metal producing
corporations. Also, with respect to tin/tungsten, MEIC's Sales Manager for
these metals (a highly competent individual) has assumed a key role in the
management of the Committee. Principal advantages of the new arrangements
are: elimination of the excessive 2-1/2% MEIC sales commission; and scope to
reduce MC2's high inventories and receivables, which have been partly caused
by inefficient MEIC practices and the problems of inter-Ministry communi-
cations. The marketing policies of the Committee have yet to be finalized,
but the Government has agreed that the Committee will be granted authority to
take appropriate measures to improve marketing efficiency, including entering



- 16 -
into long-term smelter contracts where appropriate. This should be facilitated
by the proposed project, with production expanded and quality and quantity of
supply more reliable.
D.   Accounts and Audit
4.16      MC2's accounting records are well maintained and contain reason-
able detail on the Corporation's costs, revenues, production, inventories,
and other financial and operational data.  Apart from the annual accounts
and monthly statements of production, cash receipts and expenditures, how-
ever, management does not receive adequate information for effective opera-
tional or financial control.  The terms of reference for the consultants
retained for the project (para. 5.14) will include assistance in improving
the Corporation's management information systems and its financial planning
capabilities.
4.17      The State Audit Office is the only official audit service available
in Burma, and has been used satisfactorily in other IDA projects in the
country.  In MC2's case (like that of many other state corporations in Burma),
audits have been several years behind, but at the request of IDA, MC2 has
submitted audited financial statements for FY76. The Government has agreed
that MC2 will submit audited accounts to IDA within five months of the close
of each fiscal year, and quarterly financial statements within 60 days.
E.   Ore Reserves
4.18      Sufficient ore reserves exist in the present areas of operation
to produce at least 67,000 tons of tin concentrates and 30,000 tons of tungsten
concentrates. Of these 97,000 tons, only about 22,000 have been proved --
sufficient for 15 years' production at present mining rates. These totals are
understated, however, as they do not reflect recent real price increases,
particularly for tungsten. For those mining sites scheduled for development
as part of the proposed project (Heinze Basin, Kanbauk and various gravel pump
reserves), there are sufficient proved reserves for at least 15 years operation
at the expanded rates of production. Proven reserves at the Heinda mine,
where increased output will commence during 1977 following completion of
the KfW-financed project, are only sufficient for 11 years. Conversion of
probable and possible reserves to proved status, for these and other tin!
tungsten deposits in Burma, is expected to be easily accomplished with modest
amounts of further exploration and expenditures.
V. THE PROJECT
5.01      The project consists of the following components:  (a) dredging
and related concentrating and infrastructural facilities (including a township
with housing and community facilities) at Heinze Basin (300 km S.E. of Rangoon)
to produce about 650 LTPY of tin concentrate by FY81 (Map IBRD 12524), and
improvements to gravel pump operations at Kanbauk close to the Heinze Basin,
increasing tin concentrate production by about 100 LTPY by FY81; (b) a new
tin/tungsten concentrating and upgrading plant at Tavoy, 80 km south of Heinze



- 17 -
Bas., to separate mixed concentrates and improve the grade and quality of tin
and tungsten concentrates produced by the Corporation; (c) equipment for new
gravel pump mining operations near Tavoy to produce about 150 LTPY of tin
concentrates by FY81; and (d) technical assistance for training of key tech-
nicians, engineering,project management, procurement, start-up, and the
initial operation of the project, plus assistance in improving the Corporation's
operating and financial controls, preparing a manpower plan (para. 4.14) and
preparing a study of exporting concentrates directly from Tavoy. In particular,
the provision of consultants experienced in dredging and concentration of
tin/ tungsten ores is to compensate for MC2's unfamiliarity in these areas.
A more detailed description of the tin/tungsten project is given in Annex
5-1. In addition, US$200,000 equivalent of the proposd credit will be used for
a study of the future development of the mineral sector (para. 5.16).
A.   Technical Description
1.   Heinze Basin Dredging Project and Concentrator
5.02      The dredging would take place in a 25 km long southern section
of the Heinze Basin, access to which is by sea or by surfaced road from
Tavoy or Ye (both within 60 km of the project area). Sea access is limited
during the monsoon season, and road access is also somewhat limited due to
5-ton load limits on bridges and 13 km of unsurfaced road between the Basin
and Tavoy. The project can be planned around these restrictions and the
Government has agreed that the unsurfaced road will be improved to an all-
weather condition no later than December 31, 1979, i.e., before project
start-up.
5.03      A portion of the Basin was dredged prior to World War II and inter-
mittent dredging was carried out west of the Basin up to 1952. A UNDP-fi-
nanced program (1972-75) undertook extensive borings in the Basin and a
feasibility study was completed by the Malaysian consulting firm, Osborne
and Chappel, in mid-1975. Recoverable concentrate is conservatively esti-
mated at 6,640 tons, sufficient for 19 years at the proposed rate of mining.
In the initial years, production will average 550 tons of concentrate per
annum, and after the tenth year will decline to about 250 tons per annum,
as lower grade ores are worked.
5.04      Careful study was done by the consultants to determine the optimum
dredge size based on both operational and economic factors. The dredge se-
lected will be a conventional bucket ladder dredge with a jig treatment
plant on board. The dredge would be capable of digging to a depth of 16
m. during the first 8 years of operation. Its pontoon and ladder would
then be extended to increase digging depth to 27 m. The dredging sequence
has been selected to maximize the present value of the cash flow. Annual
production is estimated at 1.4 million cu. m. of ore in the early years
(reflecting operator inexperience and dredging conditions), increasing to
2.0 million cu. m. after the tenth year. These production estimates are
51% and 74% of theoretical dredge capacity, respectively.
5.05      The dredge's jig plant would produce a concentrate grading 20-40%
tin which would then be transported by barge to the nearby shore-based mill.
After upgrading there, concentrate grading 65% tin would be transported by
road or sea to Tavoy for further processing.



- 18 -
5.06      The flowsheet for the Heinze Basin mill would include screening,
magnetic scalping, classifying, and Wilfey table treatment. The concen-
trate would pass through a fresh water wash and, after drying, be treated on
high-intensity magnetic separators to separate refractory minerals. The
mill flowsheet has been thoroughly tested by the consultants. The ore type
is quite common in south-east Asia, the flowsheet is conventional, and the
equipment proposed is standard and widely used in alluvial tin concentrators.
5.07      Due to the remote location of the Heinze Basin and the lack of
existing infrastructure, the project will require extensive support facili-
ties including: water craft (tugboat, work boat, personnel boats, barges);
power (diesel generators for the dredge and shore complex); wells for water
supply; and workshops, offices, and a warehouse. Social infrastructure would
include: a 237-home townsite, school, community hall/cinema, hospital, mar-
ket, playfield, and electrical, water, and sanitary facilities.
5.08      Production of tin concentrates at the nearby Kanbauk gravel pump
mines is expected to increase by about 100 LTPY (from the current 200 LTPY)
as a result of better maintenance and operational supervision associated with
the Heinze dredging and concentrating complex and improved power and water
supply. Only a very small amount of additional direct investment at Kanbauk
would be involved. Concentrates from Kanbauk would be further upgraded at the
Heinze Basin mill and the Tavoy concentrator.  Recoverable ore reserves at
Kanbauk are estimated at 3,400 tons, sufficient for 10 years operation at the
projected rate of output.
2.   Central Concentrator at Tavoy
5.09      As a result of antiquated and inefficient concentrating facilities
(Annex 4-1), much of MC2's output is of a low and unreliable grade (averaging
about 69% for tin concentrates and 64% for tungsten), high in impurities and
sells at a substantial discount below standard prices. Based on a proposal
by the Corporation, IDA commissioned a study of various alternative new con-
centrating facilities to determine the best location and a preliminary flow
sheet for the selected alternative. This was carried out by Osborne and
Chappel of Malaysia and their final report was produced in July 1976.
5.10      The selection of a large centralized concentrator located in Tavoy
is based on its favorable economic return, and the ability of a Tavoy loca-
tion to provide the focus for improved operational control of the Corpora-
tion's mines in the Tenasserim Division. As the concentrator would treat
a variety of ores, including mixed concentrates from Mawchi, the flowsheet
involves a number of circuits including: crushing, screening, electrostatic
precipitation, wet gravity separation on tables, cleaning in Willoughby boxes,
drying and high intensity magnetic separation. In addition to producing high
quality wolfram and tin concentrates, the concentrator would produce a number
of byproducts, but incremental revenues from these will be small. Testing
done by the consultants was sufficient to determine the basic flowsheet but
further metallurgical testing will be required to finalize concentrator
design. A preliminary study has been conducted by the Corporation to identify
specific possible sites for the concentrator. The final site will be chosen
with the assistance of the project consultants and the site acquired as a
condition of credit effectiveness.



- 19 -
5.11      Overall, the concentrator will produce 3,000 - 4,000 LTPY of concen-
trates (grading 75% for tin concentrates and 67% for tungsten) on a single-
shift basis, with ample flexibility for increasing its capacity and modifying
its flowsheet as other mines are developed in the area. Infrastructural
facilities for the concentrator include: water supply from nearby wells or
the Tavoy river, electric power (two 345 kw diesel generators), and transport
(five six-ton trucks - concentrates from various mines in the area are presently
delivered to Tavoy by local buses).
5.12      The Government has agreed that the terms of reference of the project
consultants will include assistance to MC2 in the improvement of the export of
concentrates. This will include study of the feasibility and desirability of
direct export of the Corporation's products from Tavoy to smelters in Malaysia
or Thailand, without the inefficient and time-consuming process of shipment to
Rangoon as presently practised. The expanded output of concentrates in the
area should provide sufficient incentive for vessels to stop at Tavoy, and,
since concentrates would be trans-shipped from lighter vessels, minimal
infrastructure would be required.
3.   Gravel Pump Mining Project
5.13      Although knowledge of reserves is patchy, there are a number of
tin and tungsten-rich deposits in the Tenasserim Division which are ideal
for gravel pump operations. This process consists of monitors (water jets)
to wash down sand and gravel to a sump. From the sump, the slurry of liqui-
fied material is pumped to a palong (sluice box) for treatment. Equipment
would be acquired to establish gravel pump operations at one or two loca-
tions. Since major production preparation, such as extensive stripping, would
not be necessary, this component of the project could be implemented relatively
quickly. Equipment needed (drills, hydraulic monitors, pumps, diesel generator,
and jig plants) is highly mobile and expensive infrastructural facilities are
not required. In addition to yielding about 150 LTPY of tin concentrates, the
project, under consultant supervision, will provide valuable training.
4.   Technical Assistance
5.14      MC2's inexperience in the operation of other than simple mining
and concentrating activities necessitates fairly extensive outside technical
assistance by consultants experienced in the design and operation of dredg-
ing, mining, and concentrating facilities. The Government has agreed that the
Corporation will retain consultants, to be financed from the proposed credit,
and on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, to assist with project engineer-
ing, project management, overseas training of key technicians, procurement,
and to supervise and assist during the start-up of the facilities and during
at least the first two years of their operation (with IDA to be consulted
before the termination or reduction of this operational assistance). The
consultants will also assist in the development of physical, cost, and finan-
cial control systems to improve MC2's overall operational effectiveness,
assist with export improvements (para. 5.12), and help prepare a manpower plan
(para. 4.14). Draft terms of reference (Annex 6-2) have been discussed with
the Corporation. Osborne and Chappel, the Malaysian consulting firm which did
the project feasibility studies, has been selected for this assistance. The
employment of the consultants is a condition of credit effectiveness. The



- 20 -
estimated cost for engineering services and other consulting assistance is
US$1.9 million, of which about US$0.5 million would be technical assistance,
spread over a five-year period. The average cost per man-year is estimated to
be US$84,000 including all travel, overhead, and associated expenses.
5.   Other Expansion Plans
5.15      Significant future expansion of production is envisaged by MC2
and three major mine rehabilitation programs, in addition to the project, are
in the pipeline. The Heinda mine is being expanded with the help of KfW
financing through a new open-pit system and a new concentrating mill which
should increase annual production by 800 LTPY of tin concentrates, with
production scheduled to start during 1977. At Hermyingyi, exploration
work assisted by German technical aid is being carried out with a view to
proving adequate reserves on which to base a project. This could add another
500 LTPY of tin/tungsten concentrates by the early to mid-eighties. At
Mawchi, a USSR-financed rehabiltation program to increase output by 1,000 LTPY
of tin was suspended in 1973. This could be resumed if insurgency problems
were brought under control and new financing found. The timing of this is
uncertain, but there have been recent indications that the security situation
may be inproving. In order to ensure sufficient managerial attention is given
to the proposed IDA project, the Government has agreed that the Corporation
will not embark on any major new investments (over US$1 million equivalent per
year) without prior IDA approval.
6.   Sector Study
5.16      The Government has agreed that it will employ consultants acceptable
to the Association with satisfactory terms of reference, to assist in carrying
out a study of the future development of the mineral sector. This would help
the Government to establish sector priorities and to identify suitable develop-
ment projects. The scope of the study should be agreed by June 30, 1977. The
Government has agreed to employ the consultants by December 31, 1977, and to
commence the study within three months. The study's recommendations will
be reviewed with IDA and implementation steps agreed. Part of the credit
(US$200,000 equivalent) will be used to finance the work, with the Ministry of
Mines as executing agency.
B.   Environmental Aspects
5.17      As the project operations involve physical, rather than chemical
processes, no harmful pollutants will result. Dredge tailings will be deposi-
ted back into the Basin, but in the same form as the naturally occurring
materials. Concentrator tailings will be disposed of on land and shou'ld not
raise any environmental problems. Dredging operations will create some minor
disruption of fishing activities in the Basin, but these are not economically
significant to the local population. Moreover, the area affected at any one
time will be confined to a small part of the Basin.
C.   Capital Costs
5.18      Project cost, excluding interest during construction and incremental
working capital, is estimated at US$26.0 million equivalent, of which US$18.9



- 21 -
million would be for the dredging, concentrating and related facilities at
Heinze Basin (including Kanbauk); US$3.7 million for the central concentrator
at Tavoy, US$2.7 million for the gravel pump mining pilot project, US$0.5
million for technical assistance additional to the engineering and project
management included in other project components, and US$0.2 million for the
sector study. Total financing requirements are estimated at US$27.8 million;
these costs are detailed in Annex 5-2 and summarized below:

5.19      All base costs reflect March 31, 1976 prices.  Estimates have been pre-
pared in great detail by the consultants, based on their extensive experience
in Malaysia, and supplemented by budget quotations from suppliers. Estimates
for civil construction and infrastructure are based on quotations from the
Construction Corporation of the Burmese Ministry of Works, and were found
by the consultants to be reasonably in line with their Malaysian experience.
Duties and taxes amount to 23% of capital costs. In addition to normal



- 22 -
import duties averaging 15%, they include a newly-instituted 30% commodity
tax on the C.I.F. value of imported machinery and equipment. Physical contin-
gencies reflect varying firmness in design and engineering, and range from
5% to 20% of the base estimate categories, and average about 10%. Price
escalation was applied to project cost components as follows: local and
foreign equipment costs - 9% in 1976, 8% in 1977-79, 7% thereafter; local
civil works 20% per annum (reflecting recent cost trends in major locally-
supplied construction materials such as cement and timber of at least 20%
annually, which trends are expected to continue into the project construction
period); engineering, training and administration costs - 7% per annum for
both local and foreign costs. Overall, the capital cost estimates, and
provisions for physical and price contingencies, are felt to be realistic.
The consultants have re-checked major project items in late 1976, including
consultation with a leading tin dredge design firm, and have found both the
base estimates and the 1976 escalation allowance to be adequate.
D.   Financing Plan
5.20      The proposed financing of the estimated requirements of US$27.8
million equivalent for the project is shown below (Annex 5-3):
Financing Plan
US$ Millions Equivalent
Foreign Exchange Sources:
IDA Credit                              16.0
Local Currency Sources:
Cash Generation                          5.8
Debt and Share Capital                   6.0
Total Financing                27.8
The IDA credit will be made to the Government of Burma to cover all estimated
direct foreign exchange expenditures, with US$15.8 million equivalent to be
onlent to the Corporation over 15 years, including 5 years grace, at 10% per
annum, and other conditions satisfactory to IDA. The foreign exchange risk of
the credit will be borne by the Corporation. The execution of the subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government and MC2 is a condition of credit effec-
tiveness.
5.21      Local costs include construction and civil works and duties.
The Government has agreed to allow the Corporation to retain its entire cash
generation to finance a portion of the local costs of the project (US$5.8
million) and, at the same time, maintain an adequate liquidity for its existing
operations. The Government has also agreed to the timely provision of funds, on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, to meet the estimated US$6.0 million
local currency requirements, and also to meet any shortfall in the Corporation's
cash generation and any project cost overruns. Sufficient funds will be in
the form of equity so as to prevent MC2's long term debt to equity ratio from
exceeding 60:40, and its projected long-term debt service coverage from being
less than two times.

VI.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Organization and Management
6.01      Project management will be based on:  (a) recent MC2 experience
in executing the Heinda mine expansion and (b) engineering and project man-
agement support from outside consultants (para 5.14). In some respects, the
project should face fewer problems than the Heinda expansion, where lack of
reliable water transport and the logistics of moving heavy equipment to the
site presented numerous problems and delays. The project will include its
own water transport facilities, and the only heavy equipment item (the dredge)
will be constructed outside the country and floated to the Heinze Basin site.
6.02      The project organization (Annex 6-1) will be headed by a Project
Manager (the Director of Planning of MC2, who was responsible for the Heinda
project). He will be responsible to MC2's Management Committee. The consul-
tants' terms of reference (Annex 6-2) will include assistance in detailed
planning and scheduling, procurement, supervision of construction and start-up
of the facilities and their operation for a minimum of two years after project
completion. In addition to the managerial and technical assistance resulting
from the consultants' involvement, some 34 personnel will receive a total of
about 65 man-years of overseas training, probably in Malaysia, under super-
vision of the consultants, in the operation of facilities virtually the same
as those of the project.  The costs of this are included in the project (Annex
5-2).
B.   Project Schedule
6.03      The consultants are expected to start work by the end of the first
quarter of 1977, so that the first specifications and tender documents can be
issued during the second quarter, and first orders placed following inter-
national competitive bidding within the last quarter (Annex 6-3). Certain
items procured by international shopping (para. 6.04) may be ordered even
earlier. The dredge is scheduled for delivery in the last quarter of 1-979, by
which time the on-shore project facilities should also be complete, with
production commencing from all project components by the end of 1979.
C.   Procurement
6.04      The packages of equipment and supplies for the project will be
prepared and specified by the consultants and be subjected to international
competitive bidding with the exception of some small items of highly special-
ized equipment for which there are very few eligible suppliers; for these
international shopping procedures will be used. These small items would each
be under US$75,000 equivalent in value and total about US$1 million. The only
goods expected to be procured locally will be certain construction supplies,
e.g., cement, timber. Under Burmese regulations, all local construction will
be done by the Government Construction Corporation. This work is relatively
small-scale and will be under the general supervision of the project con-
sultants.



- 24 -
6.05      Contract awards may have to be approved on an interministerial
basis. The Government has agreed to take any steps necessary to ensure prompt
review of and decisions on all project procurement matters.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of IDA Credit
6.06      The allocation of the proceeds of the credit is shown in Annex 6-4.
Disbursements would be made against 100% of foreign expenditures for (i)
directly imported materials, equipment and machinery, and (ii) consultants'
services, technical assistance and training. There would be no local currency
financing from the credit. The disbursement schedule (Annex 6-5) is based on
estimates of order placements, payment schedules, and expected construction
and equipment delivery times in line with the construction schedule (Annex
6-3). The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by the end of 1981. Any
uncommitted funds remaining would be used to finance other project components,
if found justified, or otherwise would be cancelled.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      Assumptions used in the financial analysis, forecast income state-
ments, balance sheets, statements of sources and application of funds, to-
gether with supporting data, are contained in Annexes 7-1 through 7-14.
A.   Project Operating Costs and Revenues
7.02      Operating costs for the project (Annex 7-1) are based on the con-
sultants' knowledge of Malaysian conditions, with adjustment to allow for
the limited operating experience in Burma. Production costs for dredging
and concentrating, including depreciation and interest charges, will be
about US$1.80 per lb. of concentrate (1976 prices) for the first eight
years of operation. This is in the lower range of dredging costs in other
countries and lower than typical costs for gravel pump and underground tin
mining. As the grade of ore mined declines in the later years (para. 5.03),
costs per ton of concentrate will rise such that, even with the loan repaid
and no financial charges, they will be on the high side for dredging, and
comparable with typical present-day gravel pump mining costs.
7.03      Project revenues arise both from incremental production and the
achievement of a higher grade on existing production, thereby reducing dis-
counts and penalty charges (Annex 7-6).
B.   Financial Rate of Return
7.04      The after-tax financial rate of return for the project is 10.0% and
13.7% if the commodity tax or production value is excluded (Annex 7-3). These
relatively low returns are due to: high import taxes and duties which raise
capital and operating costs for the project, and the distorted exchange rate
for the kyat. It is questionable how meaningful the financial return is in a



- 25 -
centrally planned economv like Burma's.  A more useful indicator is given
by the economic rate of return, which is markedly higher (para. 8.01).
7.05      The sersizivity of the project's return to changes in revenues
is aggravated by the commodity tax on production which represents a fixed
burslen on MC2, independent of revenues or profit levels. Commodity taxes are
levied on both production value and on imported goods and equipment. A
summary of sensitivity tests performed is given below:
MC2: Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Capital   Operating                After-Tax
Case         Costs       Costs      Revenues    Return       Pre-Tax Return
i.  Base Case      100         100         100        10.0%           13.7%

3.                 100         120         100         6.9%           10.2%
4.                 100         100          80          1.3%           6.2%
5.                 120        120         100          3.0%           7.6%
S.                 100         120         120         13.4%          17.5%
7.  One year project delay                             8.5%           11.5%
C.   Break-Even Point
7.06      It is estimated that profit break-even for MC2 following project
start-up will occur at a sales level of 2,470 LTPY, and cash break-even
at 2,140 LTPY. These figures represent about 78% and 68% respectively of
MC2's projected normal annual output (about 3,200 tons). The relatively high
breakeven points are the result of the commodity tax which is tied to costs
(most of which are fixed) rather than to profits. This could put a substan-
tial burden on the Corporation in the event of declining metal prices.
For example, in FY82, a revenue decline of 14% would produce a loss, and
a decline of 21% would reduce cash generation, after debt service, to zero.
These negative effects will be cushioned by the planned introduction of an
"Export Equalization Scheme," whereby losses incurred by corporations in the
export sector will be made up by cash contributions from the Government. On
the other hand, after-tax profits above an allowed "target" level due to
upward fluctuation of metal prices above pre-determined ceilings will be
transferred to the Government. The effect of such transfers has not been
incorporated into the financial projections which are detailed in the follow-
ing sections, as they will depend on the ceiling prices established, which in
turn will be based on budgetted operating costs plus an allowable profit
margin. If the Corporation can improve on its profit margin by reducing costs
below budget, it can retain these savings

7.08      After project start-up in FY80-81, sales volume is projected to in-
crease 140% from FY76 levels. In addition to some gains in output at exist-
ing mines, the bulk of the increase in sales volume arises from the project
(900 LTPY) and expansion of the Heinda mine (800 LTPY). Also in FY81, with
the start-up of the Tavoy concentrator, the sale of MC2's output through
smelter contracts will allow a reduction in inventory levels (para 4.11),
giving sales a one-time boost. Production and sales volumes decline some-
what in later years as the Heinze Basin dredge encounters lower grade ores
and the effect of the one-time inventory reduction is absorbed.
7.09      Revenues increase at an even faster rate than sales volume (up
360% in current terms from FY76 to FY81). This reflects higher tin and
tungsten prices forecast over the period, together with the realization of
better prices for MC2's output once the Tavoy concentrator comes on stream.
7.10      Costs per ton jump considerably in FY77 reflecting wage increases,
implementation of bonus and social security schemes, and the institution
of the commodity tax on imported materials (averaging 30%). Beyond 1977,
costs per ton remain relatively steady as output gains offset total cost
increases and as lower cost facilities (Heinda and Heinze Basin) begin produc-
tion.
7.11      Pre-tax profits increase strongly over the forecast period - up
465% by FY81. Net profits follow a somewhat different trend. Declines
from FY76 levels occur in FY77 and 78 as a result of replacement of the
income tax by the commodity tax on production and overhead costs (15% on costs
plus a 12% nominal profit - equivalent to 16.8% on costs). Once sales volumes
and margins pick up in FY79 and beyond, the burden of the commodity tax
becomes progressively less and net profits show a sharp recovery.

7.13      MC2's financial position remains sound over the project implementa-
tion period and beyond. Large cash surpluses build up once the project
comes on stream. Part of these may be appropriated by the State under the
Export Equalization Scheme (para. 7.06) but the Corporation should be able to
prepare further expansion projects (para. 5.15) to absorb these funds. The
long-term debt-equity ratio reaches a maximum of 48:52 in FY80 and declines to
19:81 by FY86, assuming that the deferred expenses and goodwill are written
off in FY79 (para 4.12). Debt service coverage throughout the forecast period
remains favorable, and at no time falls below 3.7 times.
7.14      In addition to covenants related to project financing and operations
during the implementation period (para 5.21), the Government has agreed to the
following to ensure the maintenance of a sound financial position for the
Corporation after project implementation: (a) the Government will provide
funds to ensure the maintenance of a current ratio of not less than 2.0; (b)
additional funds (whether in local currency or foreign exchange) will be
provided to the Corporation where needed to meet normal maintenance and
subsequent capital expenditures associated with the project; (c) the Corpora-
tion will not incur new debt if to do so would cause its debt/equity ratio to
exceed 60:40 or its projected debt service coverage to fall below two times.



- 28 -
F.   Major Risks
7.15      Major risks associated with the project are threefold.  First,
management is inexperienced in dredging and in more modern concentrating
operations and present managerial and financial control over the Corporation's
activities needs improvement. This problem should be alleviated by the
proposed overseas training of key technicians and the provision of extensive
technical assistance and supervision by consultants during project implemen-
tation and for two years following startup. The consultants will also assist
in implementing a more effective management control system for the Corporation.
In addition, the current expansion of the Heinda mine has added to MC2's
expertise in the supervision of expansion projects.
7.16      Second, there have been some insurgency activities in the project
area in the past, and recurrence of these could adversely affect project
implementation. On the other hand, no security problems arose with the KFW-
financed project at nearby Heinda, and the general area appears to be under
reasonable control.
7.17      A third risk relates to the possibility of prices for tin and tungs-
ten being lower than projected. Offsetting this, the influence of the Inter-
national Tin Council in moderating downward price pressures through its buffer
stock operations, and the prospect of increased cooperation among tungsten
producers should act to lessen the downside risk of future price fluctuations.
Also, if the Government's new Export Equalization Scheme can work effectively,
the financial risk to the Corporation due to metal price fluctuations will be
minimized. Most importantly, the Corporation is expected to remain a low
cost producer of tin/tungsten while the project will help to improve product
quality and therefore its saleability.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Economic Rate of Return
8.01      The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 21.0%
at the official rate of exchange for the kyat (Annex 8-1). The difference
between the economic and financial rates of return is due to import duties and
commodity taxes, which affect both capital and operating costs significantly.
Using a shadow-priced rate of US$1 = K 13, versus the 6.65 official rate, the
economic rate of return becomes 28.5%. The official exchange rate is main-
tained by very stringent exchange and trade restrictions. Black market rates
are at least 18 to 20 Kyats per US dollar, but the 13.0 shadow rate was
calculated as the rate that would prevail with free trade, reflecting the
opportunity cost of a marginal unit of foreign exchange. Sensitivity tests
show that the project's contribution to the economy will remain favorable even
under adverse conditions. For example, with a 20% drop in revenues, the
project's economic rate of return remains above 20% on a fully shadow-priced
basis.

B.   Foreign Exchange and Other Benefits
8.02      The Burmese Government gives high priority to expansion of the
mineral sector. By strengthening local management and operational exper-
tise, the project will provide a foundation from which further projects can
be developed and successfully implemented. More directly, the project com-
ponents will create employment for about 300 persons in remote areas of the
country where existing opportunities are limited. In addition, social ser-
vices will be provided in the form of a townsite, hospital, school, water
and sanitation facilities associated with the project.
8.03      Export earnings over the 19-year project life are expected to aver-
age the equivalent of US$6.0 million annually in 1976 terms (Annex 8-2).
This represents about 3% of the value of Burma's average 1973-75 exports
and almost one third of those presently generated by the mineral sector. Net
foreign exchange benefits (after outflows for capital, operating and debt
service costs) are forecast at US$4.6 million annually (1976 terms). These
gains will have a positive impact on the country's foreign exchange situation,
which must be improved if Burma is to start to realize its full development
potential.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01      The following commitments have been agreed to by the Government:
(i)  A study on MC2's inventory and receivables policy and a plan for
reducing these to an appropriate level will be submitted to IDA
by August 31, 1977 (para. 4.11).
(ii)  Measures reflecting sound accounting practices will be taken
regarding MC2's intangible assets by March 31, 1978 (para 4.12).
(iii)  MC2 will prepare a manpower plan with consulting assistance, in-

months of the close of each fiscal year and quarterly financial
statements within 60 days (para. 4.17).
(vi)  The unsurfaced road between Tavoy and Heinze Basin will be
upgraded before December 31, 1979 (para. 5.02).
(vii)  The project consultants will assist MC2 in improvement of the
export of concentrates (para. 5.12).

(over US$1 million equivalent per year) without prior IDA
approval (para. 5.15).
(x) The Government will employ consultants to assist with a study
of the future development of the mineral sector (para. 5.16).
(xi)  The Corporation will be permited to retain its entire cash
generation during project implementation, and the Government
will provide US$6.0 million equivalent in local currency on
terms satisfactory to IDA, plus additional funds to meet any
shortfall, to meet any cost overruns and to maintain the
Corporation's debt-to-equity ratio below 60:40 (para. 5.21).
(xii) The Government will take steps to ensure prompt review of and
decisions on all procurement matters (para. 6.05).
(xiii) The Government and the Corporation will meet certain financial
covenants (para. 7.14).
9.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness are as follows:
(i) A suitable site for the Tavoy concentrator will be acquired
(para. 5.10).
(ii)  The project consultants will be employed (para. 5.14).
(iii) An onlending agreement, satisfactory to IDA, will be concluded
between the Government and the Corporation (para. 5.20).
9.03      Subject to the foregoing conditions and commitments, the project
provides a sound basis for an IDA credit to the Government of Burma of US$16
million equivalent, with onlending of US$15.8 million equivalent to the
No. 2 Mining Corporation for a period of 15 years, including 5 years of grace,
at 10% interest per annum.

4-inch pipes in 5-foot lengths, a platform sand-
pump, chisels, augers, etc., worked by rods inside
the pipes. Used in prospecting alluvial deposits
to depths of 50 feet or more.
Bucket-Ladder Dredge        A dredge whose digging mechanism consists of a
ladder-like truss on the periphery of which is
attached an endless chain which rides on sprocket
wheels and on which buckets are attached.

or rock.
Concentration               Separation and accumulation of economic minerals
from gangue.
Dredging                    The removal of soils from under water, using the
water as a means of transportation to convey the
soils to final positions. The act of using a
dredge. Dredges can be hydraulic or mechanical,
the latter having wide use in tin mining.
Gangue                      Undesired minerals associated with ore, mostly
non-metallic. The non-metalliferous or non-valuable
metalliferous minerals in the ore. The fraction of
ore rejected as tailings in a separating process.
It is usually the valueless portion but may have
some secondary commercial use.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Gravel Pump Mining          This method of alluvial mining consists of (1)
excavating and breaking up the gravel bank,
usually by using monitors; (2) washing the dis-
integrated material into a sump, excavated in the
bedrock; (3) elevating the mixture from the sump
to an elevated line of sluices by means of a gravel
pump; and (4) sluicing the gravel for the recovery
of its mineral content.
Gravity Separation          Treatment of mineral particles which exploits dif-
ferences between their specific gravities, their
sizes and shapes also playing a minor part in separa-
tion, performed by means of jigs, classifiers,
hydrocyclones, dense media, shaking tables, Humphrey's
spirals, sluices, vanners, buddles.
Ground Sluicing             Moving earth, sand, gravel, or other rock or mineral
materials by flowing water.
High-tension Separation    In mineral processing, the use of high-voltage
direct current at between 18,000 and 80,000 volts
to charge small particles of dry ore as they fall
through its field (emanating as a spray or a point
discharge). These are then sorted into relatively
charge-retaining and charge-losing minerals in
accordance with their conducting power, e.g., separa-
tion of cassiterite and heavy minerals such as
ilmenite, xenotime. Also called electrostatic
separation.
Ilmenite                    An iron-black mineral, FeO-TiO2;  sometimes with
some replacement of iron by magnesium or manganese.
Used in making ceramic products.

by means of a pulsating motion and from which the
stratified products, e.g. cassiterite, gangue, are
separately removed, the pulsating motion being
usually obtained by alternate upward and downward
currents of the water. Also called washbox.
Lanchute                    A coffin-shaped sluice box, about 5 meters in
length, used for the manual second-stage concentra-
tion of tin-ore.
Lode                        Strictly, a rock fissure filled with mineral;
usually applied to metalliferous lodes. In general
miners' usage, a lode vein, or ledge is a deposit
of valuable mineral between definite boundaries.
The word should not be used for a flat or stratified



ANNEX 1

closely enough so that all of them, together with
the intervening rock, can be mined as a unit.
Magnetic Separator          A device in which medium solids are caused to
adhere, by magnetic means, to a conveying belt or
drum, while a current of water removes non-magnetic
particles which contaminate the medium, e.g., the
removal of gangue from cassiterite ore.
Magnetite, Magnetic         Natural black oxide of iron, Fe304.  As black sand,
Iron Ore                    magnetite occurs in placer deposits and also as
lenticular bands. Magnetite is used widely as a
suspension solid in dense medium washing of coal
and ores.
Middlings                   That part of the product of washery, concentration

solidated gravels and sands in alluvial mining to
break down, wash and transport them.
Palong                      A form of sluice box, usually between 60 and 100
meters in length and fitted with riffles, commonly
used as the primary concentrating device in recover-
ing alluvial tin-ore by hydraulic open-cast methods.
Panning                     Washing earth or crushed rock in a pan, by agita-
tion with water, to obtain the particles of greatest
specific gravity which it contains. Used only for
high value minerals.
Refractory                  A material of very high melting point with proper-
ties that make it suitable for such uses as furnace
linings and kiln construction.

tin, by gravity. A rectangular deck with longitu-
dinal riffles, it is shaken rapidly in a compounded
to-and-fro motion by a vibrator in such a way as
to move the sands along while they are exposed to
the sweeping action of a stream of water flowing
across the deck, which is tilted about its long
axis.
Tribute Mining              System under which a syndicate of miners delivers
ore at the pithead at an agreed price.  It may
also operate where ore deposits are too small and
scattered for normal mining activities. The
tributors work and deliver their ore to the owner
and receive payment calculated upon agreed terms
from its ascertained valuable content. Also,
working on a sharing basis.
Trommel                    A revolving cylindrical screen used in grading
coarsely crushed ore. The material to be screened
is delivered inside the trommel at one end. The
fine material drops through the holes; the coarse
is delivered at the other end.
Wilfey Table                Long-established and widely-used form of shaking
table. Plane rectangle is mounted horizontally
and can be sloped about its long axis. It has a
hard cover, e.g., linoleum with longitudinal
riffles diminishing at discharge end to a smooth
cleaning area, triangular in upper corner. A oompound
eccentric is used to create gentle and rapid throwing
motion on table, longitudinally. Sands, usually
classified for size range, are fed continuously and
worked along table with aid of feedwater and across
riffles downslope by gravity tilt adjustment, and
added washwater.

BURMA
APPRAISAL OF TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
THE BURMESE MINERAL SECTOR
A. PRESENT POSITION AND RECENT TRENDS
1. Role in the Economy
1.        The mineral industry in Burma contributed about 1.4% to the GDP in
1974 and this proportion has not changed significantly in recent years. The
value of mineral exports in 1974 was K 89 million (US$18.5 million), 9.5% of
the total value of exports 1/. This value has increased from K 39 million
(US$8.2 million) in 1970 2/ (when minerals made up 7% of the total value of
exports). However, the only significant development appears to be the in-
crease in the export value of precious stones from K 7 million (US$1.5 mil-
lion) in 1970 to K 42 million (US$8.7 million) in 1974. Other positive
developments are the increase in the production of antimony (1970 - nil;
1974 - 1,050 tons) and an increase in the production of tin concentrates
(1970 - 450 tons; 1974 - 719 tons). This additional output of antimony
and tin is equivalent to an increase of about US$1 million in the net
realized value of mineral exports.
2.        Since domestic consumption of metallic minerals is negligible,
the production figures are indicative of export volumes. By the official
statistics, which of course do not include illegal production and trade,
production of minerals for export is about 10% of pre-War levels (1938-39)
and is basically static. No significant new mines have come into operation
for nearly 40 years. There are no substantial smelting, refining or other
value-adding facilities other than an antiquated lead/zinc smelter.
3.        An unknown but not insignificant value of minerals is smuggled
out of the country and constitutes an important barter good. Gemstones,
tin/tungsten and jade are the principal commodities in this trade. Some
estimates place such uncontrolled movement as high as about 60% of the
gemstones and between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of tin and tungsten con-
centrates. If such estimates are correct then this illegal trade is
worth about US$7 million, or somewhat in excess of one-third of the
official value of mineral exports. Providing some evidence of this un-
controlled trade is the fact that about 3,000 illegal workers were re-
cently driven off the gemstone workings by the army. Also, apparently
1/   Including base metals, silver and precious stones (IBRD Report No.
565a-BA, statistical appendix). The 1974 export figure is the
mid-year forecast.
2/   1970 US$1 = K 4.76; 1974 US$1 = K 4.81.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
several gravel pump operations were recently discovered within Burmese
territory funded by Thai capital. Since patrolling of the Thai border
is difficult it is likely that while some operations were intercepted,
others have started up. Furthermore, the price paid by the Government for
tin concentrates from the tributors is much less than what they can
obtain across the border in Thailand (largely due to the artificial Kyat
exchange rate). As a result, it is very likely that official tributor
sales are merely token sales to maintain good relations with the Govern-
ment.
4.        The mining industry provides employment for about 18,000 (exclud-
ing the Myanma Oil Corporation) or less than 1% of total employment measured
by official figures. An estimated 8,000 work in mines only during the wet
season when water conditions permit alluvial mining of tin. The largest
employers are the Myanma Bawdwin Corporation, employing about 6,000, and the
Myanma Tin Tugsten Corporation, employing about 3,000.
2. Government Policy and Development Assistance
5.        With the implementation of the First Four-Year Plan (1971/72 -
1974/75), the Government identified the minerals sector as one of the
development sectors. The sectoral policy pronounced in the First Plan
was "To work all chemical and mineral enterprises, except those specifically
permitted to be worked on cooperative basis, as State-owned enterprises."
6.        The most tangible evidence of the Government's serious intentions
to develop the sector are the numerous technical appraisal missions which
have been invited to examine the sector and the several development and
technical assistance contracts which have been implemented. In general,
Government implementation policy has been to identify potential projects
and to assign them for development through bilateral and multilateral
technical assistance programs and through bilateral credit agreements.
7.        Since nearly all projects are still in initial stages of prepara-
tion, it is not clear to what extent Government intends to rely on foreign
technical and managerial ability to ensure successful operations.  It would
appear that "turnkey" projects are favored, delivered with trained domestic
teams and meeting guaranteed performance criteria.  The Government is
apparently not considering operating under any form of contract management
or participatory agreements.
8.        The main thrust of the Government's development policy for
the sector is to invest in modernization and reopening of mines which
were operational before the War and are now either operating at reduced
capacity (e.g. Bawdwin lead-zinc mine) or on a tribute basis (e.g.,
several tin placers) or have closed down (e.g., tin dredging operations
in the Heinze basin). The only major departure from this pattern is the
exploration work conducted on the Monywa copper deposit. On a commodity



ANNEX 2
Page 3
basis the exploration priorities are stated to be (i) Tin-Tungsten, (ii)
Lead-Zinc, (iii) Copper. The 1975 report to the Pyithu Hluttaw states
that in 1974-75, K 32.6 million was spent on mineral exploration and
prospecting.
9.        The principal recent project activities are as follows:

IDA
10.       The Government's second Four-Year Plan (1973/74 - 1977/78),
currently under revision, calls for average annual net production in the
mining sector to increase by 2.4%, reaching a total value of US$56
million equivalent by 1978. The plan envisages the purchase of machinery
and equipment necessary for expanding mineral production and converting
the Mawchi, Heinda, Bawdwin, and Hermyingyi mines into modern mining
centers.  With the exception of the Heinda project, it appears that
little progress will be made on the other projects before 1978.
11.       The overall Government development strategy for this plan
period at least, is to de-emphasize industrial development in favor
of agricultural development. Within this overall strategy development
progress in the mineral sector appears to be fairly directly related to
the availability of soft credit terms for specific projects.
12.       The major sources of assistance to the sector to date are
outlined below:



ANNEX 2
Page 4
FEderal Republic of Germany (FRG)
1:i.      The FRG has played by far the most significant role in the
m:neral sector within the scope of bilateral agreements.  This assistance
initially took the form of technical assistance on a grant basis. Technical
assistance still continues and specific credit lines have been made available,
of which the most significant is the DM 15 million for the Heinda mine project
cturrently under disbursement. A proposed DM 65 million credit for the Bawdwin
mine has at least been deferred following KFW's conclusion that the project
entvisaged was not financially feasible. DM 5 million of this credit is now
earmarked for Bawdwin, with most of the remainder tentatively being considered
for the Monywa copper project.
U_SR
1's.      The USSR provided a credit line of 1.8 million rubles for the
rehabilitation of the Mawchi tin mine. However, insurgency activity
has prevented this project from being continued and only a part of the
credit was taken up. The USSR has sold some equipment to the Industrial
M:nerals Corporation.
Jiapan
1li.      Japanese involvement has been in the Monywa copper project,
commencing with technical assistance under the Colombo Plan and sub-
sequently continuing under a bilateral technical assistance agreement.
This work involved exploration drilling, establishing a pilot plant and
testing, and a feasibility study. Japan is interested in a joint venture,
but this is so far not acceptable to the Burmese.
Canada
16.       The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) initiated
a technical assistance program in 1971-72 which focused on exploration
drilling at the Yadanatheingi lead-zinc prospect and the Bawdwin Mine, and
which ended in early 1974. Currently CIDA is providing one driller and
one mining engineer within a three year and US$1.25 million project directed
at: the exploration for barite in the Maymyo region.
01:her Countries
17.       Several other countries have provided technical assistance, parti-
ciularly in the form of short appraisal missions, and these include Poland,
Yugoslavia, China, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Australia.
UIDP
18.       The UNDP continues to have a major input into the minerals
sector. Its program currently includes the following projects:

19.       The broad thrust of government mineral development policy (para. 8)
is sound and there are certainly enough potential targets and developmental
opportunities on which to base positive action. Burma is attempting to develop
the mineral sector but very much on its own terms. The environment is one
where only countries with extraordinary perseverance and the willingness to
"invest" large sums of technical assistance on a grant basis (such as the
Federal Republic of Germany and Japan) have been able to gain a measure of
acceptance in project activity. There are no signs in the mineral sector
to-date of the Burmese being able to launch and adequately manage any signi-
ficant revenue-generating projects on their own initiative and funding.
3. Financial, Management and Organizational Problems
20.        The decline of the mineral sector began with the extensive World
War II damage and the post-war withdrawal of the private foreign mining
companies. The continuing debilitated state of the sector has resulted
from a lack of inv=stment stemming from the withdrawal of the private
interests arn  overnment emphasis on investment in other sectors, the
inability ;. che ½overament mineral corporations to use their own finan-
cial resources due to total Government control over their revenue and
expenditures, a chronic shortage of foreign exchange, and the lack of
experience in project preparation and execution in the country. Further
restrictive factors have been the extensive insurgent activities in large



ANNEX 2
Page 6
areas of the country where minerals can be produced and the Government
policy of not allowing foreign or private participation in the development
of the sector. A recent exception to this latter policy has been the advent
of joint ventures in petroleum exploration involving private oil companies
but foreign participation in the non-petroleum sector has been limited to
bi-lateral and multilateral technical assistance and financial aid, as
outlined above.
21.       The major problems confronting the sector are poor and outmoded
plant, a lack of planning experience and commercial orientation, shortages
of foreign exchange and the related shortage of spare parts, a fragmented
organizational structure, a weak financial situation for most of the sector's
corporations, over-employment and reluctance to rationalize, and the dis-
torted exchange rate of the kyat, which contributes substantially to the
financial weakness of the mining corporations and results in marginal
financial returns for most substantial projects and a diversion of a
significant proportion of sector output into illegal trading.
22.       There are some signs that the long term sectoral decline is
coming to an end. Government policies over the last few years have resulted
in increased activities by various agencies in the sector, as described in
the previous section.
23.       A reasonable degree of technical competence exists at various
levels in the sector's institutions but management abilities are limited
and there is a lack of innovation and initiative. In certain areas there
are labor shortages (para. 32) but this has not been a major limiting
factor. It is not likely that substantial projects in the sector could
be adequately prepared and implemented without fairly extensive outside
technical assistance in addition to the essential outside financial
resources.
24.       Although most of the sector institutions are called corporations,
their separate legal identity is vague and they have extremely limited auto-
nomous power. There are no shares or similar instruments and ownership is by
the people and vested in the State. All revenues have gone to the Union
Government Consolidated Fund (UGCF) and operating and capital expenditures have
been drawn from the Fund under rigid and restricted budgets approved by the
Government. There has been some modification of this financial system with the
introduction a few years ago of limited "borrowing" at no interest under the
Working Capital System but the corporations have had little effective control
over their financial resources and there have been no charges for funds drawn
from the UGCF, which has been the sole source of finance other than a few
bi-lateral credits on-lent through the central Bank.
25.       The responsibilities and powers of the mining corporations have
been purely operational and all policy decisions have been taken by the
Minister of Mines or the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers.
Some liberalization of this highly centralized control is envisaged under new
guidelines, described under the section on the structure of the sector.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
26.       The entire minerals sector in the country is equivalent to
the output of a fairly small mining company elsewhere which could operate with
a central office staff of about 50 professionals and support personnel,
a geological staff of about 20 and several district offices employing an
additional managerial and office staff of about 100 (down to the mine or plant
superintendent level). In contrast, mining operations in Burma are divided
between four operating corporations and supervisory and support staff run into
the hundreds. There is not one good managerial group but several fairly
mediocre ones. The argument for this "decentralization" is that one single
organization would be too unwieldy, given the size and operational methods of
the bureaucracies involved. The appraisal mission did not examine in detail
the degree of duplication of common services in such a system (such as account-
ing, stores, marketing, geology and planning) which generally benefit con-
siderably through centralization and computerization of the more routine
elements. The scope for improvement of management systems is substantial.
There is some evidence that reorganization and shuffling of units is a never-
ending process in search of "efficiency". For example, the geological unit,
which was with the Myanma Mineral Development Corporation for a few years, is
moving back to the Directorate of Geological Surveys and Exploration. It now
appears that all geological expertise will be in the latter unit and that
geology will be split away from the operating units.
27.       There has been little action to improve effectiveness.  Thus,
although shortcomings are perceived, little is done to rectify them. The
individual who is tempted to introduce change balks at the enormity of the
problem. An example of this is the lack of cost accounting and auditing
systems. Accounting students are taught all the latest approaches, but as
young and "inexperienced" juniors in an organization, they are virtually
powerless to effect change.
28.       Entrepreneurship, as it relates to business acumen and innovation,
is probably largely confined in the mineral sector to those who can produce
and sell illegally. Ideally, these entrepreneurs should somehow be in-
corporated into the system. In theory this would appear to be possible,
since the operations could be termed cooperatives and thus meet socialistic
goals. But practically speaking, the pricing and marketing system is not
likely to be able to adjust sufficiently to divert anything but a small
proportion of such entrepreneurial activities to the official trading chan-
nels. Despite the apparent shortcomings within the system as a whole, certain
State enterprises are profitable and a sincere attempt is being made to focus
increasingly on profitability. It is likely that great progress could be made
if the Burmese were willing to purchase contract management for projects, as a
bold step to the rapid acquisition of managerial skills. To some extent the
consulting assistance for the proposed IDA project is a step in this direc-
tion. But a very specific situation prevails at this time which is bound
to have a bearing on project implementation.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
4. Education
29.       Higher education is currently affected by student unrest,
particularly in Rangoon, which is countered by the authorities by closure
of the University. Over the 18 months to March 1976, when it was closed
again, the university had been open for only 3 1/2 months. The only
advantage of such events is that it decreases the numbers of graduates
pressing on limited job opportunities. For example, there are approximately
1,000 students studying geology with about 250 graduating each year. Since
the State is the sole employer, it clearly is unrealistic to expect the
various mineral organizations to be able to absorb such numbers.
30.       The quality of the graduates apparently leaves much to be desired
and is far below "western" standards. Also, it is difficult for Burmese to
receive permits to go abroad for studies and the UNDP has difficulties in
getting the fellowship positions filled in its programs.
31.       A quantum jump has to be taken in upgrading the standard of pro-
fessionals in geology, mining, mineral dressing and extractive metallurgy,
through exchange lectureships, specialized courses (both in Burma and abroad)
and study abroad. It would appear that the most useful strategy would be to
attempt to upgrade the graduates of the existing system in the disciplines
already taught and to send overseas candidates for training in disciplines not
yet being taught in Burma. Attempting to reform the present structure of
education for the sector should be a long-term objective, but one which is
likely to be particularly difficult to effect.
5. Labor
32.       Most of the mine labor before the War, both in surface and under-
ground operations, was expatriate (Chinese, Malay, Ghurka, Indian, etc.) and
reflected the feeling at that time that expatriate workers were far more
productive than nationals. Although this was probably an unduly biased
attitude, it is still today difficult to attract Burmese labor to mining
operations in some areas. It is particularly difficult to obtain recruits for
the underground operations at Bawdwin. Labor turnover is such that about 600
new recruits are required annually (for the whole mine) and the underground
operations are continually understaffed. At the Yadanatheingi Mine, all
underground labor reportedly consists of convicts. Surface mining operations
fare better but there is also considerable seasonal movement in and out from
farming activity and some areas of the country where a sparse population
results in scarce labor. There is much current discussion on incentive schemes
(para. 33) and how to make them sufficiently attractive. At the Bawdwin
operation one of the most attractive features for labor is the adequate
availability of basic foodstuffs at somewhat subsidized prices.
33.       The naturally peaceful disposition of the people coupled with a
centrally planned economy results in a remarkably tranquil labor force. Trade
unions and strikes are illegal and apparently the mines have not been troubled
by any spontaneous labor disturbances. However, continued tranquility



ANNEX 2
Page 9
of the industrial labor force in the future is likely to depend much on
wage and price levels and the ability of individuals to exercise a choice
to return to agriculture should inflationary trends (currently at least
20% per annum) and regulated wage structures (public sector wages have re-
mained essentially unchanged in Burma since 1948, with only minor cost of
living adjustments in 1972 and 1976) erode any advantages of industrial
employment. Steps are being taken under the new commercial guidelines
(para. 46-49) to introduce bonus systems linked to performance which should
offer scope for workers to improve their income levels.
6. Security and Insurgency
34.       The problem of insurgency is one of major importance to the future
development of the sector and officials are vague in their discussion of the
matter. Basically, only about 30% of the country is completely free from any
form of insurgency activity. The rest of the country can be divided into
heavy insurgency activity and sporadic activity. It would appear that in the
more intense areas the Government can not guarantee safe conduct or safe
operations.
35.       From the point of view of mineral development, it is therefore
necessary to superimpose an "insurgency activity" map over a map of geo-
logical potential and potential projects, and to assess the degree of overlap.
At this time, it would appear that operations such as Monywa, Heinda, and
the Heinze Basin are areas where safe conduct can be assured with adequate
military effort. The Mawchi operation is clearly a problem, and the issue is
at what cost the area could be neutralized. Bank staff have not been allowed
to visit the area. Also, the Bawdwin operation and vicinity is an example of
a particularly difficult situation clearly bordering on an intensive insurgency
front, and the issue of insurgency becomes critical to any rehabilitation
plans for the mine. It is clear that, should mining activity become a specific
target of the insurgents, the sector is particularly vulnerable and it would
require a major effort by the Government to assure safe conduct. In some
areas, illegal mining and smuggling operations are apparently related to
insurgent activity.
B. STRUCTURE
1. Background
36.       Prior to World War II, mineral production was entirely in the hands
of the private sector, dominated by British owned companies. During the War,
much of the mining plant was severely damaged and neglected. In the post-
War period, there was considerable reluctance by the former companies to re-
invest in rehabilitation and in new plants in the newly independent Burma.
The smaller mines which were still in operation were gradually nationalized.
In 1951, the Government took a 50% interest in the Bawdwin mine through



ANNEX 2
Page 10
Burma Corporation (1951) Limited, and in 1965 the Burma Corporation was national-
ized. The only private legal activity in the mining sector at the present time
is small scale mining, particularly of tin and tungsten and antimony. The
"official" part of this production is bought from the "tributors" by No. 2
Mining Corporation (tin and tungsten), and No. 3 Mining Corporation (antimony).
2. Major Institutions
37.       A small number of government corporations, which are essentially
part of the Ministry of Mines, are responsible for all official production
of minerals. The producing corporations, with the exception of the Jade and
Gem Corporation, have until recently been required to supply all of their
output to the government-owned Myanma Export Import Corporation (MEIC), a part
of the Ministry of Trade, for export sales. There have been various organiza-
tional changes in the sector over the years, and since the sub-division of the
Mineral Development Corporation in 1972 (para. 46) the main sector institutions
have been as follows: The Myanma Bawdwin Corporation (now No. 1 Mining
Corporation) responsible for lead, zinc and silver production, with 50%-60% of
non-petroleum sector output and 40% of employment; the Myanma Tin Tungsten
Corporation (now No. 2 Mining Corporation), responsible for tin/tungsten
production with 30%-40% of sector output and 15% of employment; the Myanma
Mineral Development Corporation (No. 3 Mining Corporation) responsible for
production of antimony and coal and the development of copper production; the
Industrial Minerals Corporation (No. 4 Mining Corporation) responsible for
production of limestone, gypsum, and other non-metallic products; the Gem and
Jade Corporation, responsible for production and marketing of jade, rubies and
other gems and pearls; and two main supporting entities within the Ministry,
the Directorate of Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration (DGSE), responsi-
ble for exploration and geological studies, and the Department of Planning and
Works Inspection, responsible for mine inspection, safety, planning and
statistics. The Myanma Oil Corporation (MOC) is responsible for oil and gas
exploration and production.
38.       The Minister of Mines has three advisory committees, made up of
advisors from other ministries and the directors of the operating Corpora-
tions. These committees are Technical, Projects and Executive (largely admin-
istrative matters.) The development priorities are set out by the Projects
Committee which would appear to be the senior decision making body within the
Ministry.

3. Mineral Marketing
40.       Burma holds a very minor positon in the world production and export
of mineral products even though it exports nearly all of its non-fuel mineral
output. It currently provides less than 1% of world tin production, about
1.5% of world tungsten production, and under 0.2% for zinc, lead and silver.
41.       Mineral marketing is a particularly weak aspect of State operations
in the mineral sector. Export marketing has been handled by the MEIC with the
exception of gemstones which are put up for auction by Trade Corporation No.
19. Under the decentralization policy, commercial enterprises falling under
one Ministry will be able to handle their own commercialization if they so
desire. The Mining Ministry has recently set up a new metals marketing
organization in the form of a Minerals Marketing Committee. This Committee
was formed in late 1976 and is managed by representatives from the three
metal producing corporations. In addition, the former sales manager for
metals with the MEIC (a well-regarded and competent individual) and the
only person on the Committee who has any long-term experience with foreign
buyers has been made Secretary of the Committee. Beyond this, however, it
is not yet clear how broader expertize in marketing will be acquired.
42.       Marketing is presently virtually divorced from the production
function (although this should change with the above mentioned Marketing
Committee). The role of the marketing agency has been basically to sell what
is produced and apparently the only direct communication between production
and marketing was a seminar held once a year. And so, whether in tin-tungsten
or in zinc concentrates, there has been almost no liaison between marketing
and production to better adapt the products to market requirements, thereby



ANNEX 2
Page 12
rinimizing penalties and securing better prices. There is much scope for
Iroduct up-grading, both at the mine and at suitably located central concen-
trating plants, for a wide range of mineral commodities.
13.       The basic marketing techniques are one-year contacts or spot
Eales of batches, both done on a tender basis with ore buyers. Even in
tin, with three smelters relatively close at hand in Malaysia and Thailand, no
tolling contracts are entered into. The reasons given are that ore supplies
ere unreliable in quantity and quality and that the approach in mineral sales
is similar to the way rice is sold and the "higher authorities" favor that
approach. The Malaysian consulting firm, Osborne and Chappel, in examining
tin marketing in Burma, found that domestic assays were unreliable and arbitra-
tion often had to be resorted to. They recommended direct sales to a smelter.
Tin and tungsten marketing is discussed further under the Annexes on the
Market (Annexes 3-1 and 3-2) and the Corporation (Annex 4).
4X.       It would appear that there is considerable scope for improving
gem marketing strategy. The approach, as practiced for 12 years, is to
aiction once a year mixed batches of gems which are cut domestically. The
dDmestic cutting is poor and the once-a-year auction (with reserve prices)
d3es not permit on-going contact with the market. A year-round marketing
oitlet has recently been opened on a trial basis in Switzerland. It would
a)pear that Burma, as the world's leading source of quality rubies, could
d3velop a more sophisticated marketing strategy. For example, it could
e3tablish offshore cutting and jewelry-making affiliates (in locations
wiere such "know-how" exists) or attempt to import such "know-how" on a
c)ntract basis. Thailand is a good example of a thriving gem cutting
iidustry which developed on the basis of domestic production and which is
iicreasingly attracting rough stones, many of them smuggled from Burma.
4i.       The prevailing exchange rate and low mineral purchase prices
vLrtually exclude the possibility of the Government purchasing minerals on
":he free market" from tributors. For example, the Government purchase
p-ice is K 3 for one standard measure of tin concentrates (a condensed
mLlk tin) but this can be sold in Thailand for 10 Baht which is traded
f)r up to K 12 or a multiple of up to 4 times. This differential contains
a more favourable purchase price for the tin, reflecting its value as a
birter good, as well as a free market exchange rate for the Kyat. Similar
d fferentials exist for all other mineral commodities which lend themselves
ti? smuggling.
4   Legislation and Operational Guidelines for the Sector
41,.      The legislative framework for the sector has evolved in stages
o'-er the last 15 years. The Petroleum and Mineral Development Corporation
A(t was superceded in 1965 by the Mineral Development Corporation and a new
a(ministrative system introduced in 1972 when the Mineral Development Cor-
p ration was re-organized. Separate legislation was approved for each
c(rporation e.g. the Myanma Tin Tung3ten Corporation Act in 1974. In May,
1!75, the Standard Guidelines for the Operation cf State Economic Enter-
plises were issued by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. These are
iTtended to enable some departure from the extreme central control of
tle Government. More autonomy and financial responsibility is intended to



ANNEX 2
Page 13
rest with the corporations and new fiscal and financial measures (e.g.
new taxes, a system of debt financing with accompanying financial charges)
are being introduced. Implementation of this new system commenced in
April 1976, and although this represents a fairly significant change in
policy, the system and the people are so accustomed to close control that
it will likely be some time before much innovative and autonomous behavior
results. The rank and file manager is extremely reluctant within the
system to take a major decision, or, for that matter, to commit himself
to writing. Decision making will, in all likelihood, continue to be made
slowly and by senior committee.
47.       Interest charges on debt are to be introduced progressively.
The producing corporations will be permitted to take over their own
marketing (para. 41) and will have more freedom to retain their own cash
generation. There will also supposedly be some recognition of foreign exchange
earners in the allocation of the country's scarce foreign exchange resources.
Auditing will still be done exclusively by the Government Audit Office and
it is difficult to see how badly needed improvements in the accounting area
can be made sufficiently quickly to enable accounting and auditing staff
and systems to cope with the new demands which are inevitable if the new
commerical orientation is to function effectively.
48.       Wage policy will still be controlled centrally but under the
commerical re-orientation, bonus systems are being introduced. These are
to be related to the financial and production performance of the corporations
and will be structured so that lower paid workers will receive proportionately
higher rates of bonuses.
49.       The changes are being introduced cautiously and the Government will
certainly remain dominant in the sector. Indeed, if implemented ineffectively
the new guidelines could act as yet another set of restrictive controls in
addition to the system which already existed.
C. MINERAL POTENTIAL AND EXPLORATION
50.       The country is comprised of three physiographic regions.  The Western
Hills in the West, the Central Belt, and the Shan Plateau in the East with a
Southward continuation of the highland in the Tenasserim Strip. Geological
features include a great variety of rock types, ages and structures and each
physiographic region has its characteristic geological features. The main
metallic mineral deposits of Burma are found in Eastern Burma, in the Shan
Plateau area, the Tenasserim Strip, in northern Burma, or near the eastern
edge of the Western Hills. Within these areas, specific types of deposits
tend to be grouped in northerly-trending belts (commonly referred to as
metallogenic provinces). The well known Burma tin-tungsten province contains
numerous deposits of cassiterite and wolframite either separately or in com-
bination and extends throughout the Tenasserim Strip and northerly to about
latitude 21°15'. These deposits comprise both alluvial and lode occurences.
Another province, characterized by deposits of lead, zinc and silver, known as
the lead belt, lies immediately north of the tin-tungsten province and extends
north-north-easterly for some 300 miles through the Southern and Northern
Shan States. Barite deposits occur in the same province. Scattered antimony



ANNEX 2
Page 14
deposits, a few of which have been mined on a small scale, overlap the north
end of the tin-tungsten province and the south end of the lead belt, and thus
extend northerly from near Moulmein into Southern Shan State. Rubies and
sapphires have been mined from the 15th Century (or earlier) from an area of
about 40 square miles near Mogok in Northern Shan State. Jade is mined to
the north of this area. Near the eastern edge of the Western Hills, from the
Arakan Yoma in the south to the Naga Hills in the extreme northwest Burma,
are a series of ultrabasic intrusions and dacitic extrusive bodies as near
Monywa, that may constitute a copper and nickel province.
51.       Documentation on the mineral resource endowment is of three basic
types: (i) The pre-War work of the Burma Division of the Geological Survey
of India, most of which was published, (ii) The post-War work by the Direc-
torate of Geological Survey and Exploration and its forerunner organizations --
most of this work is not published and is not readily available, (iii) The
work done under bilateral and multilateral technical assistance agreements --
this work is largely the property of the Government. The status of geological
knowledge may be summarized as follows: of Burma's total area of 261,228
square miles, 184,260 square miles (about 70% of the country) has been mapped
at only reconnaissance scale (1 inch to 4 miles) and only 78,320 square
miles (about 30% of the country) has been covered by geologic maps of
1 inch to 1 mile scale. At the advent of World War II, most of the Central
Basin and Tenasserim region had been compiled only into schematic 1 inch to
32 mile maps which are quite inadequate by modern standards and which have not
been updated since. Only a small part of the country has been prospected
systematically by modern methods. It is due largely to problems of security
that large tracts of the country have not been geologically mapped or pros-
pected in any detail, and geological missions are assigned only "secure" areas
for exploration. Ironically, and unfortunately, geologically attractive
provinces are generally in hilly terrain which is generally deemed to be
"not secure".  In summary, indications are that Burma has a highly varied
and favourable mineral endowment which justifies a strong effort in mapping
and exploration.
D. PLANNED SECTOR INVESTMENT AND NEEDS
1. Potential Development Projects
52.       The mineral sector has been given a high priority for investment
by the Government (para. 5), given its potential for growth and the important
contribution it can make to the country's foreign exchange earnings. On the
other hand, realization of objectives may be slow due to Burma's limited
financial, technical and managerial resources (para. 57). As mentioned earlier,
the thrust of the Government's development strategy is to rehabilitate old
tin/tungsten mines and the Bawdwin lead/zinc/silver mine, to develop the
Monywa copper deposit, to commence tin dredging at Heinze Basin and to carry
out a number of smaller projects in antimony, gemstones and tin/tungsten.
The salient features of the major projects are summarized below:

US$0.70 per pound = $2 billion
Status: Japanese government completed feasibilty study in late 1976
Potential start of new production: early 1980's
Project:       Antimony, Gold, Gemstones
Order of Magnitude of Capital Investment Required: US$10-15 million
Potential Gross Value of Annual Production (order of Magnitude)
US$ 5 - 10 million
Status: Government is in initial planning phases
Potential start of new production: could be operational by 1980
53.       The three substantial potential projects, excluding Heinda which
is nearing completion, are Heinze Basin (the IDA project), Bawdwin and
Monywa. The Heinze Basin project and its related components are discussed
in detail in Annex 5-1.
54.       The Monywa Copper project has the potential of being a valuable
undertaking and may possibly expand to be a major copper venture. At
this stage, and basing judgment on the Japanese findings, it appears
difficult to consider anything but the export of concentrates,
i.e., not establishing a smelter. The additional benefits which the
project offers is an industrial undertaking in an underdeveloped region
and the opportunity for upgrading railway track and adding new rolling
stock. The project does not appear to present security problems and has
an interested sponsor-the Mitsui Mining Company of Japan.
55.       The Bawdwin mining and smelting complex poses a particularly
difficult developmental challenge from the point of view of technical
complexity, infrastructural shortcomings, and insurgent activity. The
mine and plant rehabilitation plan, as recently developed by Klockner and
K.f.W., appeared to be of rather limited scale and only a partial solution,
and was recently judged unsuitable for financing by KfW and the German
government.
56.       From the point of view of profitability and relative ease of
implementation, there are a large number of projects which are likely to
offer very interesting returns with a considerable "cushion" for poor
management. Tin gravel pump mining, modernization of gemstone production
and marketing, and promotion of antimony production are examples of poten-
tially highly attractive projects. The problem with these projects, from
the point of view of Bank action, is that they are all relatively small
and therefore difficult to handle as individual projects. At the same time,
they require considerable assistance in preparation and implementation. A
start on improving tin output by gravel pump mining is being made a part of
the IDA project. The antimony and gemstone projects have had very little
preparation work done as yet.

2. Development Potential and Problems and the Bank's Role
57.       The priorities outlined above are sound but realization of the
development plans now under review are likely to be slow due to shortcomings
in project preparation and execution abilities, the limited foreign exchange
resources that can be attracted, and the limited local funds available. The
distorted exchange rate for the kyat coupled with other inefficiencies in
the sector corporations have resulted in financiallyweak institu-
tions with little scope for project financing through cash generation.
Furthermore, the exchange rate situation makes it difficult to achieve
attractive rates of return in financial terms. Bawdwin, Monywa and the
Heinze Basin dredging project are all examples of financially marginal but
reasonably substantial projects in the sector. KfW decided not to finance
the limited modernization project at Bawdwin partly due to its poor financial
return and both Monywa and Heinze Basin are financially marginal projects
even though shadow-pricing of taxes and foreign exchange costs and benefits
produces very attractive economic returns. For significant re-development
of the sector to take place some means of augmenting the foreign exchange
revenues of export-oriented projects and institutions may have to be found.
58.       An examination of the medium term outlook presented in a 1973
mineral sector report 1/ highlights the hazard of making predictions in
the uncertain Burmese environment. At that time, the mission forecast a
potential increase of K 30 million (US$6.2 million) in the value of mineral
exports by 1974/75 from tin and tin-tungsten projects underway or being
planned. In actual fact, the real increase, in 1971/72 price terms, has
been only about K 6 (US$1.2 million) million. The major reason for this
difference is accounted for by the suspension of the Mawchi project and
the delay in start-up of the Heinda project. Also a small used dredge was
postulated as operational but such a development did not materialize.
59.       Notwithstanding the abovementioned difficulties, the mineral
sector has the potential to approach an export level of US$35 million
(1976 prices) by 1980/81, assuming the envisaged expansion and product quality
improvement in tin/tungsten, better control of gemstone production and
marketing and some expansion in antimony. In the longer term, exports could
approach US$100 million by the mid-80's assuming two major projects like
Monywa or Bawdwin are executed, or one of these is done in parallel with
minor improvements in, for example, tin/tungsten, gemstones and jade, and
antimony. Growth of this order of magnitude is not conditional on new
mineral discoveries but on adequate preparation and funding of projects
1/   Freyman and Associates; Burma:  Development Prospects in the Mining
and Non-Ferrous Metallurgy Sector; January 1973.



ANNEX 2
Page 18
to develop known mineralization. Achieving such a level by the
mid-80's would require sector investment of at least US$200 million (1976
prices) over the next 5-10 years and project preparation, execution and
early operation would need extensive outside technical assistance.  Sector
potential is substantially greater if illegal exports could be brought into
the official sector and if government policy were to allow more active
foreign participation.
60.       A major strategic question for the development of Burmese mineral
potential is the relative emphasis which should be placed on more modest
projects in tin/tungsten, gemstones or antimony versus major capital intensive
undertakings such as Bawdwin or Monywa. The impact of the latter type of
project in contributing urgently needed foreign exchange would be much greater
but execution could overtax Burma's limited financial, technical and managerial
resources. Furthermore, it may be impossible to execute such large and
complex projects effectively without a level of outside technical participation
which might be unacceptable to the Government. The Government intends to push
for implementation of a number of projects, both large and small, but the
numerous limitations already outlined may force it to be very selective in
those projects chosen for advancement.
61.       The Bank's role in sectoral development could be three-fold.
First priority should be in financing specific projects such as the proposed
tin/tungsten expansion, thereby establishing some record of successful experi-
ence in the sector. Secondly, the Bank can, through consultants, helpto
identify and select development priorities from the longer term alternatives.
Third the Bank could act as a catalyst for other sources of finance to enable
larger projects to be undertaken.

APPRAISAL OF TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
THE TIN MARKET
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        The value of tin sales represents some US$1.2 billion annually,
and therefore plays a comparatively modest role in international trade.
However it is one of the few metals where a large proportion of the
production comes from the developing countries (about 75% of mine and
refinery production). As such, tin has a significant role in the economy
of a few developing countries - Bolivia, and Malaysia for example. Another
distinct feature of the tin market has been the long history of producer
and consumer cooperation.
2.        The tin market has been characterized by low growth in consump-
tion, and this is not expected to change in the future. On the other hand,
the grade of proven reserves has shown a decline over the past couple of
decades.  In spite of improved mining and concentrating methods, costs
of production and therefore prices, have shown a real increase over time.
B. PROPERTIES
3.        Tin metal is white in color, has a brilliant lustre, and a high
light reflectivity when polished. It is normally malleable and ductile.
Tin metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife.  However, above 2000C,
it becomes quite brittle. Tin's malleability is utilized in collapsible
tubes and foil - one of the few uses where tin is directly consumed.
Sheets as thin as 0.0014 to 0.0002 cm. can be rolled. Chemically,
the most outstanding property of tin is its ability to resist corrosion by
air and many acidic liquids. Because of this property, tin in the form
of tinplate, is used as a container for foods and beverages and in collapsible
tubes for toothpaste and various other products. Tin-bearing solutions used
in plating are more conductive than other plating solutions. As a result,
the tin covering on iron or steel is more continuous, decreasing the possi-
bility of corrosion of the coated material. Thinner coats can be applied
with tin than other substances. Another important property of tin is its
ability to impart desirable properties to other metals when used as an alloy.
The best example of this is the use of tin to harden copper in bronze - first
used in 3200 B.C. This was one of man's first metallurgical experiments and
laid the foundation for the Bronze Age.
4.        Although there are several tin minerals, cassiterite (a tin oxide -
SnO ) is by far the most common. Cassiterite has a high specific gravity
(6.A - 7.1), and is quite hard. Because of its hardness and greater resistance
to weathering than other minerals, it is found in placer deposits quite free
of impurities. Initial treatment by gravity separation yields a concentrate



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
which is relatively pure cassiterite - about 77% tin. Smelting and refining
yields relatively pure tin metal. "Grade A" or "Straits" tin has a minimum
tin content of 99.95%.
C. USES
5.        Tin is generally used in improving the properties and character-
istics of other materials. Although tin is essential to an industrial
economy, society is not overly conscious of the role played by tin. The
table below shows the major end uses of tin in selected industrialized
countries.

International Tin Council (ITC), 1975 Data
6.        Some 40% to 45% of world tin consumption is as a coating in
tinplate. The bulk of tinplate goes into the fabrication of metal containers
for food, beverages, and other commodities.  In the USA, tinplate represents
less than 35% of tin consumption. Elsewhere in the world this use is somewhat
more than 40% of total consumption. Only primary tin is utilized in tin plate.
7.        The use of tin plate has trended downwards, mainly because of
development of rust-free steel and aluminum in containers, particularly
for those products with short shelf life such as beer and soft drinks. This
trend is more pronounced in the USA than elsewhere in the world. In
addition, thinner tin coats and differential plating have also decreased
the use of tin.
8.        On the other hand, a technique introduced in the manufacture of
aluminum cans known as "drawn and wall-ironed" cans has been applied to
tin cans. This technique permits the production of two piece seamless
cans. First manufactured in 1971, these cans are in strong competition
with aluminum cans. Tin cans offer a number of advantages including
cost, strength, magnetic handling, and better consistency in filling.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
9.        Other uses for tinplate include:  bottle caps, closures, and
kitchen utensils. These uses account for less than 10% of tinplate con-
sumption.
10.       Solder represents the second most important use of tin, where
it is used in various alloys with antimony, silver, and lead. Solder
accounts for some 25% of tin consumption. Most of the solder is used
in joining electrical and electronic circuits, and joining in plumbing,
and heat radiation and air conditioning equipment. A small amount is
used in the sealing of tin cans.
11.       The outlook for tin in these applications is closely tied to
the future of copper. Heat exchanging equipment in automotiv'e applica-
tions is an important use. If the trend develops to smaller automobiles,
a decrease in automobile production growth, or substitution of aluminum
for copper in radiators, demand for tin could be affected.
12.       In other areas, such as commercial and domestic air conditioning,
and electrical and electronic circuits, the outlook seems favorable. Use
of epoxy resins for joining, or a trend away from copper heat exchangers
could materialize. However, the prospects for continued use of tin are
good. In electrical and electronic applications, solder seems likely to
remain a favored component.
13.       Another important use of tin is in bearings.  Babbitt alloys are
the most common. These alloys range from 80 to 90% tin, together with
antimony and copper. There are also lead base babbitt metals which contain
I to 10% tin. These bearings enjoy wide use in most automobile and other
engines, farm, construction, and other machinery. Use of plastic, air,
low tin, or other bearings could lower demand.
14.       Bronze and brass represent some 8% of tin consumption. Bronzes are
copper base alloys which may or may not contain tin. The most important tin
alloys are phosphor bronze containing 10 to 12% tin with small amounts of
phosphorus and gun-metal-tin bronze casting alloys. An important use of tin
bronzes is in plumbing fixtures. Other uses include bearings, fittings and
castings.
15.       The bulk of the tin used in tinning is as a coating on other
metals. Its use as a coating on copper wire to prevent corrosion is the
most common example. Many small machinery parts are tin coated.
16.       The most promising use of tin is in the chemical field.  Although
demand is small, the potential for growth is large. Organotin compounds
are used as stabilizers in polyvinyl chlorides (PVC), and fungicides and
biocides. Inorganic tin chemicals are widely used as perfume and soap
stabilizers, and as reducing agents in dye manufacture. The most visible
use of tin chemicals is stanous fluoride in toothpastes.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 4
17.       Other uses of tin cover a wide range of applications.  Examples
include piping for distilled water, and beer and other beverages, collapsible
tubes for toothpaste and other medicinal uses, dental amalgam, pewter and
jewelry. A recent development is the use of molten tin as a float both in the
manufacutre of flat plate glass by the Pilkington process.
18.       There is no direct substitute for tin in most of its applications
as, for example, synthetic rubber for natural rubber. However, alternative
materials such as aluminum or rust free steel to replace tinplate in
packaging applications have had a significant effect on ti-fl usage. In
many of its uses, alternative materials are available. As a result, tin
consumption has not increased at a rate commensurate with the growth in
demand for the end products. The future outlook is for the low growth
trend to continue.
C. WORLD TIN RESERVES
19.       Tin is a relatively scarce element with an average content in
the earth's crust of 1.7 parts per million (ppm). In contrast, copper
is 37 times more abundant. Tin is mainly found in placer or alluvial
deposits, derived from weathering and erosion of primary tin deposits.
Cassiterite's greater resistance to weathering permits it to endure
better than the minerals commonly associated with it. Primary or lode
deposits occur in siliceous granitic rocks. They are usually vein-type
deposits or disseminated replacement deposits.
20.       In placer deposits, tin may be found in association with small
but important amounts of columbium, tantalum and rare earth minerals.
Generally, though, the placer deposits are relatively free of other metal
impurities. Lode deposits, on the other hand, usually contain other
minerals. These, commonly in the form of sulphides, include copper,
antimony, lead, zinc, bismuth, and tungsten minerals. Published world
tin reserves are estimated as shown below:

21.       Tin is the only metal where reserves are heavily concentrated in
the developing countries, particularly South East Asia. Four countries in
the region - Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Burma have 57Z of world
reserves. These reserves lie in the Bankga-Belitung - West Malaysia -
Thailand tin belt which extends from the three Indonesian islands of
Bangka, Belitung and Singkep northwards some 3,500 km through Malaysia,
Thailand and Burma to Mandalay. Most of these reserves have been identi-
fied onshore but there is increasing exploration and mining activity in
the offshore areas of the belt.
E. SUPPLY
22.       Primary mine production, scrap, and U.S. Government stockpile
disposals are the sources of supply for tin. The International Tin Agree-
ments have had a significant influence on supply, and are discussed in
Chapter F below.
1.   Primary Production
23.       As indicated by the distribution of reserves, the main tin
concentrate producing countries are in South East Asia. With the exception
of Australia, all the important producers are in the developing world. In
addition to those countries shown in Table 3, Brazil, United Kingdom, South
Africa, Rwanda, Japan and Burma produce small quantities of tin.

24.    Malaysia has remained the dominant producer, although its share of
world output has declined over the past seven years. This trend is expected
to continue, in spite of offshore discoveries and opening of formerly reserved
lands, due to the gradual depletion of existing onshore reserves. Thailand,
Indonesia, Australia, Brazil and Burma are expected to continue to increase
their share of production. It is to be noted that statistics for 1975 show
some discrepancies since some tin concentrates moved to smelters under forged
certificates of origin. Much of this tin probably originated in Thailand. As
a result, the "others" category is inflated by some 4,000 tons.
25.    Mine production has shown only gradual growth over the last couple of
decades. The rate of growth from 1955 to 1974 was of the order of 1% per
annum. Since 1972, production has actually declined in response to imposi-
tion of export controls by the International Tin Council (ITC), lower grades
of ore, and higher mining and smelting costs.
26.    The pattern of tin trade has changed since the 1930's.  At that time,
most tin concentrates flowed to four smelters - in Malaysia, Indonesia,
Holland, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, tin production from
South-East Asia was unavailable to the free world. Additional smelting capacity
was constructed in the USA, Australia and Zaire. In addition, primary mine
production expanded considerably in such countries as Bolivia, Nigeria, and
Zaire.
27.    During the 1950's, the principal production centers shifted back to
South-East Asia. Additional smelting capacity was also added in South-East
Asia, while some was lost in Holland and the United Kingdom in the 1960's.
There are 38 primary tin smelters in the world, located in 22 countries, and
ranging from 500 to 60,000 tons of annual capacity. Excluding the centrally-
planned economies, the largest 13 smelters (Table 4) account for about 87% of
total estimated capacity of about 313,000 tons of refined tin. Despite the
significant excess of capacity, an expansion of the Mentok smelter in
Indonesia was completed in 1975 and further expansion is under way in Bolivia.
Indonesia now has the capability to smelt all of its mine output. The major
smelters listed below are all in ITC member countries.

share of refined metal production from 58% to 74%. Their share of mine
production declined slightly from 92% to 90%. The primary tin output by

2. Scrap
29.       Scrap represents a significant portion of tin supply.  In the
U.S., the country for which the most data is available, secondary metal
represents some 25% of total consumption, of which 60% is old scrap. Old
scrap therefore represents 15% of total consumption. Scrap recovery is
less well developed elsewhere in the world. It probably represents some
20% of total world consumption.
30.       Tin scrap is generally derived from the alloy uses of tin.  It
is usually reused as an alloy constitutent of solders, bearing metals, and
brass and bronzes. Only one-tenth is recycled as tin metal. While recovery
of tin from tinplate is technically feasible, it is presently uneconomic.
High prices for scrap steel or emergency conditions would be required to
warrant collection, transport and cleaning of used tin cans.
3. U.S. Government Stockpiles
31.       Because of the minimal tin production in the U.S., tin has been
designated a strategic material for stockpiling. As a result, substantial
quantities of various grades of tin metal were purchased up to 1955, when the
stockpile reached a peak of 354,000 metric tons. Other countries such as
Canada, Italy and the United Kingdom also accumulated small stockpiles during
this period.
32.       Subsequently, part of the U.S. stockpile was declared surplus,
and available for disposal. The General Services Administration (GSA), the
U.S. Government agency responsible for the stockpile, has since 1962 disposed
of about 143,900 tons (Table 6). These disposals have generally occurred
during periods of tin shortages, and usually in consultation with the ITC.
Disposal by commercial sales occurred from 1962 to 1968, and from mid-1973
onwards. The present U.S. stockpile is about 200,000 tons. U.S. disposals,
plus the large stock still held, obviously have had and can continue to have,
a damping effect on upward tin price movements.

F.   INTERNATIONAL TIN AGREEMENTS
33.    Tin is unique, not only amongst metals but equally amongst all
commodities in that the market is regulated by an international body of
producers and consumers which operates a system designed to limit the highest
and lowest prices reached on the market. Whilst commentators disagree on the
extent to which the International Tin Agreement is successful, it is probable
that the fall in prices for copper, lead, and zinc which accompanied the recent
world economic decline were lessened, in the case of tin, by buffer stock
manipulation. The results have been more marked than other, less cohesive,
producer price support actions and the Fifth InternaLiunal riin Agreement seeks
to improve the effectiveness of the Tin Council's monitoring activities.
34.    The Fifth International Tin Agreement, which came into force on July 1,
1976 and is in the process of being ratified by its member governments,
is the latest such market arrangement governing tin, with the history of
producer/consumer agreements and producer restraints and agreements going back
to 1930, following a drastic slide in the tin price in the late 1920's.  A
series of voluntary production restraints and producer agreements involving
the major producer nations evolved during the 1930's.  In the mid-thirties,
the first buffer stock was set up, and in the late thirties, consumer partici-
pation commenced on the International Tin Committee.  During and after World
War II, there were no real controls operating, and the First Post-War Tin
Agreement came into effect in 1956.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 11
35.       The objectives of the 1956 Agreement were:
i)   to prevent or alleviate unemployment, and other serious
difficulties resulting from imbalances between supply and
demand;
ii)   to prevent excessive price fluctuations, and to strive
for stability which would yield long-term supply/demand
equilibrium;
iii)   to ensure adequate supplies at reasonable prices;
iv)   to promote economic tin production and prevent uneconomic
use of tin resources.
36.       The provisions of the 1956 Agreement were:
i)   creation of an International Tin Council composed of
consuming and producing countries, both with equal votes;
ii)   development of an export control system among the producing
countries, with duration of controls and quantities of
exports to be decided by the Council;
iii)   creation of a buffer stock to stabilize prices by buying
and selling tin within price ranges established by the
Council;
iv)   initiation of concerted action in the event of a tin
shortage.
The First Tin Agreement contained many of the features tried in the earlier
tin agreements, but also removed some of the weaknesses of these agreements.
A buffer stock and export quotas were integral parts of the Agreement. Sub-
sequent agreements were negotiated and ratified covering the periods
1961 - 1966, 1966 - 1971, 1971 - 1976. While certain refinements were
incorporated into these agreements, the basic provisions and objectives
have remained unchanged. An example of the refinements was the giving
of authority to the buffer stock manager.
37.       With the Fifth Tin Agreement, covering the period 1976 - 1981,
the United States has joined for the first time. Under the Fourth Interna-
tional Tin Agreement (1971 - 1976) the Tin Council member-governments were as
follows:

France               Rep. of Korea         Yugoslavia
Neterlands
Both groups have 1,000 votes on the Council distributed in proportion to the
member country's volume of production or consumption respectively.
38.       By using its buffer stock, which is contributed on a compulsory
basis by producers, and on a voluntary basis by consumers, and, with the coopera-
tion of the producing countries' governments controlling exports, the world
tin price can be influenced in relation to the floor and ceiling prices set by
the Council. The Tin Council does not aim to control the market but rather to
reduce the amplitude of potentially violent price fluctuations.
39.       The ceiling price agreed in May, 1976 was M$1,200 per picul and the
floor price M$1,000 per picul. Buffer stock operating rules oblige the Buffer
Stock Manager, who is elected by the Council, to always sell tin when the
market price reaches the ceiling and always buy when it reaches the floor.
Within these price limits are three price sectors: Between M$1,200 and 1,135
the Manager may buy or sell but must always remain a net seller, between
M$1,065 and 1,135 may take no action, and between M$1,065 and 1,000 he
may buy or sell but must always remain a net buyer.
40.       Assessment of the success of the Tin Agreements depends on the
criteria used in the evaluation. In terms of the stated objectives of
the Agreement, it cannot be regarded as a total success. To the extent
that export controls are imposed on the producing countries, their foreign
exchange earnings are reduced at least for a time, since earnings are a
function of both price and volume. Unemployment also tends to be created.
On the other hand, while absolute price stability has not been achieved,
price fluctuations are probably less than for many other metals. Figure 1 on
page 16a shows past LME price movements in relation to the Penang floor and
ceiling prices used to quide the buffer stock operations.
41.       Some countries have, no doubt, benefited more than others.  High-
cost producers, such as Bolivia, have enjoyed greater stability than they
otherwise might have had. Since the ITC has generally succeeded in protecting
the floor price, more producers have been able to stay in operation. Drops in
prices would have had a greater effect on high-cost producers and would also have



ANNEX 3-1
Page 13
permitted fewer producers to stay in the market or return to it. It there-
fore seems probable that the high-cost producing countries' production would
have become lower over time without the price support mechanisms.
42.       It seems likely that a larger buffer stock capability would improve
performance, enabling the Buffer Stock Manager to intervene in the market
with larger quantities for more sustained periods. One aim of the Fifth Tin
Agreement is to increase the buffer stock by 20,000 tons through voluntary
contributions from consumers. The ITC has been reasonably successful in
protecting the floor price because it can impose export quotas. It has no
such measure at its disposal to protect the ceiling price. A larger buffer
stock would permit a greater, more prolonged effort. For this reason, it
would seem that the consuming nations have as much interest in a buffer stock
as the producers.
G. DEMAND

44.       As with most other metals, there is a correlation between the
rate of growth of a country's tin consumption, and the state of industrializa-
tion in the country. While declining in the U.K., tin consumption has been
virtually level in the U.S. and France for many years. In Japan, the annual
rate of growth averaged 7% through the 1960's, and, after a sharp rise in
1973, has moderated in a pattern similar to that exhibited in other developed
countries. On the other hand, the growth rate of consumption in such countries
as Brazil has been considerable.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 14
45.       Unlike most metals, the overall rate of growth in tin consumption
has been low, of the order of 1.3% over the past twenty years.  As an indus-
trial metal, and as noted above, tin is seldom used in its pure state but is
usually combined in various proportions with other metals.  The low growth has
therefore come partly because of substitution in products where tin is a
constituent, and partly because of more efficient use of tin. This trend is
expected to continue.
H.   TIN PRICES
1.   The Tin Market
46.       Tin is traded on the Penang Market, the London Metal Exchange (LME),
and the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX). Although the LME has been regarded
as the world market, the Penang Market has gained in importance in recent years.
One of the reasons is that Penang is strictly a physical market. The price
in Penang (quoted in Malaysian Dollars per picul) is determined daily by balanc-
ing the quantities of tin concentrates offered to the smelters against the bids
received for purchases of tin metal. Deliveries of purchased tin are made after
the concentrates have been smelted, usually within forty-five days of the sale.
The price therefore, is based on actual physical supply and demand.
47.       On the other hand, LME sales may be for immediate or future delivery.
As a result, many transactions are for the purpose of hedging. While hedging
plays a useful role in permitting consumers to protect their positions in
purchases of a commodity, speculation also results. The LME does play a
useful role in commodities trading since it reflects expectations for the
particular commodities and the world economic situation in general. However,
price fluctuations can be exaggerated.
48.       Some of the international trade is at Penang prices, and some at
the LME price (Pounds Sterling per metric ton). The LME price is usually
slightly higher than the Penang price, reflecting transportation costs,
although the difference fluctuates according to a number of factors,
including exchange rate variations, with the annual average differential
ranging from US$0.02 to US$0.16 per pound in recent years. LME price
quoations are for Standard Tin (99.75% tin), although High-grade tin
(99.85% tin) is also traded.
2.   Historical International Supply/Demand and Price Movements
49.       The latter part of the 1950's was characterized by the end of the
U.S. purchasing program for stockpiling purposes and by the existence of
the First International Tin Agreement under which severe export controls were
enforced for a relatively long period (15th December, 1957 to 30th September,
1960). As a result of export controls, which imposed an initial export
cutback of some 45%, world production dropped by about one-third, to some
120,000 tons in 1958 from about 175,000 tons in 1953 (the highest level for
the decade). Also, during the late 1950's, and despite the slump in the demand
for tin, the USSR sold substantial tonnages of tin in the Western market.
This had a depressive effect on the tin price.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 15
50.       Although 1960 was still a year of export control (January to Sep-
tember inclusive) tin production improved slightly from the low of 1958 due
to the more cooperative attitude of the USSR whose supplies of tin to the
market were curtailed dramatically. It took, however, more than a year for
production to regain the lost ground while the demand for tin was running
ahead of production. At the time, a great proportion of the deficit of
production was met by the substantial sales of tin metal from the U.S.
strategic stockpile and, to a lesser extent, by sales from the ITC buffer
stock and from the strategic stockpiles of Canada, Italy and the United
Kingdom.
51.            Tin production recovered in the second half of the 1960's.
The exceptionally high tin price which ruled during 1964 and 1965 stemmed
largely from the Malaysia-Indonesia confrontation and stimulated invest-
ments in the tin industry. As a result, a comparatively higher production
growth was experienced in the years 1967 and 1968 when mine output of tin-
in-concentrates rose from 174,200 tons to 184,100 tons (+ 5.7%). During
the late 1960's, however, the demand for tin was unable to maintain the
same rate of expansion as tin supplies, and a change occurred from a
production deficit to a position of surplus. This had a depressive effect
on prices and the ITC decided to enforce a mild form of export control for
five successive periods from September 1968 to the end of December 1969,
(initial cutback about 4%) which, together with purchases on buffer stock
account again strengthened the tin price.
52.       Export controls caused world production of tin-in-concentrates
to fall slightly in 1969 but it recovered in 1970 and 1971 to marginally
higher levels. In 1972 world output of tin-in-concentrates rose to 194,100
tons, which was the highest level for over a quarter of a century and showed
an increase of 4.1% on the previous year. Again, this had a depressive
effect on the price of tin and in 1973 the Council had to reintroduce export
control (although in a less severe form than on previous occasions), from
January to September, with a consequent drop in mine production to approxi-
mately the same level of two years earlier. The last quarter of 1973 was
free from export control and saw a series of events which later proved
to have far-reaching effects on the tin industry and particularly on tin
trading.
53.       The Arab-Israeli war in October 1973 ended with the oil crisis
which caused steep rises in the prices of all raw materials including
tin. In the same period, the liquidation of the Williams, Harvey smelter
in the United Kingdom had serious implications for the flow of tin; trade
channels between Bolivia and Europe were affected and the search for new
outlets for the Bolivian concentrates disrupted the regular flow of tin
metal into the market during a period in which the demand for tin was rising
at an unprecedented rate. Another important feature of this eventful period
was the resumption of major GSA commercial sales in June 1973.
54.       In 1973 consumption of primary tin metal reached a record level of
some 213,000 tons (21,400 tons, or 11% higher than consumption in 1972). This
was met by heavy sales from the ITC buffer stock (some 11,500 tons during



ANNEX 3-1
Page 16
1973) and from the surplus to the USA stockpile (over 20,000 tons) from June
to December 1973. The strong demand for tin in 1973 continued well into 1974
with consequent high Lin prices, particularly in the first half of the year
when tin values reached an all-time record of M$1,380/picul (US$3.72/lb.)
despite the large amount of tin (almost 22,000 tons) sold by the GSA during
January - June 1974.
55.       With the general world economic decline, the tin price declined
to average US$3.11 in 1975. During 1976, however, the price recovered sub-
stantially. The rise has been dramatic in Sterling terms, and reached an
all-time high in that currency, although the rise in dollar terms has been
less spectacular, reflecting the relative re-alignment of the two currencies.
56.       This increase in prices in the period 1973-74 represents in large
measure exceptional increases in energy and other operating costs. In real
terms, the price has shown a slight increase (approximately 1.5% per annum)
in the period 1960 - 1973. The rapid increases in production costs is also
reflected in the rapid increase in the ITC floor price. It has increased
from M$635 per picul in September 1973 to M$1,000 per picul in May 1976.
The ITC price ranges have been expressed in Malaysian Dollars since July 4,
1972.
57.       The increase in the LME price during 1976 can be partly attributed
to the recovery in world economic conditions and the consequent demand for
tin, and partly to hedging against the declining value of the Pound Sterling.
Export controls imposed on the producing countries in April 1975 by the ITC
helped to prevent a build-up of excessive stocks of tin, and also helped to
hold up the price. Annual average LME tin prices since 1961 are shown below.

ANNEX 3-1

I.   DEMAND/SUPPLY/PRICE OUTLOOK
1.   Demand
58.       Statistical analysis shows that the income elasticity of demand
for tin in developed countries is small -- of the order of 0.1 - 0.3 --
particularly if compared with that of other metals. Estimated price elastic-
ities of demand for tin are also low - around 0.2. Given the many subsitutute
materials for tin - aluminum, glass, paper, plastics, tin-free steel in
cans and containers, aluminum and copper base alloys in bronze and other
industrial uses - the statistical estimates are probably on the low side.
However, technological factors appear to play an important role in the sub-
stitution process.
58.       Consumption will continue to depend to a large extent on tinplate
for containers. In developed countries the container industry is expected to
continue growing steadily, but technological substitution in this industry
will probably allow only a modest growth in tin use. It is less likely,
however, that substitution will occur as rapidly in the developing and centrally
planned economies as in the developed countries. Changes in demand for tin in
bronze, brass, solder and other alloys are expected to be quite uniform
worldwide, but a more rapid increase in domestic demand is possible in develop-
ing countries. Tin's greatest potential for growth is in chemicals, but,
although the industry's forecasts of tin use in chemicals are very optimistic,
chemical uses account for only a small proportion of total tin consumption,
and thus the impact on world demand will only be slight.
60.       World demand for tin is projected to increase at only 1.5% per annum
between 1972-74 and 1985 (Table 9) and is expected to be below trend until the
end of the 1970's. The sharp increase in tin prices during 1973 and 1974 has
hurt tin consumption in developed countries, and full recovery is not expected
until the late 1970's and early 1980's, when the gradual price adjustment to
long-term trends will again stimulate demand growth.
2.   Supply
61.       World production of tin-in-concentrates is projected to grow at
about 1.0% per annum between 1972-1974 and 1980 (Table 9). Over the period,
however, growth is expected to be positive until the late 1970's in response
to the relatively high prices of the past three years. A fall in world pro-
duction of tin ore is projected in the mid-1980's in response to the fall
in real prices projected for the early 1980's. These projections assume that
overall production of tin ore will follow historical patterns in response
to price changes: mine production is expected to continue to react with
a certain lag to the movements in real prices.
3.   Price Outlook
62.       Price movements through 1985 should continue to reflect the
cyclical adjustment of consumption and production to market influences,
including the effect of ITC actions (Table 10).

63.       In the short term, the real price of tin is expected to continue to
be lower than its 1974 peak level. A modest increase is projected to take
place in 1977 and 1978 as world demand recovers from the 1974-75 slump.  An
over-supply could develop in the late 1970's with the response of production
to the price increase of 1973 and 1974, and tin prices - in constant 1976
dollars - could decline for a period, although the ITC's operations should
minimize the effect. During the 1980-85 period, prices are expected to move
upward in real terms, reflecting the lagged response of mine production to the
downward price movement in the late 1970's.
4.   Methodology
64.       The projections of demand, supply and prices are based on an econo-
metric model that relates: (a) mine production of tin to lagged prices and
lagged production; (b) consumption to lagged tin prices, the price of aluminum
and industrial production in OECD countries; and (c) tin prices to stocks and
the general inflation level in OECD countries.
65.       In making the forecasts, it was assumed that the United States'
strategic stockpile, which was reduced by 23,000 tons in 1974, will remain
unchanged thereafter. Some disposals from the U.S. stockpile, however, are
likely in the early 1980's when real tin prices are expected to increase
quite substantially. It is obviously impossible to speculate about future
U.S. stockpile disposals. One can expect that with the more direct participa-
tion of the U.S. Government in the workings of the International Tin Council,
a closer coordination between U.S. tin stockpile sales and ITC buffer stock
operations will evolve.

TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
THE TUNGSTEN MARKET
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        The unique properties of tungsten - a heavy, hard, heat resis-
tant metal, seem likely to ensure continued growth in its major applica-
tions. Substitution, even at increased prices, is not likely to modify
tungsten usage significantly. However, uncertain supply tends to restrict
expansion of tungsten use.
2.        The tungsten market is quite small, with world consumption of
the order of 40,000 tons per annum. Statistical data on such a market is
often inaccurate, and invariably incomplete. Although available data must
be treated with caution, it is possible to draw certain conclusions about
the future prospects for tungsten and likely price developments.
B. PROPERTIES
3.        Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metals: 3400 C,
three times that of copper and twice that of steel.  It is one of the
heaviest elements, about equal to gold. Above 1,650 C, tungsten outranks
all metals in tensile strength. In addition, tungsten has good corrosion
resistance, electrical and thermal conductivity, and a low thermal expan-
sion coefficient.
4.        Tungsten (chemical symbol: W) occurs in nature as wolframite-
(Fe. Mn) W04; Scheelite-CaWO4; and less commonly as Ferbeite-FeWO4; and
Heubenite-MnWO4. Tungsten is used in the form of metal powder, carbide
powder, ferrotungsten, and chemical compounds. A number of treatment
processes are employed to obtain the desired use form from the natural
mineral.  The treatment processes vary with the source mineral.  Initial
treatment usually involves concentration by gravity because of the miner-
al's high density.
C. USES
5.        Because of its desirable properties, tungsten is used in a num-
ber of rapidly expanding advanced technology industries. Detailed infor-
mation on use patterns is available only for the U.S., but can be con-
sidered indicative of uses elsewhere, except for steel, which in other parts
of the world, accounts for a somewhat larger part of the total consumption of
tungsten.

6.        The percent distribution of U.S. tungsten end use forms is as
follows:
Table 1: Tungsten End Use Forms
Uses                                         %

Chemicals                                          1

7.        Carbides are usually in the form of cemented tungsten carbide and,
to a lesser extent, cast tungsten carbide. Their largest uses are for cut-
ting edges on numerically controlled machine tools, and metal shaping and
forming dies in metal working machinery.  The high heat and wear resistance
of tungsten carbides makes it a preferred material in these applications.
Substantial advantages are also realized in the mining and construction in-
dustries through use of tungsten carbide inserts in rock bits. Other uses
of carbides include ball point pen tips and gas turbines. A market for
tungsten carbides which developed quickly in the 1960's was steel jacketed
tire studs with carbide centers. This market accounted for one third
of the tungsten consumed in transportation equipment or 6% of the total
tungsten consumption in the late 1960's. However the damage to road sur-
faces prompted most jurisdictions to outlaw tire studs. Only a minute
quantity of tungsten is consumed in studs today. Nonetheless, there are
no satisfactory substitutes for tungsten carbides. Only titanium carbide
and aluminum oxide have any comparable market acceptance.
8.        The second important use of tungsten is in alloy steels.  Hard-
ness at elevated temperatures is the important property of tungsten high
speed steels, and die and hot work steels. They are used primarily in the
working of metals by high speed drilling, cutting and shaping of metal.
Shock and wear resistant tungsten alloy steels are used in grader blades,
in rock crusher jaws, and in teeth for bucket and wheel excavators. High
temperature steels find application in rocket nozzles and other aerospace
equipment. Lesser quantities are used in high strength applications in auto-
motive and railroad equipment and ships. Molybdenum, to a large extent, is
substituted for tungsten in tool steels. Molybdenum forms the same type of
double carbide with iron and carbon as does tungsten. However, the molyb-
denum steels have a lower melting point, have 'Less red-hardness, and have a
tendency to decarburize.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 3
9.        The most visible use of tungsten metal is the filament in incan-
descent electric lamps. Although this use is well known and important, it
represents less than 6% of tungsten consumption. The filaments for more than
10 million lamps can be made from one ton of tungsten. Improved technology
has reduced filament thickness over time, and tungsten accounts for less than
0.1% of the average price of a light bulb. Although there is no satisfactory
substitute for tungsten in lamps, fluorescent lighting has reduced the import-
ance of this use over time.
10.       Tungsten metal, alone or in alloys with copper or silver, is used
in the manufacture of electrical contact points in electrical circuits.
Automotive electrical distributor points are small discs of pure tungsten
rod because of the metal's high wear resistance and adequate electrical con-
ductivity. An important application of the metal is in the manufacture of
electrical tubes, such as X-ray, transmitter, receiver and cathode ray tubes.
Tungsten wire is used to form cathodes for electron tubes. Tungsten rod is
used to heat cathodes in transmitter tubes. Tungsten rod is also used for
inert - arc welding of iron and steel, and other metals. The heavy weight of
tungsten is utilized in counter-weights and balances in the horizontal and
vertical stabilizers of aircraft.
11.       Non ferrous tungsten alloys are used where the desirable charac-
teristics of tungsten and another metal are required. For example, tungsten -
copper - silver alloys find application where high electrical conductivity
is needed. Contacts in telephones, business, electric clocks and remote
control devices are typical uses. Copper infiltrated tungsten is used in
power tubes.
12.       Tungsten chemicals are used in textile dyes, paints, enamels and
glass manufacture. Sodium tungstate is used for the manufacture of other
tungsten compounds for pigments, chemical analyses, and fireproofing textiles.
Tungsten trioxide, of bright yellow color, is used in oil and water colors.
Other tungsten compounds are luminescent and are used in luminescent pig-
ments in X-ray screens, television picture tubes and fluorescent lighting.
13.       The uses of tungsten are quite diverse.  In most applications,
other materials perform less satisfactorily. The cost of tungsten is
usually a minor item in these uses. As a result, substitution for tungsten
is not likely to be a significant factor in consumption patterns in the fore-
seeable future.
D. WORLD TUNGSTEN RESERVES
14.       Tungsten is commonly found in association with other metals, such
as tin, molybdenum, copper and bismuth. Most tungsten minerals occur in
quartz veins associated with siliceous granitic rocks. To a lesser extent,
tungsten minerals are found in contact metamorphic deposits at or near the
contact of limestone and granite intrusives. Other production has also come
from replacement deposits and pegmatites, and from weathered surface deposits
and placer deposits. The grade of tungsten in these deposits ranges from
0.6% to 2.0%.

15.       The principal known reserves in the World, in terms of contained
metal, are:

16.       These reserves were estimated at the price prevailing in 1976.
The price has increased over the past few years in real terms, and therefore
the amount of reserves has increased. The relative distribution of reserves
has remained about the same.
17.       Other countries with known reserves of tungsten include Mexico,
Peru, and Argentina in the Americas; Australia, Thailand, Burma, Laos, and
Vietnam in South East Asia and the Pacific; and Portugal, France and the
United Kingdom in Western Europe. Centrally planned economies have about
70% of the world's known tungsten reserves.
E. SUPPLY-PAST AND FUTURE
18.       Primary mine production, sales from U.S. Government stockpiles,
and scrap are the sources of supply for tungsten.
1.   Primary mine production
19.       Mainland China, with its substantial reserves, is the world's
largest producer and exporter. The dearth of statistics available to the
world on production from China, and also North Korea make it difficult to
assess the supply position.



ANNEX 3-2

20.       Geographical distribution of mine production is shown in Table 3
below.

Source: USBM.
21.       Mainland China's production is estimated to be of the order of
9,000 metric tons per year. North Korea's production is probably some 2,200
metric tons per year. The remaining Centrally planned eonomies have been net
importers of concentrates in recent years although their production represents
20% of world supply. As described in paragraph 25 below, China has joined
discussions with other producing countries as a participant in recent years.
The result may be that increased information on Chinese production becomes
available. More importantly, China's exports may be more closely controlled,
as they have been in the past year, to help stabilize prices.
22.       In any event, Western world primary mine production together with
imports from China, have not been sufficient to meet demand in recent years.
Demand includes net exports to the other centrally planned economies. The
shortfall has, in large measure, been met by sales from the U.S. Government
stockpile. In such an environment, any fluctuations in supply from China have
a major impact on prices. Such fluctuations have commonly occurred in the past.
23.       Primary mine production is expected to increase over the next
few years. The current high level of prices can be expected to favorably
influence development decisions for deposits in a number of countries.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 6
2.   Scrap
24.       As with most metals, scrap supply is generated from new scrap in the
fabrication process, and old scrap from end uses. Data on new scrap is
virtually unavailable while it is incomplete on old scrap. In any event,
tungsten obtained from old scrap is believed to be a significant part of
supply; probably of the order of 15%.
25.       In most cases, new scrap from alloy steels and tool steels is
re-used directly without separation of the constituent elements. Tungsten
metal is usually re-cycled to metal processing plants. Supply of new scrap
is reasonably well organized and represents a consistent, accountable factor.
26.       The more significant factor is the supply of old scrap, since the
volume is price sensitive. Tungsten carbide collection from metal shaping,
cutting tools and rock bits is well organized. However low prices render
re-cycling from all but the larger consumers unprofitable. Conversely, high
prices spur expedition of tungsten carbide to those plants set up to treat
this material. Another source of old scrap is tungsten rod discards from
inert-arc welding.
3.   U.S. Government Stockpiles
27.       Sales from U.S. Government stockpiles, however imperfectly, have
served to give some measure of stability to the tungsten market since the
early 1960's. This has been more true in recent years when the GSA has
limited sales below world price levels.
28.       With the formation of U.S. Government stockpiles in the early
1950's, tungsten was considered a strategic and critical material because
of its use in tools of production, in nuclear and space equipment compo-
nents, and military applications. The U.S. Government built up a large
inventory of tungsten in various forms during that period. Subsequently,
changes in U.S. Government policy led to disposal of these stockpiles since
the late 1950's. The U.S. stockpiles as of the end of 1975 held some 50,000
tons of tungsten. Actual disposals from the U.S. Government stockpiles are
presented in Table 4 below.

29.       Disposals from the U.S. Government stockpiles have helped, in large
measure, to fill the supply gap in the Western World. Since 1970, there has
been a negative net balance between production and consumption, even with GSA
disposals. The disposals have not been without criticism from both consumers
and producers, particularly in 1975. However, it would seem that the disposals
have served a useful purpose in that they have helped to meet the supply gap
which otherwise would have resulted.
F.   PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION
30.       In 1963, Bolivia and South Korea asked the United Nations to take
measures in stabilizing tungsten prices after a sharp drop in prices had
resulted when China released large quantities into the market.  An ad hoc
committee under the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
was formed as a result.  The ad hoc committee and its working group, however,
served principally as a forum for discussion.
31.       In 1974, new pressures were exerted to catalyze action on price
stabilization. The UNCTAD working group in its August 1974 meeting in Geneva,
re-affirmed the need to improve the quality and volume of information on
tungsten. Among other things, the group sought a comprehensive survey of the
actual prices at which tungsten was traded. These proposals were submitted to
the ad hoc committee at the November 1974 UNCTAD meeting on commodities. Peru
and Bolivia led the developing nations in pressing for affirmative action on
the proposals. China, for the first time, attended the meeting as a participant.
32.       In April 1975, parallel meetings of major producing companies,
and government representatives of producing countries were held in La Paz,
Bolivia. The producing companies formed the Primary Tungsten Association
(PTA). Founding members included Mineroperu, Beralt Tin and Wolfram of
Portugal, Peko-Wallsend of Australia, the Societe Miniere d'Anglade of
France, and Comibol and private sector companies of Bolivia. China was
a participant in the government meetings convened by Bolivia.
33.       Tentative agreement was reached by the PTA to set upper and lower
limits of respectively E 45 and L 35 per metric ton unit of 65% minimum W03
tungsten concentrate, but this has had little or no effect. A headquarters
for the PTA was also established in London.
34.       The price limits were submitted to the Tungsten Committee of the
UNCTAD on which 29 producing and consuming countries are represented. While
tentative agreement was reportedly reached on establishment of price limits,
a decision was made to postpone substantive discussions until 1976. This
decision was made to give time to resolve the technical problems.
35.       These problems revolve mainly around the fact that tungsten
is not traded as a homogeneous product. For this reason the Committee con-
cluded that a buffer stock would be impractical. It was also felt that there
would have to be an agreed price relationship between all the forms in which



ANNEX 3-2
Page 8
tungsten is traded; concentrates and ferrotungsten, for example. The price
quotation to be used also raised difficulties. Further meetings took place
in Geneva in November, 1976, but again disparate views were voiced and no
agreement was reached. Whether progress can be made on these problems remains
to be seen.
36.       In general, many consumer nations seem to be moving away from
resistance to commodity price stabilization agreements. Such an agreement,
in the case of tungsten, could result in a rather unique combination of
market economy and centrally planned economies. This would be essential to
have an effective agreement.
G.   CONSUMPTION AND DEMAND
37.       Demand for tungsten is closely linked to levels of activity in the
steel and machine tool industries, which are, in turn, linked closely to
economic activity in the industrialized countries. The U.S. is the major
consumer in the free world, while the USSR consumes only a slightly smaller
amount. Table 5 shows the geographical distribution of consumption in market
economy countries, including net exports to centrally planned economies.
Table 5: Tungsten Consumption in Market Economy Countries
(metric tons of contained metal)

Total                 10,950   29,210   28,980   22,180
Sources: USBM, UNCTAD.
38.       Consumption in market economy countries has grown at a rate of 4%
per year from 1966 to 1974. A decline of 23% in 1975 resulted from the major
economic recession in the Western World. The substantial variation in yearly
consumption reflects the close correlation between tungsten demand and economic
activity.
39.       Demand is expected to recover over the next couple of years.
After 1977, annual growth in demand is expected to be of the order of 4%.
H.   PRICE
40.       Primary tungsten concentrate production is commonly sold in pounds
sterling per metric ton unit (mtu) of 65% W03 content. U.S. market prices



ANNEX 3-2
Page 9
are quoted in U.S. dollars per short ton unit (stu) 65% W03 content.  A ton
unit is one hundredth of a ton.  Therefore, the approximate value of a ton of
ore or concentrate is obtained by multiplying the price by the percent W03
content (or grade).
41.       International trade, including Burma's production, is often on the
basis of prices quoted in the London Metal Bulletin (LMB). The LMB quota-
tion is based on surveys of representative sales usually through metal trad-
ing companies. The LMB quotation is presented as a range, with the high
and low prices usually US$2 to 5 apart.
42.       There are no universally accepted or standard specifications for
tungsten concentrates. The 65% W03 content does serve as a reference point.
Particular sales or contracts will generally establish the price basis after
negotiation. Desirable concentrates -- high grade and with low impurities --
will command a price at the high end of the range, or even at a premium over
the high end of the LMB quotation. On the other hand, lower grade concen-
trade with high impurities will only sell at a discount to the low end of
the price range.
43.       Prices historically have shown erratic and rather violent move-
ments. Fluctuations of 100% or more in a year have not been uncommon. Past
prices, stated in terms of averages of the midpoints of the LMB quotation, are
shown in Table 6 below.
Table 6:  Average Tungsten Prices
Year                            Price
(US$ per mtu)
1967                            49.60
1968                            43.00
1969                            47.40
1970                            74.30
1971                            50.70
1972                            35.90
1973                            41.80
1974                            92.50
1975                            91.30
1976                           102.00
44.       Although current prices increased substantially in 1974, they
started from a rather depressed base. In real terms, the average price
in 1974 was less than the price in 1970, and equivalent to or only slightly
higher than prices in 1967 - 1969.
45.       After reaching a high of US$118 in September 1974, prices (in
current terms) declined to US$88 at the end of 1974. In the first six months
of 1975, prices recovered somewhat and fluctuated from US$90 to US$100.
However, they dropped to US$85 in July. After recovering somewhat in August,
prices remained level at US$86 to 88 through the end of 1975.

46.       With high prices and poor economic outlook in the latter part of
1974, tungsten concentrate consumers decreased their inventory levels. With
this modest decrease in demand, China sharply reduced exports in early 1975,
which resulted in an improvement in prices. However, demand continued to
decline during this period and remained low throughout the year. rhe rel-
atively stable prices in the latter part of 1975 can be attributed to a low
level of supply, a high level of sales to Eastern Europe, and a low level of
inventories.
H. OUTLOOK
47.       With recovery in economic activity in 1976, tungsten demand
recovered. As a result, prices averaged over US$100 per MTU during 1976,
ranging up to about US$140 late in the year.
48.       As noted above, from 1977 onward, growth in tungsten demand is
expected to average 4% per annum. As indicated in the section on tungsten
uses, the outlook is quite favorable and substitution is not expected to be a
major factor.  As in the past, supply is more likely to be an inhibition to
growth than demand.
49.       Price projections are shown in Table 7 below:

50.       The prospects of increased Chinese cooperation with other producers
look favorable, and have already serve to attenuate the violent price fluctua-
tions of the past. Implicit in the above prices is the assumption that sales
from U.S. Government stockpiles will reflect, at least to some extent, the
market requirements. The price projections represent a trend line. Fluctua-
tions around the trend line must be expected.

BURMA
TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
NO. 2 MINING CORPORATION:
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.        The No. 2 Mining Corporation (MC2) presently produces approximately
1,500 LTPY of tin, tungsten and mixed tin/tungsten concentrates. Ore is mined
in two principal regions of the country (Map IBRD 12322).
(a) Tenasserim Division
This area in the extreme south-eastern part of Burma produces
around 1,000 LTPY of tin, tungsten and tin/tungsten concentrates.
Operating units comprise a few small MC2 mines and a multitude
of tribute operations.
(b) Mawchi and Pyinmana Area
Both Pyinmana and Mawchi are separate tin/tungsten centers
lying north and north-east of Rangoon respectively. This
area produces around 500 LTPY of tin/tungsten mixed concen-
trates, almost all of which come from tribute operations.
2.        In both the Tenasserim and Mawchi/Pyinmana regions, the quantity
and quality of the reserves remaining to be worked have, in most cases,
not been thoroughly proved and prospecting records are incomplete. The
assessment of ore sources conducted by the consultants, Osborne and Chappel,
is therefore based partly on such historic information as is available and
on verbal advice from MC2 officials. While this situation is not entirely
satisfactory, the statements recorded are considered a realistic assessment,
particularly in view of Burma's history as a major tin/tungsten producer and
the multitude of operating units, both big and small, which are known to have
existed in the past. In this respect, it should be noted that current produc-
tion levels are only 10% of those recorded some 40 years ago.
3.        A summary of estimated ore reserves and current production levels
at MC2's various mining centers is given in Table 1 below. More detailed
information on historical production is provided in Annex 4-2, page 3.

ANNEX 4-1
Page 3
4.        Overall, MC2 operates 7 mines and 8 small concentrators, with
associated facilities such as warehouses and workshops. However, over 75%
of the concentrates produced are from ores purchased from independent tribute
miners, who work individually or in small groups under the loose supervision
of Corporation staff. The tributors upgrade their production on site to
about 65% tin-ore/wolfram content by rudimentary means, with MC2's various
mines acting as purchasing and storage depots for tributor production. A
description of MC2's mining and concentrating operations is given in Sections
B and C below.
B.   MINING OPERATIONS
1.   Heinda Mine
5.        Background:  Operations at this locality commenced in 1926 and have
continued uninterrupted to the present day. In 1955, the original expatriate
mining company joined with the Burmese Government to form the Anglo-Burma
Company Limited. In 1963, the company was entirely bought out by the Govern-
ment.
6.        Mineral production is almost entirely tin at an average of 72%
Sn. Mineralisation occurs in the form of an alluvial placer deposit, the
average grade of the reserves having been assessed at 0.69 kg/cu.m. A West
German team (Grundstoffberatung E.V.) carried out studies on the Heinda
mine between August and October 1970. The statement of reserves shown in
Table I is based on the German estimate updated to account for ground worked
in the intervening period and adjusted for metallurgical recovery.
7.        Existing Facilities:  Currently, MC2 conducts mining operations
utilising ground sluicing methods with the final recovery being achieved by
hand cleaning in palongs. Pre-blasting of selected ground is undertaken prior
to ground sluicing by monitors. Palong concentrates are upgraded in a separ-
ate treatment plant possessing a shaking table, screen, one magnetic separator
and several lanchutes. Equipment is generally in fair to good operating
condition. The grade of the final concentrate is in the order of 72% Sn and no
further upgrading is carried out in Tavoy, the concentrate being shipped to
Rangoon for sale.
8.        Future Development:  A new mining system is presently being imple-
mented (with start-up scheduled for early 1977) based on a Federal Republic of
Germany survey, utilizing open pit methods and earthmoving equipment. The
foreign exchange costs of the project (US$8.9 million of total project cost of
US$12.9 million) are being financed by a KfW credit and German technical aid.
Pre-blasting will continue with the new system but hydraulic mining methods
will be terminated. The open pit has been designed to utilize benches of 7.5
meters and the spoil will be hauled by eleven 18-ton dump trucks to the
central mill; loading will be by front-end loaders.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
9.        A new concentrating mill is also being constructed, with Krupp
of West Germany supervising the work. This new mill will treat run-of-mine
ore using trommel washers and vibrating screens for disintegration and sizing,
hammer-mills for reduction of oversize, jigs for primary concentration and
shaking tables for secondary clean-up. The final concentrate will be produced
with limited secondary stage concentration equipment after magnetic separation
of the table concentrates. The designed capacity of the new mill is 600
tons/hour. Production from the new facilities is projected to be 1000 LTPY of
tin concentrates, an increase of about 800 LTPY over present output.
10.       Although Krupp claims the new mill will produce a final concentrate
assaying 72% Sn minimum with a recovery of 90%, Osborne and Chappel feel
that the attainment of a high grade for the final concentrate without unaccep-
table losses is likely to present problems with the proposed flowsheet and
equipment currently being installed. Such problems would be overcome by
the installation of additional equipment, or by final stage-upgrading at
the Tavoy concentrator to be built in association with the proposed IDA
project.
2.   Hermyingyi Mine
11.       Background:  Operations, which included both underground and open
pit working, were conducted by an expatriate mining company from 1913 to 1943.
Between 1946 and 1962, only tribute operations took place because most of the
original machinery was destroyed during the war. In 1966, the Mineral Develop-
ment Corporation took over operational control of the mine which was fully
nationalized in 1971.
12.       Mineralization is associated with a primary deposit occuring as
numerous veins in the rock together with the occurrence of quartz veins. A
survey of reserves was undertaken by Mineral Development Corporation geologists
between 1966 and 1970. The results of the survey, however, were considered to
be far too optimistic and, with Federal German aid, the work is currently
being undertaken once more. The full results of this survey have yet to be
published. What is conclusive, however, is that the rich reserves have been
almost exhausted and only large tonnage methods of working the remaining lower
grades will enable the mine to be viable. The figures quoted in Table 1 for
Hermyingyi reserves are those contained in the preliminary report of the
Germany study team.
13.       Existing Facilities:  Current working methods are conducted entirely
by tributors, using adit methods and shallow pitting of surface deposits.
Facilities comprise only a lanchute and drier. All tributors' production is
sent to Tavoy for separation of wolfram-ore from tin-ore. The tributors
themselves upgrade mine production to 65% wolfram-ore/tin-ore content by
panning and sluicing. Raw ore is crushed by sledge hammer and manual grinding
is effected by rolling a cement filled steel pipe over a curved metal sheet.
As no facilities exist in Tavoy for wet separation, various non-magnetic
and middlings fractions from the magnetic separators are returned to Hermyingyi
for fuirther washing.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 5
14.       Future Development:  Following development work by both the MDC
and the German consultants over the last three years, proposals are being
compiled for a further study into exploiting the underground reserves on a
large scale. Based on the preliminary exploration and survey of ore reserves,
expansion potential has been assessed at 500 tons per annum each of tin and
tungsten. Conceivably, a mine could be on-stream by the early to mid-1980's.
This deposit would be worked directly by MC2 although current tribute opera-
tions would still continue simultaneously at their present level on a portion
of the reserves. Ore from an expansion project at the mine could be easily
upgraded at the proposed new Tavoy concentrator.
3.   Kanbauk Mines
15.       Background:  Mining operations date back to 1911 when they were
started by an expatriate mining company and continued as such until 1926.
After this date, local companies participated in the mining venture until it
was nationalized in 1971. In 1974, following the completion of a UNDP-
assisted exploration program, a gravel pump mine was established at Kanbank
with UNDP assistance and equipment. The UNDP facilities were handed over to
MC2 in February 1975.
16.       Tin, tungsten and a mixed ore concentrate comprise the minerals
produced, which occur in alluvial placer deposits and as a primary minerali-
zation in veins in the surrounding rock. Between 1967 and 1972, the MDC
carried out a pitting and boring program over approximately 2,000 hectares in
the vicinity of Kanbauk Mines. Based on this exploration work, reserves were
calculated. A subjective assessment of the recoverable ore content remaining
in these reserves was done by Osborne & Chappel in 1975 and is the basis for
the figures in Table 1.
17.       Existing Facilities:  MC2 conducts hydraulic gravel pump operations
in the alluvial deposits, while tribute operations are confined to the primary
lode mineralization. Some primitive ground sluicing operations are conducted
by tributors during the wet season.
18.       There are two upgrading plants at Kanbauk Mines.  One, which after
trials has never been used, was constructed by the UNDP at the time they
developed a third opencast mine on the Kanbauk reserves. The ex-UNDP plant
has shaking tables for primary concentration with clean-up by lanchutes.
Middlings containing refractory and magnetic minerals are to be separated in a
dry section comprising magnetic and H.T. separators. All equipment is new,
and had not as yet been used by MC2 due to a shortage of equipment for the
water supply connection and some deterioration in supervisory control follow-
ing the departure of UNDP personnel. The other plant treats primary palong
concentrates from the three opencast pits, including the ex-UNDP mine, and
also carries out, from time to time, some upgrading of the wolfram-ore produced
by tributers in the Kanbauk area. Apart from magnetic separation, where
equipment is in poor condition and very antiquated, concentration in this
plant is by manual methods. All the primary concentrates from MC2's own
operations are upgraded to selling grade in this plant. Tributors' production
consisting mostly of wolfram-ore is usually upgraded at Tavoy before shipment
.to Rangoon.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
19.       Future Development:  Since the Kanbauk Mines are less than 10
kilometers from the proposed shore complex for the Heinze Basin dredging
project, the most reliable method of improving these mining operations would
be by complete integration of Kanbauk operations with those of the Heinze
Basin project. This would result in immediate improvement in infrastructure,
transportation, communication, workshop and mineral dressing facilities, and
labor skills, together with supervision by trained management from a strong
base. The concentrating facilities proposed for Heinze would be used to
upgrade the rough concentrates from the palongs at Kanbauk mines. Integration
of Kanbauk mines with the Heinze Basin complex is further discussed in Annex
5-1.
4.   Kyaukmedaung Mine
20.       Background:  Intensive mining operations took place at this locality
prior to the last war when three bucket ladder dredges were in operation.
Dredging ceased in 1973 on apparent exhaustion of viable reserves. In February
1972, it was decided to attempt gravel pump methods of mining and these have
continued since that date. Mineral production consists of tin-ore occurring
as an alluvial deposit. No information is available on the extent or grade of
remaining reserves.
21.       Existing Facilities:  Production is obtained from MC2 gravel pump
operations and tributors. The MC2 mine consists of one pumping unit, ground
cutting being effected by monitors. Tribute operations, such as ground
sluicing, take place in the alluvial deposit as well as tunnels and adits in
primary deposits occurring in the neighbouring hills. These operations
produce tin and mixed tin/tungsten concentrates. Since no mechanized equipment
is available, processing of MC2's gravel-pump mine palong concentrates and
tributors' production consists solely of lanchute washing and drying. Final
separation is carried out in Tavoy.
5.   Nanthilar Mine
22.       Background:  Small scale operations have taken place at this locality
for some years, and in 1970 the mine came under the jurisdiction of the
Mineral Development Corporation. Mineral production consists entirely of tin
occurring as a primary deposit associated with iron and copper sulphides. The
deposit consists of widely irregular veins and lenses. One assessment of
workable reserves was attempted when approximately 600 feet of exploration
tunnels were driven. This survey, however, was inconclusive and MC2 proposes
conducting an extensive review of reserves in the near future. Production
will be temporarily halted while the deposit is being further investigated.
23.       Existing Facilities:  Current production is confined to one MC2-
operated mine utilizing adits and drifts from the surface. The ore is roasted
to remove pyrite. There are no records of equipment installed, and further
processing is apparently entirely manual.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 7
6.   Yadanabon Mine
24.       Background:  The mine commenced operations in the early 1950's and
was eventually taken over by the Burmese Government in 1954. Mineralisation
occurs as an alluvial placer deposit with wolfram, the main ore, being assoc-
iated with bismuthinite, monazite and pyrite. Ore reserves are not known and
have not yet been assessed.
25.       Existing Facilities:  There are three actual working sites utilizing
conventional gravel pump methods, working in conjunction with palongs. Pre-
blasting is resorted to in exceptionally hard ground which is then cut by
monitors. The treatment plant contains a shaking table, magnetic separator
and vibrating screen. Due to its remote location the plant was not visited by
Osborne and Chappel and no comment can be made on the condition of its equipment.
7.   Heinze Basin
26.       A UNDP study team carried out a comprehensive boring program over
the whole area between 1971 and 1974 and the reserves were valued in the
subsequent feasibility study carried out by Osborne & Chappel in 1975. Detailed
information on the proposed project for the Heinze Basin is given in Annex
5-1.
8.   Mawchi Mine
27.       Background:  Production at this mine commenced in 1915, and in the
pre-war period it was one of the world's largest primary lode producers of
tungsten. In 1939, production reached over 3,000 LTPY of tin concentrates and
over 2,700 LTPY of tungsten concentrates. The mine operated throughout
the Japanese occupation, but production ceased altogether in 1949. In
1963, the Government established a joint venture company with the original
owners and took over operational control. Administration eventually passed to
the Mineral Development Corporation in 1962.
28.       Mineralization is associated with black mica, tourmaline, calcite
and quartz veins. Cassiterite, wolfram and scheelite are the chief ores
produced. There are numerous mineral veins--70 separate veins have been
identified. The reserves remaining in the Mawchi Mine were assessed by
a team from the USSR between 1969 and 1974. The ore presently being worked
by the tributors, from whom almost all current production is now derived,
is recovered from the vicinity of the old Mawchi Mine. Such production
is thus outside the stated reserves given in Table 1.
29.       Existing Facilities:  Current production is obtained largely from
tribute operations. Conventional underground methods are utilised using
shrinkage stopes in the extraction process. Because of the security situa-
tion, it was not possible for Osborne & Chappel or IDA staff to vist Mawchi,
and no detailed comments are available on the concentrating facilities at the
mine site or on the condition of installed plant. However, from discussion



ANNEX 4-1
Page 8
with MC2 officials, it was ascertained that a large mill was built at the
mine before World War II. This mill incorporated gravity and flotation
circuits for the production of bulk mixed concentrates. Apparently, no
magnetic or high tension separation facilities ever existed, and mixed con-
centrates of cassiterite, wolfram and scheelite components are sold without
further treatment.
30.       Future Development:  A Soviet technical aid mission commenced
investigations in 1969 to assess the feasibility of a full scale rehabilita-
tion program and to recalculate ore reserves. Due to insurgency problems,
this aid program was terminated in January 1974 and the program of rehabilita-
tion temporarily suspended. The proposed rehabilitation program envisaged a
total output of 1,000 tons per annum, 500 tons from the mine and 500 tons from
tribute operations. It further envisaged the progressive replacement of
some existing equipment such as crushers, hydrosizers, ventilation equipment,
battery locomotives and mine cars and an immediate upgrading of the hydro-
electric plant with the installation of new turbines, generators and trans-
formers. Mlore experienced technicians were also called for and it was sugges-
ted that the existing mill equipment needed immediate replacement. This
program could be resumed if insurgency problems were brought under control
and new financing found. While the timing of this is uncertain, the Corporation
is hopeful, and there have been recent indications that the security situation
may be improving.
9.   Miscellaneous Gravel Pump Reserves
31.       A multitude of small operations were carried out in the past,
but only a few of these are currently in operation. From historic records,
MC2 have tentatively identified about six separate accessible areas where
mining could commence using vertical gravel pumps. It is believed that there
are sufficient reserves for ten pumps to be installed and that these would
give a total annual production of 500 tons of tin-ore and/or wolfram. The
total reserves were assessed at 17,000 tons (Table 1). While Osborne &
Chappel were unable to substantiate these figures, there is no reason to doubt
that MC2's report fairly reflects the potential of these reserves. A limited
start to recommencing gravel pump operations at one or two of these potential
sites forms part of the proposed project (Annex 5-1).
10. Offshore Areas
32.       An offshore exploration project is currently in progress in the
Mergui Area. This has a good chance of success, as the prospecting area
is a logical extension of tin-bearing areas worked in Thailand. Osborne &
Chappel consider this project, which is UNDP financed, well-conceived and
success would add a new source of ore and provide a logical extension to the
Heinze Project, as the area of likely mineable deposits are at moderate depths
in sheltered areas. It will probably be at least late 1977 before first
indications of potential are known, although sonar soundings have identified
promising areas.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 9
C.   CONCENTRATING FACILITIES
1.   Facilities at the Mine Sites
33.       As described in the previous section, existing tin/tungsten concen-
trating facilities at the mine sites are generally primitive with only a
minimum of mechanization. Equipment is antiquated and often in poor running
order. The only new equipment available is that installed under a UNDP
project at Kanbauk (para. 18).
34.       The equipment installed in existing plants consists of a variety
of driers, vibrating screens, magnetic separators, shaking tables and various
crushing machines. MC2 presently uses only three shaking tables throughout
the Tenasserim Division and nearly all gravity separation is performed manually
in palongs, lanchutes or by panning. No attempt is made to remove sulphide
contaminants or refractory minerals from the concentrates, except possibly at
Nanthilar, where the flowhseet indicates the presence of a roaster for sulphide
removal. With regard to the Mawchi ores, no attempt is made to split the
mixed concentrates into tin and tungsten, and only the more penal contaminants
are removed.
35.       The tributors upgrade their production on site to a minimum of
65% tin-ore/wolfram content by rudimentary means. MC2's various mine treatment
plants act as purchasing and storage depots for tributors' production which is
further upgraded at facilities at the mines or in Tavoy.
2.   Other Concentrating Facilities
36.       Tavoy Separation Plants:  In addition to the concentrating facilities
at the various mines, there are two up-grading plants in Tavoy which are used
to separate wolfram from cassiterite in the bulk concentrates produced by
various mines in both the Tavoy and Mergui areas. Both plants are only
concerned with magnetic separation of wolfram-ore and other magnetic impurities
from tin-ore. Feed to the separators is prepared using vibrating screens and
roll crushers when required. No gravity separation facilities are available
at either plant and all processing is carried out dry. Equipment at both
plants is very old (1930's vintage) and in poor operating condition. Combined
average throughput is 46 tons/month.
37.       Rangoon Separation Plant:  This plant treats Upper Burma concentrates
and, occasionally, concentrates from Mergui. Equipment is in poor condition.
Plant capacity is given as 25 tons/month, but it is used sporadically.
3.   Future Developments
38.       Due to antiquated and inefficient concentrating equipment, it is
not possible for MC2 to realize the full value of the ores currently produced.
No financially viable case can be made for improving existing concentrating
facilities at the mine sites, or those at Tavoy and Rangoon. As a result, the



ANNEX 4-1
Page 10
proposed IDA project includes a new centralized concentrator at Tavoy to treat
all of MC2's production of tin, tungsten, and mixed concentrates. This is
described in detail in Annex 5-1.
D.   TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES
1.   Tenasserim Division
39.       Tavoy (population 40,000) is one of the largest towns in the Tenas-
serim Division and is considered the commercial center of the area. It is
also the administrative center of the Division.
40.       Both the Kanbauk/Heinze and the Heinda/Kyaukmedaung/Hermyingyi
areas are connected to Tavoy by road, part sealed and part dirt. The condi-
tion of these roads is poor in places and, in the wet season, sections become
impassable for several days at a time due to flooding. Bridge loadings are
generally restricted to 3 to 5 tons on roads in the Tavoy area with the
exception of the bridges on the Tavoy to Heinda road where maximum permissible
loads may reach 10 tons. Washed concentrates from the Kanbauk, Hermyingyi,
Heinda, and Kyaukmedaung areas are delivered to Tavoy by local bus. Delays
are frequent due to the necessity of organising a military escort for security
reasons. From Tavoy, concentrates are delivered to Rangoon by boat.
41.       Connections between Tenasserim/Yadanabon and Tavoy are by sea, or
by sea to Mergui and then by tar-sealed road to Tavoy. MC2 utilizes its
own schooner for collection of concentrates from Yadanabon. From here,
concentrates are sent to either Tavoy or Rangoon for upgrading.
2.   Mawchi/Pyinmana Area
42.       Pyinmana lies on the main Rangoon-Mandalay railroad in the Sittang
River valley 350 kms north of Rangoon. The town is utilised as a local
administrative center by MC2 for the collection of tribute ores. To the
south-east, at a distance of 160 kms, lies the mining center of Mawchi, a
small town lying just to the west of the Salween River valley.
43.       Pyinmana is well served by both rail and road communication, and
lies astride the main north-south rail and road links between Rangoon and
Upper Burma. There are little or no restrictions on the type of vehicles
utilizing the road, the condition of which is generally good throughout
the year. Rail connections are also excellent. Communications between
Mawchi and Rangoon are difficult only because of the security situation.
The area is well served by a tar-sealed road. At present, the connection
between Rangoon and Mawchi is accomplished by a circuitous road/rail route,
adding a further 500 kms to the journey.

1/ Six months.
2/ Up until 1975, MC2 accounted for sales on the basis of actual shipments adjusted for the net realizable value
of changes in inventory during the year. Gross revenues thus represent the net realizable value of annual
production. For 1976, gross revenues equal actual shipments with inventories being valued at cost of production.
3/ Sales deductions are made up of NEIC commission (2 1/2% of sales), treatment charges (normally 2% to 4% of sales
depending on the quality of shipments), and freight charges (about 1% to 2% of sales). In 1973 end 1974, bank
commissions were also charged (amounting up to 15% of sales). This practice has now been discontinued.
4/ Opening inventories for FT 1976 are valued at net realizable value. Closing inventories are valued at average
cost of production during the year. The change in the inventory valuation method had only a small impact on
1976 profits since the net realizable value per ton used to value opening inventories was only marginally above
the relevant production costs per ton for those inventories.
5/ Part of MC21s operating costs relating to the Mawchi Mine are deferred and capitalized. Because of insurgency
activity and suspension of the rehabilitation program, 1SC2's present production from the Mawchi Mine is limited.
Thus the cost of keeping the mine open for future development is deferred.
6/ MC2 first became liable for income taxes in 1973 when corporate tax rates were the same as those on personal
income. The tax rate was reduced to 50% in 1974-76.
7/ Excludes intangible assets (deferred expenses end goodwill) and assets under construction.

21 Tungsten price is the weighted average of prices of all purchases made by a group of European tungsten
carbide manufacturers as reported in the London Metal Bulletin.
LTU = one hundredth of a long ton or 22.4 lbs.
}/ Revenue factor is the ratio of revenues received by MC2 per ton of concentrate to the average tin (or
tungsten) metal price prevailing in the year. This ratio has fluctuated fairly widely in the past
mainly reflecting the timing of MC2's sales in relation to swings in metal prices above or below the
yearly average.

The functions of the main divisions at Head Office, Rangoon are
described below:
(a) Administrative Division is responsible for matters relating
-o appointments, postings, transfers, training, pay and
allowances, welfare, etc., of the Corporation's personnel.
(b) Accounts Division is responsible for preparing the Corpora-
tion's annual budget estimates and submission of these to
the Government; authorizing the cash requirements for the
Projects and Head Office Divisions; exercising budgetary
and financial control on the implementation of the projects;
auditing and admitting claims for payments; auditing the
accounts of the mine site branch offices annually; compiling
the annual accounts and submitting these to the Administrative
Ministry; and laying down the accounting procedures for the
Mine Sites and Head Office Divisions of the Corporation.
(c) Production Division is concerned with mining, concentrating
and smelting of tin and tungsten minerals; mine security;
obtaining required materials and stores for operations;
preparing progress reports and other reports which may be
called for; and taking action on proposals for short-term
and long-term projects in consultation with the Head of the
Planning and Projecting Division.
(d) Planning and Projecting Division is responsible for studying
and solving difficulties in connection with production of
the existing mines; improving and modernizing the technical
methods employed at the mines; organizing in-service technical
training and training for new employees; and taking action on
proposals for short-term and long-term projects in consul-
tation with the Head of the Production Division.
(e) Engineering Division is responsible for the civil, mechanical
and electrical works of the Corporation; and the purchase
and supply of mining stores and machinery spares.
3.        MC2 has been limited in its activities to production.  Exploration,
mine geologic work, research and marketing have been carried out by other
Government corporations or departments. While close cooperation exists
among the various bodies so that the required work usually gets done, activi-
ties are too diffused and responsibility is difficult to pinpoint. In future,
MC2 will be allowed to have more influence over its marketing (text para.
4.15). With regard to exploration, MC2 will carry out work only in areas
within its present mining areas, regional exploration remaining the respon-
sibility of the Directorate of Geological Survey and Mineral Exploration.

TIN-TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.        The project aims at expanding production of tin through development
of a dredging operation in the Heinze Basin. In addition, the quality of
existing products will be improved through construction of a central concentrator
in Tavoy to treat the output of all No. 2 Mining Corporation's (MC2) operations.
Additional benefits are expected to be derived from improved control - produc-
tion and financial, of the Corporation's operations. Integration of the
adjacent Kanbauk mines in the Heinze Basin operation is an example of possible
improvements. The proposed pilot gravel pump project will also serve to in-
crease production substantially and yield high returns. A detailed descrip-
tion of these three elements of the project follows below.
2.        MC2, as with the remainder of the mineral sector, has suffered from
a lack of capital investment. This has, in large measure, been the key factor
in the decline of mineral production in Burma over the past couple of decades.
Another important factor has been the excessive government control in all
aspects of corporate operations. This has led to a bureaucratic lethargy in
the Corporation; a pattern displayed by virtually all the government corpora-
tions.
3.        The trend to "commercialization" within state owned corporations
makes it an appropriate time to attempt some improvement in operations
in the mineral sector. The exact form of this trend is not yet known, and
there are indications that it may represent additional controls on top of
what are already excessive controls. IDA's involvement in the project will
improve the possibility of influencing the trend to commercialization favor-
ably. At worst, the project being considered stands on its own and should
provide reasonable benefits to the economy. With effective project implemen-
tation and start-up assistance, MC2 has the resources to ensure reasonable
operation of the facilities. The terms of reference for this assistance are
contained in Annex 6-2.
B.   HEINZE BASIN DREDGE
1.   Background
4.        The Heinze Basin is located some 300 km. south east of Rangoon,
and 50 km. north of Tavoy, in the Tenasserim Division of Burma (see IBRD
Map 12322). The Basin is a T-shaped estuary, with the southern section
some 25 km. in length. The more favorable tin deposits lay at the extreme
end of this southern section, and in the Onbinkwin Chaung, off the main
estuary.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 2
5.        Access to the Basin may be obtained by surfaced road from Tavoy,
or Ye 60 km to the north. However load limits on the bridges is usually
confined to 5 tons. Insurgent activity also discourages frequent use of
these roads. The Basin is also accessible by sea during the non-monsoon
season. The limitations of surface access will require transport of heavy
and bulk materials for the project by sea.
6.        The climate is tropical monsoon, with the monsoon lasting from
May to October. Rainfall during the monsoon usually exceeds 500 cm, while
rain is almost non-existent during the dry season.
7.        Vegetation in the area is tropical.  Mangrove swamps and low for-
ested hills border the Basin. Secondary scrubland forests occur on the low
elevated hills near the coast. Some teak and other hardwoods are also found,
together with numerous bamboo thickets.
8.        A portion of the Heinze Basin was successfully dredged prior to
World War II by a British owned company, Tavoy Tin Dredging Corp. In addi-
tion, intermittent dredging operations were also carried out by Heinze Burma
Tin Syndicate Ltd. west of the Basin near Onbinkwin. The latter operation
was terminated in 1952.
9.        Subsequently, a UNDP financed, UN executed program undertook exten-
sive borings in the Basin from 1972 to 1975. Following this, UNDP financed
the execution of a feasibility study for mining of the deposits. This study
was completed by Osborne and Chappel, a Malaysian consulting firm in mid-
1975.
1. Geology and Ore Reserves
10.       The deposit is almost entirely alluvial with some eluvial deposi-
tion in the south-western areas. The alluvium has probably been derived
from the valleys south and west of the Heinze and Onbinkwin Chaungs. The
alluvium consists of free sandy wash interspersed with clays of varying
tenacity.
11.       Tin values occur in both the free wash and clays.  Higher tin val-
ues are found to the south and west, the supposed sources of mineralization.
However, the clays predominate in these areas, and become tougher in con-
sistency. These clays adversely affect dredging throughput and recoveries.
The tin mineralization is quite coarse, about 50% of + 52 mesh.
12.       The previous dredging was centered on the junction of the Heinze
and Onbinkwin Chaungs. Boring by the U.N. identified certain limited areas
which could be reworked. The economic values remain at a depth of about
10 meters.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 3
13.       Mineable ore reserves in the Heinze Basin have been estimated at
32.9 million cu.m. containing 0.20 kg/cu.m. of 76% tin concentrate. The
recoverable concentrate would therefore be 6,640 tons. The southern area
contains 13.9 million cu.m. with a grade of 0.31 kg/cu.m. The northern area
contains 19.0 million cu.m. at 0.12 kg/cu.m.
14.       Rather than utilize conventional arithmetic averaging methods in
calculation of ore reserves, Osborne and Chappel used a "Horizon Method"
which considers volume recovery and value recovery. This type of approach
has wide acceptance for evaluation of alluvial deposits.
15.       A correction factor ranging from 100% to 0% was applied to the
volume for bedrock configuration. Irregular bedrock, particularly where
limestone is the bedrock, results in a tendency to overvalue the volume and
value of tin-ore recovered. The correction factors are applied to successive
horizons below which bedrock is likely to be encountered. Slope corrections
may also be applied where dredging depth is greater than 30 meters by reducing
the peripheral area factors in successive horizons.
16.       Correction factors are also applied to tin values for each of the
four categories of ground types. Ninety five percent recovery is estimated
for tin values in free sandy wash; 75% in soft clays; 25% in medium clays;
and 0% in tough clays. Incorporated in these factors are allowances for
losses in recovery of fine grained tin in the jig plant.
17.       In addition, the correction factor for physical assays as compared
to chemical assays was not applied. The effect would have been to increase
tin-ore values by 8%. Losses in tin concentrator and other factors compen-
sate for this correction, so that a net 2% increase might result. This net
result was not considered significant enough to apply.
18.       A cut-off grade of 0.10 kg/cu.m. was used in the calculation of
ore reserves. Anomalous values in the bore holes were corrected by weight
averaging values in adjacent areas.
19.       The resultant ore reserve figures must be considered conservative.
The corrections applied are appropriate for the type of deposits. The ore
reserves are sufficient for 19 years at the proposed rate of mining.
20.       In addition to these ore reserves, there are large areas in the
Basin which are presently sub-economic. These reserves contain 40 million
cu.m. with a grade of 0.05 kg/cu.m. While they are low grade their status
should be kept under review during the life of the project.
3. Main Production Facilities
21.       Mining: The proposal to use dredging as the mining method is a
fairly obvious one. Nonetheless, thorough site investigations and objective
assessment of the technical data were undertaken in the selection of the
mining method.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 4
22.       Dredging enables 40% of the current economic reserves in
the Basin to be mined. Other methods, particularly in the deeper northern
section, could not achieve this extraction. Even in the shallower southern
portion, extensive earthworks would be required for open pit methods. These
could not be justified economically.
23.       Selection of dredge size was based on two main sets of factors,
operational and economic. The operational factors were mainly conditions
applicable to the locality. Stiff clays and mangrove swamps present in the
Basin limit the minimum pontoon draught. Maneuverability of the dredge is
also a limiting factor within the constraints of the deposits in the Basin.
In addition, the lack of dredging experience in Burma was a factor since
larger dredges require a high degree of skill in operation and maintenance.
As a result of this assessment of operational factors, the maximum size dredge
was considered to be with 0.43 cu.m. buckets and the minimum 0.17 cu.m.
buckets.
24.       Within these operational limits, an economic study was undertaken
on four different dredge sizes. Combinations of two different sized dredges
were also examined.
25.       Such factors as reserves mined, capital costs, operating costs,
and net cash flow were determined for each alternative. The smaller dredge
could not mine at depth in excess of 12 m., reducing the reserves. The
larger dredge could not negotiate the shallower ground, also reducing the
reserves. As a result, the 0.35 cu.m. dredge was shown to be the optimum
size.
26.       The dredge selected would be a conventional bucket line dredge
with 0.35 cu.m. buckets and a jig treatment plant. The dredge would have
the capacity to dig to 16 m. during the first eight years operation in the
shallower southern portion. In this area, a draught of 2.3 m. would be
necessary, as well as wide pontoons and a low profile to ensure stability.
The dredge would be modified in year nine to adapt it for operation in the
deeper northern portion of the deposits. The main modifications would be
extension of the pontoons and ladder to increase the digging depth to 27 m.
At the same time, an overburden chute and scuttle wouldbe installed to
facilitate overburden removal.
27.       The dredging sequence has been carefully selected to maximize to
the extent possible the present value of the cash flow. The higher grade
southern portion is mined in the earlier years.
28.       Annual production is estimated at 1.4 million cu.m. in the early
years increasing to 2.0 million cu.m. after the tenth year of production,
as shown in Table 1. These production estimates are 51% and 74% of theoret-
ical capacity, respectively. The lower production in the first two years
is due to operator inexperience and dredging conditions. From the third
year of production through to the ninth year production varies from 1.6 to
1.8 million cu.m. depending on the dredging conditions. The production esti-
mates reflect the operating conditions and other factors. They are considered
to be realistic.

29.       The jig plant would consist of a screening plant to remove the
oversize (+ 6 mm), and a two-stage jig plant. The jig plant would have 32
primary 3 cell cross flow jigs 1,070 mm x 1,220 m. in 32 flow lines. The sec-
ondary circuit would have 4 flow lines of 4 cell jigs of the same design.
The overflow from the secondary jigs would be sent to 2 tertiary 2 cell
jigs. The tertiary concentrate would return to the secondary circuit.
30.       The treatment plant would produce a heavy mineral concentrate
grading between 20% and 40% tin, and is expected to average 28% tin. In view
of the relative coarseness of the tin-ore and lack of deleterious materials,
no problems should be encountered in the jig treatment plant.

31.       Mill:  The heavy mineral concentrate will be treated in a mill to
be constructed as part of the nearby shore complex for the project. The mill
would also treat the rough concentrates from the adjacent Kanbauk gravel pump
mine (paras. 46-53). Feed to the mill would grade 20% to 40% tin, and
contain minor amounts of zircon, xenotime and monazite, all saleable products;
as well as other waste products. The mill would produce a bulk tin concentrate
grading 65% tin, and a refractory minerals concentrate of zircon. Both these
products would be sent to the Tavoy concentrator for further upgrading.

32.       The flowsheet for the mill would consist of initial screening to
remove the oversize (+10 mesh) waste. This wou:Ld be followed by a magnetic
scalper to remove the small amount of magnetic minerals in the ore, mostly
magnetite. The ore will then be classified and treated on Wilfey tables to
produce a tin rich concentrate, a middling product, and sand waste.  The tin
concentrate, grading 65% Sn, would pass through a fresh water wash, and then
would be dewatered, and dried.
33.       Then it would be treated on high intensity magnetic separators.
The non-conducive portion would be the refractory mineral concentrate, mostly
zircon. The conducive portion would be treated on a twin disc magnetic sepa-
rator to remove ilmenite. The non-magnetic portion would then be combined
with the concentrate. Both the tin and the refractory concentrate would be
sent to Tavoy for further upgrading.
34.       The mill flowsheet has been thoroughly tested by the consultants,
Osborne and Chappel. This type of ore is quite common in South East Asia,
and the flowsheet is conventional for the ore. The equipment proposed is
standard and widely used in alluvial tin concentrators.
4. Industrial and Social Infrastructure
35.       The total lack of infrastructure in the Heinze Basin requires that
extensive facilities be supplied for the project. The remote location also
dictates a need for complete facilities, particularly in terms of maintenance
and support facilities.
36.       Dredge Support will be provided by several water craft.  The major
item is a 450 c.v. tugboat which will provide assistance during important
moves of the dredge, movement of barges, and transshipment of oil and other
materials. The tug will be sea-going and capable of emergency trips to
Rangoon for spares. A 70 c.v. workboat will be responsible for movement
of all barges in the Heinze Basin, particularly to and from the dredge.
Three 30 c.v. personnel boats with a capacity of 25 people each will assure
personnel movement. Also included will be 3 - 20 ton tin-ore barges for
movement of concentrate from the dredge to the shore complex; four 55,000
litre capacity oil barges; and one 20 ton capacity material barge.
37.       Power for the dredge will be supplied by five on-board diesel
generator sets each rated at 345 KW. Four generators will meet normal
power requirements of the dredge with the fifth set acting as a spare.
The spare will be able to operate independently in case problems occur on
the common electrical bus-bar or synchronising gear. Total installed power
on the dredge will be 1,650 KW. The power requirements while operating on
ore are estimated at 1,015 KW.
38.       Electrical energy for the shore complex will be supplied by one
345 KW diesel generator, the same size units as will supply power on the
dredge, plus an auxiliary 150 KW generator. Total estimated power load for
the shore complex is 330 KW.

39.       Direct driven diesel generators and pumps would be the power and
water supply for Kanbauk. This would replace the antiquated hydro plant. The
existing dam will be used as a water supply for the gravel pump operations.
Since most of the mining equipment is diesel operated, power requirements for
Kanbauk are quite low.
40.       Water for the mill will be sea water from the Chaung.  The mill
requires the bulk of the water requirements. The final portion of the wet
circuit in the mill will be a fresh water wash. Fresh water for the social
infrastructure will be supplied from wells at Ohndaw 0.6 km. from the shore
complex.
41.       Industrial infrastructure will also include workshops, offices,
and a warehouse. The workshops would be capable of performing all routine
maintenance for the dredge, mill, and auxiliary shore plant. There will
be five main sections in the shops:
(a) Automatic welding shop
(b) Machine shop
(c) Sheet metal working shop
(d) Motor transport and diesel repair shop
(e) Electrical maintenance shop
42.       The automatic welding shop would be capable of extensive rehabil-
itation of the dredge heavy wear parts. Bucket bases, pins and tumblers,
and ladder rollers would all be rebuilt in the shop.
43.       The workshop would not carry out heavy engineering, or special-
ized electrical rewinds. These would have to be carried out in Rangoon,
or elsewhere, if required.
44.       A new town will be constructed close to the shore complex.  This
townsite would include 237 houses for all the employees. All houses will
be provided with electric, water, and sanitary facilities, and built to
standard Government designs.
45.       The townsite will also include a school for 200 children, a com-
munity hall/cinema, a sixteen bed hospital, a market, and playing field.
5. Integration of Kanbauk Mine
46.       The existing Kanbauk gravel pump mine is described in Annex 4-1.
Operational performance results has been poor. Constraints on the operations
include: lack of water for sluicing and for power generation; lack of effective
maintenance on the hydro-electric station, water supply pipelines and flumes
and other plant and equipment; and lack of investment in all phases of the
operation. Labor supply has also been a problem owing to the seasonal nature
of the operations. As a result, the mine has produced less than a third of
the output of a comparable operation elsewhere, given the same conditions.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 8
47.       Integration of the operation with the Heinze Basin project should
increase output substantially with a minimal investment cost. The benefits,
in effect, would be derived more from improved operational control. The
infrastructure, workshops, mill, and particularly supervision of the Heinze
Basin project could all be effectively used for the Kanbauk mine.-
48.       Recoverable ore reserves in the gravel pump mine are estimated at
3,400 tons of cassiterite.  At the projected rate of output, these would be
sufficient for 17 years operation.  The average grade of the reserves is of
the order of 0.31 Kg./per cu.m.
49.       A considerable amount of Banka drilling and test pitting was done
over an area of some 2,000 hectares by the Mineral Development Corporation
(MDC) from 1969 to 1972. This work proved the existence and extent of the
deposit. However, additional work, including some check boring, will be
required to determine more accurately those reserves which are recoverable.
The Mineral Development Corporation did not attempt to separate the reserves
into recoverable and non-recoverable. The recoverable reserves shown above
were estimated by Osborne and Chappel from MDC's work. The estimate is
believed to be conservative.
50.       Mining is presently carried out in three pits, including one which
was developed under a UNDP financed UN executed project. This UN project
was undertaken to demonstrate more modern mining techviquer.  Pir:-.-tion, as
a result, was expanded from 40 tons to 100 tons per year. More importantly,
the gravel pump operations are equipped with sufficient, satisfactory
machinery for the integration.
51.       The UN project included a concentrator with shaking tables, Wil-
loughby boxes, vibrating screens, magnetic separators, and high tension
separators. Although the UN turned the concentrator over to the Corpora-
tion, the Corporation has not operated it. The Corporation should utilize
this concentrator until required for the project. The equipment would then
be incorporated into the Heinze Basin mill. Any equipment not required for
the Heinze Basin mill might be utilized in the Tavoy concentrator or else-
where.
52.       In order to improve the efficiency of Kanbauk operations, a small
amount of capital investment is required. The two key items would be im-
provement of the supplies of electric power and water. Additional diesel
driven pumping and power capacity would be installed.
53.       Improvement of the storage dam and pipeline would be required to
provide make-up water for the gravel pump mining. Since water for the mining
operation would be stored and recycled, only small quantities are required
for make-up.

B.   CENTRAL CONCENTRATOR AT TAVOY
1. Background
54.       MC2's concentrating facilities, as outlined in Annex 4-1, are
antiquated and inefficient. As a result, most of the products the Corporation
sells are sub-standard. These products sell at a substantial discount to
prices for standard grade concentrates. This is particularly true for the
mixed tin-tungsten concentrates presently sold by the Corporation.
55.       MC2 had prepared a proposal for construction of a small central
concentrator at Tavoy, to permit production of clean tin concentrates. On the
basis of this proposal, the Bank undertook to finance a small study of various
alternatives open to the Corporation, and prepare a preliminary flowsheet for
the selected option. Osborne and Chappel Sdn. Berhad of Ipoh, Malaysia, the
same firm which prepared the feasibility study for the Heinze Basin project,
was retained to undertake this study. The consultants carried out their study
from February to May 1976.
2. Alternative Studies
56.       Concentrating facilities at each of the Corporation's existing and
future operations were reviewed. For a number of reasons, it was not prac-
tical to improve the Corporation's existing facilities. There are a large
number of small operations which could not support modern concentrating
installations. The existing facilities are too primitive to consider improve-
ment. In addition, much of the Corporation s ore comes from tribute opera-
tions, which are basically artisanal, or family operations.
57.       As a first step in the study of possible alternatives, six pos-
sible combinations of new plants were compared on a net present value basis
of the required capital and operating cost expenditures. Since the increased
revenue was the same for each of the combinations, such an approach is valid.
As a result of this comparison, three of the combinations were eliminated
since the net present value was 30% higher than for the other alternatives.
58.       Therefore, three alternatives remained which merited more thorough
investigation. These alternatives were:
(a) A large central concentrator at Tavoy to treat
all the Corporation's output.
(b) Concentrator as in (a) but sited at Rangoon.
(c) A concentrator at Toungoo to treat the mixed
tin-tungsten ores from the Mawchi-Pyinmina
area; together with a smaller central concen-
trator at Tavoy to treat all the production
in the Tenasserim area of Southern Burma.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 10
59.       Discounted cash flows were prepared for each of the three alterna-
tives. All three yielded high rates of return. In alternative (c), the
Toungoo plant had a high return while the Tavoy plant had a return which
was acceptable.
60.       Justification could be made for selection of any one of the three
alternatives. The economic rates of return were all within three percentage
points. These central concentrators permit production of concentrates of a
consistent, high quality. A centralized concentrator would have a lower
investment cost per unit of throughput than the alternative of constructing
new plants at each of the Corporation's mines and collection points. The
operating costs per unit of throughput are also lower, and more than offset
any increased transport costs. Better supervision and control is also
achieved in a central plant.
61.       The large central concentrator at Tavoy is considered to provide
significant unquantifiable benefits in addition to the high rate of return.
The potential for increasing tin and tungsten production exists in the
Tenasserim division, of which Tavoy is the centre. The existence of a mod-
ern concentrator could provide impetus for this development. The concen-
trator could provide a strong base for coordinating and managing activities
in the area. The close contact which the concentrator would have with the
producing mines would permit a measure of operational control over these
operations. While the concentrator would be capable of treating all of the
Corporation's output, sufficient flexibility remains to construct concentrat-
ing facilities which might be required in development of new large mines.
62.       A few disadvantages of a plant in Tavoy are evident.  The plant
in Tavoy requires its own power generating equipment, increasing the capi-
tal costs slightly. In addition, exports of concentrates are at present
permitted only from Rangoon. However, output of the plant would be suffi-
cient to justify direct exports from Tavoy. The advantages of the plant at
Tavoy far outweigh the disadvantages; particularly if exports are permitted
directly from Tavoy.
3. Description of Concentrator
63.       The primary concentrating facilities available at the Corporation's
various mines are satisfactory to upgrade production to 65% tin - wolfram
content. The tribute miners also upgrade their production to a 65% content.
Upgrading to this level presents no undue problems, since removal of light
gangue minerals only is required. This practice would be continued after
start-up of the central concentrator. Therefore, the feed to the Tavoy
concentrator would consist of a rough concentrate grading approximately
65% heavy minerals.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 11
64.       The multitude of types and sources of these concentrates require
a fairly complex circuit in the concentrator to treat them effectively. In
addition to a primary circuit for wolfram rich and mixed ores, a separate
primary circuit is provided for wolfram-free tin concentrates. Each of
these two primary circuits is also equipped to dry those ores which are
received wet; and for crushing coarse ores to permit liberation of the val-
uable constituents.
65.       In the wolfram circuit, following drying and crushing, the ore is
treated by low intensity magnetic separators. The highly magnetic minerals
are removed and discarded. The ore is then screened into three size frac-
tions to permit separate treatment of these fractions. The oversize (+10
mesh or +2 mm) is returned to the crushers. The separate treatment of the
three size fractions is necessary because the mineral constituents of each
fraction differ requiring different treatment processes.
66.       Following screening, the ore is treated on high intensity electro-
static precipitators to split off the non-conductive portion. The conductive
portion is then treated on high intensity magnetic separators to split off
the tin ore from wolfram. The tin ore which is the non-magnetic product of
the high intensity magnetic separators is recycled to various stages of the
tin circuit for recovery.
67.       The preliminary wolfram concentrate is then treated by wet gravity
separation on tables and then Willoughby boxes for clean-up. Following dry-
ing, this product is further treated on high intensity magnetic separators
to yield the final wolfram concentrate.
68.       The tin circuit is essentially similar.  Following drying, crush-
ing and screening, the tin ore is also treated by high tension electro-static
precipitators. The conductive portion passes directly to wet gravity sepa-
ration on tables and then Willoughby boxes for clean-up. Following drying,
this product is treated on high intensity magnetic separators to yield the
final tin concentrate.
69.       In addition to producing high quality wolfram concentrates and
tin concentrates, the concentrator will also produce sheelite concentrates;
and recover xenotime, monazite and zircon as by-products. The exact quanti-
ties recovered of these by-products will, of course, depend on the source
of the tin ore. The average content of these products in the tin ore feed
is approximately 2.5%. These by-products will provide a small but signifi-
cant revenue for the Corporation. These revenues have not been included in
the benefit streams for the concentrator.
70.       The design of the flowsheet for the concentrator was based on
preliminary bench testing of ore samples collected by Corporation officials
and the Consultants. Mineralogical analyses were undertaken to determine
the mineral constituents of the various ores. In addition, screen analyses
were done on the samples to determine the distribution of tin, wolfram and
other minerals in the different size fractions of the ores. The screen
analyses indicate that most of the mineral constituents are generally free,
with what interlocking that does occur being generally confined to the plus
10 mesh fraction.

71.       As a result of these tests, the main treatment phases were iden-
tified. It is unlikely that any of the treatment phases will cause major
difficulties. However, further metallurgical testing will be required during
engineering design to confirm the ores' amenability to treatment by the pro-
cesses proposed; and to verify that all identified treatment problems can
be overcome. The testing would also ensure selection of the most suitable
processing equipment where alternatives are available. This additional
testing is estimated to require 20 man weeks of work and cost US$20,000.
72.       While additional metallurgical testing will be required, it is
not expected that the final concentrator flowsheet will differ appreciably
from the flowsheet prepared by the Consultant, and outlined above. The ores
are similar to ores found elsewhere in South East Asia. The treatment pro-
cesses proposed are commonly used for treatment of these ores. The equipment
proposed is standard and widely used in concentrators of this type.
4. Infrastructure
73.       Selection of the specific site for the concentrator will be under-
taken at the time of engineering design, with the assistance of the project
engineering firm. The Corporation has conducted a preliminary site investi-
gation to narrow the choice of sites to three. This preliminary selection
considered, inter alia, the general specifications outlined below. A final
site will be chosen with the consultants' assistance and acquired as a
condition of credit effectiveness.
74.       General specifications for the site require a land area of 0.5
hectares with a slight slope, ideally I in 5. In addition, 5 to 6 hectares
of adjacent ground would be needed for tailings disposal, and water storage
and recirculation. A source of fresh water is also necessary.
75.       Water requirements for the concentrator are estimated at 12,000
litres per minute. The water should be fresh water, and it must be neutral.
With a suitable site and retention dams, some 80% of the water required
could be recirculated. The make-up water required would be 2,500 litres
per minute.
76.       Electrical energy requirements for the concentrator cannot be
met by the Electric Power Corporation with existing facilities in Tavoy.
The diesel generating plant, with a total capacity of 868 KW, does not
meet existing needs. In view of this, independent power generating facil-
ities have been included in the project. Two 345 KW diesel generators, the
same type specified for the Heinze Basin, will provide power. Estimated
requirements are 613 KW maximum, and 368 KW normal usage. The two gen-
erators would have the capacity to supply the plant on full load and would
have sufficient spare capacity for possible additions or alterations to
the plant. Two units are utilized rather than one since it permits stan-
dardization with the Heinze basin, and enables the plant to operate, albeit
at reduced capacity, if one unit breaks down.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 13
77.       Transport facilities (trucks) are required to carry the concentrates
of the various mines to the central concentrator. These trucks would also
take the clean concentrates to the shipping point. Since no adequate alter-
native seems to exist in Tavoy (loel buses are presently used), 5 six-ton
trucks have been included in the project.
78.       Export of the clean concentrates would be on small schooners which
regularly serve Rangoon, if present practice is maintained. However, the
volume of output from the plant at Tavoy would be sufficient for coastal
vessels to call at the port of Tavoy. Establishment of a monthly service
to the tin smelters at Phuket in Thailand or Penang in Malaysia should be
feasible.
C.   PILOT GRAVEL PUMP PROJECT
1.   Background
79.       As indicated in Annex 2, the mineral sector in general and tin-
tungsten mining in particular are operating considerably below their poten-
tial. Production in 1938/39 of over 10,000 tons of tin and tungsten has
declined to only 1,500 tons in 1975/76. Whereas before the war, 6 dredges
were operating, there are none now; and whereas there were 21 gravel pump
operations, there is only I now.
80.       While the Heinze basin project would provide a basis for restor-
ing dredging in Burma, a pilot gravel pump could be the first stage of re-
building production from those deposits suitable for gravel pumping. The
modest scale recommended for this pilot project recognizes the constraints
imposed by the available managerial and technical know-how, capital invest-
ment, and insurgency.
81.       The Corporation prepared a preliminary study from historical
records on gravel pump mining. Records are still available from some of
the earlier operations, although in many cases they are incomplete. These
records have served to indicate some seven separate areas with high poten-
tial. These areas would include the following locations: Wagon, Kalonta,
and Phachaung - Khechaung in Tavoy District; and Manoron in Mergui District.
A number of other areas are also considered to be attractive.
2.   Description of Project
82.       Geology and ore reserves:  The deposits are alluvial, and are
derived from erosion of nearly primary occurrences. During transportation of
the erosion products, the heavier metal minerals may be concentrated due to
local conditions. These deposits commonly occur in sand and gravel although
clay is commonly present. Cassiterite (a tin oxide - SnO2) is the ore mineral
most commonly found. In the northern part of the Tenasserim division, wolframite
(an iron tungstate - Fe, MnWX ) is also found.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 14
83.       The previous work has shown the presence of deposits.  Additional
work will be required to determine the extent and grade of the deposits as
well as the recoverable content. Approximately 100 holes will be drilled in
each of the seven areas identified. Two "Banka" drills will be procured for
the project to undertake the drilling, as well as related geophysical equip-
ment.
84.       A significant factor in evaluation of the ore reserve situation is
that gravel pump operations are highly mobile. Hence proving of ore reserves
is not as vital as for underground or open pit mines. If an area is depleted,
or is not as rich as anticipated, the operation may be moved elsewhere. Only
losses from the moving time are incurred.
85.       The "Banka" drilling should however provide sufficient informa-
tion to justify moving the operation to specific areas. Once established,
the drilling should serve to ensure that the economically recoverable re-
serves are extracted.
86.       Mining:  Gravel pump operations basically consist of monitors (water
jets) to wash down the sand and gravel, and direct it to a sump. From the
sump, the slurry, or liquified material, is pumped to a "palong," for treatment.
The important requirement in gravel pumping is water under high pressure (100
psi). Storage ponds are usually used to recycle most of the water required.
87.       Under the project, sufficient equipment will be procured to estab-
lish gravel pump operations in two areas. Start-up of a gravel pump opera-
tion does not require major pre-production expense, such as stripping. For
this reason, the project could be implemented relatively quickly.
88.       Concentrating:  As noted above, the gravel pump would pump the
slurry to a "palong", a long sloping sluice-box. The heavy minerals including
the tin ore are trapped in the sluices while the lighter gangue material flows
over the palong and is discarded. The concentrate obtained may be further
upgraded in a portable jig plant. A concentrate containing approxiamtely 30%
tin would be obtained from the jig plant.
89.       Since the treatment is straight gravity separation, only the
light gangue minerals are removed. However, some care must be exercised
on the "palong" or losses can be high.
90.       Equipment requirements:  The major items of equipment required for
the pilot gravel pump project are as follows:
Quantity                      Item
2                   Banka Drills
8                   Hydraulic Monitors
4                   Pumps (Diesel Motor)
4                   8" Gravel Pumps (Diesel motor)
2                   150 KW Diesel-electric generators
2                   Small jig plants



ANNEX 5-1
Page 15
91.       This would be sufficient for two operations.  Other miscellaneous
material such as piping and electric cable will also be required.
3. Technical Assistance
92.       Technical assistance would be provided by the engineering firm
for the pilot gravel pump project. The assistance would cover all phases.
The drilling program would be laid out in consultation with the firm; the
actual drilling would be carried out with supervision by the firm; as
would calculation of recoverable ore reserves.
93.       Technical assistance would also be provided for the gravel pump
operations. Selection of the locations would follow the early drilling
results. Start-up and early operations of the mines would be under the
supervision of the engineering firm.
94.       It is estimated that assistance would cover a minimum of two
years.

TIN TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES
A. Effective Date of Estimates
1.        The original estimates for the Heinze Basin dredge and mill were
prepared during March and April 1975 and reflected prices as at 31st March,
1975. The original estimates for the other project components and revised
estimates for the Heinze Basin components reflect March 31, 1976 prices. The
capital costs are detailed in full in two feasibility studies prepared by
Osborne & Chappel Sdn. Bhd., tin mining consultants of Ipoh, Malaysia. The
reports are as follows:
(1)  Comprehensive Feasibility Studies for Mining Placer
Tin-Ore in the Heinze Basin; August 1975 (with up-
dated costs contained in a further report: Final
Revised Summaries of the Capital Cost Estimates for
Implementation of the Heinze Basin Project; April
1976.
(2)  Review of Existing and Projected Facilities for Tin/
Tungsten Concentration in the Tenasserim Division and
at Mawchi including Recommendations for their Improve-
ment; July, 1976.
The costs for the project are summarized by component in Table 1.
B. Method of Estimation
2.        The cost estimates were prepared based on the equipment specified
and on the assumption that all new equipment would be used, and without the
benefit of completed design engineering. The estimated cost of individual
items were either prepared within the consultants' firm or obtained as in-
formal or formal quotations from the various Burmese Government corporations
concerned, e.g. Construction Corporation. The costs were estimated on the
basis that equipment would be procured on a components basis under inter-
national competitive bidding and assembled by other contractors under the
supervision of an engineering firm i.e. rather than turnkey contracts for
complete items such as the dredge.



ANNEX 5-2
Page 2
3.        With regard to Osborne & Chappel's own estimates, four separate
bases were employed:
-    actual quotations obtained from suppliers against
specifications submitted
-    informal advice obtained from suppliers against
specifications submitted.
-    the updating and adjusting of prices of similar items
recently purchased within Osborne & Chappel's own
organization.
-    the objective assessment of costs of fabrication and
components, using quoted basic Malaysian prices, or,
where applicable, the domestic rates quoted by the
relevant Burmese Government Corporation.
4.        To assess the reliability of prices quoted by the Government
Construction Corporation, the consultants compared a number of the quota-
tions received with their own estimation of the cost of similar work if
executed in Malaysia. In most cases they found the Corporation quoted
competitive rates.
C. Freight, Insurance and Related Charges
Calculation of Port Charges and Handling Charges to Transit Godown
Port Charges
5.        Port charges have been calculated at 2% of CIF Rangoon costs.
Handling Charge
6.        This varies depending on the item being handled but for budgetting
purposes the charges have been calculated as follows:
Steelwork, hardware and all materials       US$1.50 per tonne (10 kyats)
Machinery, equipment and parts thereof    US$6.00  "    "   (40 kyats)

7.        All foreign costs have been obtained on the basis of CIF Butterworth,
Malaysia. The cost of shipping from Butterworth to Rangoon is about US$22 per
tonne (M$55).



ANNEX 5-2

Local Freight
8.        It has been assumed that all machinery, spares and parts will be
transhipped at Rangoon and transported by sea to the Heinze Basin. Local
freight costs are based on landing craft charter which are about US$10 per
tonne (69 kyats) from Rangoon to Heinze Basin.
Insurance During Carriage and Transit
9.        This has been taken at 1% of the basic cost and is assessed in
foreign currency. Insurance during towage of the dredge was estimated at
2% of construction costs.
D. Procurement and Project Management Assistance
10.       The cost of consultants (excluding engineering, training, and tech-
nical assistance covered below) provides for 50 man-months for personnel in
Burma, together with comprehensive back-up services from the consultants' home
office facilities and staff. The cost per man-year, including travel and
other expenses associated with this assistance, has been estimated at about
US$84,000 equivalent.
E. Design Engineering
11.       The specifications included in the report only form a basis for
the subsequent engineering design required. Some of this design work can
be competently executed by the Construction Corporation in Burma. Other
work such as the design of the dredge, will have to be executed overseas.
12.       The estimate for design engineering work has therefore been
allocated between domestic and foreign currency in accordance with the local!
foreign split of the equipment and construction costs. The basis for the
calculations involved in estimating design expenses are given in the table
below:

G. Technical Assistance
14.       For first two years' operational supervision of the project and
assistance to the Corporation during and after project execution for the
development of improved financial and operational control systems: approx-
imately 6 man-years over a five-year period at US$84,000 per man-year (in-
cluding travel, office, accommodations and all back-up and overhead expenses).
H. Duties & Taxes
15.       Custom duties for most machinery and equipment imported into Burma
is 15% of the CIF value--this has been used for all imported equipment and
materials. In addition, the recently enacted (mid-1976) new system of taxes
on Commodities and Services has resulted in an additional 30% on most imported
items, which amount has also been added to all foreign costs (all duties and
taxes in local currency).
I. Preproduction Expenses and Administration
16.       These are the estimated costs of the No. 2 Mining Corporation's
administration to supervise the design, construction and implementation
of the project until it becomes operational. Based on discussion with the
Corporation on their normal accounting practices and the experience with
the Heinda Mine expansion, a figure of 3.3% of the equipment and construc-
tion costs was adopted.
J. Contingencies
17.       Physical contingencies were taken as 10% of the basic before duty
costs for all items except buildings and construction at Tavoy, where a con-
tingency of 20% was allowed, due to the fact that a final site has not been
selected.
18.       Price contingencies were calculated using escalation rates as
follows:
(1) Local and foreign equipment costs: 9% in 1976, 8% per
annum in 1977-79, and 7% per annum thereafter (99.7%
of total cost of equipment is in foreign currency).
(2) Local construction and civil works costs: 20% per annum.
This reflects recent trends in prices for locally supplied



ANNEX 5-2
Page 6
construction materials, particularly timber and cement.
These trends are expected to continue into the construction
period.
(3) Engineering, training and administration costs: 7% per
annum for both local and foreign costs.
K. Working Capital
19.       Normal and insurance spares have been included under cost of
equipment and spares respectively. Other working capital needs (inven-
tory, receivables, etc.) are estimated as being negligible with respect
to the project cost as improvements in product quality and marketing effi-
ciency resulting from the project will permit a reduction in receivables
and inventories sufficient to offset the additional requirements that
would otherwise result from increased output.
L. Interest During Construction
20.       This item is based on interest charged in local currency on the
on-lent and outstanding portion of the proceeds of the credit during project
execution at 10% per annum.

TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR
CONSULTANTS
The No. 2 Mining Corporation will execute a project designed to
increase its production of tin and tungsten concentrates. At the same time,
the quality of its products will be improved. To finance this project, the
Government of Burma has applied to the International Development Association
(World Bank) for a credit. To assist the No. 2 Mining Corporation in execution
of the project and early operation of the facilities, an engineering consulting
firm experienced in tin mining and concentrating will be retained.
The Consultants shall provide the Corporation with Technical Assis-
tance for the implementation of the overall project which may be generally
summarised as follows:-
(1) Development of a dredging operating in the Heinze Basin
50 km North of Tavoy in Southern Burma. The Project
will entail procurement of a 0.35 cu.m. diesel electric
bucket dredge, and construction of a shore complex with
a mill, workshop, townsite, and other related facilities.
(2) As part of the Heinze Basin Project, improvements in
operations of the Kanbauk gravel pump mine will be
instituted. While additional output will be primarily
derived from improved operational control of the mine,
provision of a reliable source of electric power and
water will also be included.
(3) Construction of a central concentrator in Tavoy to
treat all of the No. 2 Mining Corporation's production
of tin, tungsten and mixed concentrates. The concen-
trator will produce high quality tin and tungsten
concentrates.
(4) A pilot gravel pump project will provide the basis
for future development of gravel pump operations.
Promising areas will be evaluated and two areas will
be selected for development of mining operations.
The work of the Consultants will include, but not be limited to,
items of work relating to the detailed engineering design, project planning,

ANNEX 7-1

BURMA
TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
OPERATING COSTS
A. General
1.        The estimated annual operating costs for each of the project
components are summarized in Table 1. the estimates are based on the feasi-
bility studies prepared by the consultants Osborne & Chappel, which were
prepared with due consideration of the factors outlined below.
B. Labour
2.        Labour costs are directly dependent upon the manpower requirements
and wage rates applicable. The complement of labour required to operate
the dredge and other project components is based on Osborne & Chappel's
knowledge of the normal requirement for similar operations in Malaysia and
increased to compensate for the lack of experienced labour in Burma (3 shifts
per day for the dredge, one per day for other facilities).
3.        The proposed manpower establishment for the major project compo-
nents, Heinze Basin and the Tavoy concentrator, are given in Tables 2 and 3.
The Government grades applicable to each classification of employee is given
together with the standard Government wage rate. No provision has been made
for bonuses and other social benefits in these tables, but allowance have been
made for these in the summarized costs in Table 1 (10% of wages for bonuses,
8% for welfare fund).
C. Price Estimation
4.        The estimation of the cost of fuels and materials required has been
based on currently quoted Burmese Government rates or, where items are not
domestically available, on the quoted net prices in Malaysia. The latter
have been used as Malaysia is the world's major market for dredging spares
and a major producer of many items.
5.        Replacement spares, maintenance materials and some freight and
insurance charges are the only items which would be purchased in foreign
currency.  This amounts to 31% of the total operating costs for the project.



ANNEX 7-1
Page 2
D. Materials Consumption
6.        The following approach has been used in the estimation of consump-
tion of materials, fuels and spare parts:
Fuel and Other Consumable Materials
7.        The consumption of these items is directly dependent on the charac-
teristics of the machinery specified and/or its application. These items
are not influenced by local conditions and therefore may be accurately esti-
mated by reference to historic records of similar operations.
Maintenance Materials Including Machinery Replacements
8.        The consumption of these items is influenced by working conditions
appertaining to the locality where the dredge or other plant operates in addi-
tion to the normal operational factors such as wear and tear.
9.        The estimate of usage of these items presents some problems as it
requires the estimation of abnormal rates of wear due to abrasive ground or
corrosion. In formulating estimates of replacements required, subjective
adjustments of Osborne & Chappel's own records have been made after a review
of dredge operations in similar conditions.
E. Freight and Port Charges Including Insurance In Carriage
10.       These have been estimated in the same manner as those for capital
costs given in Annex 5-2.
F. Import Duties and Commodity Taxes
11.       Import duty has been charged on imported materials at 15% and com-
modity tax at 30%.
G. Insurance
12.       This has been calculated at a quoted rate of 1-1/2% of the value
of items being covered.   This information was based on informal advice from
the Savings and Insurance Division of the People's Bank of the Union of Burma
and provides for all risks cover.

TIN/TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
BREAK-EVEN POINT (1981-82)
1. The profit and cash break-even points have been calculated for the year 1981-82. At this
point, MC2's output of 3,160 tons of concentrate is representative of the average that may be
expected annually for the Corporation as a whole over the project life (19 years).
2. The following basic data were used to determine the break-even point for MC2's total
operations:

D. BREAK-EVEN POINT
Profit Break-Even:    78.2% of normal output or 2,470 annual tons.
Cash Break-Even  :   67.7% of normal output or 2,140 annual tons.
The high break-even points are partly a result of the commodity tax which is
tied to costs rather than profits. If this tax were eliminated, the profit and
cash break-even points would be 62.1% and 52.3% respectively.
1/ Tribute production represents ores purchased by MC2. Such costs are completely variable.
2/ Because of Burmese employment practices, labor costs tend to be fixed over wide ranges
of output.
3/  Materials and overhead costs (fuel, repairs, transportation, supervisory salaries, etc.)
are estimated to be 1/3 variable and 2/3 fixed.
4/ Commodity tax is 16.8% on all costs.
5/ Includes commodity tax on sales deductions (freight and insurance charges on exports of
concentrates).
6/ Actual debt repayment in 1981-82 is K 1.9 million. The above figure of K 9.0 million is
more representative of the repayment burden once repayment begins on the proceeds of the
IDA credit.

FINANCI RATS OF RETURN AND SENSITIVIfT ANALYSIS
Assumptions
1.       Financial rate of return calculations are based on the incre-
mental capital cost, operating cost and revenue streams shown in page 2
of this Annex. All streams have been deflated to 1976 price terms on the
basis of international inflation rates (1976 - 8.4J%, 1977 - 8%, 1978 -
7.5%, 1979 and beyond - 7%). These are the same inflation rates used for
the current firancial projections (Annex 7-4., paragraph 3). Different
inflation rates have been used for capital costs (Annex 5-2).
2.       Other basic assumptions used in the financial rate of return
calculation are as follows:
Construction period:     3 years
Life of projectt        19 years

1/  All streams are in terms of September 30, 1976 prices (the mid point of MC2's 1976-77
fiscal year).
2/ Inital working capital needs with increased production in 1979-80 are recouped in the
following two years when the Tavoy concentrator comes on stream--allowing MC2 to reduce
its inventories and receivables.
3 Subsequent capital costs are primarily associated with the Heinze Basin Kanbauk components.
They include: 1982-83 improvement of roads; 1983-84 renewal of bucket band for the
dredge; 1988-90 dredge rehabilitation-increasing the digging depth and replacing the pontoons.
4/ Incremental operating costs decline in 1988-90 due to shut down of the dredge for rebabilitation.
5/ Taxes refers to t$716.8commodity tax on production and overhead costs which replaced the
income tax in IYi T e commodity tax declines over time due to decreasing depreciation
and interest charges when expressed in real terms.

ANNEX 7-14
Page 1
BURKA
TIN/TUNGSTEN MAPANSION PROJECT
ISSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL PRIJECTIONS
A. INOCKE STATEMUNT
1. Gross Sales
(a) Tonnage
Tonnage sales by type of concentrate are based on the
Projected Output by Mine table (Annex 7-8). Also, tonnage
sales are affected by changes in inventory levels each
year. Assumpticas on inventory levels are given in
paragraph 7 (c) of this Annex.
(b) Selling Prices
Prices for tin and tungsten concentrates are based on
forecast setal prices prepared by the Comodities and
Export Projections Divisimn (Annexes 3-1 and 3-2)
Details on the "revenue factor" used to calculate
revenues to MC2 as a percentage of the forecast metal
price are given in Annex 7-6.
2. Sales Deductions
Freight, insurance, MEIC comission, and furthw treatment charges
are deducted from XC2'a gross sales. In the past, these have averaged 6%
to 7% of sales revenues. Thia is expected to decline to 4% during F177-80
with the replacement of MIEC (which charges a 239 comission) by the
marketing committee. Once the Tavoy concentrator comes on stream treat-
ment charges will be eliminated (presently about 2% of gross aales5 reduc-
ing sales deductions to 2% in PY81 and beyond.
3. Cost of Production
Costs of production by mine are given in Annex 7-7. Information
on operating costs of the project components (Heinze Basin, Gravel Pumps,
Tavoy Concentrator) is provided in Annex 7-1. For existing mines, pro-
duction cost forecasts are based on the followings
(a) Tonnage output by mine for both tributor and Coxporation
operations as detailed in Annex 7-8.



ANNEX 7-h
Page 2
(b) Total production costs reprosents the cost of MC2's own
output as well as tb cost of purchased ores from tribu-
tore.
(c) The cost of purchased ores is equal to tribute output
times the relevant tribute rates by mine. It is assmed
prices paid for tribute ore will remain constant in real
terse over the forecast period.
(d) Costa by nine of KC2as own production are based on FY76
costs with adjustment to reflect the present situation.
Labor costs have been increased 25% in FY77. This takes
into account the 10% cost of living adjustment granted
to workers in July 1976, plus bonuses and the social
security scheae introduced by the Government in 1976 which
will raise labor costs a further 15%. In addition, costs
of imported materials included in operating costs have
been raised 30% to reflect the new commodity tax on such
imports. Overall, the effect of tbese changes is to raise
costs of MC2's own production by 20-25% at each mine site.
It is assmed that, over the balance of the forecast
period, costs of WC2's ow production will rmain constant
in real terms, except where affected by expansion or
modernization projecta (Heinda and the IDA project).
(e) Costs at the Hinda mdne are expected to rise substantially
over the next three years. In addition to the factors'
mentioned in (d), this is the result of the expansion of
mining activities at this site in connection with the
current rehabilitation program due to come on stream in
1977. Based on discussions with the Corporation and
analysea of existing data,  C2' s productiom costs at
Heinda are forecast to rise (in constant terms) at 70% of
the rate of increase in output over the Fr76-79 period
(output risea from 140 to 940 tons or 6.7 times, own pro-
duction costs rise from K2.9 to K13.7 million or 4.7 times).
(f) Output and production coats at the Kanbauk mine increase
in 7I80 as a result of closer supervision of these opera-
tions as implementation of the Heinse Basin project pro-
ceeds. Increrental operating costs are obtained from the
variable Coat compoents of the Gravel Pump operating
cost table in Annex 7-1.
4. Inlation of Costs and Revenues
It is assumed that escalation of both costs and revenues will
approximate world inflation rates as forecast by the Bank (1976 - 8.4t,
1977 - 8%, 1978 - 7.5%, 1979 and beyond - 7%). This assumption is based
an the following factors:



ANEX 7-4
Page 3
(a) All of MC2's revenues and about 30% of production costs
are in foreign exchange or are foreign exchange reated
(i.e. duties and couodity taxes an imported materials).
(b) With respect to local production costs (70% of the total),
the majority of these are made up of labor (10% of total
production costs) and ores purchased from tributors (50%
of total production costs). Based on MC21s past experience,
these costs should be largely set by the Corporation's
ability to pay - i.e. the prices it receives for its out-
put - and thus may be reasonably assumed to follow inter-
national inflation rates.
While devaluation of the kyat over the forecast period is possible,
such an occurence would lead to a proportionately greater increase in
revenues than in costs.  This would result in an improvement in cash flows
and financial rate of return above those presently projected.
5. Indirect Expenses
(a) Interest
Interest on onlending of the IDA credit from GOB to KC2
is assumed at 10%. Interest on other loans (FRG loan
for the Heinda mine) is about 2¼% annually.
(b) General and Administration
These costs are projected at 6% of annual produstion
costs. This is in line with MC2's experience over the
FY72-76 period.
(c) Depreciation
Depreciation is forecast at 7.5% of operating assets at
year end.
6. Comodity Tax
A 16.8% commodity tax on cost of sales, overhead, interest and
depreciation costs incurred in the year replaces the 50% income tax,
beginning FY77. This is based on a 15% tax on the sum of total operatilng
costs plus a 12% nominal profit.
B. BALANCE SHEET
7. Current Assets
(a) Cash and Bank
Forecast at 5% of production costs.



ANNEM 7-4
Page 4
(b) Receivables
Receivables are projected to decline from 33% of sales
in FY76, to 25% in FY77, and to 16.7% over the Fr78-80
period. This improvement will be achieved through a
reduction in the delays in transmission of cash receipts
to KC2 after the Marketing Committee assumed control of
the Corporation's sales in late 1976. A further reduct-
ion in receivables to 8.3% of sales in forecast for Fr81
and beyond once the Tavoy ooacentrator comes on stream
and MC2 can enter into long term smelter contracts for
its production.
(a) Mineral Ores Inventory
Inventories of mineral ores are expected tp decline from
103% of production coats in 7176 to 70% in F717. In fact
most of this reduction has already been achieved. At the
end of Auguat 1976 MC2's inventories of mineral ore were
35% below year-end levels. Closer control over inventory
levels in future should allow a reduction to 60% of pro-
ductimn coats in F778, and to 33% over the F779-80 period.
In F781, with the start-up of the Tavoy concentrator,
elimination of the need to process and re-process poor
quality concentrates, and the establishment of smelter
contracts, a further redoution in inventories to 16.7% of
production costs is possible.
(d) Supplies Inventory
Inventories of supplies are forecast at 40% of production
costs in FY77, 35% in Fr78, and 30% thereafter.
(e) Other Receivables
Forecast at 15% of production costs.
8. Current Liabilities
(a) Accounts Payable
MC21s purchases are conducted almost entirely on a cash
basis. Accounts payable are thus forecast at 5% of pro-
duction costs.



ANNIZ 7-4
(b) Tames Payable
It in ewpected 3C2 wil1 rmit the accusulated incame tax
payable by the end of FY77. Comodity tax.s are to be
tranitted to the Goverment as sales are made, thus it
is unmikely that a significant payable in this respect
will arise.

TIN/TUNGSTEN EPANSION PROJCT
oCONoaKIC RATE OF RETURN AND SDISIVITT ANALYSIS
Aisuiitionlb
1.        The econmic rate of return an the project has been calculated
on the basis of cost and benefit streas expressed in 1976 real tems.
These streams are based on those used in the financial rate of return
calculation (Annex 7-3) adJusted to reflect costs and benefits to the
economy as a whole. In particulars
(a)  Cpiti Costa:  duties and commodity taxes (15% and 30%
of the c.i.f value) are excluded from the imported
eomponents of capital costs and working capital needs.
(b) Oorating Costs: duties and taxes on ioported components
are excluded. Such taxes amount to about 12% of base
operating costs. Also, the 16.8% commodity tax on opera-
ting costs is excluded.
(c)  Benefitss  no changes have been made to the benefit
strea which is already valued at world market prices.
2.        The official foreign exchange rate of US$1 - K 6.65 does not
reflect the prevailing supply of and demand for foreign exchange in Burma
since it is maintained by very stringent exchange and trade restrictions.
For the purpose of presenting a more representative assessment of the
returns from the project, the ecmnoaic rate of return has been calculated
on three bases:
Case 1: No shadow pricing of foreign exchange
Case 2: Foreign exchange is shadow priced at the rate of
US$1 - K 10
Case 3: Foreign exchange is shadow priced at the rate of
US$1 - K 13
The rate used in Case 3 is the same as that arrived at by Bank
economists for the purpose of economic analysis of the "Burma Paddy Land
Development Project" (Report No. 1129-BA, May 25, 1976).
