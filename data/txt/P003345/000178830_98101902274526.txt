REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC
OF THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A
TIN AND TUNGSTEN EXPANSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to the Union of Burma for the equivalent of US$16 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the expansion of tin and
tungsten production. Of the total proceeds of the credit, US$15.8 million
equivalent would be relent to the No. 2 Mining Corporation, at an interest
rate of 10% per annum, repayable over fifteen years including five years
grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY -/
2.        The latest economic report entitled "Development in Burma:    Issues
and Prospects" (1024-BA) was distributed to the Executive Directors on July 27,
1976. Country data are provided in Annex 1.
3.        Burma is rich in natural resources, much of which have yet to be
developed. At present, the population is about 30 million and the per capita
income is US$110. World War II and the struggle for independence in 1948
devastated the economy and divided Burma politically. The fifties were a
period of turbulence, both political and economic. When the present Govern-
ment came to power in 1962, its major objectives were to unify the country and
complete the social transformation of the economy which had begun in the
forties.
4.        After 11 years of government by the Revolutionary Council, a Consti-
tution was adopted in a nationwide referendum in December 1973. It vested in
the People's Assembly supreme executive, legislative, and judicial authority.
The People's Councils, which extend down to village tracts, are the primary
means of governing the nation. During the recess of the People's Assembly,
the Council of State, which consists of the President and high ranking Govern-
ment officials, exercises power on its behalf. On the whole, there has been
little change in Government personnel. The Burma Socialist Program Party is
the only authorized political party.
1/ Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as the corres-
ponding parts of the President's Report for a Second Ports Project, dated
December 8, 1976 (P-1955-BA).
This document has a ramilctd distribution and may be wod by recipients only in ths _wftrme 
of their official dutie. Its contsnts may not otherwise be disclosed without World Dnk suaheqesn.



5.        By and large, the Government has made notable progress in the attain-
ment of its social and political objectives. Insurgency is still a problem,
particularly in the hills and border areas, but there is probably greater
stability now than at any time since independence. Nationalization of all
major sectors has been accomplished. Although the ownership of land is
vested in the State, the agricultural sector is almost fully operated by
individual farmers. Efforts have also been made to reduce inequalities in the
distribution of income and widen the scope of education and health services.
6.        However, efforts in social fields have been constrained recently by
inadequate financing as a result of slow economic growth. During 1965-75,
real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.3%, scarcely exceeding population
growth which was 2.2% annually. Output of productive sectors increased even
more slowly. Stagnation of agricultural production, combined with the growth
of population, led to a steady dwindling of the exportable surplus. Specif-
ically, rice production, the dominant crop, did not increase between 1963 and
1975 which in turn resulted in a steady decline in rice exports from 1.6
million tons in 1963 to less than 0.2 million tons in 1975, an average annual
decline of 19%. Although export prices are now considerably higher, export
earnings in 1975 were less than half those of 1965. The stagnation of agri-
cultural output directly affected the industrial sector which is largely agro-
based. Similarly, due to the decline in exports, this sector was deprived of
necessary imports of intermediate goods and raw materials. Over the last
decade, industrial production increased by only 1.4% per year.
7.        Slow economic growth has been largely due to the neglect of agri-
culture, forestry, mining, and transport. Agriculture, which accounts for
36% of GDP, received on average only 7% of public investment during the last
five years, equivalent to 2% of its value added. Inadequate public invest-
ments in agriculture were not offset by private investments. As a means of
achieving the desired pattern of income distribution, prices for compulsory
delivery to the Government of many agricultural commodities were set at low
levels. Farmers, especially paddy farmers, were left with little incentive
to produce marketable surpluses and with inadequate savings for maintenance
and investments.
8.        Traditionally, the Government derived a large part of its revenues
from rice exports. The drop in rice exports therefore had an adverse impact
on Government income. The related scarcity of foreign exchange necessitated a
marked contraction of imports (reducing customs revenues) and led to a very
slow growth of industrial production (and related revenues). There was also
a substantial loss of Government revenue because the nationalization of large
scale private firms led to reduction in private income taxes. This was not
compensated by an increase in Government revenue from taxes and surpluses
transferred by Government enterprises.
9.        The current revenue/GDP ratio declined from 16.5% in 1963 to 14% in
1973 and below 10% in 1975. The index of current revenue (in real terms) fell
from 100 in 1970 to 68 in 1975. Despite substantial cuts in maintenance and



capital expenditures (in real terms), the budget deficit, almost entirely
financed through bank borrowing, increased so much that the money supply
doubled between 1972 and 1975. The deterioration of the budget was primarily
responsible for the sharp inflation which ran at a yearly rate of over 30%
throughout 1975.
10.       In recognition of these problems, the Government has implemented
a series of reforms beginning late 1973: (i) procurement prices of major
agricultural commodities have over the last few years been increased sub-
stantially; (ii) management and organizational reforms of the State economic
enterprises have been introduced, including specific guidelines directing
these enterprises to operate along more commercial lines; (iii) the invest-
ment strategy has been shifted to accord priority to agriculture, livestock,
forestry, transport, fishery, and mining in contrast to the past emphasis on
industry; (iv) finally, in April 1976, a major tax reform was enacted, which
substituted a new Commodity and Service Tax, with substantially higher rates,
for most of the indirect taxes. On the basis of preliminary figures, the
tax reform is expected to increase Government revenues by 40% in 1976/77 over
the pre-reform plan targets. An important by-product of the new tax measures
has been a comprehensive recalculation of production costs of the State eco-
nomic enterprises which should result in more realistic prices and improved
financial performance. If successful, these efforts to mobilize more resources
for development, reduce inflation, and improve economic management will clear
the way for more rapid growth of investment and production.
11.       The economic situation in 1975/76 showed a marked improvement over
the performance in the previous decade. Though the recent reforms may have
played a part, this was primarily due to favorable weather conditions and the
resulting excellent harvest. Real GDP growth was 6%, the highest since 1968.
Furthermore, investment in 1975/76 increased by about 20 to 25% in real terms;
and this was achieved with a 40% reduction in the budget deficit. As a
consequence of the improved fiscal situation inflation has now been reduced
to an annual rate of about 20%. Furthermore, the most recent harvest appears
to have been a record, and economic prospects for 1976/77 are quite favorable.
12.       Despite these favorable developments, much remains to be done to
put the economy firmly on the path to sustained and more rapid growth. It
will be some time before the recent reforms are fully implemented and begin
to have a significant impact. Iloreover further measures are needed to bring
domestic prices in line with international prices, to raise the level of
domestic savings and to diversify and increase exports. If pursued vigorously
and duly supplemented with additional measures, the Government's new policy
orientation should lead to a significant acceleration of economic growth. In
this context, substantial foreign transfers of resources into Burma would be
helpful in complementing domestic efforts. Given Burma's low income level and
the scarcity of foreign exchange, these transfers should be on concessionary
terms and should, in addition, finance part of local cost requirements which
cannot, at present, be covered adequately by domestic savings; local cost
financing is particularly needed for the agricultural sector where most in-
vestments have a low foreign exchange component.



-4-
13.       During the last five years aid commitments averaged US$60 million
a year, mostly on concessional terms. Total external debt as of March 1975
was US$537 million, including an undisbursed balance of about US$217 million.
The debt service ratio has increased recently to about 20%, partially as a
result of the poor performance of exports. Since most of the aid currently
in prospect is on concessional terms, and with the projected improvement in
export earnings, the debt service ratio is expected to decline during the next
five years. Burma's gross foreign exchange reserves were approximately US$147
million in November 1976, equivalent to about six months' imports, at the
level planned for 1976/77.
14.       Burma's development potential is considerable.    The Burmese are
well educated. Production potential in agriculture is excellent, especially
for paddy. Exploitation of forest wealth is under way and could be expanded
further. Known mineral reserves can support a large increase in output and
exports, and total mineral deposits, although not yet identified sufficiently,
are likely to be substantial. The Bank Group, in close cooperation with the
IMF, is pursuing discussions with the Government regarding further improvement
in economic policies which would help Burma realize its promising potential
for economic development. At the Government's request, the Bank has organized
an aid group for Burma to assist the Government in meeting its development
objectives. Participants in the first meeting of this group which was held
on November 30, 1976, in Tokyo, broadly endorsed recent improvements in Govern-
ment policy and indicated that they would continue to support the Government's
development efforts.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, of IFC in 1956, and of
IDA in 1962. Between 1956 and 1961, the Bank made three loans totalling
US$33.1 million, all for transportation projects. A loan for the Port of
Rangoon helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and storage facil-
ities, and the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment. Two loans
helped finance the postwar reconstruction and dieselization of the railways.
All three projects were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully dis-
bursed by FY68. No lending was requested between 1962 and 1973. Since 1973,
IDA has made eight credits totalling US$142.5 million. IFC has made no invest-
ments in Burma, nor are any planned. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of December 31, 1976, and notes on the execu-
tion of on-going projects; implementation of these projects is proceeding
without major difficulties. In addition, the Bank is Executing Agency for
a UNDP-financed multi-sectoral preinvestment and technical assistance project
aimed at the development of a pipeline of priority projects suitable for ex-
ternal assistance.
16.       The Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most immediate
constraints to growth and particularly at increasing and diversifying pro-
duction for export in order to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange.



- 5 -
To achieve this, the Bank Group is placing primary emphasis on the develop-
ment of agriculture, forestry, and mining. The Bank Group is also financing
infrastructure improvements such as transportation and telecommunications,
mainly to rehabilitate facilities whose inadequacy has been increasingly
impeding economic development. The proposed credit will be the first Bank
Group operation in the Burmese mining sector.
17.       A Fourth Railways project is being appraised.    Other projects under
active preparation include an irrigation project in Upper Burma, a second
paddyland development project, a cereal seeds project, a forestry project,
a fertilizer project, and a highways rehabilitation project.
18.       The Bank Group presently accounts for about 15% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 7% of debt service. In five years,
the Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to
about 20% and its share in the debt service to fall to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE MINING SECTOR
19.       Although only a few areas of the country have been systematically
prospected, it is clear that Burma has a highly varied and favorable endow-
ment of minerals. In the 1930's, Burma was an important world producer of
tungsten, lead, and tin, and also exported significant amounts of copper,
nickel, cobalt, antimony, silver, and gemstones. At that time, the mining
sector contributed 12%.of all export earnings and 6% of GDP. During World
War II, and the period of insurgency which followed, the mining sector was
ruined. After the war neither the private sector nor the Government made
a strenuous effort to restore abandoned works. Between 1950 and 1965
the State gradually took over mining operations but investments were not
adequate to develop the sector's potential.
20.       The effects of the war and decades of neglect are evident.    The
volume of output is at one tenth of pre-war levels. The sector only con-
tributes 1% of GDP, 1% of employment, and 7% of export earnings. Mines are
in very poor condition because normal replacement and maintenance has not
been carried out. Given its favorable endowment Burma remains a competitive
producer, partly as a result of low wage rates. However the benefits fore-
gone by past neglect and inadequate management are enormous. Over half of
the official tin and tungsten output is produced by "tribute" 1/ miners using
primitive techniques. Unofficial sales by these individuals may be even greater
than their sales to State corporations since the price received for tin and
tungsten smuggled to Thailand is about four times the official Burmese price.
The Bank is discussing with the Burmese authorites steps, including price
adjustment, by which this flow of tin and tungsten can be directed to official
1/   Tribute miners are individuals who are allowed to mine in certain areas
but are legally bound to sell their output to the mining corporations.



- 6 -
purchasers. In recent years the only variations in the sector's performance
have been an erratic but generally upward movement in the value of official
gem sales, and a continuing decline in official output of tin and tungsten
concentrates.
21.       More recently, there has been a significant change in the Government's
attitude towards the sector. In contrast with the post-war period of neglect
and indifference the Government is now seeking rapid development of the
sector's potential for export earnings. The lack of a systematic inventory
of the country's reserves will not be an obstacle to development in the
short or medium term.   Known reserves alone have an estimated potential
export value of US$1.5 billion at present mineral prices.    Of this amount,
over 60% represents reserves of lead, zinc, and silver at the Bawdwin mine,
almost 20% represents known reserves of tin and tungsten, and copper reserves
account for most of the remaining 20%.   Exploitation of these reserves is
therefore central to any development strategy for the sector. Exploitation of
the Bawdwin reserves presents complex management, infrastructural, and tech-
nical problems. In order to yield quick returns the best approach is to begin
with the further development of tin and tungsten. This strategy can be
expected to yield higher returns in the near future, and involves less risk.
It is also more practical in view of the need for management and professional
staff to acquire new techniques. While in the near term the Burmese capacity
to implement projects in the mining sector will be fully occupied with devel-
oping the potential of tin and tungsten reserves, the medium term program
should include plans for the development of the Bawdwin mine, copper reserves
at Monywa, and antimony and gemstones.
22.       A number of problems face the Burmese, in exploiting the sector's
potential.  There is a critical shortage of foreign exchange and limited
experience in executing and managing new projects in the sector. As a result
the Government has taken steps to enlist assistance and funds from overseas.
The bulk of foreign technical assistance has come from UNDP, Germany,
Japan, and Canada.   Germany has invested in the expansion of the Heinda Tin
mine, and has assisted in studies of the Bawdwin and Hermyingyi mines.     The
Japanese have appraised possible development of the Monywa copper mine.
Canada and the UNDP are both involved in exploration, and the UNDP has fi-
nanced feasibility studies and a training program for prospectors. Security
problems constrain the development of the sector and it is therefore not
possible at the moment to prepare a systematic inventory of reserves and a
long-term development strategy. However, insurgency activities have not been
significant in the area of the proposed project. Another problem of the
sector is that existing exchange rates coupled with relatively high taxes and
import duties lead to a divergence of financial and economic rates of return,
which is proportionately greater at lower rates of return. While this does
not seriously affect the proposed project, which has a good economic rate
of return and a reasonable financial rate of return, it could in particular
cases lead to the selection of an inappropriate technology or the deferral of
economically attractive projects. The Government is aware of the problem and
is taking steps to ensure adequate financial returns, including establishment
of an Export Equalization Fund.



- 7 -
23.       Although there are many problems and issues to be resolved in the
process of rehabilitating Burma's mining sector, an appropriate development
strategy for the medium term can be clearly outlined. The first stage
requires the rehabilitation of tin and tungsten mining operations and a
careful program of institution building and technical training. The pro-
posed IDA project meets these requirements. In due course, with either the
rehabilitation of Bawdwin or the expansion of Monywa, and improvement of a
number of smaller operations in antimony and gemstones, the export earnings of
the sector could rise to US$100 million per annum, compared with US$15 million
at present. A total investment of at least US$200 million would be required
to implement these projects. The Bank has a necessary and major role to play
if this strategy is to be implemented, and the objectives of the Burmese
in this sector are to be achieved.
PART IV - INSTITUTIONS OF THE MINING SECTOR
24.       The Ministry of Mines controls mineral production.   In 1972 five
distinct mining corporations under the control of the Ministry of Mines were
created. These are: the No. 1 Mining Corporation responsible for lead,
zinc, and silver production from Bawdwin, with about 50% of the value of
sector output; the No. 2 Mining Corporation (MC2) responsible for tin and
tungsten production, with 30% to 40% of sector output by value; the No. 3
Mining Corporation responsible for antimony, coal, and copper; the No. 4
Mining Corporation responsible for limestone, gypsum, and other nonmetallic
products; and the Gem and Jade Corporation responsible for production and
marketing of jade, pearls, and gemstones. The export sale of minerals (except
in the case of the Gem and Jade Corporation) has been the separate responsi-
bility of the Myamna Export Import Corporation. The separation of responsi-
bility for production and sale has reduced the incentive to produce ores and
concentrates of good grade and quality; and is also part of the reason for an
accumulation of uneconomic levels of stocks. As part of the institutional
changes since 1972, the Government decided to give the corporations joint
control over sales, through their representation on a Minerals Marketing
Committee which is taking over mineral sales from the Myamna Export Import
Corporation. In order to strengthen this arrangement the Government has
agreed to grant the Minerals Marketing Committee authority to improve market-
ing efficiency and to enter into long term smelter contracts at its discretion
(Section 4.01 of the Development Credit Agreement). Two more agencies complete
the institutional framework: the Department of Geological Survey and Mineral
Exploration, which carries out prospecting for the corporations; and the
Department of Planning and Works Inspection which is responsible for mine
inspection, safety, planning, and statistics.
25.       Continued evolution of the institutional structure can be expected
as sector output expands. One important influence on future evolution will
be the recently issued Guidelines for the Operation of State Economic Enter-
prises. These Guidelines are intended to introduce greater autonomy to State
economic enterprises by requiring them to operate on a commercial basis.



- 8 -
However, it is difficult at this stage to judge how quickly senior manage-
ment will adapt to the new climate since they are accustomed to a closely
controlled, centralized system.
26.       The operations which have been amalgamated under the control of
the No. 2 Mining Corporation have been consistently profitable for many
years. However, declining output, failing plant, and future cost increases
(including higher taxes) could eliminate profits unless steps are taken now
to improve output and efficiency. As is usual in Burma, there has been strong
central control of operations, covering such details as wage rates, staffing
levels, and budgets, combined with inflexible and unrealistic production and
financial targets. The accounts of the corporation have been improved over
the past year, but further development of the accounting system will be
undertaken, with the help of consultants, to provide information for improved
management control. MC2 has sufficient staff who are technically competent,
but they lack recent experience in tin mining. The new equipment and tech-
niques to be introduced by the proposed project are appropriate to existing
conditions and no serious transitional problems are expected. Attracting
sufficient labor has been a problem in some areas, largely owing to fixed wage
rates which do not make allowance for specially difficult working conditions,
or alternative opportunities (e.g., illegal mining). Provision has been made
in the proposed credit for MC2 to prepare, with the help of consultants, a
manpower plan to improve its operational efficiency (Section 4.04 of the
Development Credit Agreement).
PART V - THE PROJECT
27.       The project was identified in the course of a UNDP-financed program
of exploration in 1972-75, and was prepared by a UNDP-financed study in 1975/
1976. It was appraised in March and April 1976 and a post-appraisal mission
visited Burma in August 1976. A report entitled "Burma: Appraisal of the Tin
and Tungsten Expansion Project" (No. 1351-BA) dated February 8, 1977 is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project
summary is attached in Annex III. At negotiations held in Washington in
January 1977 the Government was represented by a delegation led by Colonel
Than Tin, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Mines.
Project Description
28.       The proposed project is intended to re-introduce dredging and
assist the rehabilitation of the tin mining industry of Burma. The project
components are:
a.   A dredge and its ancillary concentrating and infrastructural
facilities at Heinze Basin (300 km S.E. of Rangoon) to produce
about 650 long tons per year (LTPY) of tin concentrate from
1980/81, as well as an on-board jig treatment plant, a shore-
based treatment mill, a tug boat, personnel boats, a work boat,
barges, a small township, and power and water supply.



- 9 -
b.   Improvements to the operations of the Kanbauk mine, close to
the Heinze Basin, sufficient to add 100 LTPY to its present
output of 200 LTPY, by 1980/81. Improvements will come through
improved power and water supply, and better support and
supervision from the nearby Heinze Basin operation.
c.   A new tin/tungsten concentrating and upgrading plant at
Tavoy, 80 km South of the Heinze Basin, to split mixed
concentrates and improve the grade and quality of all tin
and tungsten concentrates produced by the Corporation.
Support items include power and water supply and vehicles.
d.   New equipment for gravel pump mining operations near Tavoy
which will lead to an increase of 150 LTPY in concentrate
production by 1980/81. Specific items include diesel gen-
erators, drills, hydraulic monitors, pumps, and jig plants.
e.   Training for key supervisory and operating staff and tech-
nical assistance for engineering, procurement, start-up,
initial operations of the project, and for improvement of
the corporation's operating and financial controls.
f.   Consultant services to study future development of the mining
sector.
Project Execution and Implementation
29.       MC2 will be responsible for the execution of the project.   The
management of MC2 have some recent experience of project implementation
through their involvement with Germany in expanding the Heinda mine, but
the technical staff of MC2 have no recent experience in dredging or with
the modern concentrator included in the project. To assist in project
implementation, consultants will be engaged to assist in detailed planning
and scheduling, engineering procurement, construction supervision, commis-
sioning, and at least the first two years of plant operation (Section 3.03
of the Development Credit Agreement). The employment of these consultants,
and the acquisition by MC2 of a suitable site for the Tavoy concentrator are
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Credit (Section 6.01, items (b) &
(c) of the Development Credit Agreement). Prior to commencement of operation,
MC2 with the consultants' assistance would determine ways of improving the
physical export of tin and tungsten including the feasibility of direct export
from Tavoy (Section 3.03 (a) of the Development Credit Agreement). In addi-
tion, the Government has undertaken to upgrade the road from the Heinze Basin
to Tavoy to all weather standards (Section 3.02 of the Development Credit
Agreement). To assist the Government in carrying out the study of the future
development of the mining sector, it was agreed that the Government shall
employ consultants, acceptable to the Association, by December 31, 1977
(Section 3.01 (e) of the Development Credit Agreement).

Cost, Financing and Relending
30.       The estimated cost for the project is US$27.8 million, equivalent,
(of which US$0.2 million, equivalent, is for the study of the future develop-
ment of the sector) with a foreign exchange component of US$16.0 million,
equivalent. The local cost component of US$11.8 million, equivalent, includes
about US$6 million, equivalent, for duties and taxes on imported equipment.
The proposed IDA credit of US$16.0 million equivalent would finance the entire
foreign exchange component or about 73% of total costs net of import duties
and taxes. Of the total proceeds of the credit, US$15.8 million, equivalent,
would be relent to MC2 at an interest rate of 10% per annum, repayable over
fifteen years, including five years of grace, with MC2 bearing the foreign
exchange risk (Section 3.01(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). The
remaining US$0.2 million equivalent would be used by the Government to finance
consultant services to study future development of the sector. The local cost
would be financed in part from MC2's internal cash generation (US$5.8 million
equivalent) and in part from Government funds equal to the taxes and duties it
will receive from the project. It has been agreed that MC2 will not incur
debts unless its debt/equity ratio does not exceed 60/40 and debt service
payments are covered twice by internal cash generation; and that MC2 will
maintain a current ratio of 2:1 (Sections 4.10 (a), and (b) and 4.09 (a) of
the Development Credit Agreement). In addition no new major investments will
be undertaken before project completion without the Association's prior
consent (Section 4.08 of the Development Credit Agreement).
31.       The financial position of the Corporation is sound, despite reduc-
tion in output over recent years, and is projected to remain sound both during
and after project execution, although the financial rate of return for the
project is only 10%. Even with a pessimistic projection of future tin and
tungsten prices, earnings should be adequate to provide MC2 with sufficient
funds to meet its debt service payments and to provide for a significant part
of future capital needs.
Procurement and Disbursement
32.       Items to be financed by the Association will be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines, except
for some small items of highly specialized equipment (e.g. certain special-
ized mineral dressing items) with very few eligible suppliers, where inter-
national shopping procedures will be used. The estimated cost of items not
subject to international competitive bidding has been limited to a maximum
of US$1 million equivalent (or about 6% of the total credit).
33.       The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against 100%
of the CIF value of imported equipment, spare parts and materials, and the
foreign exchange cost of consultant services and training.



Marketing
34.       For the time being Burma has elected not to become a member of the
International Tin Council (ITC). Since the country provides such a small
proportion of world output (about 1% of total world supply), non-membership
has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on its ability to
sell its production. The Bank has informed the ITC of its consideration of
the project.
35.       It is expected that world tin demand will show modest growth, sup-
ply and demand will be in reasonable balance, and that there will be contin-
uance of a modest long term upward trend in real tin prices. ITC buffer
stock operations should also, in the future, moderate international price
fluctuations, especially on the downside. Demand for tungsten is expected to
remain strong and the price outlook is good; there are also prospects for
more effective cooperation among producers with the aim of moderating price
fluctuations.
Benefits and Risks
36.       The project represents an important step in the rehabilitation of
the Burmese mining sector. The most significant direct contribution of the
project would be its effect on Burma's mineral export earnings which would
on average increase by about US$6 million equivalent annually, in 1976 prices.
Other aspects of the project should prove to be of increasing significance
and benefit as the development of the sector proceeds. These include: the
promotion of improved management including the introduction of improved
management accounting and control procedures; the development of efficient
mineral marketing; the introduction of appropriate modern technology; the
training of key professional staff; and a study of the future development of
the mining sector.
37.       There are three basic project risks.   First, the Corporation is
inexperienced in the dredging and more modern concentrating operations to be
introduced, and certain weaknesses exist in project implementation management;
these are intended to be overcome by the employment of the engineering and
management consultants. Secondly, insurgency activities could disrupt produc-
tion. However, the Burmese have tight control over the area where the project
is located, and the nearby Heinda mine has not been affected adversely.
Thirdly, tin and tungsten prices could be lower than projected. Offsetting
this is the influence of the ITC, the prospects for increased cooperation
among tungsten producers, and the important fact that the Corporation is a
producer of both tin and tungsten whose prices do not necessarily move together.
38.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be 21%
at the official exchange rate. Sensitivity tests show that the project's
contribution to the economy will remain favorable even under adverse condi-
tions. For example, with a 20% fall in revenue the economic rate of return
only falls to 13%.

PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Socialist
Republic of the Union of Burma and the Association, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       Special conditions of the credit are listed in Section III of
Annex IV. The execution and delivery of the on-lending agreement (Subsidiary
Loan Agreement), the employment of the engineering and management consultants
and the acquisition of a site for the Tavoy concentrator are conditions of
effectiveness.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATIONS
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Cr. No. 413     Inland Water Transport Project; US$16.3 Million Credit of
July 2, 1973; Effective Date: September 17, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
Procurement was slow in the beginning because the Inland Water
Transport Corporation's management was not familiar with IDA procedures.
However, procurement has picked up in recent months and at December 31, 1976
US$8.1 millions equivalent had been disbursed. The implementation of the
project has been affected by high tender prices for certain equipment, and
materials. As a result the scope of the project has been reduced and four
passenger vessels will now be constructed locally instead of importing six
vessels as originally planned.
Cr. No. 414     Third Railways Project; US$16.7 Million Credit of July 2,
1973; Effective Date: September 17, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The physical execution of the project has made good progress. Ex-
cept for diesel locomotives, whose maintenance backlog continues to be the
constraint on BRC's carrying capacity, the rehabilitation of passenger
coaches and freight wagons, as planned under the project, was completed
in December 1976. Of the Credit proceeds of US$16.7 million equivalent,
US$16.4 million is committed and US$14.0 million was disbursed as of end-
December 1976. The Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing
Date of December 31, 1977. Passenger traffic continues its increasing trend
in long distance travel. Freight tonnage shows signs of recovery but ton-
miles are tending to decrease, reflecting increases in shorter distance
traffic; this will be carefully watched. Because of a 13.4% increase in
passenger fares effective July 1, 1976, financial performance for 1976/77
is expected to be better than that for 1975/76.
Cr. No. 483     Lift Irrigation Project; US$17.0 Million Credit of June 21,
1974; Effective Date: August 6, 1974; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1978
The project made a very good start. Within three months of the
signing of the Credit Agreement, the Project Committee was established and
functioning effectively; procurement actions were initiated for US$12.6 million
equivalent of equipment and spare parts. The contract for procurement of
10,000 pumps was awarded in January 1975. By December 31, 1976, nearly half
of the pumps had been delivered, and about 3,000 pumps had been sold to farmers.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4 pages
The program for the repair of Irrigation Department construction equipment is
under way, but suffering delays owing to a shortage of key spare parts being
purchased under the Credit. The program to rehabilitate and extend flood
embankments was set back by the 1976 monsoon which came earlier than expected
in the year. Despite these problems, it is still possible that the project
will be completed on schedule. At December 31, 1976 a total of US$8.6 millions
equivalent had been disbursed.
Cr. No. 493    Forestry Project; US$24.0 Million Credit of July 10, 1974;
Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date: March 31,
1981
Progress on the project has been improving: rehabilitation of
existing trucks and tractors has been completed and the first lot of road
and extraction machinery was delivered in time for the 1976-77 timber ex-
traction operation. In September 1976 GOB signed a service contract with a
Canadian Consultancy Group to undertake the forest industry feasibility
studies which commenced in January, 1977. Project implementation however
continues to lag behind schedule due to delays in equipment procurement and
in construction of access roads. Main reasons for these delays were cur-
tailed budget allocations and difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange per-
mits for imports. Solutions for both of these problems are being actively
pursued; a supplementary budget allocation was made in November 1976 which
has allowed procurement to go forward. Disbursement as of December 31, 1976
totalled only $5.2 million but are expected to improve significantly by end
June 1977.
Cr. No. 551    Telecommunications Project; US$21.0 Million Credit of May 30,
1975; Effective Date: July 23, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project has had a good start and procurement of equipment items
and coordination with Burmese construction agencies for construction works
under the project are on schedule. Bids for most of the equipment to be
procured under the project have been received and are being evaluated. Cost
over runs of about US$3 millions seem likely and the possibility of bilateral
assistance is being actively explored by GOB and the Association. Telecom-
munications have consistently earned a good return on assets employed, and
new tariffs introduced in April 1976, as well as improvements to the account-
ing system, are likely to maintain this record.
Cr. No. 597    Livestock Project; US$7.5 Million Credit of December 30,
1975; Effective Date: March 26, 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1981
There have been delays in getting the Project Unit organized and
progress has been slow, though with some recent improvement. The Director of
Field Services has been appointed; the first team of veterinary extension
staff has visited the National Dairy Development Board in Anand, India for

training ; subject matter specialists have been selected; and inseminators
trained. Construction of veterinary posts and housing has started; and
important consultant appointments have been made. Improvement in the rate
of implementation is promised but management performance needs to be, and is
being, closely watched.
Cr. No. 642    Paddyland Development Project; US$30.0 Million Credit of
June 21, 1976; Effective Date: August 20, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The Project Implementation Committee and the Project Unit have been
established. Lists of equipment and supplies required for the aerial photo-
graphic survey were reviewed in Burma by Bank consultant, in November 1976.
Procurement actions are now being initiated for construction and survey
equipment. The Government is now preparing their evaluation of the consult-
ants proposal for the hydrological investigations study. A Bank consultant
will visit Burma in February to assist the Government in preparing the terms
of reference for the Paddy Storage and Handling Study.
Cr. No. 671     Second Ports Project; US$10.0 Million Credit of January 13,
1977; Expected Date of Effectiveness; April 13, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The credit is expected to be effective by April 13, 1977.
