IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT NO. 2101-LA)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second
Telecommunications Project in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), for which
Credit 2101-LA in the amount of SDR 19.1 million was approved on March 3, 1990 and made
effective on October 23, 1990.
The credit was closed on February 28, 1998, two months after the original closing
date. Disbursements under the credit totaled SDR 19.06 m (US$27. 17m equivalent). The
undisbursed balance of SDR 0.04 m is expected to be canceled on July 1, 1998, at the end of
the grace period. Cofinancing for the project was provided by the Japanese Government
(grant of Yen 1,736 million) and UNDP (grant of US$ 1.2 million equivalent).
The ICR was prepared by Veronique Bishop (Task Manager) of the East Asia and
Pacific Region Energy Unit (EASEG), with input from the client and data prepared by Sati
Achath (Consultant, EASEG). The ICR was reviewed by A. Shanmugarajah and Peter Smith
of the Telecommunications and Informatics Division (IENTI) and cleared by Yoshihiko Sumi,
Sector Manager (EASEG) and Guy Darlan, Acting Country Director (EACSM).
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission in January-February 1998. It is based on information collected during this mission
and material in the project file. The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by
providing data, commenting on drafts of this report, presenting views reflected in the
mission's Aide Memoire (Appendix A), and providing an Evaluation Report discussing the
project's execution and completion (Appendix B). The cofinanciers also provided comments
(Appendix C).

IMPLEMENTAT'ION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(C]REDIT 2101-LA)
Evaltiation Summary
Introduction
1.   IDA extended its first credit for the Lao telecommunications sector in 1986, with a
Telecommunications Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance Credit (No. 1684-LA; SDR 3.5
million or US$3.9 million equivalent). The project, executed in cooperation with the
Government of Japan, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), succeeded in rehabilitating and expanding the
telecommunications system in Vientiane and introducing operator-assisted long-distance
telecommunications in the four main provincial capitals. In addition, under the project,
consultants and IDA staff assisted the project's direct beneficiary, Entreprise d'Etat des Postes
et Telecommunications Lao (EPTL), in preparing a Development Plan for 1990-95.
Project Development Objectives and Deseription
2.    The Second Telecommunications Project was designed to support EPTL in
implementing the Development Plan for 1990-95. The project's objectives were to: (a) carry
out priority investments in the sector and improve international telecommunications services;
(b) strengthen EPTL's capabilities in the areas of planning, project implementation,
operations, maintenance and financial management; and (c) develop EPTL's human resources.
These objectives were consistent with the sector strategy of the Government of Lao PDR anid
the Bank's country assistance strategy for Lao PDR.
3.    The project comprised three main components: telecommunications facilities,
technical assistance and training. The telecommunications facilities component was designed
to provide: (a) digital switching facilities and cable plant with exchange capacity of 15,000
lines; (b) a digital microwave long distance transmission network interconnecting six key
cities, providing 30 telephone circuits for long distance and international communications; (c)
ancillary equipment and civil works to support the above investments; and (d) supervision of
maintenance and operations. The technical assistance component was to provide about 8.2
staff-months of consultant services for (a) management of the investment program and (b)
institutional development including management, corporate planning, finance and accounting.
The training component was designed to support about 300 staff-months of technical training.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.   Implementation results substantial]y exceeded appraisal estimates. The
telecommunications facilities component introduced long-distance and international service to
provincial Laos, which had previously relied exclusively on only about 110 telegraph stations.



- vi -
Under this component, ETL installed: (a) 23,200 lines of digital exchange capacity and related
cable plant (54% more than appraisal estimates); (b) a digital microwave backbone network
connecting six key cities providing 480 circuits of long-distance capacity, of which 450
circuits are international capacity (15 times appraisal estimates); (c) ancillary equipment
including 150 public payphones; and (d) 4 buildings including a new headquarters building
and 3 buildings in provincial cities housing telephone exchanges. Under the technical
assistance component, 202 staff-months of consultant services were provided to EPTL in
technical, financial and accounting matters including billing and collections (24 times
appraisal estimates). Under the training component, ETL staff received 336 staff months of
training (12% more than appraisal estimates), largely in the form of graduate fellowships
financed by UNDP.
5.    Although sector liberalization was not an explicit objective of the project at the time of
appraisal, the Government of Lao PDR has taken the initiative during the project
implementation period to substantially commercialize the telecommunications sector and open
it to private investors. Its actions include: (a) separating telecommunications and postal
operations into two companies, Entreprise des Telecommunications Lao (ETL) and Entreprise
des Postes Lao (EPL); (b) partially privatizing ETL by entering into a 51%/49% joint venture
with Shinawatra of Thailand called Lao Telecommunications Co., Ltd. (LTC); and (c)
increasing tariffs and indexing them to the US dollar to protect them from depreciation of the
local currency. The Borrower, the Beneficiary and the private investors clearly took actions
beyond the project's scope to restructure and liberalize the sector.
6.    The project benefits are likely to be sustainable because of the Government's clear
commitment to reform, the involvement of a private-sector telecommunications operator in
LTC (which contributes experience and incentives for efficiency), and tariff levels which are
adequate to finance operations and maintenance, as well as a share of ETL's projected capital
expenditure.
Project Costs and Financing
7.    T'he estimated project cost at appraisal was US$ 41.4 m, of which (a) SDR 19.1 m
(equivalent to US$24.5 m at appraisal) was to be financed by IDA, (b) JPY 1,736 m
(estimated to US$11.7 m at appraisal) by a Japanese Government Grant, (c) US$1.2 m by a
UNDP Grant, and (d) the remaining US$4.0 m by EPTL. The appreciation of the SDR
relative to the US Dollar (in which most contracts were denominated) enabled ETL to increase
the US$ value of its expenditures under the IDA credit by US$3.3m relative to appraisal
estimates. Similarly, the appreciation of the Japanese Yen relative to the US$ resulted in an
increase in the US$ value of the Japanese Grant, to US$ 12.69 m equivalent. The total cost of
the project including interest during construction was US$45.4m.
IDA and Borrower Performance
8.   T'he performance of the Borrower and the Beneficiary were highly satisfactory. The
Beneficiary worked effectively with IDA to identify and resolve problems, enabling it to



- vii -
overcome initial delays in project effectiveness and implementation. The Borrower and
Beneficiary complied with the covenants included in the Development Credit and Project
Agreements, with the exception of the accounts receivable turnover covenant from 1991 to
1995, and delay in compliance with covenants related to financial accounting and reporting.
The Beneficiary channeled project cost savings and contractor penalties to additional
productive investments, enabling it to significantly exceed the project's physical targets and
improve efficiency. Moreover, the Borrower and the Beneficiary made substantial institutional
reforms and physical investments well beyond the scope of the project.
9.    IDA's performance was satisfactory. During project identification and preparation,
ETL and IDA set realistic project objectives and developed a robust design. These factors led
to strong commitment by the Borrower and Beneficiary. During project supervision, IDA
could have provided more assistance in responding to the emerging need for sector regulation,
and in identifying new sources of financing for LTC's future investments.
Assessment of Project Outcome
10.   The project outcome is judged highly satisfactory. The project greatly exceeded its
physical and institutional targets, despite initial implementation delays. ETL' s
implementation capacity improved substantially under the project, enabling it not only to
successfully implement the project investrnents but also to attract, coordinate and implement
an additional US$26.6m investments financed by 6 other donors. As a result, telephone
penetration in Laos has tripled and quality of service has greatly improved since the inception
of the project. The project also ultimately met its financial targets, although ETL did not
comply with certain financial covenants in the early years of project implementation. The
project paved the way for private investment in the sector, which has already demonstrated
positive results in terms of increased efficiency and productivity. Upon completion of the
project investments, the related assets will be transferred from ETL to LTC in respect of a
portion of the Government's contribution tO the equity of the company. (para. 11)
Summary of Findings and Lessons Learned
11.   The Second Telecommunications Project demonstrates, as shown elsewhere, that
robust project design and strong beneficiaiy commitment are critical to project success.
Flexible specifications permitted the beneliciary to capitalize on technological advances that
enabled it to greatly exceed the project's original physical targets. Given the Government's
interest in commercializing the economy, and the telecommunications sector in particular, the
Bank could have provided more support in sector reform, notably by supervising the project
more regularly and encouraging the Government to adopt a more competitive market
structure.

IMPLEMENT'ATION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(CREDIT 2101-LA)
PART I: PROJECT I'MPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement and Evaluation of Obiectives
1.    Proiect Setting. In 1986, the Government of Lao PDR undertook a program of far-
reaching economic liberalization called the New Economic Mechanism. Recognizing the
need to improve the national telecommunications system rapidly and comprehensively in
order to support anticipated economic growth, the Government developed a strategy for the
telecommunications sector which emphasized the need to: (a) meet the growing demand for
telecommunications services through the establishment of a modern network with high-quality
digital technology; (b) strengthen the operations of EPTL; and (c) separate EPTL's
telecommunications activities from its postal operations. To execute this strategy, the
Government requested IDA assistance in developing and financially supporting a medium-
term investment program which would provide the backbone of a nationwide
telecommunications network and would allow for rational donor coordination. Under the
Telecommunications and Technical Assistance Project (supported by IDA Credit 1684-LA),
EPTL developed a telecommunications development plan for the period 1990-95, assisted by
their consultants and IDA staff.
2.    IDA's overall strategy for its operations in Lao PDR at that time were (a) to foster
economic integration through an emphasis on vital infrastructure development; (b) to support
government efforts to upgrade operations of public enterprises; (c) to stimulate developnment
in distant regions; and (d) to foster growth of the private sector and development of human
resources.
3.    Project Obiectives. The objectives of the Second Telecommunications Project, as
stated in the Staff Appraisal Report presented to the IDA Board of Directors on February 6,
1990, were to: (a) carry out priority investments in the sector, particularly the first phase of a
nationwide digital telephone-network, and improve international telecommunications services;
(b) strengthen EPTL's capabilities in the areas of planning, project implementation,
operations, maintenance and financial mnanagement; and (c) develop EPTL's human resources.
4.    Although sector reform was not stated explicitly as a project objective, IDA engaged
the Government to commercialize the sector through a number of project conditions and
covenants, including: (a) a condition of effectiveness requiring an 80% increase in domestic
telecommunications tariffs; (b) covenants requiring debt service coverage of 1.5 times and
self-financing of 5%-15%; (c) a dated covenant requiring separation of EPTL's postal and
telecommunications accounts by Januaiy 1, 1994; and (d) implementation of a plan to improve
its accounting system and auditing procedures.



-2 -
5.    Evaluation of Obiectives. These objectives were consistent with the Government's
sector strategy as well as the Bank's country assistance strategy described above. The project
objectives were realistic and reasonable in the context of the underdeveloped state of the Lao
telecom sector and the then-prevailing views on telecommunications sector reform. During
the early stages of the New Economic Mechanism, the scope for private investment in Lao
PDR was limited. Moreover, the global lessons of the benefits of telecom sector
liberalization were only just becoming apparent.
6.    In hindsight, however, given the ensuing global trend toward telecom sector
liberalization as well as the opening of the Lao economy to private investment, the process of
liberalization of the Lao telecom sector might have benefited from (a) project objectives which
focused more explicitly on sector commercialization and restructuring, and (b) greater Bank
participation in sector liberalization, in particular by assisting the Government to develop the
sector's legal and regulatory framework for the sector, which has been identified by the
Borrower as a priority (see Appendix B, Borrower's Contribution, Section VII.1).
B. Achievement of Obiectives
7.    Project Components. The project sought to achieve its objectives through the
following components which were included in the Project Agreement signed between EPTL
and IDA:
a.    Component A: Telecommunications Facilities This was the main component (over
90% of project costs, and included four sub-components:
(i) Switching Facilities and Cable Plant: (i) installation of digital telephone
exchanges in Vientiane and four provincial capitals, and transfer of a small digital
exchange from Vientiane to a fifth capital; total capacity of about 15,000 lines;
and (ii) construction of local networks, subscriber connections and installation of
public call facilities in the six cities.
(ii) Long Distance Transmission Network: (i) installation of a digital microwave
route mentioned above, with initial capacity of 30 circuits for national and
international traffic; and (ii) construction of access roads to, and foundations of,
certain microwave from Luang Prabang, via Vientiane, to Pakse, interconnecting
the six cities repeater stations.
(iii) Ancillary Equipment and Civil Works: (i) ancillary equipment for the above
facilities and the general administration of the network, including about 50 public
telephones and booths; and (ii) buildings for telephone exchanges and cable
storage.
(iv) Supervision of Maintenance and Operations: Supervision of maintenance and
operation of switching facilities and transmission network for one year after
commissioning, provided by suppliers.



-3 -
b.    Component B: Technical Assistance. This component provided for a total of about
180 staff-weeks for (i) management of the total scope of the work related to EPTL' s
Program; and (ii) institutional development, including strengthening of EPTL's
capabilities in management, corporate planning, finance and accounting, engineering,
operation and maintenance.
c.    Component C: Training. In addition to training provided by the equipment suppliers
(switching: about 20 staff-months (s-m) overseas and about 5 s-m on site;
transmission: about 10 s-m overseas and 5 s-m on site), the Project included aboul: 6 s-
m of assistance in Lao PDR by a training expert, as well as substantial foreign training
for EPTL's staff (total of 300 s-rn).
8.    These project components directly and unambiguously addressed the project's
objectives.
9.    Achievement of Proiect Targets. Despite initial delays in project effectiveness and
startup, the project has greatly exceeded its physical and institutional targets and introduced
long-distance and international telephone service to provincial Laos, which had previously
relied exclusively on and telegraph for long-distance communications (see table 6 and
Implementation Record below).
10.   Component A: Telecommunications Facilities. As of December 1996, EPTL1ETL, had
completed installation of the major equipment under this component, including: (a) 23,200
lines of digital exchange capacity and related cable plant (55% more than the target of 15,000
lines); (b) the digital microwave backbone transmission network interconnecting six key
cities, providing 480 circuits of long distance capacity, of which 450 circuits of international
capacity (15 times more than the target of 30 circuits); (c) 150 public payphones (3 times the
target of 50); (d) 10 public call offices; and (e) 4 buildings including a new headquarters
building and 3 other buildings in provincial towns housing telephone exchanges. Suppliers of
the major equipment also assisted in supervising operations and management for the first year
after commissioning the digital exchanges and transmission network.
11.   Quality of service improvements have also greatly exceeded targets, largely as a result
of system digitization (see Table 6--Quality of Service). Call completion rates for local, long
distance and international calls increased from an estimated 30-40% in 1990 to 80-90% in
1997. Line faults declined from 14 per 100 lines in 1992 to 1 per 100 in 1997; and faults
cleared within 3 days increased from 59% in 1992 to 95% in 1997.
12.  In addition to the investments under the project, ETL is successfully implementing an
expanded investment program which includes an additional US$ 26.6 million equivalent in
financing from bilateral donors including the Governments of Japan, Germany, France and
Vietnam, to expand the IDA-financed microwave routes, the rural telecommunications
network and the international links (see Table 8B and Annex C3). Together with the project,
these investments have: (a) more than trebled the exchange capacity of the Lao network,



-4 -
boosting telephone penetration from 0.17 lines per 100 population in 1990 to 0.50 per 100 in
1997; (b) introduced domestic long-distance telecommunications service (where only 1 circuit
of capacity had existed prior to the project); and (c) introduced telephone service to rural
areas.
13.   Component B: Technical Assistance Component MCTPC and ETL engaged
consultants who provided 202 s-m of advisory assistance for accounting, billing and
collections. Under this component, EPTL upgraded its accounting system in 1991 to
internationally accepted standards, and began producing monthly financial statements for
headquarters. In 1993, this system was computerized. EPTL also introduced internal control
procedures and cash management practices, as well as specialized financial reports designed to
anticipate liquidity problems and to assess the company's overall financial position. Since
1991, the Audit Department of the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Finance has certified
the accuracy and reliability of EPTL's accounts. Due to the absence of independent firms with
auditing capabilities, the Bank has accepted this certification as satisfying the audit covenant
with respect to this project and others in Lao PDR. EPTL engaged consultants in July 1991 to
help implement improvements in billing and collection systems.
14.   Component C: Training Under this component, ETL staff received a total of 336 staff-
months of training, including 20 1-year graduate fellowships provided by equipment suppliers,
and 24 staff-months of telecom management training, 72 staff-months of instructor training
and a study tour under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union.
15.   The technical assistance and training provided under the project supported progress in
sector restructuring and in strengthening ETL's human resources, including its project
management, financial and accounting capabilities (see Table 7). Project management
assistance was instrumental in enabling ETL to successfully attract, coordinate and implement
the additional bilateral investments noted above, which permitted EDL to double its
investment program relative to appraisal estimates.
16.   These improvements are evident in ETL's greatly improved financial performance and
operational efficiency. From 1990 to 1997, EPTL/ETL's revenue per line trebled from $274
to $943. Efficiency improvements resulted ini a 15% reduction in operating cost per line and
doubling of staff productivity per line over the same period from 112 staff per 1000 lines in
service in 1990 to 53 in 1996 (see Table 6).
17.   Despite these efforts, from 1990 to 1995 EPTL failed to comply with the covenant
requiring that it maintain receivables at less than 3 months of sales. Finally in 1996,
receivables declined to 2.5 months, due largely to improved enforcement of penalties (fines
and cutoffs) for late payment.
18.  ]Institutional Development. Although institutional reform was not initially included
in the project's objectives the Government and the Beneficiary have instituted a number of
reforns leading to partial privatization and the development of a major investment program.



-5 -
First, as noted above, EPTL reorganized and strengthened its project management and
accounting functions through consultant assistance and training.
19.   Second, effective March 1, 1995, EPTL was divided into two separate state-owned
corporations, Entreprise des Telecommunications Lao (ETL) and Entreprise des Postes Lao
(EPL); in accordance with one of the Government objectives noted above. ETL assumed the
obligations of EPTL under the Project Agreement for the Second Telecommunications
Project.
20.   Third, effective October 8, 1996,, the Government and Shinawatra of Thailand entered
a 51%/49% joint venture called Lao Telecommunications Co., Ltd. (LTC) in the form of a
build-operate-transfer scheme. The Government has agreed to contribute US$46.8 m in kiind
over three years in respect of its 51% share, through the transfer of ETL's assets and
operations. Shinawatra paid US$45 mil lion in respect its 49% equity share, which it will
transfer to the Government without charge after 25 years.
21.   Fourth, the Government and Shinawatra have agreed upon an investment program of
US$400 million over the next 25 years. The first US$100 m of this program is to be invested
over the first five years, financed by retained earnings, depreciation and debt (no additional
equity contributions are envisaged at this time). LTC has secured supplier financing for some
of this investment, however at the time of the completion mission, LTC was seeking an
additional US$34 m of debt financing to support the investment program. The financial crisis
in Thailand may, however, limit LTC's capacity to borrow from commercial sources.
22.   To summarize, the project supported the Government and ETL in accelerating the
development of the Lao telecommunications sector through physical investments as well as
commercialization of the sector. Nonetheless the Bank could have provided more support in
sector liberalization had it supervised the project more systematically.
C. Implementation Record
23.   Proiect Effectiveness and StarlM. The project became effective on October 23,
1990 (3 months later than appraisal estirnates), after the Council of Ministers approved a
100% tariff increase effective January 1, 1991. In addition to this delay in effectiveness, other
delays occurred in project start-up, which were attributed to initial difficulties in project
management. These resulted in contracting delays and non-compliance with some reporting
requirements and financial covenants, such as the introduction of accrual accounting system.
As a number of these delays were caused by the contractors, the contractors incurred penalties
which were generally paid in kind. For example, a penalty for contractor delays in supplying
local exchanges was paid through the provision of an additional 2,000 lines of exchange
capacity.
24.   Disbursements. Due to the initial delays in project effectiveness and startup,
disbursements under the IDA Credit fell somewhat short of appraisal estimates for the first 2



-6 -
1/2 years of project implementation. However, from the end of IDA fiscal year 1993 onward,
disbursements exceeded appraisal estimates (see Table 4).
25.   At the end of 1997, IDA Credit disbursements totaled US$ 26.563 million (SDR
18.951 million), leaving an undisbursed balance of SDR 0.149 million. IDA, the Borrower
and the Beneficiary agreed to extend the credit closing date to permit completion of
disbursements against existing contracts. The closing date was extended by two months to
February 28, 1998. The last disbursement was made on March 24, 1998, and the undisbursed
balance of SDR 0.04m is expected to be canceled on July 1, 1998, at the end of the grace
period.
26. Proiect Costs and Financine. The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$41.4
m, of which (a)SDR 19.1 m was to be financed by an IDA credit, (b) JPY 1,736 m by a
Japanese Government Grant, (c) US$1.2 m by a UNDP Grant, and (d) the remaining US$4.0
m equivalent by EPTL.
27.   Actual project costs in terms of the currencies offinancing, were equal to appraisal
estimates. Project costs in terms of US$, however, exceeded appraisal estimates because the
US dollar depreciated against the Japanese Yen and SDR during project implementation. The
estimated US$ equivalent value of the Japanese Grant at the time of disbursement was
US$12.686 m, compared to US$11.7 m at appraisal. The actual US$ equivalent of
disbursements under the IDA Credit was US$27.1 m, compared to US$24.5 m estimated at
appraisal. As a result of the depreciation of the US$, actual project costs in terms of US$ were
US$ 45.56 m, which exceeded appraisal estimates by US$ 4.16 m (see Table 8B).
28.   The IDA credit of SDR 19.1 m covered 60% of total project costs, including 59% of
foreign exchange financing and 64% of local costs. Project costs for the microwave links were
substantially below appraisal estimates. EPTL reallocated these project cost savings, and the
savings associated with the appreciation of the SDR, to purchase additional telephone
exchanges and outside plant, consistent with the project description in the Credit Agreement.
29.   The Japanese Government provided a grant of Yen 1,736 (US$ 11.7 million
equivalent, 28% of total project costs) which financed the digital switching equipment for
Vientiane and the major provincial cities under the Project. A UNDP Grant funded US$2.1
million (3% of total project costs) of training, technical assistance and miscellaneous small
supplies and equipment. EPTL financed interest during construction and the local costs of the
transmission system and the cabling network (10% of total project costs).
30.   Additional funding for EPTL's investments was provided by other donors. The
Government of France provided a grant of FF 4.8m (US$5.3 m equivalent) which financed a
34 Mb/s microwave link between Vientiane and Paksane (completed December 1991). The
Government of Germany provided grants of US$9.1 m equivalent for rural wireless telephone
systems.

D. Economic and Financial Analysis
31.   The project's financial and economic rates of return substantially exceeded appraisal
estimates. At appraisal, the financial internal rate of return (FRR) was estimated at 12%, based
on expected incremental after-tax cash flows generated by increases in both the number of lines
in service and traffic per line. Increasecl traffic, in turn, derived from: (a) improved call
completion rates (consistent with increased quality and reliability); (b) increased telephone
density; and (c) introduction of interprovincial long-distance service. The analysis in the SAR
conservatively assumed no increases in nominal tariffs beyond the 80% adjustment in Janiuary
1990 (which had been implemented as a project condition).
32.   In the event, tariffs were increased above projected levels after project effectiveness, and
were subsequently pegged to the US dollar. In addition, although the investment prograam was
delayed by about 2 years, actual traffic ultimately exceeded appraisal forecasts. The net effect
has been that, despite the initial delay, project revenues substantially exceeded appraisal
estimates. As a result, ex-post FRR discounted to 1990 is estimated at 18.0%, and NPV at US$
6.4 m (see Table 9).
33.   The economic internal rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 12.6% at appraisal, on the
basis of financial cash flows adjusted to reflect economic costs and benefits (notably, grants and
taxes were added back to the financial cash flows). The analysis conservatively excluded
consumer surplus resulting from improved quality and access, and assumed no further nominal
tariff increases (beyond the 80% adjustment in 1990). Based on ex-post adjusted financial cash
flows, the project generated an ERR of 16.1% and an NPV of US$ 10.4 m (see Table 9).
E. IDA Performance
34.   IDA's performance under the Project was satisfactory. Project objectives developed at
identification were in line with the country's and the Bank's assistance strategy, and were
supported by the project's components, conditionalities and covenants. (para. 34)
35.   Specifications and tender documents for key investment components (e.g. transmission
systems) were prepared in advance of project effectiveness (in order to prevent disbursement
delays) and were revised during implementation to enable ETL to substitute a more cost
effective microwave transmission system for a fiber-optic transmission system.
36.   During supervision, IDA could have provided more support to ETL in engaging
consultants and to the Government in undertaking sector reforms; however, resources were not
made available for such efforts, as IDA had decided not to pursue a subsequent operation in
the sector (see Country Assistance Strategy).
F. Borrower and Beneficiary Performance
37.   The Government's and ETL's performance under the project was highly satisfactory.
Both entities demonstrated strong commitment to the project and to sector reform and



-8 -
commercialization. They worked closely with Bank preparation missions and consulted with
Bank staff regarding all major issues. After ETL surmounted initial delays (due largely to
problems with contracting), disbursements exceeded appraisal estimates (Table 4). With
minor exceptions, the Government and ETL met the project's covenants.
G. Assessment of outcome
38.   The outcome of the project was highly satisfactory. All of the physical, financial and
institutional objectives of the project were fully achieved; many were greatly exceeded. The
Government and Beneficiary undertook additional policy reforms beyond the scope of the
project which enabled them to attract and implement additional investment from donors as
well as substantial private investment in LTC.
H. Project Sustainability and Future Operation
39.   The project assets will in the future be operated by LTC, which now has the commercial
management, incentives and cash flow required to enable it to operate the IDA-financed assets
efficiently. The project benefits are therefore highly likely to be sustainable.
40.   The privatization of LTC was in line with the project's development objectives as well as
the country's development agenda. It is expected to result in increased sector investment ($400m
by 2001 required under LTC's concession agreement), improved efficiency and, more generally,
improved commercial orientation of the sector.
41.   The project did not reduce the Government's ability to meet its financial obligations to
IDA, as the privatization proceeds ($45m) greatly exceeded the amount of the credit (SDR 19.  m
or about $25m--the only outstanding loan). The price represents fair compensation for the assets
received (based on expected cash flow), without a subsidy element from IDA to the private
sector.
42.   The Bank was not involved or represented in the privatization transaction. The private
joint-venture partner has substantial experience in the sector and in the region; at the time of the
transaction, it also had access to the necessary funding to meet investment obligations (although
this has been constrained since the Baht crisis). A more competitive privatization process would
have been preferable; however, the Bank did not pursue a dialogue with the Government at the
time that it announced its plan and so it missed an opportunity to discuss alternatives with the
client.
43.   The privatization does imply a breach of contract under the Credit and Project
Agreements, as ETL will no longer be able to service the debt that was on-lent to it by the
Government because the assets financed by the project are being transferred to LTC (in
accordance with the terms of the privatization). In fact, ETL is no longer required to service its
loan from the Government. However, the project's legal documentation have not yet been
revised to reflect this. The country counsel has met with the counterparts (MOF, MTCPC, and
LTC) to discuss the necessary revisions to the legal documents.

44.   Looking forward, the Government recognizes the need to substantially strengthen its
capacity to regulate this quasi-monopoly sector, in particular with respect to policy on
evolution of the market structure, development of a Telecommunications Law, and
management of the radiospectrum. The Government has written to the Bank requesting the
Bank's assistance in this area.
I. Key Lessons Learned
(a)  Despite infrequent Bank supervision missions, the beneficiaries substantially
exceeded the project's physical targets and implemented institutional reforms well beyond the
project's original scope.
(b)  Specifically, changing the specifications for the long-distance transmission
system from fiber-optic to microwave increased long-distance capacity by 15 times at a lower
cost, with acceptable quality.
(c) The Second Telecommunications Project demonstrates, as shown elsewhere that
robust project design and strong beneficiary commitment are critical to project success.
(d) Flexibility in specifications permitted the beneficiary to capitalize on
technological advances that enabled it to greatly exceed the project's original physical targets.
(e) Given the Government's interest in commercializing the economy, and the
telecommunications sector in particular, the Bank could have provided more support in sector
reform, notably by supervising the project more regularly and encouraging the Government to
adopt a more competitive market structure.
(f)  Although LTC has a 25-year monopoly, its ability to retain that monopoly is
contingent upon (i) whether it meets its, investment commitments under its concession ($ 100m
by end-2001) and (ii) whether substitutes such as global mobile service are permitted in Laos.
These threats somewhat contain LTC's ability to abuse its monopoly position; nonetheless,
experience shows that regulation is important where competition is limited. It will therefore
be essential for the Government to carefully review whether LTC abides by the terms of its
concession agreement.

Appendix A. Mission's Aide Memoire
World Bank/IDA Mlission, January-February 1998
Second Telecommunications Project (Cr. 2101-LA)
A mission consisting of Ms. Veronique Bishop (Task Manager), Mr. Mostafa El-Erian (Counsel)
and Ms. Linda Schneider (Vientiane Liaison Office) visited Lao PDR from January 28 to
February 11, 1998 to review implementation progress on the Second Telecommunications
Project (STP) and to collect information to prepare the Implementation Completion Report on
the project. The mission wishes to thank the Government of Lao PDR and the staff of Entreprise
des Telecommunications Lao (ETL) for their hospitality in making arrangements for the visit and
for their cooperation in providing the necessary information.
This Aide Memoire records the mission's findings and agreements reached. Its contents are
subject to confirmation by the Government of Lao PDR and World Bank management.
Proiect Completion. ETL is completing disbursements against the 5 contracts which have
undisbursed balances. Works and equipment deliveries under these contracts are expected to be
complete before the revised closing date of February 28, 1998. The IDA mission agreed to
review a discrepancy in disbursements against the Alcatel contract.
Plan for Future Operation of Proiect Assets. The mission was informed that the Govermnent
intends to contribute the Project assets funded under the credit to Lao Telecommunications 'Co.,
Ltd. in respect of the Government's 51% equity contribution. The mission expressed concern
that an appropriate valuation method be used to assess the value of such a contribution, and
discussed a number of options such as (i) I)iscounted Cash Flow valuation and (ii) Comparable
Company valuation (e.g. using Price-to-Book ratios or Price-to-Earnings multiples). It also noted
that a transfer of project assets would have implications for the Government's and ETL's
obligations under the legal agreements for the credit which would need to be reviewed by II)A in
accordance with the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement. ETL therefore
agreed to provide additional information to IDA necessary, including the 1996 Master Agreement
between the Government and Shinawatra. the 1996 financial statements of ETL. and the 1997
financial statements of ETL and LTC (when available) in order to develop a plan for future
operation of the assets, including the possible revision of the project legal documents.
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). ETL and Laos Telecommunications Co. (LTC)
provided their contribution to the ICR, and, conmmented on the mission's draft ICR text and
tables. ETL also shared with the mission a copy of a UNDP report evaluating their investment in
training under the project. IDA would incorporate a section of this report as the Cofinancier's
contribution to the ICR. The Ministry of Finance agreed to review the contribution prepared by
ETL and contribute as necessary. ETL agreed to solicit written contributions from the
Governments of Japan. Germany and France to be included in the ICR. The mission agreed to
transmit the revised ICR to Ministry of Finance and ETL for their review and comment before
issuance.

II.    Project Obiectives
The objectives of the project are to:
a)    Carry out priority investments in the sector, particularly the first phase of ;a
nation wide digital telephone networks and improve intematonal
telecommunications services,
b)    strengthen  EPTL's capabilities in the areas of planning project
implementation, operation, maintenance and financial management, and
c)    Develop EPTL's human resources.
Ill.   Proiect Desian, implemental:ion and operation experience
3.1   Proiect Design
The project is an integral part of EPTL's sectors telecommunications investment
program 1990-1995 as follows:
a)   installation of automatic digital telephone exchanges in Vientiane and five
provincial capitals,
b)    construction of local cable networks in the six cities,
c)   installation of a backbone networks of digital Microwave links, connecting
all new telephone exchanges, and
d)    Training and technical assistance.
3.2  Implementation
* The World Bank Projects
* The Bilateral Aid
*  French
*  Japan
*  Germany
*  UNDP/ITU
*  Others
3.3   Operation experiences
3.3.1  A technically second telecommunications network installed.
a)    Preparation of tender clocument and site survey,
b)    Answer bidder's queries and participate in bidder's conferences
c)    Review conformity of bids with specifications, prepare technical and
financial reports on bids, and prepare recommendations for contract
award and submission to Bank of bid documents for approval.
d)    Contract negotiation.
c:*AcJ1 .doc                         2

e)    Supervise installation.
f)    Commission civil works and equipment.
g)    Acceptance test.
h)    Solve problems during warranty period.
i)    Maintain a proper set of accounts on project disbursements at all times of
project implementation.
The above activities were completed satisfactory with consultant personnel providing the
necessary inputs at the appropriate lines and working with FTL counterpart staff to
provide on the job training.
Almost the contracts were awarded based on the most cost effective bids, while
ensuring conformity with technical specifications, ETL counterparts were involved in the
complete process with the terms and conditions of the World Bank standard bidding
documents and credit agreement. Except conduct such factory or source tests, this was
not done because the funding for the suppliers or the project did not provide these
activity funds.

Figure 1:    Project Participants
This is a very complex and convoluted situation, which existed with out a fully defined
hierarchical structure. It is therefore not surprising that although numerous meetings,
reviews, reports the overall picture was difficult to ascertain at any given time during the
project, because the different parties held allegiance to different monitoring super visors.
However, there has been a high degree of cooperation between the various participants
of this project, all working towards a common goal and operating in a congenial climate,
within the bounds of inevitable commercial competitiveness.

IV.   Some weak point
4.1   Fundamental plans
The fundamental plans (Master plan) developed by Lao/85/018 were followed to
some extent. The long term plan indicated optical fibre links for the south of country and
Microwave radio links for the north. This has been changed and Microwave radio
systems are used exclusively and no optical fibre links have been installed to date,
except in the inter-exchange junction network in Vientiane.

During the tendering phase of equipment procurement, the technical specifications were
sent to all potential bidders and interfaces were specified to comply with ITU-*T and ITUI-
R recommendations.
The Fujitsu FETEX-150 digital switching equipment initially had some interface problems
with the other switches, because of clifferent signaling systems. This was resolved with
negligible delays. There was an interface problem with the Australian satellite earth
station and the gateway digital switch in Thailand.
Also, when Alcatel had been identified as the source for digital microwave equipment, it
was emphasized that the transmission equipment must be capable of interconnecting to
Fujitsu digital switching equipment. A move to signaling system No. 7 eventually
eliminated all interface problems.
4.3   Proiect delays
For the subcontractor Ericsson, there were delays in the capital Vientiane but
installations within the provinces were on schedule. Optical fibre cabling between
exchanges and RSU's was in time, but the cable networks to the cabinets was late
approximately 6 months and incurred a late penalty of US$ 116,870. This was to a large
extent caused by quality control problems.
For the subcontractor Alcatel, transportation difficulties in delivering the microwave
equipment to the repeater sites caused delays, especially during the rainy season. The
total delay was approximately 5 months and Alcatel incurred a penalty which was paid in
kind i.e. Alcatel provided 3 months; of technical assistance from the date of final
acceptance free of charge.
For the subcontractor Daewon, was done cause of the difficulty and delay for approval olf
the import without tax for materials, equipment and tools for 2 months and the stop
working during rainy season approximately 93 days. The bid committee was accepted
to the revise construction schedule for 150 days in the addition to the initial time
schedule. Therefore the completion of work schedule should be finished in the end of
July 1997 as dead line. Since the contractor could mot finished his work in time, so
Daewon incurred a penalty of US$ 54,841.50.
4.4   Main Power
Some difficult problems were encountered in supplying sufficient qualified counterparl:
staff and also the language barrier, especially at the beginning of the project.
c:wb98dt1.doc                       4

Another difficulty was that if staff were sent abroad for training during the installation
period, they would miss the very important on the job training. During the project, the
project Director was changed 4 times
During the splitting of EPTL into ETL and EPL on 1 of March 1995 most of the
experienced accountants were attached to EPL, and consequently ETL has few
accountants experiences in the telecommunications accounting.
4.5   Operation and Maintenance
At present the maintenance activities are centralized, but no formal central maintenance
unit has been established.  When faults occur in the provinces, an engineer is
dispatched from Vientiane to resolve the problems. Insufficient spare parts and tools are
available to decentralize maintenance to the regions.
V.    Borrower Performance
The overall assessment of ETL's performance is satisfactory. All commitments made
during the negotiations and covenanted under the loans were fulfilled.
Regardless of any project implementation difficulties or delays that have occurred, there
is no doubt that the telecommunications networks that has been installed during the
tenure of the project is a high quality, high reliability, digital electronics network that has
to a large extent, fulfilled some of the main infrastructure preconditions necessary for
further development not only in this sector, but also other sectors of the society.
It is fair to say that there were no serious grievances and only minor disagreements
between the parties in matters of timing, inter connectivity or accountability consistent
with normal commercial competitiveness.
The impact of the time delays was not too serious in the context of this being the first
digital telecommunications equipment to be installed in Lao PDR, resulting in an
expansion of the budget in terms of additional consultancy fees and also loss of potential
revenue during the delays period.
The resulting telecommunications systems were sound technical products, operating to
the satisfaction of the Government and participating donors/Banks.
VI.   Bank Performance
Overall the Bank's performance has been highly satisfactory. In particular, the
Bank has successfully maintained good working relations with ETL, identified and
appraisal the project, assist ETL in project preparation, and supervised the project over a
five-year period.  Several supervision missions were fielded during the project
implementation period.
Problems encountered were clearly identified, solutions, agreed actions and advice to
problems were promptly provided to those concemed.

Suitable follows up actions were taken and where needed, mid-course corrections were
made. Task managers supervised the project, with no discernable negative impact on
project continuity and out come.
VII.  Operation Plan
Telecom I and 11 projects have been carried out by the Govemment in the period 1992 to
1995 at a cost of about US$ 60 millions (local costs, loans plus grants) and was
operated by EPTL up to 1994.
On 15 March 1994 the Government has awarded the contract to establish Lao Sinawatra
Telecom Co., Ltd. which is a joint venture 70% owned by Shinawatra International and
30% owned by EPTL, on the basis of BOT for 15 years. The company is to raise funds
and carry out the works envisaged in the Telecom Ill.
The Telecom Ill project was originally planned to be commenced in early 1994 with
construction expected to be completed in late 1996. During 1995-1996 Lao Shinawatra
Co., Ltd. began to operate its first service whish is GSM digital mobile telephone in
Vientiane Municipality only. This has been delayed and the whole project should be
replaced by the Telecom 2000 project.
On 1st January 1995, the Govemment had decided to split the Telecom and Postal
services of EPTL. As a result ETL has been established to carry over the telephone
service operations instead of EPTL. In the same time the Govemment had decidecl to
privatize ETL and started to negotiate the privatization conditions with many international
telecommunications investors and operators.
On 8th October 1996, the Govenmment had made its final decision and enters a joint
venture agreement with Shinawatra International Co., Ltd. The joint venture between
Government and Shinawatra Co., ILtd. is a 51% Government and 49% Shinawatra Co.,
Ltd. with shares holding US$ 100 mrillions.
Lao Telecommunications Company (LTC) shall be established or a joint venture
company to operate and undertake the development of telecommunications services; in
Lao PDR.
The company has a 25 years license to operate and undertake projects foreseen under
the Lao Telecommunications master plan.
The expansion of services and geographical area covered is expected to assist the Lao
Govemment in creating a modern, efficient telecommunications network and support its
economic development plans.
Investment by new company over the next 25 years is expected to be approximately
US$ 400 millions. The investment shall be divided in three phases:
Phase I:    at least US$ 100 millions for the first five years
Phase II:   at least US$ 100 millions for the following five years
Phase Ill:   at least US$ 200 millions for the last fifteen years
In order to ensure appropriate telephone distribution to rural areas, the company shall
invest in the rural telephone service at least US$ 1 million within the first five years of
operations.

VlIl.  Recommendations
1.    Regulatory Matters
In view of the newly formed joint venture it is even more critical that the MCTPC
regulatory functions be upgraded to cope with the privatization aspects of
telecom operations. The formulation of a Telecommunications Act should be
done as soon as possible.
Frequency management needs more assistance in particular and injection of
funds is needed to upgrade the equipment necessary for countrywide frequency
monitoring.
2.    Lancuage
Continued effort is needed to surmount communication difficulties arising from
insufficient English language capability. Technical texts that are written in many
language has become a de facto standard as the medium for communication, not
only in the technical fraternity, but also for international business transactions. It
is therefore recommended that a continuing effort be made to raise the level of
comprehension, depth of vocabulary and enunciation of English for incoming and
existing staff, in order not to be disadvantaged by deficiencies.
3.    Human Resources Development
(a) Technical
The present quantity of technical staff (engineers and technicians) in ET; should
be adequate for the present size of the network. The technical knowledge
upgrading particularly for technicians should now be the focus of attention rather
than increasing the intake of more engineers and technicians, i.e. quality not
quantity.
Several modular-style; advanced equipment courses are needed, in the format
now being produced by DETECON for the SEL rural telecommunications
equipment. Advanced equipment courses are urgently needed for the Alcatel
microwave equipment and the Satellite earth station equipment. While there is a
Fujitsu FETEX-150C digital switch computer simulation program available in the
PTTC, a well-structured course is needed to accompany this simulation. Funds
for these activities should be mobilized as soon as possible.
This effort is even more important now that the joint venture has been formed
because the bilateral grant assistance by the German, French, and Japanese
Govemments may be on hold until the operational framework becomes more
well-defined. Historically, it is well known that equipment suppliers in general are
notoriously inadequate with respect to technology transfer and in many cases in
the training they have provided.
(b) Managerial
Many staff has been sent on fellowships abroad for management training. An
effort needs to be made to create an in-country management training capability
by national instructors. This could be done in the PTTC in Vientiane and the ITU
c:WebNXd1.dcc                       7



- 35 -
Curriculum Development expert started the groundwork for this effort during the
project.
4.    Repair Unit
A facility should be provided and staff trained to form a group to supply some
support services for the operation and maintenance activities countrywide. At
present there is small repair room allocated for the repair of telephone sets. This
section is quite active and is already repairing 100 telephones per month. With a
modest outlay of funds for test and repair of equipment and tools, and Ithe
assistance of a Telecom Repair Consultant (2 months for each of three
successive years), a facility could be created to repair equipment power supplies
and some circuit cards. Clearly, not all circuit cards could be repaired, and it is
realized  that some  cards  incorporate  proprietary  integrated  circuits.
Nevertheless, the items that could be repaired would save many thousands of
US$ per year, not to mention the time and effort saved in sending faulty modules
and cards back to the manulacturer.
5.    Spare Parts
Inevitably, there are not enough spare parts available for the satisfactory
maintenance of installed equipment. This situation will become more acute as
the equipment gets older and more failures occur. This matter should be
addressed as soon as possible and adequate funds made available for spares to
be purchased as soon as possible, before the equipment becomes obsolute. It
must be remembered that if a special production run becomes necessary, the
price of the spares increases significantly.
The matter of spares should also be viewed in the context of solving the
problems, which crate failLires, which need spare parts for restoration.  For
example, the commercial power supply in some areas has been measured to be
unreasonably high. Also the earthing (grounding) of some installations has not
been adequate, thereby increasing the susceptibility of some equipment to
lightning damage.
6.    Equipment Tvyes
Already, the transmission equipment is becoming diverse. In other words, while
it is desirable for two manufactures to provide, for example, microwave radio
equipment, in order to alleviate the monopolistic problems of using a sole source,
when there are four or five equipment suppliers, the problems of spare parts,
training and interfaces becomes counterproductive. It is recommended that this
point be taken very seriously for future equipment procurement cycles.
7.    Network uparadina (route diversity)
When the next upgrade of the microwave backbone network takes place, serious
through should be given to route diversity. The present star design is ver
vulnerable to failures. For example, a fault in the link between Vientiane and
Pakxan would render the rest of the south of country isolated.

IX.   Lessons Learned
World Bank loans are of high interest for countries like Lao PDR because of the
low interest rates. We also appreciated the supervision control mechanism in
form of Field Missions during the implementation phase of projects. We find if
helpful to work with the Mission Team to control and improve each the technical
and financial situation of the projects.
On the other hand side however, we think that regulation and rules during
preparation phase are too comprehensive and hamper the speedy process of
preparation, evaluation and award of the projects. But in general to develop a
country like Lao PDR with the financial support of the World Bank is an
advantage particularly if it comes to develop rural areas.

Second Telecommunication Project
Credit 2101-LA
United Nations Development Programme
5.0 SUMMARY / CONCLUSION
The essence of this project has been the culmination of' efforts by nun-ierous parties
resulting in the construction of a very modern, high-tech, digital telecommunication
network which has produced a launching pad for further interconnection of
communities throughout the far extremities of the country. This project has provided
one of the infrastructural elements necessary to accelerate the rate of development
within the country. To this end, there have been strong multi-sectoral linkages created
by the project which will perpetuate long after this project has finished, wi-lich brings
into perspective the subject of sustainability.
External technical assistance has been invaluable in developing management and
technical capability during the course of the project. On completion of the project,
sustainability is questionable in several areas. While significant advances have b_en
made in the installation of equipment, there is still a lack of sufficient highly qualified,
practically trained, technical staff for high level operation and maintenance activities.
Even more important, the number of staff with extensive management training and
experience may not be sufficient to cope with the wide ranging changes now taking
place during the process of privatization. The formation of the joint venture has
changed the. landscape considerably. The component composition is approximately
90% ETL staff and 10% Shinawatra staff and it is not sufficient to assume that any
deficiencies will be solved by a process of "osmosis".
Urgent attention needs to be paid to continuation of the process of Humian [Resources
Development.
It is the conclusion of the evaluation rnission, based on the findings established by
observing each output and activity, that none of the objectives was conmpleted in full
(100%). To generalize, the equipment installation was completed satisfactorily.
However, the institution buildinig process is not very mature arid the structure present
today is still relatively fragile. This is understarndable considering the veiy steep
learning curve and the small number and level of counterparts available at the
beginning of the project.
While infrastructural projects may no longer be a priority of UNDP, it must be
recognized that, without a telephone network, the rate of progress of many projects in
other sectors wouid diminish to a meager pace, resulting in higher project costs for
numerous reasons including the simple fact that they will take longer to cormplete. It
may therefore be premature to relegate all infrastructural projects to the category of
low priority".

II.    Proiect Objectives
. ,
The objectives of the project are to:
a)    Carry out priority investments in the sector, particularly the first phase of a
nation wide digital telephone networks and improve international
telecommunicaticns services,
b)    strengthen  EPTL's capabilities in the areas of planning  project
implementation, operation, maintenance and financial management, and
c)    Develop EPTL's human resources.
Ill.   Project Design, implementation and operation experience
3.1   Proiect Design
The project is an integral part of EPTL's sectors telecommunications investment
program 1990-1995 as follows:
a)    installation of automatic digital telephone exchanges in Vientiane and five
provincial capitals,
b)    construction of local cable networks in the six cities,
c)    installation of a backbone networks of digital Microwave links, connecting
all new telephone exchanges, and
d)    Training and technical assistance.
3.2   Implementation
* The World Bank Projects
* The Bilateral Aid
*  French
*  Japan
*  Germany
*  UNDP/ITU
.  Others
3.3   Operation experiences
3.3.1  A technically second telecommunications network installed.
a)    Preparation of tender document and site survey,
b)    Answer bidder's queries and participate in bidder's conferences
c)    Review conformily of bids with specifications, prepare technical and
financial reports on bids, and prepare recommendations for contract
award and submission to Bank of bid documents for approval.
d)    Contract negotiation.

e)    Supervise installation.
f)    Commission civil works and equipment.
g)    Acceptance test.
h)    Solve problems during warranty period.
i)    Maintain a proper set of accounts on project disbursements at all times of
project implementation.
The above activities were completed satisfactory with consultant personnel providing the
necessary inputs at the appropriate lines and working with ETL counte,rpart staff to
provide on the job training.
Almost the contracts were awarded based on the most cost effective bids, while
ensuring conformity with technical specifications, ETL counterparts were involved in the
complete process with the terms and conditions of the World Bank standard bidding
documents and credit agreement. Except conduct such factory or source tests, this was
not done because the funding for the suppliers or the project did not provide these
activity funds.

Figure 1:    Project Participants
This is a very complex and convoluted situation, which existed with out a fully defined
hierarchical structure. It is therefore not surprising that although numerous meetings,
reviews, reports the overall picture was difficult to ascertain at any given time during the
project, because the different parties held allegiance to different monitoring super visors.
However, there has been a high degree of cooperation between the various participants
of this project, all working towards a common goal and operating in a congenial climate,
within the bounds of inevitable commercial competitiveness.

IV.   Some weak Point
4.1   Fundamental plans
The fundamental plans (Mastier plan) developed by Lao/85/018 were followed to
some extent. The long term plan indicated optical fibre links for the south of country and
Microwave radio links for the north, This has been changed and Microwave radio
systems are used exclusively and rio optical fibre links have been installed to date,
except in the inter-exchange junction network in Vientiane.
4.2   Technical interface
During the tendering phase of equipment procurement, the technical specifications were
sent to all potential bidders and interfaces were specified to comply with ITU-T and ITU-
R recommendations.
The Fujitsu FETEX-150 digital switching equipment initially had some interface problems
with the other switches, because of d[fferent signaling systems. This was resolved with
negligible delays. There was an interface problem with the Australian satellite earth
station and the gateway digital switch in Thailand.
Also, when Alcatel had been identified as the source for digital microwave equipment, it
was emphasized that the transmission equipment must be capable of interconnecting to
Fujitsu digital switching equipment. A move to signaling system No. 7 eventually
eliminated all interface problems.
4.3   Proiect delays
For the subcontractor Ericsson, thiere were delays in the capital Vientiane but
installations within the provinces were on schedule. Optical fibre cabling between
exchanges and RSU's was in time, but the cable networks to the cabinets was late
approximate'ly 6 months and incurred a late penalty of US$ 116,870. This was to a large
extent caused by quality control problems.
For the subcontractor Alcatel, transportation difficulties in delivering the microwave
equipment to the repeater sites causeid delays, especially during the rainy season. The
total delay was approximately 5 months and Alcatel incurred a penalty which was paid in
kind i.e. Alcatel provided 3 months of technical assistance from the date of final
acceptance free of charge.
For the subcontractor Daewon, was done cause of the difficulty and delay for approval of
the import without tax for materials, equipment and tools for 2 months and the stop
working during rainy season approximately 93 days. The bid committee was accepted
to the revise construction schedule For 150 days in the addition to the initial time
schedule. Therefore the completion of work schedule should be finished in the end of
July 1997 as dead line. Since the contractor could mot finished his work in time, so
Daewon incurred a penalty of US$ 54,841.50.
4.4   Main power
Some difficult problems were encountered in supplying sufficient qualified counterpart
staff and also the language barrier, especially at the beginning of the project.
cAwt98\cd1 dcc                      4



- 50 -
Another difficulty was that if staff were sent abroad for training during the installation
period, they would miss the very important on the job training. During the project, the
project Director was changed 4 times
During the splitting of EPTL into ETL and EPL on 1* of March 1995 most of the
experienced accountants were attached to EPL, and consequently ETL has few
accountants experiences in the telecommunications accounting.
4.5   Operation and Maintenance
At present the maintenance activities are centralized, but no formal central maintenance
unit has been established.  When faults occur in the provinces, an engineer is
dispatched from Vientiane to resolve the problems. Insufficient spare parts and tools are
available to decentralize maintenance to the regions.
V.    Borrower Performance
The overall assessment of ETL's performance is satisfactory. All commitments made
during the negotiations and covenanted under the loans were fulfilled.
Regardless of any project implementation difficulties or delays that have occurred, there
is no doubt that the telecommunications networks that has been installed during the
tenure of the project is a high quality, high reliability, digital electronics network that has
to a large extent, fulfilled some of the main infrastructure preconditions necessary for
further development not only in this sector, but also other sectors of the society.
It is fair to say that there were no serious grievances and only minor disagreements
between the parties in matters of timing, inter connectivity or accountability consistent
with normal commercial competitiveness.
Tht- impact of the time delays was not too serious in the context of this being the first
digital telecommunications equipment to be installed in Lao PDR, resulting in an
expansion of the budget in terms of additional consultancy fees and also loss of potential
revenue during the delays period.
The resulting telecommunications systems were sound technical products, operating to
the satisfaction of the Government and participating donors/Banks.
VI.   Bank Performance
Overall the Bank's performance has been highly satisfactory. In particular, the
Bank has successfully maintained good working relations with ETL, identified and
appraisal the project, assist ETL in project preparation, and supervised the project over a
five-year period.  Several supervision missions were fielcled during the project
implementation period.
Problems encountered were clearly identified, solutions, agreed actions and advice to
problems were promptly provided to those concemed.

Suitable follows up actions were taken and where needed, mid-course corrections were
made. Task managers supervised the project, with no discemable negative impact on
project continuity and out come.
VIl.   Operation Plan
Telecom I and 11 projects have been carried out by the Govemment in the period 1992 to
1995 at a cost of about US$ 60 millions (local costs, loans plus gran,tsj and was
operated by EPTL up to 1994.
On 15 March 1994 the Govemment has awarded the contract to establish Lao Sinawatra
Telecom Co., Ltd. which is a joint venture 70% owned by Shinawatra Intemational and
30% owned by EPTL, on the basis of BOT for 15 years. The company is to raise funds
and carry out the works envisaged in the Telecom Ill.
The Telecom IlIl project was originally planned to be commenced in early 1994 with
construction expected to be completed in late 1996. During 1995-1996 Lao Shinawatra
Co., Ltd. began to operate its first service whish is GSM digital mobile telephone in
Vientiane Municipality only. This has been delayed and the whole project should be
replaced by the Telecom 2000 project.
On 1l' January 1995, the Government had decided to split the Telecom and Postal
services of EPTL. As a result ETL has been established to carry over the telephone
service operations instead of EPTL. In the same time the Government had decided to
privatize ETL and started to negotiate the privatization conditions with many international
telecommunications investors and operators.
On 8th October 1996, the Govemment had made its final decision and enters a joint
venture agreement with Shinawatra International Co., Ltd. The joint venture between
Government and Shinawatra Co., Ltd. is a 51% Government and 49% Shinawatra Co.,
Ltd. with shares holding US$ 100 millions.
Lao Telecommunications Company (LTC) shall be established or a joint venture
company to operate and undertake the development of telecommucrications services in
Lao PDR.
The company has a 25 years license to operate and undertake projects foreseen under
the Lao Telecommunications master plan.
The expansion of services and geographical area covered is expected to assist the Lao
Government in creating a modern, efficient telecommunications network and support its
economic development plans.
Investment by new company over the next 25 years is expected to be approximately
US$ 400 millions. The investment shall be divided in three phases:
Phase l:    at least US$ 100 millions for the first five years
Phase Il:   at least US$ 100 millions for the following five years
Phase IlIl:   at least US$ 200 millions for the last fifteen years
In order to ensure appropriate telephone distribution to rural areas, the company shall
invest in the rural telephone service at least US$ 1 million within the first five years of
operations.

VIII.  Recommendations
Regulatory Matters
In view of the newly formed joint venture it is even more critical that the MCTPC
regulatory functions be upgraded to cope with the privatization aspects of
telecom operations. The formulation of a Telecommunications Act should be
done as soon as possible.
Frequency management needs more assistance in particular and injection of
funds is needed to upgrade the equipment necessary for countrywide frequency
monitoring.
2.    Language
Continued effort is needed to surmount communication difficulties arising from
insufficient English language capability. Technical texts that are written in many
language has become a de facto standard as the medium for communication, not
only in the technical fraternity, but also for international business transactions. It
is therefore recommended that a continuing effort be made to raise the level of
comprehension, depth of vocabulary and enunciation of English for incoming and
existing staff, in order not to be disadvantaged by deficiencies.
3.    Human Resources DeveloPment
(a) Technical
The present quantity of technical staff (engineers and technicians) in ET; should
be adequate for the present size of the network. The technical knowledge
upgrading particularly for technicians should now be the focus of attention rather
than increasing the intake of more engineers ar;d technicians, i.e. quality not
quantity.
Several modular-style; advanced equipment courses are needed, in the format
now being produced by DETECON for the SEL rural telecommunications
equipment. Advanced equipment courses are urgently needed for the Alcatel
microwave equipment and the Satellite earth station equipment. While there is a
Fujitsu FETEX-150C digital switch computer simulation program available in the
PTTC, a well-structured course is needed to accompany this simulation. Funds
for these activities should be mobilized as soon as possible.
This effort is even more important now that the joint venture has been formed
because the bilateral grant assistance by the German, French, and Japanese
Govemments may be on hold until the operational framework becomes more
well-defined. Historicajly, it is well known that equipment suppliers in general are
notoriously inadequate with respect to technology transfer and in many cases in
the training they have provided.
(b) Managerial
Many staff has been sent on fellowships abroad for management training. An
effort needs to be made to create an in-country management training capability
by national instructors. This could be done in the PTTC in Vientiane and the ITU
c:tWb9fid1.doc                      7



- 53 -
Curriculum Development expert started the groundwork for this effort during the
project.
4.    Repair Unit
A facility should be provided and staff trained to form a group to supply some
support services for the operation and maintenance activities countrywide. At
present there is small repair room allocated for the repair of telephone sets. This
section is quite active and is already repairing 100 telephones per month. With a
modest outlay of funds for test and repair of equipment and tools, and ihe
assistance of a Telecom Repair Consultant (2 months for each of three
successive years), a facility could be created to repair equipment power supplies
and some circuit cards. Clearly, not all circuit cards could be repaired, and it is
realized  that some  cards  incorporate  proprietary  integrated  circuits.
Nevertheless, the items thal: could be repaired would save many thousands of
US$ per year, not to mention the time and effort saved in sending faulty modules
and cards back to the manufacturer.
5.    Spare Parts
Inevitably, there are not enough spare parts available for the satisfactory
maintenance of installed equipment. This situation will become more acute as
the equipment gets older and more failures occur. This matter should be
addressed as soon as possible and adequate funds made available for spares to
be purchased as soon as possible, before the equipment becomes obsolute. It
must be remembered that if a special production run becomes necessary, the
price of the spares increases significantly.
The matter of spares should also be viewed in the context of solving thle
problems, which crate failures, which need spare parts for restoration. For
example, the commercial power supply in some areas has been measured to be
unreasonably high. Also the earthing (giounding) of some installations has not
been adequate, thereby increasing the susceptibility of some equipment to
lightning damage.
6.    Equipment Types
Already, the transmission equipment is becoming diverse. In other words, whiile
it is desirable for two manulactures to provide, for example, microwave radio
equipment, in order to alleviate the monopolistic problems of using a sole source,
when there are four or five equipment suppliers, the problems of spare parts,
training and interfaces becomes counterproductive. It is recommended that this
point be taken very seriously for future equipment procurement cycles.
7.    Network upcradinc (route diversitv)
When the next upgrade of the microwave backbone network takes place, serious
through should be given to route diversity. The present star design is ver
vulnerable to failures. For example, a fault in the link between Vientiane and
Pakxan would render the rest of the south of country isolated.

IX.   Lessons Leamed
World Bank loans are of high interest for countries like Lao PDR because of the
low interest rates. We also appreciated the supervision control mechanism in
form of Field Missions during the implementation phase of projects. We find if
helpful to work with the Mission Team to control and improve each the technical
and financial situation of the projects.
On the other hand side however, we think that regulation and ,rujes during
preparation phase are too comprehensive and hamper the speedy process of
preparation, evaluation and award of the projects. But in general to develop a
country like Lao PDR with the financial support of the World Bank is an
advantage particularly if it comes to develop rural areas.
