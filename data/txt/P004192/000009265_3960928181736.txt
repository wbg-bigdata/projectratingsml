MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FOR A
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit of SDR 19.1 million (US$24.5 million equivalent) on
standard IDA terms to the Lao People's Democratic Republic for relending to
the Entreprise d'Etat des Postes et Telecommunications Lao (EPTL) to support
a Second Telecommunications Project.  The Project will be cofinanced by a
UNDP grant of US$ 1.2 million; and a bilateral grant from Japan of about
US$11.7 million.  EPTL will contribute US$4.0 million equivalent out of own
cash-generation. Proceeds of the IDA Credit, along with financing from other
foreign sources, will be passed on by the Government to EPTL as a mixture of
equity (US$9.3 million, 38%) and loan (US$15.2 million, 62X); the terms of
the loan will be: 8.0% interest, 20 years, including five years of grace;
EPTL will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background:   The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), a
landlocked country with very low population density, has one of the lowest
per capita incomes (US$180 in 1988) in the world. Since 1986, the Government
has embarked on a major program of liberalization of the economy under its
New System of Economic Management (NSEM).   Increased economic activity,
resulting from the liberalization, has led to significantly increased demand
for telecommunications.    In addition,  efficient  telecommunications  and
transport infrastructure is needed to link the country's northern, central
and southern regions, to overcome the segmentation of the economy into
several small markets.
3.        Post and Telecommunications (P&T) services are provided by EPTL,
under the supervision of the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and
Construction (MCTPC). A national telecommunications network does not exist:
old urban automatic telephone networks (6,500 lines; 62% in Vientiane) are
only partly connected by outdated, manually operated high-frequency (HF)
radio links. Telephone Censity at 0.16 lines per 100 inhabitants is among
the lowest in the world.   International voice and telex communications,
manuallv operated, are only possible in Vientiane. Plant and equipment are
largely obsolete and spare parts are no longer available. Thus, maintenance
is difficult and service unreliable and of extremely poor quality.   Since
1975, the Government has undertaken only minor investments in the system,
supported by bilateral assistance, but these have been piecemeal, lacking
coherent strategy. Nevertheless, traffic since 1986 has grown strongly and
the system approaches saturation.
4.        EPTL, founded in 1986, inherited the postal and telecommunica-
tions systems from MCTPC. Although its assets are largely obsolete, it has
been able to increase services and to record sound financial results.
However, aged equipment and lack of spares prevent delivery of quality
service. Moreover, the company, still at a very early stage of development,
is not yet able to fully utilize its autonomy under the NSEM: a shortage of
qualified personnel is evident at every level of the organization.



-2-
5.        In  spite  of  growing  profits  from  EPTL's  rapidly  growing
telecommunications services, the company is far from having the financial
structure and system needed to expand in line with demand. Its capital base
needs to be augmented to enable it to undertake the size of investment
required (assets will increase 17-fold). Tariffs for international service
have been kept up-to-date and in line with international levels.   But
domestic tariffs, which were last adjusted in mid-1988, have become out of
line because of significant inflation and the devaluation of the Kip since
then. They will need to be brought back at least to their 1988 levels in
US$ terms, to enable EPTL to contribute to the financing of its proposed
investment program. EPTL's accounting system is inadequate, and arrears from
subscribers still are too high. These problems need to be addressed as part
of the process of strengthening EPTL under the proposed Project.
6.        The Government's major objectives for the sector are to:  (a)
improve the quality of, and increase access to, domestic and international
telecommunications services; (b) develop a nation-wide network; (c) increase
the operational efficiency of EPTL; and (d) place EPTL on a sound financial
footing to enable it to generate revenues for the mobilization of resources
to meet its own needs for sustained growth. EPTL, assisted by IDA and UNDP-
financed consultants, has developed a telecommunications investment program
for the period 1990-95 (the Program), which will: (a) establish the backbone
of a network (digital exchanges in, and links between Vientiane and five
major provincial capitals) and the basic parameters for future expansion of
the domestic network; (b) link other provinces with the new network backbone
through transfer of existing HF-installatiors; and (c) modernize and expand
links to the international network to meet the rapidly growing demand for
international telecommunications services.
7.        Ratignale For IDA Involvement:    The establishment of EPTL was
supported by the first IDA-financed Telecommunications Rehabilitation and
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1684-LA) which provided funds for urgent
rehabilitation and (with co-financing from UNDP) technical assistance for
project implementation, investment planning and basic accounting. After a
slow start, that project is now proceeding satisfactorily and is expected to
be completed by June 30, 1991, the original completion date. The proposed
Project, which will build on this first operation, forms an integral part of
the Program. It is consistent with IDA's country strategy for the Lao PDR:
(a) fostering regional development and economic integration by establishing
vital communications capabilities, (b) supporting the Government's efforts
to upgrade the operations of public enterprises, and (c) fostering
development of human resources. IDA's continued involvement is important to
ensure a rational development of the telecommunication network in Lao PDR,
notably with regard to (a) donor coordination, and (b) agreement on the
crucial Investment Program.
8.        Project Objectives:   The objectives of the proposed Project are
to: (a) carry out priority investments in the sector, particularly the first
phase of a nation-wide digital telephone-network, and improve international
telecommunications services; (b) strengthen EPTL's capabilities in the areas
of planning, project implementation, operations, maintenance and financial
management; and (c) develop EPTL's human resources.

of planning, project implementation, operations, maintenance and financial
management; and (c) develop EPTL's human resources.



9.        Proiect  DescriRtion:    The  proposed  Project will  include  the
following components:(a) installation of automatic digital telephone
exchanges in Vientiane and five provincial capitals with a capacity of 15,000
lines; (b) construction of local cable networks, subscriber connections and
installation of public call facilities in the six cities; (c) installation
of a backbone network of digital microwave links, connecting all new
telephone exchanges; existing HF-radio links will be relocated into regions
with lower traffic demand; and (d) training and technical assistance to
strengthen EPTL's project implementation and operations capabilities.   To
assist in project implementation, training, institutional and financial
development, EPTL will employ consultants which are presently assisting in
detailed design and preparation of tender documentation.
10.       The  proposed  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  US$38.6  million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$35.9 million
equivalent (93Z of total project cost), plus US$2.8 million in capitalized
interest during construction.   Provision has been made for retroactive
financing under the proposed IDA Credit, of eligible expenditures (for
training and buildings) of up to US$0.5 million, incurred after January 1,
1990.  The Government, has obtained letters of intent from UNDP and the
Japanese Government that they will contribute grants to the funding of the
proposed Project. Estimated Project costs and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.   Amounts  and methods of procurement and disbursement are
summarized in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and status
of Bank Group operations in Lao PDR are given in Schedules C & D
respect.vely, and a map delineates the new network.   The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 8106-LA, dated February 6, 1990, is being distributed u-., rately.
11.       Actions Agreed: During negotiations, the following agreements were
obtained: (a) EPTL and the Government will conduct, in consultation with IDA,
an annual review and update of the Program; (b) EPTL will implement a human
resource development program agreed with IDA; (c) EPTL will introduce in
Vientiane and five major provinces an improved accounting system, as agreed
with IDA, phased over the 1990-92 period; and will submit plans for improving
accounting in the remaining provinces in 1993; (d) EPTL, assisted by its
consultants, will study the level and structure of telecommunications tariffs
prior to end 1990; and will take needed action, including adjustment of
tariffs sufficient to finance from internal sources at least 5% of the two
year average of the Program during 1990 to 1992, and at least 15X thereafter;
(e) EPTL will observe othe- financial covenants to preserve a sound financial
condition (a 1.5 debt serv.ce coverage ratio, no dividends before completion
of the Program, agreed maximum levels of accounts receivable, maintenance of
asset values in foreign currency terms).  As conditions of effectiveness of
the proposed Credit, (a) the Goverunment and EPTL will increase domestic
tariffs (on average by about 80%) to offset their erosion due to inflation
since mid-1988; (b) EPTL will employ consultants satisfactory to the
Association (para.10).
12.       Benefits and Risks:  The Program represents an important first step
in the Government's strategy of national integration and simultaneous
economic decentralization through improved telecommunications infrastructure.
It will help develop a comprehensive, integrated nationwide network,



providing the critical backbone from north to south. It will significantly
improve services (including automatic access tc international networks) to
about 5,200 existing telephone subscribers an. provide services to about
9,500 new subscribers in six major locations throughout the country.
Redeployment of existing HF equipment will benefit other provinces.  The
Program is expected to yield an economic rate of return of about 13X.
13.        The major risk is that implementation may be slower than expected
because of EPTL's weak implementation capabilities, with negative
consequences for EPTL's financial performance, and delayed availability of
urgently needed services. The proposed Project includes measures to mitigate
this risk: (a) a substantial program of technical assistance (including
project management) and training of EPTL staff; (b) early appointment of
project implementation consultants; ani (c) structuring of procurement around
a small number of packages which can be awarded on a turn-key basis.
14.       Recommendation.   I aA satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
