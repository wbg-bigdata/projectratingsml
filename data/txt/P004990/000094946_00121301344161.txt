EGYPT - COTTCN GINNING REHABILITATION PROJECT
THE COTTCN SYSTEM IN EGYPT
1.        The Egyptian Cotton General Organization (ECGO) acts as an
umbrella organization in the cotton system in Egypt. Through its wholly
owned subsidiaries, ECGO performs all conmercial activities involved
between the sale of seed cotton by the grower and the purchase of lint
cotton by the end user, domestic or foreign. The diagram on page 2 depicts
the cotton system in Egypt and ANNEX 20 gives values added at each stage of
the system. Ginning contributes only 5% of total value added.
2.        Well in advance of a cotton growing season, the "Higher Committee
for the Planning of Cotton Affairs," on behalf of government, determines
the total land to be used under cotton production, the total volume and
different varieties to be grown district-wise and the price to be paid to
the farmer for each variety of cotton. This policy is then announced to
all concerned.
3.        The basic price paid to the farmer for lint cotton is determined
by the government before the planting season starts. Actual price paid by
ECGO is determined by this basic lint price, the variety and grade of cotton
produced and standard yield of lint expected from each cantar of seed cotton.
The grade and standard yield are assessed by the government classifiers. The
basic lint price is fixed after considering the national agricultural policy
and the expected return to the farmer from alternative crops. In 1973,
depending on the variety, the farmer will receive between LE18 to 25/cantar
of average grade seed cotton. The return to the farmer was increased by (a)
higher price payable per cantar of seed cotton; (b) reduced pesticide cost
through introduction of a 50% subsidy. This increase had to be given to make
it more profitable for the farmer to grow cotton. Present return per feddan
of cotton cultivation is estimated at LE30 to 36. No major increase in seed
cotton price is foreseen for the next year or two as the present prices do
make it more profitable to grow cotton rather than wheat or other crops.
4.        In compliance with the policy laid down by the HCPCA,1/ the
Agricultural Credit Bank advances credit to the farmers to buy inputs like
seed, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. The Agriculture Ministry supplies State
inspected planting seed and fertilizer. To ensure proper use of pesticides,
its spraying is carried out by the Ministry itself. Individual farmers are
then levied a charge for this service through the Agricultural Credit Bank,
but since last year, the government has started subsidizing 50% of the cost
of this service. The Agriculture Ministry carries out research to develop
better varieties of cotton, provides advice to the farmers and endeavors to
ensure that cottonis grown'and picked under proper growing conditions.
5.        The cotton crop is picked and sold in August/September.  Legally
this cotton is purchased by ECGO. However, ECGO designates the six export
companies as its agents for handling cotton. Cotton can be delivered
either to any of the 2,000 official collecting centers or to 10,000 private

stores.  A private store is generally a small house capable of storing at
least 15 cantars, where cotton is stored in bulk, inspected and graded by
the classifiers of the Cotton Arbitration and Testing Organization, and
bagged by the export companies at their expense. The official collecting
centers belong to the export companies but are maintained for them by the
Agricultural Credit Bank for a fee of 5 PT/Cantar. At these centers,
cotton is graded by the classifiers and bagged at the expense of the farmer.
The export companies pay a fee for the grading and classification service.
6.        The Cotton Arbitration and Testing Organization maintains a well
trained staff of 300 permanent and 300 temporary classifiers on loan from
other cotton sectors. These classifiers visit each collecting center,
official or private, once a week. Based on their inspection, each farmer
is issued a certified invoice detailing the grades of cotton delivered.
The farmer has a right to appeal against the grade assigned. This grade,
and the expected lint recovery from each cantar of seed cotton (ginning
outturn), is then used to determine the price to be paid to the farmer (the
cotton prices announced by the government are in terms of lint cotton). To
encourage production of higher grades of cotton, substantial incentives are
offered to the farmer. The price paid for the highest grade could be more
than twice of that paid for the lowest grade (Table 5.1).
7.        Before the start of the ginning season, ECGO, based on the
information received from the Agriculture Ministry, allocates cotton to its
five ginning companies according to their ginning capacities. This broad
allocation is then translated into different varieties of cotton in dif-
ferent regions to individual ginneries. The ginning companies as well as
the export companies participate in these negotiations.
8.        Cotton received at the collecting centers is transferred to the
ginneries by the export companies.  The ginneries, 73 of them at present,
receive their cotton from pre-deslgnated centers. Each ginnery generally
has 10 to 40 centers located from 5-100 km away, allocated to it.  Most of
the cotton is delivered in a 4 weeks' period in August/September, and
received, weighed and stored in the ginnery yards. Generally, a ginnery
processes only one variety of cotton during a season.
9.        The ginneries store, gin, press and ship cotton as a service to
the export companies for ginning, storage and shipping fees fixed by ECGO.
About 80% of their revenues are from the ginning fee.  In addition to
ginning cotton, the ginneries also process seed. Seed designated by the
Agriculture Ministry for replanting is fumigated at 550C under supervision
of inspectors from the Ministry. After fumigation, this seed is bagged and
sealed.  The rest of the cotton seed is fumigated at a higher temperature,
800C, to kill germination and sold for oil extraction. Only one ginnery,
at Minia, has its own oil extraction facilities.

10.       Lint cotton for export is shipped - by road, rail and some by
river - to Alexandria for another round of blending, farfara and pressing
operations by the pressing company. It is here that the bale size changes
from a country bale to an export bale. Overseas buyers consider this
second blending operation very important for quality control.
11.       Up to this stage, cotton is le.gally owned by ECGO although it is
handled by the export companies through different stages. Periodically,
the export companies advise EOGO of their domestic and export requirements
of different varieties of cotton. ECGO in turn posts periodic transfer
prices of each variety and formally sells cotton to the export companies at
these prices. All book transactions take place now even though cotton may
have been in an export company's warehouse for sometime. This exercise
permits ECGO to act as a buffer between the farmer and the market. The
price paid to the farmer is based on the annual agricultural policy. The
transfer price charged from the export companies is based on market forces.
In the past few years with rising world cotton prices, ECGO obtained about
half of its total earnings from these arbitrage operations.
12.       The export companies handle both domestic and export sales of
cotton. Local sales are to the state owned subsidiaries of the General
Organization for Spinning and Weaving. Between 40-50% of lint cotton is
sold locally, at prices fixed by the government, presently substantially
lower than the export prices for the same cotton. For exports, each of
the six export companies maintains sales offices in Egypt and abroad.
After' a careful analysis of world markets, opening prices of each type of
cotton are announced at the beginning of the cotton season in September.
During the season, these prices are periodically revised and conveyed to
major customers through a network of telexes. When finalizing negotiations
for an export contract, the export company must obtain ECGO's prior approval
of the deal. The export companies have their own brand names and compete
with one another.
13.       Thus, despite state ownership, market forces have been allowed to
operate at practically all stages of the cotton system in Egypt.

EGYPT - C0TTON GJNfING REHABILITATI(C PROJECT
WORLD COTT-ON PRODUCTIQX' AND TRADE
AND EG=T S_ PLACE IN THE GLOBAL OUTLOOK
A. Cotton Production and Trade
World Production and Consumption
1.       Demand for cotton has just kept pace with the grcowth in population
since 1910 to date and in the last 20 years competition from man-made fibers
has made serious inroads in the textile fiber market (Table 8.1 ).!/ Per-
capita demand of all fibers increased by 2.8% annually fro bI.h40 kg in 1952/
51 to 7.00 kg in 1971.2/ In the same period, per-capita cotton fiber con-
sumption remained practically stationary (Table 8.2 ). A study prepared by
the 1Z Department of Agriculture2/ based on 1964 data shows income elasticity
of per-capita fiber use (related to per-capita income) of nearly o-Le for the
U.S., Canada and the U.K. ard between 1.7 and 5.0 for centrally planned
countries in Asia, Sudan. Iran and South Asian countries. For all othler
countries, the income elasticity was less than one, and less than 0.8 for the
EEC, Japan, SE Asia, Peru and the USR (Table 8.16 ).
2.       Production of cotton has been over-all parallel to consiunption (Table
v-3 ) aLthough,in some years, variations in stock have produced significant
divergences. For instance, in the five years from 1966/657 to 1970/71, an
overall deficit of 2.6 million metric tons (or 22% of the average annual con-
sumption) developedY   This was undoubtedly due to the influence of a 50g
build-up of stocks from the 195859 - 1962/63 period (when they averaged h.47
million metric tons) to 6.76 million MT at the beginning of the 1966/67 season.
In August 1971, stocks had again dropped to 4.23 million 1'IT, covering only 35%
of the previoas year's consumption, the lowest coverage ratio in 20 years. The
imbalance between production and consumption induced grcmers to increase areas
under cotton.  This, coupled with increasing yields in most countries, has allowed
production to overtake demand, and stocks at the beginning of the 1972/73
season (in August 1972),were estimated at 4.38 million MT.
3.       At present, the main consuming countries are t,he USSR, China (Plainland),

these countries have a decisive influence on the outlook for the world crop,
since they account for a large proportion of global output (about 82% in the
last two seasons as shown in Table 8.5 ). For instance, cotton growers in
the USA  intend to increase production by 28% in one year from 1971/72 to
1972/73.
The International Market for Cotton
4.      Cotton production grew rapidly in the nineteenth century to feed
the expanding U.K. textile industry. As late as the First World War, the
U.K. was the largest textile producer accounting for more than two thirds of
the trade in cotton textiles. Since then, international trade has accounted
for an important share of the world's global consumption and production of cot-
ton (Table 8.6). The main exporting countries at present are the USA, the USSR,
Brazil, Egypt, Turkey, Sudan, Syria and Mexico.  The main importers are
Japan, Germany (Federal Republic), France, the USSR, Italy, Hong Kong, Poland,
the U.K., China (Taiwan) and India. In the last decade exports, accounted for
between 32% and 37% of total world consumption. The U.K., Western Europe and
Japan were totally dependent on imports while other countries (especially the
USSR) were simultaneously exporters and importers. The main exports of the
USA are to Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Italy, Germany (Federal Republic), and India,
while the main exports of the USSR are to other Eastern European countries,
France and Japan.
Prices
5.       Prices differ greatly for different varieties of cotton.  In general,
cotton is classified in 5 groups according to length.

6.       Cotton prices have only a small effect on cotton consumption, but
the ratio of cotton to competing synthetic fiber prices is a factor in the
relative share of the various fibers in total consumption (Table 8.17 ).
Prices of polyester and other MMF relative to cotton are shown in Table 8.8.
The downward trend of MMF    relative to cotton prices has been arrested or
slowed down in the last few years.
The Outlook for Consumption of Textile Fibers
7.       World fiber consumption has been shown to have a close correlation
to industrial production as measured by the U.N.'s index of manufacturing.
Frank Lowenstein and collaborators!/ found that the following equations fit
the 19h7-60 figures with a standard error in the regression coefficient of
less than 5%:
Log Y     =  2.363 + 0.849 log X1
Log C     =  2.873 + 0.650 log X1 - 0.012 log X2 - 0.159 log X3
Where Y   = World fiber consumption in thousands of NT
C   = World cotton consumption in thousands of MT
X1  = U.N. index of manufacturing (1953 = 100)
X2  = World MgF consumption in thousands of MT
= Price for medium-length cotton in the U.S. in the
preceding year deflated by the U.S. wholesale
price index (1960 = 100).
However,tb"e equatiorsresult in underestimated total fiber and overesti-
mated cotton consumption figures for 1970. Numerous studies by the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA), FAO, ICAC, the National U.S.  Advisory
Commission on Food and Fiber and others show that income has a positive but
decreasing effect on consumption, i.e., a decreasing elasticity as per
capita income increases.  On the basis of regression equations for 33
countries or regions fitted to 1953-64 or longer time series, the USDA_
after modification of some of the elasticities, arrived at a 1980 all-fiber
per capita annual consumption projection (Table 8.9 ) of 6.8 kg annually
(8.5 kg after correction of MMF to cotton equivalents). Assuming a 1980
population of 4,542 million total world fiber consumption would be 31 million
MT (38.6 million MT of cotton equivalent).
8.       As mentioned in para 1, the share of cotton in fiber demand has been
diminishing in the last 20 years. An analysis of consumption by countries
shows that cotton usage increased faster than MMF consumption only in Syria,
Sudan, Colombia, Egypt and Central America.l/ The ratio of cotton to total
fiber use is generally lower for countries having a higher per capita income.

ANNEX 8

At a given income level, the main factors affecting cotton consumption
are the prices of competing fibers (mainly rayon and polyester). For
example, between 1961 and 1971, the ratio of polyester to cotton prices
in the U.K. decreased from 4.25 to 1.64. Other factors are changes in
cotton production due to climatic conditions or governmental decisions,
instability in cottnn prices (relatsd to the previous factor), unavailability
of man-made fibers in some countries (because of lack of manufacturing
facilities and/or high tariffs for imported fiber), physical differences in
fiber properties and promotion campaigns. The introduction of wash-and-wear
and permanent press textiles has resulted in expanded consumption of NMF,
mainly in countries with high per-capita incomes.  The Prograde amAmonia
process promises to allow for 100% cotton "easy-care" fabrios and to increase
cotton consumption in knitted goods and some types of blends. Comnercial
application to ELS has not yet been developed.
9.        A USDA projection for cotton consumption,," based on separate
projections for 39 countries or regions, ranged between 14.6 and 15.0 million
MT (Table 8.10  ) at prices between 30 and 24 Us cents/pound.?/  A 14.8 million
MT annual level by 1980 would be 38% of the total projected fiber consumption1
as against the present ratio of 41% (Table 8.2 ). There is no reason to
believe in a reversal of the past trend towards a lower share of cotton in the
demand for textile fibers, but the downward trend in sytthetic fiber prices
has already flattened out (Table  8.17 ). MMF prices may show tenporary
weakness due to overcapacity, but increased cost of petroleum and gas processed
by the synthetic fiber industry should copnteract this factor. An aggregate
cotton production projection made by USDAYJ on the base of cotton crop area
and yield estimates for 24 individual countries or regions resulted in a 1980
figure similar to the consumption projection, 14.8 million MT
B. ELS Cotton Producti6n and Trade
Production
10.       AJlthough the origin of mos t commercially important cotton species
has long been a matter for speculation among botanists, geneticists and
archeologists, one of the generally accepted views is that upland-type
cottons (Gossypium hirsutum) and ELS cottons (G. barbadense) apparently
originated in Central America and Peru respectively. It is true that cotton
was also known and used in India thousands of years ago but, at present,
"Asiatic" cottons (G. herbacewu and G. arboreum) account for only a limited
volume of commercial crops. G. barbadense slowly spread eastwards and
northwards reaching the West Indies in the second half of the eighteenth century.
Seeds were later exported to the US Southeast and to West Africa. Probably

these were the seed stocks for the few plants that were selected in 1820
by Fumel, a French engineer, who had been contracted by the Egyptian ruler,
Nuhamaad Ali., to direct a projected spinning and weaving mill. This cotton
replaced the fbellediw or native cotton then being cultivated in Egypt.
RLS derived from that strain as well as from Brazilian and Sea Island seed
arriving in Egypt between 1822 and 1827 originated the present Egyptian
varieties. ELS cotton production is characterized by its relatively saall
volume (less than 5% of total cotton output) and by being concentrated in
very few countries.  At present, a handful of countries (Egypt, Sudan, the
USSR, Peru and the US) account for more than 97% of the ELS cotton crop.
A record level of 616,000 MT was reached in the 1971/72 season (Table 8.11), of
which Egypt produced one-third of the output.
Consumption and International Trade
11.       Figures on mill consumption are not generally available separately
by staple length.  However, taking into account that most of the important
consuming countries with the exception of the USSR and Egypt - and to a
smaller degree the USA - have no ELS production of their own, exports from
the main producing countries give an indication of consumption
trends.  ELS buying by Germany (Federal Republic), Italy, the U.K., and the
USA have dropped considerably from 1966/68 to 1970/71 (Table 8.12) )L/
Total exports, however, increased by about 10% due to dramatic increases in
purchases by the USSR. In 1971/72, Western Earope fine spinning aills
recovered slowly from the slowdown of the 1970/71 season and indications are
that manufacturers' demand is firsing up (forward sales of the 1972/73 crop
to Japan having increased by 62% to 28,000 NT). Supplies in 1973 are expected
to remain substantially at the previous years level.
Prices
12.       Prices for the main ELS varieties are shown in Table 8.13
The ratio of average price of EIS to other cotton reached a peak of 2.14
in 1956/57 to slide don to 1.19 in 1958/59. After 1962/63 it has remained
above 1.4. In 1970/71 and 1971/72 the ratios averaged 1.56L2 (Table 8.15 ).
Exports of ELS show relatively little short-term dependence on the ratio of their
prices to other cotton prices (Table 8.18 ).
C. EAvptian Cotton
13.       Egypt now ranks (average for the last two seasons) as the seventh
largest cotton producer and the third largest exporter. In LS and ELS, it
occupies a dominant position in international trade:

i new ELS varisty (Giza 70), as fime as Melnufi but with higher yields, shows
great promise but is st;11 to be introduced comercially (no new variety is
introduced if i t shlows a yield improvement of less than 10% compared -to a
similar variety currently being cultivat,ed). Additimnal benefits c;an oe
obtained through desalinisat-ion and soil imfprovement projects and throulgh
increa%sed fertilizer consumption.  For these reasons, cotton production has
been projected to increase by 15% from 1970/72 through 1985. The USDA fore-
casted in 19711  that, Egyptian cotton production in 1980 would reach about
564;,0oo MT, a level 11% higher than in 1970/72.1
14.      Because of a rare combination of soil and cliniaza (dry and hot  amid
availability of water at the right time of the season, Egypt has favorable con-
ditions for cultivation of cotton, and especially ELS cotton, dup1-1cated only
in a few areas in the world. EIS is not easily amenable to mechan. zed picking.
Considering the low cost of labor, Egypt has a strong Competitive yJstion in
cotton growing.  E'xcluding land rent, cotton lint cost in Egypt was U11t393 per
mT in 1969/70 (Table 8.14).  In the USA, Mexico and Pakistan, costzs wee US$670,
$518, and $426 for shorter staple cottons 2/
15.       Eg,ipt s domestic text;ile industry is expanding its installed capacity
of yarn and oloth by 40  and 25% respectively, before the end of th,e I°70,/71-
19;74/75 Five Yrear Plan. Fifteen new factories of reacy-made clothing (giving
employment to l0,000) are under construction or planned and two new p7>.nrts for
knitted goods ha-re been established.  Increased internal consumption of lint is
expected to absorb most, if not all of the increased cotton output, i.'., it
would grow from 203,000 MT in 1970/71 to about 280,000 MT by 1984/85, a rate of
growth of 2.3%  annually, which is not difficult to attain.
16.       The USDA study already referred to, proJected a 13% dron in the price
of Egyptian cotton lint exports partly compensated by a 6% increment in the
price for cotton textile exports.  Egyptian authorities and some GATT experts
have foreseen little likelihood of radical changes in EIS prices.  Others are
concerned by the market volatility which could develop as a cornsequence of thle
peculiar position of the USSR as a large ELS producer and exporberimporter and
her nation-to-nation trade ties with Egypt. A sustained drop in average lint
export prices would affect the financial situation of E(GO and may even force the
Goverlnment to take steps to counteract its effects, such as modifications of the
subsidized prices at which lint and cotton seed are sold internally or realignment
of exchange rates.  Ho-wever, it will not alter the economic Justification of the
project, which is based on the incremental benefits and costs of the project. The
comparative advantage held by Egypt in cotton growing would probably lead to con-
tinued cultivation of this commodity even if prices fell considerably.  Switching
to other crops., and mainly to other exportable crops, would be a sl,ojw process and
the need to maintain a competitive position in the world cotton market would be
of even greater importance than at present. The full modernization of' the ginning
industry is envisaged as a phased program, which couald be considerably modified
during its implementation.  Later phases of the program could itake advantage of
market, price and technological conditions as they develop in the next ten years.

Source:  Data for 1961-1971 from International Cotton Advisory Council, Annual
Review of the World Cotton Situation, 1971/72, Washington, May-June 1972.
For previous years from USDA, World Demand Prospects for Cotton in 1980,
Washington, January 1971, after adjustment of actual non-cotton figures to
cotton equivalents. Also from Frank Lowenstein, ELS Demand and Price
Prospects, Washington, April 196h.
Cotton equivalents used are:
Regular and intermediate tenacity rayon and acetate filament  = 1.51
Rayon and acetate staple fiber                                  = 1.10
High-tenacity rayon                                             = 1.53/1.80
Synthetic (non-cellulosic) filament                             = 1.74
Synthetic (non-cellulosic) staple fiber                           1.37

EGYPT - COTTON GINNING REHABILITATIaN PROJECT
NOTES ON GINNING TECHNOLOGY AND PROJECT FORMULATION
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        Cotton ginning is the mechanical process used to separate lint
from seed.   It is one of the most important steps in the production of
cotton.   Cotton possesses its higher quality and best potential spinning
performance when it is on the stalk.   Inherent properties depend on the
seed cotton variety, soil type and weather conditions, cultural and harvest-
ing practices, etc.   Ginning is a series of thermopneumatic and mechanical
operatiors and, at best, can only preserve these qualities and characteristics
which are inherent in the raw cotton, when it enters the ginning plant.
The results of the process depend on a large number of factors: genetic
variety, seed cotton moisture and trash content, type and conditions of
equipment, work supervision, etc.
2.        Lint grade, staple length, fiber fineness and maturity and fiber
strength - in the order listed - are the factors that determine the selling
price of the cotton. Lint grade is mainly determined by color,ppearance and amount of
foreign matter present.   Ginning may do little to change the color of cotton,
and will change the staple length to only a limited extent.   Short and
medium staple cottons are ginned (up to 11/4h1) most economically in sawgins.
Long staple (over 1 1/4") cottons (such as the Egyptian cottons) are ginned
in roller gins.  Roller gins nave a much lower capacity than sawgins but
they do not damage ELS cotton.
B. HISTORY AND PRESENT STATUS OF GINNING TECHNOLOGY
3.        Until nearly the end of the eighteenth century, cotton lint was
quite generally separated from the seed by hand.   This process involved
more labor than hand-picking  in    the fields, but it was gererally carried
out by whole families, if not by domestic servants and slaves.   The first
known ginning appliance was the Indian "churkal' consisting of two small
wooden rollers, which had a few longitudinal flutes on the surface and were
set close enough to pull the lint through while not letting the seeds pass.
It did not work with fuzzy-seeded upland type of cotton, and separation of
lint by hand in the southeastern US was an extremely labor-intensive opera-
tion.   Often a day's work for one laborer produced only one pound of lint.2]
4.        EliWhitney, a New Englander visiting Georgia made the first working
model of a hook or spike gin in 1792, which he patented in 1794.   It con-
sisted of a wooden roller into which spikes were driven.   The spikes were
sharpened and bent to form hooks.   As the roller rotated, the spikes passed

through slots in a metal bar at the top of a hopper ("gin breast") filled
with seed cotton.   The hooks would pull lint engaged by them while seeds
would remain behind, the slots having been set too close to permit them to
pass.   Back of the roller containing the hooked spikes, there was another,
smaller roller to which brushes were attached.   This roller, by revolving
in the opposite direction to the main one, moved the brushes in the same
direction as the hooks and helped to remove lint from the latter.   In 1796,
Hodges Holmes patented an improved gin, in which circular saw blades were
substituted for the rows of hooks in Whitney's gin and flat-iron strips or
ribs for the slotted bar.   After sharp litigation between the two inventors,
the sawgin was also adopted by Whitney in the manufacture of gins.
5.        In the U.S. before the Civil War, plantation managers had not much
work for their slaves during the off-season in the cotton fields.   There-
fore, ginning was done during the winter and there was little incentive to
look for labor-saving processes and equipment.   The seed cotton was carried
from the ginstands to the press box in baskets, and power to drive the gin
and the press screw was generally provided by mules.   Since then ginning
equipment and processes have been greatly improved, although the essential
principles have remained unchanged.   The seed cotton is drawn from the
growers' trucks, wagons or trailers by suction, conveyed mechanically (or
pneumatically) through preliminary drying and cleaning steps before ginning,
and automatically fed to the ginstands.   The cottonseed is carried mechani-
cally or pneumatically to trucks or railway cars, to storage or to associated
oil extraction plants.   The lint is also carried by a current of air or by
mechanical conveyors to condensers and into the press box, where it is
trampled mechanically and pressed generally by hydraulic power.   The bales
are taken by lift trucks to storage or transportation vehicles.   The gin-
stands are individually driven by electric motors.   All that is 'Left to be
done by hand is to loosen the seed cotton at the reception point and to
place the bag cloth and ties used to make iip the lint bales.
6.        The longer and finer lints may be roughened or damaged if ginned
in sawgins.   In 1840, Fones McCarthy patented the modern roller ginstand,
improving on models made by several persons during the previous century.
The McCarthy ginstand features a single roller covered with a material (such
as leather or a co,nbination of rubber and canvas) to which lint will normally
cling.   A stationary knife is set with its edge parallel to the surface of
the roller.   Cottonseed falls (or is fed manually) to the roller at a
distance from the knife.   As it is carried by the roller surface, lint
clinging to it passes under the knife, while the seed,unable to pass,is left
behind and falls to one side of the ginstand.   An oscillating knife is used
to move the seed cotton whose lint is being pulled by the roller thereby
helping to shake the seed loose and speeding up the operation.   However,
the capacity of a standard single-roller ginstand is only about 8%-12% that
of an S0-saw ginstand.   Although roller ginstands are used exclusively in
Egypt, and generally in India and China (even for short or medium-staple
cotton), in the U.S. and other countries they are used only to gin LS or

ELS cotton. Double-action single-roller and double-roller ginstands as
well as faster single-action single-roller ginstands, in which a revolving
drum with bars substitute for the oscillating knife (the Comet Rotorbar gin)
have been developed, but so far their application to Egyptian ELS has not
been satisfactory.
C. EXISTING CONDITIONS IN EGYPT
7.        The 10 existing ginneries to be rehabilitated during Phase I
(Table 9.1 ) and one to be closed down have been visited by the Appraisal
Mission in December 1972. The conditions in these ginneries are as
follows:
Location
8.        Most of these ginneries are located in cities or not far from
populated areas. Access to the ginneries is often difficult and the environ-
ment is polluted by dust and trash arising from their operation.
The Yards
9.        Inside yards are generally not sufficient (Table  9.2  ).  Ginneries
are therefore forced to rent land for outside yards, sometimes far from the
ginneries. In many cases, seed cotton sacks are left on the streets or along
the roads leading to the plant. Part of this seedcotton suffers deterioration
during this storage. Handling of sacks in the yards is by hand. Guards per-
manently watch for thieves and fire. Transport from outside yards to inside
yards is relatively costly (2PT per cantar on the average). Seed cotton samples
are taken by ripping holes in the sacks. Afterwards they are sometimes stacked
negligently so that their contents are spilled or soiled. Areas around and
between the buildings are generally not paved. In Lower Egypt, when it rains,
seed cotton may become wet and the ground muddy, and ginneries have to stop
work. Rains are rare in Upper Egypt. Outside lighting is generally inadequate.
The Buildings
10.       The ginneries have been built 40 to 60 years ago.  Some of them
have been established at the end of the 19th century. Therefore, it is not
surprising that moEt of the buildings, and particularly their roofs, are in
very bad state. windows, doors, floors, etc. also have to be repaired.
Sanitary facilities are obsolete or non-existent. Inside lighting is poor.
The Equipment
11.       Only three ginneries have mechanical equipment for handling seed
cotton from the blending to the ginning hall. All lack equipment for handling
seed cotton from the reception to the blending hall and for its distribution
to the ginstands. Gins are all of the single roller type and most of them have
originally been manufactured tens of years ago (some in 1880).



ANNEX 9
Page 4
Ln spite of being so worn, these ginstands get such careful maintenance
that they can process satisfactorily an average of one cantar per hour in
spite of hand-feeding.   In each ginnery, lint is collected in one (or two)
trolley car(s), which is (are) hand-pushed all along the ginning hall to
the "farfarall room.   The lint is introduced by hand in one (or two) wooden
rotating blowers  and then collected on the "farfara" floor.   After tossing
anH. manual humidifying, lint is pushed into the press box   .  Most of the
px-sses are double box and are hydraulically operated and in acceptable con-
d.ition,    They were built around 1920.   The 3 box-presses (such as in
Kafr e'l Zayat -Nile) and a very old one in Dairut I, will be replaced by
acceptable 2-box presses after they are removed from ginneries to be closed
down,and overhauled,   Storing and loading of bales are generally done
manually or, in some plants, by lift-trucks when they are operational.
Seed is conveyed to the seed room by mechanical (shaker) conveyors located
in the basement and         are generally in acceptable conditions.   Seed
rooms and their processing equipment vary in condition from one
1innery   to another.   Some of the facilities are completely run-down and
03solete.   The other facilities can be reconditioned.
12.       Most of the prime movers - boilers and steam engines or diesel
engines - are very old and, in spite of the great care pridefully bestowed
on them by power plant personnel, they are below acceptable safety standards
and liable to major break- vms.  Large belts transmit
power to the main shaft in the basement, and from it, by means of innumerable
smaller belts to the ginstands and to secondary shafts to drive other equip-
inent (pressing room, seed room, etc.).   Bearings and supports are in poor
mechanical condition  in spite of lubrication and refitting.   Uncertainty
of power house equipment obliges scheduling of one full day's maintenance every
-week and dissuades the managers to operate three shifts.   The ginneries to
be rehabilitated get electricity for lighting and small appliances from the
piblic network or from an A.C. or D.C. generator belt driven by the main
transmission shaft.   Some of the ginneries are equipped with emergency
generating sets seemingly in good condition.
Fire fighting equipment is inadequate.  Existing fire hoses are
often in bad condition.  Water pressure is obtained by water towers.
lxc:sting workshop machines and tools are old and very few of them are
r-asable.   Workshop equipment and tools for electrical and diesel engine
aintenance are practically non-existent.
D. PROJECT FORMUIATION
?ecommendation on the Ginning Process and Equipment for the Project (Phase I)
'4.       The 73 Egyptian existing ginneries are equipped with single roller
I,instands and it is generally admitted that this process is presently the
most convenient for EIS cotton.  Test runs have been conducted with other
;,ypes    gins;  they do not give satisfaction to the ECGO experts.   These



ANNEX9
technicians, who are concerned in maintaining or improving the grade
of lint produced, confirm their preference for slow-speed single-roller gins.
Some manufacturers of potentially competitive equipment concur In this
opinion.   The ten ginneries to be rehabilitated during Phase I (about 42
for the whole program) are equipped with old single-roller gins, which will
not be removed and replaced.
15.       The consultants working for ECGO and for the Appraisal Mission
have approved this decision on the use of standard roller ginstands, which
however, could be modified at later stages of the Rehabilitation Program
if technological changes in the equipment and/or in the operation of the
ginstands, proved it feasible and then only after prolonged and careful
tests.
Optimum Capacity in Terms of Number of Ginstands
16.      The tinimiu  capacity of standard hydraulic soft bale presses is
ten bales per hour, corresponding to about 4,000 kg of lint, i.e., about
80 cantars of seed cotton which can be ginned by about 70 ginstands.
As each scroll distribution conveyor above hopper. feeders is normally able
to cope with 18 ginstands, it is usual to adopt 72 ginstands as the "lunit"
for a roller ginstand installation.   Longer scroll distributors are not
recommendable.   One "twin" unit ginnery would, of course, have 144 ginstands
and would practically duplicate all the equipment required for a "single"
unit ginnery.
Project Formulation (New Ginneries)
(a)   Proposed Location
17.  New sites for three of the four new ginneries have been designated
by ECGO in agreement with Government authorities, and have been approved
by the consultants.   The four sites have been visited by the Appraisal
Mission and examined under traditional criteria:-
(i)   Availability of seed cotton (crop)
-   favorable
(ii) Availability of power
-   an  electric 11 KV power grid is at a maximum distance of 3 km.
and the average is between 1.5 and 2 km.
(iii) Availability of land
- purchasing already completed or under negotiation in all the cases.
(iv) Possibility of expansion
- generally good
(v)   Cost of land
-   normal:  between LE700 and 1,200 per feddan.
(vi) Access
-   satisfactory.  At Itaya El Barud access bridges over the canal will
be built.



ANNEX 9
Page6
(vii) Availability of labor
-   generally good,bteventual transfer of skilled manpower will
be required.
(viii) Availability of water
-   favorable (drinking water supply should be
separately planned).
(ix)  Environment
- dust: lots generally well located for dominant wind directions.
- noise: sufficiently far from populated areas.
- fire risk: no special hazards.
(x)   Construction
-   soil resistance and water table not yet investigated in detail but
-  presumed to be satisfactory.
relief:  flat area.
- cultivated grounds: farmers to be indemnified.
-   access for equipment:  good.
-   access for construction materials and equipment:  good.
- availability of contractors: good.
lb.       For one of the row ginneries, at Zagazig, the proposed site was
found to be inappropriate.   The lot is situated too close to the main road
to Ismailia and in the immediate vicinity (200 m.) of three new university
buildings, the extension of which would be compromised.   The outskirts of
the developing city of Zagazig is also at too short a distance (500 m.) of
this site.   Access roads for seed cotton and evacuation roads for bales
and seed bags  cross the center of the city and are very narrow.   After
discussions with ECGO and the concerned Ginning Company, it has been decided
that another site will be selected and purchased.   This change will have
little influence on the cost of land and the cost of the connection to the
power grid in the evaluation of capital expenditures.
(b) General Plant Layout
19.       Table 9.3 shows the general flow sheet for a ginnery processing hand-
picked cotton. With correct layout, a 72-ginstand ginnery will require a total
area of about 45 feddans and a 144-ginstand ginnery, about 55 feddans. The
^inimum lot should be about 45 feddans (about 19,000 sq. m.).  Definite layout
design depends on site pecularities such as access roads, form of the lot,
direction of dominant winds and other specific local factors.  These differences
in layout from plant to plant do not affect significantly the evaluation of
capital expenditures required. Proper distance between buildings for fire
protection and for truck traffic will be taken into consideration. Adequate
consideration will be given to environmental conditions, in the design of waste
collection, fire-fighting installations in densely populated areas, and pre-
ventic-. of dust.



ANNEX 9
Page 7
(c) Major Equipment
(i) Arrival of Seed Cotton
20. Weighbridges (truck scales) will be installed at the entrance of the
lots. Although not absolutely necessary, it should best be installed as near
as possible to the gate so as to weigh all full and empty trucks and trailers
entering and going out and to get permanent information and statistics about
the movements of materials, mainly seed cotton, bales and seed. The weigh-
bridge should have a capacity of up to 15 tons and have a platform (in sheet
steel or in concrete) of about 7 m. x 3wm,
(ii) Seed Cotton (Storage)Yard
21. Seed cotton delivered in sacks and which is not conveyed directly from
the reception to the blending room or to the bulk storage will be stacked
in the inside yards. The arrangement of these yards will be made according
to their shape and taking into consideration the seed cotton classification
by origin, ownership, etc. Unloading of trucks and stacking can eventually
be made by yard lift-trucks, if available. A balance has been struck between
the capacity of the proposed bulk stores and the fixed costs derived from the
required investment. The proposed capacity (Para. 23) will shorten the time
during which some of the seed cotton sacks have to be stacked in the yards and
allow all the seed cotton to be bulk stored by the time the rains arrive. To
avoid seed deterioration,cotton seed will be stored in covered sheds which
can also be used for storage of seed cotton sacks when space is available.
(iii) Reception Areas
22.       In these two sections, the seed cotton arriving directly from the
f'ield or from the yards is emptied on a lattice floor to separate foreign
matter and introduced manually into the pneumatical conveyance system to be
conveyed directly to the blending room or to the bulk stores. Seed cotton
sacks stored in the inside yard are, in the case of full mechanization, carried
from the yard to the reception area by one ton diesel lift-trucks equipped
with hydraulic load clamps (grips).
(iv) Seed Cotton Bulk Storage
23.   Bulk storage saves use of bags and protects seed cotton from rain, sun
and dust. It is also needed to assure permanent full capacity utilization
of the pneumatic conveyors and ginstands. The buildings have been designed to
store substantially all seed cotton stocks remaining in the yards when rains
start. An analysis of seed cotton received and ginned by the Egyptian ginneries,
shows tat to attain this objective, bulk storage capacity of about 38,000 cantars
(2,000 MT) of seed cotton must be provided for a single-unit ginnery and double
that capacity for a double-unit ginner7.   Seed dotton must not be bulk stored
on a height exceeding 7 m. To allow for separate storage of seed cotton from
different sources bought by different export companies, four bulk stores with
6 compartments each, have been planned for a single unit with 72 ginstands.



ANNEX 9
Page 5
(b) Blending
24.  In a new single unit, the blending hall will be about 45 m. x 15 m.
and will have 6 compartments to segregate seed cotton by export company
and origin. Arriving pneumatically from the reception area or from the
bulkstores, seed cotton will be distributed into the different
compartments. From there, seed cotton will be pneumatically conveyed to
the ginning hall.
(v) Seed Cotton Pneumatic Conveyance
25. For the proposed new ginneries pneumatic conveyance is foreseen
between:
- reception and bulkstores
-  reception and blending hall
-  bulk storage and blending hall
The equipment basically comprises:
-  push-pull fans
-  air/cot-on separator units
-  galvanized steel sheet ducts
-  valves, elbows, etc.
-  suction flow valves in stores and blending hall.
(vi) Seed Cotton Distribution to the Ginneries
26.   Two types of distribution are normally used:
- scroll conveyors
- pneumatic conveyors
The advantages and disadvantages of these two alternatives have been
extensively discussed. Tests have been run in Egypt and have proved that
fibers are noG damaged by scrolls. They have the advantage of allowing
for more uniform flow ensuring continued full loading of the ginstand
feeds.  Overflow is automatically reintroduced in the lines.   The only
important disadvantage of the scroll conveyors is their heavy weight, in
comparison with pneumatic conveyors. The maximum distance through which
a scroll conveyor can practically be used to move seed cotton is over a
line of 18 ginstands. The overflow-of seed cotton will be reduced to
the minimum practicable and reintroduced into the distributors.



ANNEX 9
Page 9
27.   Main equipment manufacturers also favor scroll distribution.  The
mission's technical advisor agrees with this opinion. For feeding
72 ginstandm  either four distributors or two double distributors with scrolls
wound in opposite directions may be uwed.
(vii) The Automatic Single-ZRoller Gin
28. Each ginstand is basically composed of:
- one automatic hopper feeder
- one roller gin
- electric drive
Two types of gins are presently available:
- the traditional low speed single roller gin (such aF the
No. 2 model by Platt, England, and licensees);
-  the high speed single roller gin (such as the Comet Roto-
bar by Continental Moss-Gordin, USA, and Rotorbar Murray,
Brazil) which have not been found satisfactory for Egyptian
ELS cotton.
(viii) Lint Conveyance
29.    Two alternatives are acceptable:
- belt conveyor
- pneumatic conveyor
In the first one, lint is carried by a belt to a suction hopper and
conveyed pneumatically to the condenser by flue. In the second one, lint
is pickcd up by air at each gin and directly conveyed to the condenser.
ECGO, with the concurrence of the consultants, has decided on the belt
conveyor because of easier access to inspect product quality.
(ix) Lint Condensing and Humidification
30.   The condenser extracts dust and makes a continuous sheet of cotton
named "bat" which goes down to the inclined slide. The slide is equipped
with a humidifying device consisting of adjustable water spray nozzles
automatically regulated and controlled. These nozzles rehumidify the lint
to a suitable moisture content before trampling and pressing.
(x) Bale Pressing
31. Ginning dompanies press soft bales which are delivered either to the
pressing company in Alexandria for reblending and pressing into high-density
export bales, or directly to the local spinning mills. The ECGO intends to
con.tinue pressing soft bales in the rehabilitated ginneries following speci-
fications which are different from the U. S. average "gin flat bale". General
specifications for the new presses are:

The fabrication of non-standard presses would force the bidder to adapt the
exis-ting presE design and engineering at a higher cost.
32.  Taking into consideration the high level of the watertable, it is
recommended that down-packing presses be purchased to avoid prohibitive
costs of excavation and concrete foundations. To reach the required
capacities (10 bales per hour), the presses should be automatic double
box single storey with high duty hydraulic power unit. The press should
have totally enclosed automatic tramplers and interlock switches to prevent
damage through operators' errors. Rams should be automatically controlled.
It is highly recommendable to use adequate ties for strapping bales to reach
the maximnum capacity of the press.
(xi) Bale Scaling, Marking, Storing and Dispatching
33.   Lift-trucks equipped with hydraulic grips (load clamps) similar to
those used in the yard, can take separately each bale from the press room
and move it to the scale and to the marking area. Loading on trucks and
trailers for dispatching may be made by the same lift-trucks. To
satisfy the maximum press capacity, two lift-trucks of one ton would be
required. The project has not included the purchase of lift trucks (Annex 1I).
(xii) Seed Conveyance
34.    Seed collection under the gins and conveyance to the seed room
can be done by:
- chain conveyor
- pneumatic conveyor
- shaker mechanical conveyor
The last type gives full satisfaction in existing ginneries. This type
of equipment has the advantage of self cleaning and iE recommendable for
the new ones.
(xiii) Seed Processing
35.   Because of legal regulations, forbidding exportation of cotton seeds,
it ha; been agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture that equipment manu-
facturers will be asked to send seed sorting units to Fgypt to test commer-
cially their effectivenesE to separate good seed from broken and red seed
and trash. Tenders will not be prepared until after confirmation of their
adequacy.



ANNEX 9
Page 11
(xv) Electrical Equipment
36. All electrical equipment should be in accordance with regulations
and requirements of the IEgyptian electric standards. Standardized
3-phase equipment will be for 50-cycle, 380 V with neutral wire (220 V).
Plants will be connnected to the 11 KV public network. The utilization
factor has been assumed to be 0.7 and the power factor 0.9.
(xvi) Water Facilities
37.   In each new ginnery, one water tower will be built (20 m. high)
generally of reinforced concrete. The recommended holding capacities
are:
100 cu. m. for the single units, and
150 cu. m. for the twin units.
No electric pumps (one standby) each with a capacity of 25 cu. m. per
hour (about 100 US gal. per minute) will be installed near a well pre-
ferably bored in the lot. The sewage system is part of the civil works.
A purifying unit for drinking water may be needed.
(d) Buildings and Civil Works
38.   Construction will be mostly in the traditional Eyptian system.
Frames will be preferably in reinforced concrete, and roof covers sade
of asbestos-cement sheets. If the floors of the bulkstores, the
blending and the ginning halls and the pressing room are not tiled, a
special anti-dust ingredient should be added when the concrete slab is
poured. Detailed civil engineering calculations and drawingfwill be
adapted to the specificationsof the equipment selected and to their
definitive layouts.
ProJeot Formulation (Rehabilitation of Existing Ginneries)
(a) Layout Rearrangement
39.   Most of the buildings existing in the rehabilitated ginneries will
be retained after suitable modifications and repairs. Layout rearrangements
therefore affect only the uncovered area of the inside yard. Bulk
storage buildings and reasonably extensive covered areas have been
recommended at least for all ginneries in Lower Egypt and,
for Beba 'in Upper Egypt as well. The design of the reception area
and new roads and storage areas will be tailored to fit existing build-
ings, and the boundaries of the lot. Whenever possible, inside yards
should be extended.
(b) Civil Modifications and New Buildings
40.   In some of the rehabilitated ginneries, sack and bag sheds exist
and are in acceptable condition; in others, they have to be completed



ANNEX 9
Page 12
or repaired.       Bulk storage buildings with a capacity similar to that of
new ginneries of the same size have been included in the cost estimates.
The blending room will be reconditioned or rebuilt and fitted to use the
conveying system to be installed.
4l.   After necsssary repairs to their roofs, the floor of the ginning
halls will be modified, to meet the requirements of the conveying
systems for ginned cotton. Wooden floors in the "centre corrldor '
will be removed and rebuilt in reinforced concrete.Channels for lint
belt conveyors, if used, will be incorporated. Cantilever mezzanines
along the walls may be needed to support scroll conveyors. In the press
rooms, after necessary repairs to the roofs, working floors will be
remade in concrete and tiled. All measures needed will be taken to
avoid dust coming from the lower storey, where the seed will be conveyed
to the seed room. Modifications or rebuilding of the seed rooms will
depend on the decisions on seed processing and on the detailed civil
engineering surveys. Adequate sanitary facilities and reasonable rest
rooms will be built.
(c)   Modifications and Overhaul of &cisting Equipment
(i)   The Roller Gins
42.   All ginneries in Egypt are equipped with single roller gins.  Most
of them originated from England and have been manufactured by Messrs.
Platt, Oldham, more than 50 years ago. The others were fabricated at
Alexandria by Platt licencees. "CarpentersllL/ used to build new gins
in the ginnery workshops by assembling locally made parts. This handi-
craft production can only be considered as an additional contribution
from the maintenance departments. A careful examination of each of the
existing gins, not only in ginneries to be rehabilitated, but also in
those to be closed down should determine a switching program. The best
machines in the closed ginneries will be overhauled and transferred to
replace the oldest and worst ones in the rehabilitated ginneries.
(ii) Bale Pressing
43.   The same procedure will be applied to existing two box-presses.
(iii) Seed Conveyance
44.   Generally existing shaker conveyors are in acceptable condition
After overhauling they will be equipped with individual shaking electro-
mechanical devices which are easily designed and engineered.
(iv) Seed Processing
45.   A detailed survey of each of the existing seed rooms has to be
completed.  The modifications and equipment replacements will be decided.
1/ These are the carpenters and mechanics specialized in the maintenance
of ginstands working out of shops generally located beside the
ginning hall.



ANNEX 9
Page 13
(v)   Water Facilities
46.   Most rehabilitated ginneries are equipped with water towers.
Some of them need repairs and electric pumps have to be installed to
replace the old existing ones. Water distribution piping needs checking
and may need repairs.
(vi) Workshops
47.   Ecisting machines and tools are very worn.  Very few of them will
be reusable. Some will be recovered while closing down ginneries.
(d)   Additional Equipment
(i)   Seed Cotton Handling
48.   Weighbridges, equipment for yard handling of sacks, and reception
will be the same as for new ginneries. Pneumatic conveying system will
be "tailored" to each ginnery to be rehabilitated. As in new ginneries
pneumatic conveyors will be installed between reception and the blending
hall directly or through bulk stores where these are built.
(ii) Seed Cotton Distribution to the Ginstands
4s9. This equlipment will be adapted to the conditions in the
ginning hall, namely the number and the lay-out of roller gins, after they
have been overhauled, and re-installed, if necessary.  It will probably not
be possible to hold-up these distributors and the regulating feed valves on
the ginstands. They could be supported either by cantilever concrete slabs
to be built at a convenient level (if technioally possible) or by reinforced
concrete or steel columns. The seed cotton will fall in the feeding hoppers
to be fitted on the existing gins.
(iii) Autonatic Feeders
50.   Each of the gins will be equipped with an automatic hopper feeder.
Due to small differences between gins of different ages and of different
manufacturers, suppliers will be required to fit the feeders to each
ginstand.
(iv) Lint Conveyance, Condensing, Humidification and Pressing
51.   The equipment to be purchased is the same as in new ginneries.
However, the lint,instead of sliding directly into the trampler, will fall
on the "exfarfara" floor and will be manually pushed into the press.  Bale
scaling, marking,storing and dispatcbing will be modernized as in the case
of new ginneries.

EGYPT - COTTON GINNING RIHABILITATION PROJECT
EPTPLOYTENT CONDITIONS IN Ti EGYPTIAN COTTOD GINNING INDUSTRY
A. Labor Laws
1.        The first labor law to be introduced in Egypt related to its oldest
industry - cotton ginning.  Law No. 1499 of 1909 prohibited the employment in
ginneries of children under nine years of age. In 1933 another law was
passed prohibiting the employment of children under 12 years of age in
ginneries.  Fourteen more laws were passed in the subsequent years, which
were eventually brought together under Law No. 91 of 1959 contained in the
ILO Legislative series as U.A.R. One Law No. 91.
2.        This docuwent and subsequent amendments contain sections dealing
with the employment of ch:ildren and health and inspection regulations which
are important in the context of ginnery rehabilitation.  Some important
provisions are:
(i)  No male or female under the age of 15 can be emloyed
in industry unless they undergo a medical examination
and hold a labor card certifying that they are
medically fit to do industrial work.
(ii)  No male or female under the age of 15 can work between
the hours of 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. - i.e., night work is
prohibited.
(iii) Males and females under 15 years of age can only work a
maximum of 6 hours per day and this must include 1 hour
for meals and rest.  Not more than 4 hours must be worked
without a break during the 5 working hours each day.
(iv) There are numerous health regulations stipulating the con-
ditions under which certain types of work will be performed.
(v)  Labor inspections must be carried out to ensune that the
law is being observed by industry.
3.        Egypt joined the ILO in 1936 and passed the legislation necessary
to comply with the conditions of mambership. Egypt has also ratified a
comparatively large number of international conventions, 34 out of 136,
whereas many member countries have only ratified between 3 and 10. Inter-
nationel convention 81 is important as it deals with labor inspection and
lays down the working and employment conditions for factories and industry.
Egypt has ratified this convention and, along with other member countries,
presents annual reports to the ILO certifying that all these labor conditions
and requirements are being complied with.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
B. Labor Cooperatives
4,        Since the inception of the cotton ginning industry in Egypt
around 1860, ginneries have obtained the bulk of their work force by buying
their services from individuals, operating as labor contractors. Payment
to these contractors was based on the output of lint. The contractors in
turn paid their workers a daily wage. With nationalization of the industry
in 1963, GOE decided to introduce greater social responsibility in the
procurement of ginning workers by replacing private labor contractors with
labor cooperatives to supply the ginneries with contract workers.
5.        Labor cooperatives are under Government supervision.  They are
still paid by the ginneries on the basis of a fixed fee per cantar of ginned
lint    and, in return, guarantee to provide the necessary contract labor
to enable the ginneries to operate efficiently and in accordance with a
pre-determined program. Contract workers are expected to become members
of the cooperatives by buying a share for 50 PT to contribute to the
cooperative's share capital of about LE500. Labor cooperatives claim to
pay contract workers a level of daily wage which leaves them with about
40% of the fees received from the ginneries, from which-they meet social
charges on behalf of the workers, and their overheads. In addition the
workers receive a bonus of between LE1 to 7 at the end of each season, and
a TEl0 grant if a family member dies. Cooperatives usually do
not operate across more than one governorate and provide labor for up to
12 ginneries.  Within a governorate labor cooperatives compete with one
another and offer different wages for different tasks and working conditions.
6.        Before  a   ginning season begins, the cooperatives and the
ginneries negotiate the volume of labor required by types and operations,
and the fee which will be charged for the provision of each type of labor.
The fee is calculated on the basis of two shifts per day, and a clause is
included to ensure that when a three shift system is operating
the third shift is charged at nonmal rate plus "x" milliemes per cantar
(7 milliemes at most ginneries in 1972/73). Apparently the ginneries have
no redress if the labor cooperatives fail to provide the volume of contracted
labor.
7.        There is no evidence that the labor cooperative system has helped
tc improve conditions of work inside ginneries. At the same time competition
between the cooperatives has tended to reduce average contract labor fees
paid by ginneries in the last five years (para. 10). Since productivity
has not improved, individual contract labor wages have also tended to be
lower. Officials of labor cooperatives have expressed themselves in
favor of rehabilitation in the interest of those workers who would retain
their employment hopefully on better conditions of work and compensation.



ANNEX 10
Page 3
C. Present Wage Levels and Social Insurance
8.        Salaries and wages presently,paid by the ginning industry directly
to permanent and seasonal workers, and even more so wages earned by contract
workers through labor cooperatives are difficult to establish accurately.
Estimates shown hereunder are therefore only approximate.
9.        Permanent staff cannot be made redundant:  any surpluses arising
from the closure of existing ginneries must be absorbed by the rehabilitated
and new ginneries. Seasonal workers may be discharged. Normal daily working
hours for permanent and seasonal staff cover two shifts. Any third shift
working is classed as overtime at one and one-fourth the normal rate.
Numbers of workers and total wage bills for permanent and seasonal workers
are roughly estimated as follows:

Company ginneries during 1967 to 1972 are shown below. From this data it
can be inferred that:
(a)  rates vary from area to area depending on the availability
of labor,
(b) competition between cooperatives caused contract labor
rates to decline during these years,
(c)  rates have been relatively more stable from 1970 to
1972 than in the previous years.

11*       Contract labor rates not only vary between individual ginneries,
but also between the ginning companies. In 1971/72 for example, the average
contract labor rates for two companies were:
El Wady  - 119.36 milliemes/cantar
Misr     -   96.86 milliemes/cantar
Among the reasons for the variation in rates are the facts that the Misr
ginneries are larger, are operated by diesel, and have very few outside
stores compared with the El Wady ginneries.
12.       A study of the El Wady ginneries established that the average
cost of contract labor per cantar ginned during 1970/71 was 124.9 milliemes
or 12.49PT. Extrapolating this, it is estimated that the total cost of
contract labor to the ginning industry in 1970/71 was LE1.265 million.
13.       Most contract workers have a daily or shift rate and draw their
earnings 15 days in arrears from the local labor cooperative offices. Small
interim advances can be obtained. The carriers or porters are paid on a



ANNEX 10
"gang basis" according to the number of sacks of seed cotton or bales moved
each day. The total sum is then apportioned according to a pre-arranged
plan. Pay levels for people under 25 years are extremely low for all types
of work, the average being between 1.125 to 2.5 PT per hour. The range of
daily earnings based on one to two shifts plus a calculated indicative monthly
wage (24 working days) for contract, seasonal and permanent workers are as

EGYPT - COTTON GINNING REHABILITATION PROJECT
EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF MECHANIZATION
1.     There are two main features of the rehabilitatiorn of existing
ginneries:  the electrification of all equipment, and the mechanization
of seed cotton conveying and distribution, lint conveying and humidifying
(cottonseed is generally adequately conveyed at present). The obsolete
and outdated belt-and-pulley transmission and the prime movers used at
present magnify the probability of producLion losses through breakdowns.
Driving of ginstands with individual electric motors will ensure that
only one or two ginstands will be down at a time and only for a short-time
(provided enough spares are available).  The same applies to the driving
of other equipnent.  No loss of employment is related to electrifying of
equipment drives and, on the contrary, trained persoTnel for electrical
maintenrance w11. be required.  The important improvements in materials
handlina could comprise the following:
a)     Mechanical handling of cotton seed sacks in the yards;
b)     Pneumatic handling of seed cotton from reception to bulk storage
and/or blending hall and from bulk storage to blending hall.
c)     Pneumatic suction and conveyance of seed cotton from the blending
hall to the gimning hall;
d)     Distribution of the seed cotton to ginstands by scroll conveyor
anid its automatic feeding to the gins;
e)     Handling of lint from ginstands to condense-. by belt conveyors, lint
flue, automatic humidifying of lint, ano automatic trampling of lint
lnto the press boxes (in the case of new ginneries);
f )    Mechanized handling of lint bales in the yards after pressing.
2.     Steps (c), (d) and (e) as described above are the core segments of
the mechani7ati on of ginning operations. Breaking of this core into its
component parts or elimination of any of them would defeat the purpose of
the rehabilitation: to increase outtumn; create compatible working condi-
tions; upgrade lint by avoiding contamination with lrash, oil, broken seeds.
etc. This group of steps is the minimum level of mechanization which could
achieve a significant part of the benefits foreseen by the project.



Annex 1 1
Pge 2
Addition of step (b) is also important 41thou.ilh it can technically be segregaied
from the core steps without seriously impairing the benefits obtainable from
the latter. This is considered to be an intermediate level of mechanization
for the project. Full mechanization would include totally mechanized yard
handling as described under (a) through (f) in the previous paragraph.
3.     An analysis of the investment required for the three alternative
levels of mechanization described above and of their effects on weploynent
and the net benefits obtainable are shown in Tables 11.1 and 11.2. Inclusion of
the intermediate stage of mechanization increases projected
net benefits by 76% over those obtained from minimum mechanization
while the capital cost required increases by only L7% and employment decreases
by only 9% compared to minimum mechanization:

Inclusion of mechanization of yard handling  looks  attractive from the
viewpoint of the benefit to capital cost ratio. However, it is not necessary
to consider it from the start of the project as by its nature (utilization of
fork lift trucks) it can be flexibly implemented at a later date. In the
meantime, the specially-trained heavy weight movers - who may not either be
retrained or find employment in other jobs - can be utilized and slowly phased
out as they retire and no new movers replace them (at present they are already
difficult to find for work in some locations). Sectors (a) and (f) - mechani-
zatiori of yard handling - has therefore been excluded from the project.
1/ Only costs and benefits related to mechanization are included.

EG!PT - COTTON GINNING REHABILITAT ION PROJECT
RISK ANALvSI$ 02 T1hE PROJFJDT
1. The Need for Risk Analysis
1.01      Capital investment decisions wn the Bank Group are generally based
on internal economic and financ:ial rates of return.  Tnese measures are
arrived at by taking sinrgle value estimates of the factors affectiing cash
flows - e.g., costs and benefits in each year of the project's life - ard
calculating the net cash flow in eaclh year.  Discounted rate of return is
then calculated as a single measure of the total value of the cash flows.
However, these single value estinates are based or, certain assumptions.
Each assumption involves its owl degree - often a high degree - of uncer-
tainty; and, taken together, these combined uncertainties can .multiply
into a total uncertainty of critical rroporticns.  Thus, If we select the
best estimate value for each factor, that is, use values most likely to be
achieved, then we disregard the consequences   at times very substan-ial -
of any variations around these best estimate values.  A traditional n,ethod
of dealing with this urcertainty is to use conservative estimates for each
cash flow.  However, a combination of conservative estimates for different
factors is likely to result in an overly conservative result.  This could
lead to rejection of an otherwise attractive probect.
1.02      In the analysis of the Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project, we
faced such a situation.  There are major uncertainties, more so than an
average IDA project, in practically all major costs and benefits.  The
underlying reasons for these uncertainties are:
(a)  The vodernization program aims to mechanize an industry
which hitherto has been manually operated except for
the ginstands. There are no precedents in Egypt to
enable reliable estimates of the benefits of mechaniza-
tion in the form of quality improveraent, productivity
increase and cost savings;
(b) ECGO and its subsidiaries have no experience in any
major construction progrrm .  Their experience, which
is very valuable, is limited to running established
units.  The last few new ginneries were constructed
over 20 years ago. The Phiase I project calls for
rehabilitation or construction of -11 ginneries at sites
spread all over the country.  In addition. 10 of these
ginneries are to undergo major rehabilitation work
which by its nature is uncertain. This makes accurate
estimates of constructioar time and capital  costs difficult;
(c)  The fature of cotton in world markets is a subject of
debate itself.  In addition, we have to face the uncer-
tainty of revenues expect,ed from quality improvement;
(d)  The future values of various currencies of major iurport-
ance to this project are uncertain. About 5O0 of project

costs, spread over the next 5-6 years, are in foreign
equipment. Most of this ecuipment is expected to be
procured from the USA, UK, and one or two other coiutries.
veir haalf of Egyptian cotton is exported.  This means that
any f.uture varlations in the parity between the ITS. dollar,
Pound Sterling and Egyptian Pound will have major effects
on both capital costs and revenue benefi ts.
l.l''3    I:n order -to be realistic, project appraisal ir; this instance had
to be based on a techniquie which could cope w:ith the effects of these un-
certaintites.  IThe Monte-Carlo Simulation Risk Analys.s technique was chosen
as t'e r.ost suitab.  'The risk analysis process added two 6isticti ve
features to the single value method of evaluation.  These are:
(a)  It enabled quanttification of the uncertainty in each of
the key variables affecting the outcome of the analysis;
(b)  It combined these estimates using a simulation process
to produce a description of th;e risk a-ttached to this
investment .
2.Monte-Carlo Simulatin Risk2al-Sis
2.01      The risk analysis elirminates the need for restricting the
appraiser's judgement to a single optimi stic, pessimistic or beat estimate
evraluation of a variable.  It oermits, throughout the analysis, a oomplete
Judgement on the possible range of each varialble and on the likelihood of
each value within this range.  At each step of the analys1s. ths ee ludge-
ments are combined at the same time as the variables themselves ar e combined.
As a result, the Droduct of the analysis is not just a single value of the
decisiorn variable. out a Judgement on the possible range of the decision
variable around this value, and a judrement on the likelihood of each va-lue
wi-thi.n -'-his range,.
Q'02      These judgements take the form of probability distributions.
Every possible value of each variable is associated with a number (probabil-
ity) bet:ween 0 arnd 1, such that for each variable the sum of all these
numbers, or probabilities, is equal to 1.  These probabilities, whlicl are
called subjective probabilities because they represent subjective judgement,
follaw all the rules of traditional probability theory. Risk anal.,ysis aggre-
gates these like.lihoods. The technique best suaited for such an analysis
for cur project seemed to be the Monte-Carlo si-mulation technique.
2L03      The idea underlying the Monte-Carlo simulation is simple. It
selects at random. fromz the dis-tribution of values for each factor one parti-
cular value.  The values for all of the factors are then combined and the
rate o," return is computed from this combination. For instance, the lowest
in the range of prices might be combined with the highest in the range of
growuth rate and other factors.  (We must, however, consider inter-dependence
between different factors.)  This is repeated over and over again to define
and eevaluate tlhe odds of occurrence of each possible rate of return.  A
computer is used to do the necessary calculations which could run into millions.



AINEX 13
Page 3
2.04      The result is a list of the rates of return, with the likelihood
of their being achieved. The average "expectation" is the average of the
values of all outcomes weighted by the chances (probability) of each
occurring. The variability of outcome values from the average is also
listed.  This is an indicator of the risk profile of the project.  For
example, if a project is indicated to have a 5U% chance of earning a 10%
return or more, it means that there is an even chance that the project
would earn 10% or miore return.
3.  The Assesament of Uncertainties in Key Variables
3.01      The first step involved in the risk analysis of the project was
to determine the key variables which substantially influence the financial
and economic viability of the project.  The information presented in the
project feasibility report   was used to ascertai.n the effect on the finan-
cial results of changes in the main costs and benefits. This broad sensi-
tivity analysis enabled us to identify the following as the key variables
for the project analysis:
(a)  Capital Costs - Their absolute value and timing
substantially affected the rate of return.
(b)  Revenue Gains - About 50% of the project benefits were
attributed to revenue gains from expected quality
improvement.  This is influenced not only by the level
of grade improvement but also cotton prices obtainable
in futuwe.
(c)  ProductivitZ of Modernized Ginneries - This affected the
project in three ways. First, it determined the produc-
tion capacity and thus influenced the size of the project.
Second, it set the length of the ginnring season which has
importan-t bearing on the cotton grade (Annex i, para 11)
Third, through productivity per hour, it deteridned
operating costs.
(d)  Labor Costs - Wages formed over 5050 of total operating
costs.  Major changes in manpower requirement, and
thus wages influenced profitability.
(e)  Currency Parities - With over 60% oF revenues, andl 50%
of capital costs of the project being in foreign exchange,
any change in the valuie of the Egyptian Pound relative
to other currencies was important.
(f)  Project Completion Time - The construction time affected
the cash flow in two ways; first tirough timing and thus
the present value, of the capital costs. Second, by
determining the size and timing of the project benefits.
This influenced not only the rate of return but also
other financial ratios like debt coverage.



ANNEX1L
3.02      The appraisal mission concentrated on determining, and quantify-
ing the likelihood and range of uncertainties in each of the above factors.
Extensive discussions were held with the consultants who prepared the
feasibility report. They were asked explicitly to state the assumptions
used by them in arriving at the estimates of the variables. Uncertainties
in each of these assumptions were probed. Their experts in each field,
e.g., design and engineering, procurement, operations, etc.; were inter-
viewed to quantify the likely variations from their original estimates.
These discussions enabled planning of assessment work required in Egypt
and elsewhere.
3.03      In Egypt, experts in each field were extensively interviewed.
For example, for the assessment of possible quality improvement in cotton
lint (Annex 18 ), ECGO's top ginning expert was interviewed a number of
times. His initial estimates were compared with the consultant's estimates
and cross checked with the opinions of the ginnery managers and the officials
in the export companies, spinning and weaving organization and the agricul-
ture ministry. The estimates were then revised and refined with ECGO's
experts.  Similarly, in case of cotton prices, in addition to cotton export
companies in Egypt, discussions were held with GATT and the staff members
in the Bank Group. fvF staff members were approached for assessing the
future of the Egyptian Pound.
3.o4      These final estimates were, then, discussed and refined by the
mission members including the mission's technical consultant. Any apparent
inconsistency or bias in the estimates were corrected. These probability
assessments became the inputs to a computer model developed to perform the
risk analysis of the project. The results were broadly checked to confirm
that they were within the range anticipated by the mission while making
the probability assessments.
h. Treatment of Uncertainties
4.01        For  ease in quantifying uncertainties in the variables under
consideration, each variable was divided into components with about the
same level of uncertainty or into components affected by similar uncertain-
ties.
4.02      Capital costs were divided into foreign and local costs; foreign
costs being more certain due to more standard items being purchased from
abroad, their prices being better known and due to an open competition
between a larger number of known suppliers than is anticipated in case of
local supplies. Further, the foreign costs were divided into items with
more certain costs like gin stands, motors, switchgear, etc., which
are standard and not likely to change during detailed engineering (Table
13 .1) and relatively uncertain items like conveying and seed room equip-
ment, etc., whose specifications will be finalized only after detailed
engineering is complete and which may have to be custom made (Table 13.2).
Similarly, local costs of the new ginneries are subject to less uncertainty
as the amount of work involved in them is broadly defined (Table 13.3).
However, about 40% of the local costs of the rehabilitated ginneries are
more uncertain (Table 13,4).   These costs include repairs of ginning hall



ANNEX
floors and ceiling, seed room bulding, foundations, etc. Details of most
of this work can be fully determined only after results of a detailed
survey of the present physical state of the ginneries (presently being
conducted) are available.
4.03      Grade Imrovement in Cotton Lint - A separate assessment was made
for the qualitg improvement expected Ln the new and the rehabilitated
ginneries in bothn tne Delta and Upper Egypt regions (Annex 18, para. 13).
4.04      Ginnery Completion Time - There is a strong possibility of con-
siderable variation from the original e3timate of the time required to
complete individual ginneriest construction. As the detailed engineering
of the project has just started, the exact amount of physical work to be
done is still undefined.  The consultants have no prior work experience
in working under present environment and conditions in Egypt, and nelther
has ECGO any prior construction experience. These uncertainties reflect in
the estimates of the completion time of a new ginnery which vary between
18 months in the best case and 45 months in the worst case with the best
estimate now being 28 months (Table 1365). In case of the rehabilitated
ginneries, an additional major uncertainty is introduced - each ginnery
may have a different volume of wo>'k the extent of which may not be known
till the work is well in progress. This led to an assessment that a rehabi-
litated ginnery is likely to take at least 20 months to complete but could
also take up to 50 months, the expected time being 29 months (Table 13.6).
h °5      Operating    Saings - The level of operating cost  savings due
to the modernization and uncertainty in them, is again different in case of
the rehabilitated and new ginneries. The best estimate for cost savings2/
expected in the new ginneries due to their higher productivity, lower labor
cost and fewer breakdowns relative to the present ginneries is 18.5 PT per
cantar of cotton ginned. However, Egypt so far has not employed the level
of mechanization proposed in the new ginneries. This introduces an uncer-
tainty about the effectiveness with which this new system can be introduced
in the Egyptian environment through a completely new group of managers and
workers. Consequently, the savings could be as low as 12 PT per cantar
and as high as 25 PT per cantar (Table 13.7). In case of the rehabilitated
ginneries, due to a slightly lower level of mechanization proposed, the
productivity would be lower and thus savings are estimated at only 10 PT
per cantar. These relatively less radical changes will be managed by
experienced ginnery managers resulting in an uncertainty lower than that
in the case of new ginneries (Table 13.8).
4.06      The effects of a do-nothing policy were considered by their
division into three major categories:
1/ Excluding depreciation.



ANNEX 13
Page 6
(a) Most of the ginneries are very old and there is a
real possibility of frequent breakdowns in their
operations. Any such manor breakdown due to a
resultant loss in production capacity may necessi-
tate either an increase in the third shift operations
or movement of some cotton to a different ginnery
processing the same variety of cotton.  The above
mentioned major breakdowns are defined as those which
will force a discontinuance of ginnery operations for
a few days. Powerhouse failure is one of the major
reasons for such breakdowns. The likelihood and
seriousness of these breakdowns is expected to increase
with the passage of time. To quantify this, the probab-
ility of a breakdown in a ginnery,and expected average
production lost due to it, was assessed. for three time
periods; the first five years, the years six to ten.
and after ten years. Table 13 .9 presents these assess-
ments.
(b)  Operating costs per cantar are likely to increase with
time due to maintenance needs and some decline  ir
productivity.  This factor is relativejy definite and
a single value estimate - gradual increase of 25% from the
present level of      operating costs in the next 10 years
- was used. (Increase in these costs due to inflation
was disregarded.)
(c)  Similarlyr the expected cost penalty due to a limitation
in the production capacity (Annex 18, para. 2) was
assessed as a single best estimate. First, a decrease
in this cost penalty is a relatively small benefit of
the modernization. Second, the cost savings expected
from increased ginning capacity, planned under the proj-
ect, are relatively uncertain. Cost savings will accrue
from savings in additional transport cost incurred to
deliver cotton to distant ginneries when sufficient
ginning capacity is unavailable in a ginnery close to
the cotton production area.
4.07      For an estimate of the long-term cotton production trend,
discrete probabilities were arrived at. It involved choosing three most
likely growth rates and giving each one of them a probability.  There is
a 60% likelihood that in the next 10 years cotton production in Egypt
will increase 15% from the present level. The minimum growth is expected
to be 10% and has a probability of 25% (Table 18.12). However, there is also a25%
chance that the growth be around 30%. In addition to an uncertain long-
term production growth rate, substantial seasonal fluctuations due to
factors like weather, insect damage, etc.. are possible. In any year,
this variation can result in a production between 5% above and 10% below
the long-term production trend for the year.



ANNEX 13

4h.08      The possibIlit,y of a ch,r.ge in the par..ty of the Egyprian Pound
with other hard currencies was asse,ssed separately. This uncertainty
involved two factors: the likelihood of a change in each of the next 10
years and the rapnitude of this chanRe if it did take place. In practice, the
magnitude of suen a change is alo3 lc 1l.   to increase with years.  However,
sufficient infonrfation on this relati^ onsi,  wfas noln available and thus this pos-
sible refinement was abandoned.  stable 13 e 10 gives the possibility of a deval-
uation of the Egyptian PoLund in each of the next 1C years. This devalua-
tion is relative to an average of hard currencies and neglects likely
changes in individual hard currei;cn-.es llke the U.S. dollar.  Table 13 .11
sunriarizes the probabilities ard likel>  amounts of devaluation if it
occurred.  Expected value of the JEyptian Pound during a year is applied
to other relevant variables.
4.09       The uncertainties weres assessed oanly for the next 10 years.  Due
to a high rate of ret.irn expec'cd id  the project, even  major variations in
cash flows 10 years awTay do not substantially influence the present value
of such flows.  An attempt to cauanti-fy possible variations ir cash fi,ows
after 10 years wotild involve substantial inputs of staff time without
making any major difference in the results due to the above reason.  Con-
sequently, most of the variables were assumed to remain constant from year
11 onwards.
5.  Computer >I-odel Devel          ii for Jisk Analysis of the Pronect
5.01      A Monte,Cer.lo Risk Anialcysis Computer Miodel w-as custom nmde for
the analysis of the project.   'Si1cpak,r a risk analysis sxirualation miodel
at Harvard Business School. was iased as a core.  A model was then prograrimed
which would accept informa-:_on developed by us, use it in a logic decided
by the appraisal mission and output the information desired. Table 13 .12
presents the basic logic of this coriputer model.
5.02       In each trial (our resul-..s are based on 2CC,, Such trials), the
model follows the following steps:
(a)  The completion time of each one of the 1i  ginneries
is determined.  The twonth in which work on each of
these ginnerJes will start was pre-determined (as
defined in the project schedule - Annex 15).  For
each of the ginn eries, depending on -whether it is a
new (Table 13.5) or a rehabilitated one (Table 13.6),
the time taken between the startirig date and the date
of commissioning is determined.  The montls to complete
are simulated dependirng on the random  number for each
of the ginneries. These estimated completion times will,
over a large number of trials, reflect the basic uncertain-
ties shown in these tables.  Thus, the month of completion
of each ginnery is determined. This infornation is one of
the inputs to the determination of the capital cost expendi-
tures and capacities of different ty-pes of ginneries - new,



ANINI   13
Page 8
rehabilitated and old - in the Delta and Upper Egypt
during each year. The model takes into accouTnt the
fact that the ginning season lasts from September to
March.  Thus a ginnery coming on strear. in the period
between March to August has no output during this
period.
(b) For each year the model based on the probabilities given
ir, Table  L3.lOdeterdines if a devaluation of the Egyptian
Pound took place. If not, it proceeds to the next year.
But if there was a devaluation it uses Table 13 .11 to
siimulate the ariount of devaluation. After one devaluation
no further changes in parity are considered. The expected
value of the Egyptian Pound in every year till 1982 is
thus determined.  This information is used in calculating
the project costs and benefits during each year.
(c) Capital costs for the new and rehabilitated ginneries are
then calculated for each year. This involves six distinct
steps:
1)  Each component of the capital costs
without consideration of the uncertainty in as it
is first determiined. For example, for the rehab-
ilitated ginneries the base figures (original
estimates of our technical consultant) for its
certain and uncertain foreign expenditures components
as well as both parts of its local costs
are picked up.
2)  Each of these values is used to deternine  the "ex-
pected" cost of each component by combining this
original value with its probability assessmient
curve which is expressed in terms of expected cost
as a percentage of original estimate. For exanple,
for ur.certain foreign costs of rehabilitated gin-
neries Table 13 .2 is used.
3)  Each of these components is combined to separately
calculate the foreign and local costs of the rehab-
ilitated and new ginneries.
4)  Information from the devaluation model is used to
calculate the local currency equivalent of foreign
costs.
5) Based on project completion period, calculated
earlier, a stream of costs in each year is deter-
mined.
6)  Price escalation for each year is estimated assuming
that the local costs will rise at an annual rate of



ANNEX 13
Page 9
3 , and fJoreign - osts at 7%. Trhese rates are based
on historical trends.
The above steps give ttie capital costs, forei-r and local!
for eaeh year.
(d)  Based on the lorg-term growth t-.erd picked up, cottor.
producti or. for each of the next 20 years is deteririned.
The decision rule incor-Iorates th-at if Egypt att ains
an increase of over 15% in the next 10 years, it will
then atter'pt to limit further cotton growth and diver-
sify land utilization inlto other fields.  Cotton produc-
tion, therefore. is kept constant after the year 1983/8L.
However, if productimo in the next 10 years has not
increased by 15%, then E. t will continue its efforts
to reac-lh tL'hat level.  .ctual cotton production in a ;rear
is ther, calcuolated by ircorporating the annual fluctv.2
tion fron this lorg-Lerm trend.
(e)  The ginning capacity of the inddustr,,r is determinedi  for
each y_ea'C.  This involves detenriinat-ion of, based on the
modernized ginneries' co.,pletion months, the number of
gin stands in each mornth of each ginning season.  Gin
stands are accumulated irto th-ree separate groups -
new, rehabilitated ar1d old. rT hie prodLictivi t'7 of each
type is kriown.    Gi nstand
productiorn ionths are then converted in uo production
capacity in each morth.  'rhis. comb2ned with the expected
cottor produ'-ion during the y-ear, determines the
length of the ginning season and cotton ginned in each
type of ginnery in each year.
(f)  The effects of a do-nothing policy are ruantlified for
each year in the forr of expected. CCSft increases and
penalties as described di Annex '.18  para. 2.  The
project ber efits are then ca]ic;uiated by ar estinmate of
the cost. increases ptevented by nodernizatior . This
prevention is due to the replacement of   part- of the
production capacity of old ginneri.es by the modernized
ginneries.  The percentage of total ginrlning capacity
of the modernized ginneries is ri ult,iplied lv the absolute
increase in the costs expected daring the year under a
do-nothing policy.  This deternines tlhe savings due to
a prevention i n otherwise possible increases in the
operating costs, breakdowr. costs and production capacity
cost penalty.
(g)  Tie grade improvement in eacn of the foTr tTes of
ginneries. e.g., new and rehabilitated in the Delta
and Upper Egypt; are calculated separately. /These
expected grade improvements are multiplied by the
quantity of cotton ginned in the corresponding type
1/ Wfith due consideration for their inter-relatio1sbip9.



ANNEX 13
Page 10
of ginneries. The volume of cotton improved determines
the quality premium obtainable in export markets.
Local premium, already low, is expected to
remain at the present level. The level of grade improve-
ment, volume of cotton involved in this improvement and
the price premium obtained from this give the additional
revenues due to quality improvement.
(h) The subroutine on operating cost savings first picks up
the cost savings expected in the new and rehabilitated
ginneries. Cotton ginned by them is already known.
Thus, cost savings are calculated for the year.
(i) The increased cotton lint outturn,due to the elimdnation
of a major part of cotton lost during handling is first
determined as a percentage of the total (from a normal
distribution curve). The best estimate suggests that
this will amount to 0.7% of the total seed cotton handled,
with the lowest estimate being 0.5% and highest 1.25%.
This percentage is multiplied by the total volume ginned
in the modernized ginneries during the year. The addi-
tional revenues are calculated at a price of LE16.0 per
Cantar - the domestic lint sales price. Similarly,
revenue gains from additional availability of cotton
seed due to an improvement in planting seed quality is
determined. These savings are in direct proportion to
the production in the modernized ginneries.
(j) All the revenue gains and cost savings are added to
determine total project benefits. Based on the capital
expenditures schedule, depreciation for the year is
calculated. Profits and cash flow for the year are
determined as shown in Table 18.9.
(k) This process is repeated for each of 20 years. Basic
data is stored for every year. From the cash flows
rate of return is calculated.
5-03      The above procedure was followed for 200 trials.  For each trial
different random numbers were generated. In any trial, a high value of one
variable may be combined with a relatively low value of another variable.
This simulated real life situations. The expected value of each variable
and desired outputs are weighted averages of the values and their frequency
achieved during these trials.
6. Interdependencies among Uncertainties
6.01      In the above analysis, the uncertainties surrounding each key
variable were explicitly quantified. Some of these uncertainties were
interdependent, meaning that if the value of one of the variables was known,
it would substantially influence the assessment of uncertainty. The project
has two important interdependencies. First is in the grade improvement. If



ANNEX 13
Page 11
there was some grade improvement in the Delta, it was more than likely
that Upper Egypt ginneries would also register an improvement in the grade
of cotton ginned in them (Annex 18, para. 14).  Second, a major dependency
was noticed in the capital costs. The capital costs of the new and rehab-
ilitated ginneries are interrelated through comnon elemm-ts as are the un-
certainties surrounding the magnitude of the local and foreign costs.
6.02      If these interrelationships were ignored the results of risk
analysis would be inaccurate. For example, the grade improvement in a new
ginnery was attributed to improved handling, storage and productivity.
Operations in the new ginneries in the Delta and Upper Egypt differ ;>iX_y
in the seed cotton processed;  Upper Egypt cotton contains mcre tkust and
foreign matter. These factors are reflected in the assessments of likely
grade improvements in two types of ginneries. The grade improvement is
expected to be higher but also more uncertain in Upper Egypt compared to
the Delta.  A knowledge of the grade improvement achieved in the Delta would
reduce the uncertainty about the grade improvement in Upper Egypt and vice
versa. For example, if grade improvement in the Delta were 3/16, the most
likely grade improvement in Upper Egypt would be 4/16. An assumption that
these two were independent would lead to an assumption that the most likely
improvenent in Upper Egypt would also be 3/16 (both these expected values
would also have different ranges of uncertainties).  This would result in
an underestimation of the variance (Upper Egypt cotton has more dust and
is likely to have greater improvement), a measure of risk, in the expected
grade improvement. On the other hand, an assumption that Upper Egypt
would always register an improvement of, say, 1/16 of a grade higher than the
Delta, could lead to an overestimation of the variance. This made an explicit
consideration of the interdependencies important for a realistic risk analysis.
6.03      The interdependencies in the capital costs were handled as described
in para. 5.02(c) above.  For grade improvement, modeniized ginneries were
divided into four types - new and rehabilitated in the Delta and in Upper
Egypt. The new ginneries would have a distinct technical advantage (better
gin stands) over the rehabilitated ginneries which would result in an addi-
tional grade improvement. This advantage would be independent of the location
of the ginneries. A probability distribution was assessed for this factor.
Once the grade improvement in the rehabilitated ginneries in a region was
determined by simulation, the grade improvement in the new ginneries in that
region was obtained by randomly selecting the additional improvement from
the above probability distribution. Unlike the above case, the regional
differences in grade improvement could not be sunmmarized by a simple factor.
It involved the following steps: first, a probability distribution of grade
improvement for the rehabilitated ginneries in the Delta was assessed. This
was then divided into four likely intervals: "low," "low-mid," "mid-high,"r
aid 'high" grade improvement. Four distributions of possible grade improve-
ments in the Upper Egypt rehabilitated ginneries, corresponding to each of
the four intervals in the Delta, were then obtained.  For instance, if the
grade improvement in the Delta was known to be "low-mid," then a probability
distribution for the grade improvement in Upper Egypt was established.
Similarly, corresponding distributions were developed for the other three
intervals. (These are known as conditional distributions.) Calculations
indicated that the grade improvements in the rehabilitated ginneries in the
Delta and Upper Egypt were highly correlated (Correlation Coefficient = .8).
Without the interdependency analysis this covariance would have been ignored.



AMNEX 13
Page 12
6.O0      In the risk aialysis, first the grade improvement in-be Delta
for rehabilitated ginneries was determined by simulation. The interval
in which it fell was noted and the appropriate conditional distribution
for the rehabilitated ginneries in Upper Egypt selected by the computer.
A second simulation obtained the grade improvement obtained from this
probability distribution. Next, the additional improvement for the new
ginneries was simulated and added to the above value to obtain grade
improvements in the Delta and Upper Egypt new ginneries. A separate
program was written to handle this part of the risk analysis
7. The results of Risk Analysis
7.01      Risk analysis provided the range and the probabilities of different
values being in that range for the key variables. For example, while the
expected foreign cost component of the capital costs (before escalation pro-
vision) is "expected" to be mE6.2 million, it can have substantial variation
(Annex 19).  It can vary between 1E5.4 million and T.E8.2 million.  However,
while the probability of these costs being over LE6.2 million is only 40%
compared to a 60% chance that they will be lower than it, the magnitude of
the maximum possible overrun is much greater (LE2.0 million or 33%) thix the
size of the maximum possible underrun expected (1Eo.8 million or 13%) .-"
Similarly, considerable variation in the "expected" annual cash flow is
likely (Annex 19). For example, in 1979/80 expected net cash flow is TE2.46
million. There is, however, a 45% likelihood of the cash flow being less than
this. The minimum cash flow expected is LE1.27 million or 52% of the expected
value. On the other side, the cash flow could be as high as LE4.42 million
(180% of expected).

7.05      The results indicate that though original estimates were too optimistic,
even after consideration of all major commercial uncertainties (and assuming that
ECGO will urgently set up a suitable project implementation unit), the project is
financially very attractive. They do point out, however, that despite the attrac-
jive rate of return, substantial fluctuation irn cash flows can be expected.
8. Some Implications of the Risk Profile on Project APpraisal
8.01      It is clear that a slippage of about 9 months from the original esti-
mates is expected in the project completion time. However, the assessment of
timing was made under the assumption that ECGO will put together a competent
project implementation group, as suggested elsewhere in this report.
1/ These costs exclude price escalation. With price escalation "expected
cost" will beIE7.1 million.



ANNEX 13
Page 13
Its absence can cause even longer delays due to the complexity involved in a
successful completion of tasks involved in the project execution. Risk analy-
sis indicated that both project costs and benefits are substantially affected
by the ginneries' completion time.
8.02      The "expected" capital costs (excluding interest during construction)
of LE1h.2 million (US$36.5 million) are a weighted average of all possible costs.
There is a 45% chance that actual costs will be higher than this amount. This
and the sensitivity of rate of return to the variations in capital costs makes
a close supervision of project execution of utmost importance.
8.03      Though the debt coverage in different years is very comfortable,
it is based on the expected cash flows. A substantial fluctuation in the cash
flows from these expected values is possible. Due to this risk, a higher than
average coverage is desirable.

PROJECT BENEFITS
A. Methodology
1.        The financial and econo-mLic analyses of Phase I in this report ara
on an incremental basis which nmakes it important to establish po-siole
consequences, if any, of not undertaking the rehabilitation prcgrtv- Present
levels of revenues, costs and profits are used a3 the datum lifre.  Kith a
'do-nothing' policy, costm are expectod to inerease and profits d6cre*4-,e, -.rcr

qro owned by it.  The financi3l benefits are discussed hereun4er.
n,              
2.        Under the 'do-nothing' policy, it is assumed that maintFinance .
nlant and equipment will continue at about the present level without -a'jo:
replacements. Most ginning experts in Egypt, and IDA's technical consul-ant
believe that no further noticeable deterioration (due to ginning quality)
in lint grade is expected in the next 10-15 years even if operations are
continued on the present equipment. This factor, therefore, £s -ssumed  
remain constant.  Operating costs, mainly due to increased mai.n K.v,nce, *uJri
rise steadily by about 25% in 15 years even disregarding wj-I inflation.  r-.
the absence of major equipment replacements, for example in 'oover houses
the probability of major breakdowns would increase over 15 yeas as sh:-i .
in Annex 13  Table 9 . Loss of production would then have to be madFup-
a third shift whenever possible or by moving seed cotton 'to other  .
involving additional cost.  A penalty of 5 PT/Cantar has been app2iec'
the analysis for such breakdowns. Although theoretically there is alre3a.r
some surplus of ginning capacity in the country, this cannot e;fectivo.-y ',Ve
used because the varieties and volume of cotton grown in each district rit
from year to year, and thi.9 changas the loading on the ginneries _i- the
looility since each rocncentrat-,s rnly on one variety during the seazon. As
a result of such unoven capn'eity utilization, it is estimated that coue
production in excess O.-L 9.5j million cantars is processed in a third shfi
cr transported over imno thin ort,ti;um distance  to under-utilized .,nneries¢,

TOTAL          X
C. Savings Expected in OperatIng Costs
4.        By 1978 rehabilitation is expected to yield substantial operating
cost savings from the present operating costs level (excluding any increase
due to a do-nothing policy) of approximately LE584,O00 per year. The
absolute level of these savings will increase with increasing volume of
ginning; in 1983/84, these savings will amount to LE631,000 annually. These
savings derived from the risk analysis are based on the best estimates tha¢,
the operating costs would drop from the present average of 62.18 PT/Cantar 4x
49 PT/Cantar by the end of the project. These assessments are refinements of
the initial estimates and the underlying assumptions used by IDA's consul7.tr-
detailed in Table 18.6.    _Improved productivity is the
most important factor in cost reduction. Conpared to an old ginstandye a-wera:2 d
productivity of 1 in a season, a rehabilitated ginnery will have a productIv .7Y
of 1.87 and a new ginnery 2.05. There are three main reasons:  firsts mec;`A._1.46u
feeding of ginstands will increase output by 25% in rehabilitated and by ', -
new ginneries; second, the new ginneries are expected to run at 85% of vro-
duction capacity compared to 80% for old or rehabilitated ginneries; third, zie
modernized ginneries are expected to run 3 shifts a day, 6 days a week- compared
to the present average of 2 shifts a day.
5. -'     There will be other expected cost savings. With storage yards
within ginnery premises, there will be substarntial savings in transport
costs presently incurred in bringing seed cotton froTn outside yards to the
ginnery. Lubricating oil needs will be cut by about 65% as, a result of
,ixproved driving system  and use of ball bearings. Powr costs .-due to
use of eledtricity will, brwver, increase -as powor conuaption w1iU
increase with mechanization. -e absoYIte i&aor wage savings are eVxpeoted
Vhil -the-iumber of vorker! will be reduced, average hourly wages paid
should increase beause s -a)  composition of the work fdofe till
change from mainly unskilled to ski Wesemi-skilled men; b) workers in
futllr  are projected to work only one shift a day instead of an average
1-1/3 shifts a day without being adequately caxpensated as now; c) women
and childrern presenltl.y paid subsistence wages will be replaced by adul.t men.

Reduction in operating costs                  X__
D. Expected Revenue Gains
About 75% o.f the bero-fits from the project are expected from
revenue gains in three main areas: increase in average price of lilnt due
to better quality, additional cotton lint availability and additional cotton
oeed sales. Total expected revenue gains as calculated in the risk analysis
exercise, would equal LE2.5 million in 1978/79. The basic reasons for these
revenue gains and the mechan±cs of quantifying them are explained in Annex 13.
Revenue Gains Expected from the I1aprovement in Cotton Grade
ltoCt-rad
The price paid for a bale of cotton is based on both the variety of
cotton and the grade (quality) of that cotton. The grade is an indication
of the quality.  Even within the same variety (e.g., extra long staple
Giza h5) there is a substantial differential between the prices of different
grades. This differential is more pronounced in the case of superior cottons
like-extra long staple varieties grown by Egypt. For example, in the 1971/72
season, the opening price for the highest grade of Giza 45 Extra, was 188
Tallariesl/ per cantar and for the lowest grade, flly fair (FF), it was 101
Tallaries per cantar. Thus even a mall ixprovement in the average grade of
cotton can mean substantial extra revenues.
Q        Factors Determining Grade
i) The final grade of lint cotton of a particular variety is influenced
by two major factors.  First, the grade of seed cotton delivered by the
farmer. The seed cotton grade is affected by the growing conditions; timing
of cotton picking, frequency of picking, etc. For the purpose of the moderniza-
tion program, we have considered these factors as unchanged though the govern-
ment is trying to persuade farmers to follow prescribed agricultural practices.
The second major factor is thfa ginning operation. While ginning cnnnot improve
the basic lint characteristics, e.g*, length of fibre, strength, etc., poor
sinning can substantisII7 aslter io-me of the characteristics that determine
t.he grade.
I1   5 Tallaries = LE1



Annex t
Page 4
ii) There are five such key characteristics.
(a) tAearance - color, cleanliness and evenness. This is
affected primarily by handling. Long storage could also
deteriorate appearance.
(b)  Preparation - blending and farfara operations and the
gLtstand setting influence this.
(¢)  Foreign Matter - this is affected by handling as well as
by storage. An excessive presence of dust and other
foreign matter is considered undesirable by the spinners.
(d) Lint Length - poor handling could damage fiber length.
(e)  Immature Fibres - too early a picking increases imature
fibres in seed cotton. Their entry into cotton lint can be
reduced by proper adjustment of the ginstand rollers. These
immature fibres separated from lint are called scarto. fThus,
an improper setting of the rollers or old ginstands where-
an accurate setting is not possible, can adversely affect
the grade.
iii) The effect of different ginning operations on these factors is
different. A rough estimate of their relative importance is given below:
Approximate Influenee of Various
Factor          Weight                           Ginning ODe*ations
Color                10 - 15%           Handling (50%), Foreign Hatter (25%),
Storage (25%)
Foreign Matter       20 - 25%           Handling (70%), Storage (30%)
Immature Fibre         50%              Handling & Preparation (50%), Setting of
Machines (50%)
Preparation          10 - 15%           Handling (40%), Machine Setting (60%)
iv) Most of these factors are inter-related. The relative importance
that the ginning operations have on the determination of the grade is then
roughly weighted as follows:
Handling      50%
Ginstands     30%
Storage       20%
v) The infl-aence of each of the above factors on the determination of
grade may vary slightly according to the variety of cotton. However, due to
a lark of any reliable information on this possible variation, we have
neglected this factor in the present analysis.

10.      Effect of Cotton Handling on Grade of Lint
i) Present handling methods adversely affect the grade in a number of ways.
Some storage yards are located outside the ginnery compounds. In addition,
sometimes due to labor shortage during September, when most of the cotton is
received, some seed cotton is dumped on the roadsides by the farmers. This
reasults in double or even triple handling. It results not only in a
fairly high wastage, but also in the mixing of foreign matters in seed cotton.
In addition, because of manual handling of loose seed cotton in the ginnery,
some cotton is trampled under feet and fiber is damaged.. Indirectly, manual
movement of cotton and feeding of ginstands reduces hourly output. This
results in a longer ginning season thus increasing the quantity of cotton
stored for a long time which adversely affects the grade.
ii)  Major advantages of the new system will be:
(a) Pneumaticconveyance will substantially reduce loss of
cotton from blending hall onwards.
(b)  Inside yards in all new ginneries will eliminate double/
triple handling. Reception of seed cotton during the
cotton receiving period will be faster.
(c) Uniform feeding of ginstands combined with their higher
productivity will shorten the ginning season. Hourly
output per ginstand at the partially mechanized ginnery
at Minia is 20 to 25% higher than other non-mechanized
ginneries in Minia.
(d) Elimination of farfara room will prevent damage due to
cotton being crushed under workers, feet and also eliminate
non-uniform humidification.
(e) Air suction and transportation of cotton conveyance will
remove dust and foreign materials from seed cotton.
11.      Effect of Storage on Grade of Cotton
i) Main disadvantages of the present storage facilities which
influence lint grades are:
(a) Many storage yards are located away from ginneries
necessitating additional handling.
(b) Open air storage results in wastage and scattering of
cotton. Also, long storage in the open affects the quality.
Upper sacks are affected by sun and dust. Lower sacks are
damaged by moisture. If seed cotton is stored in the open
for more than 2 to 3 months a deterioration in its grade
takes place. The average grade of cotton lint ginned at
the beginning of the ginning season can be considerably
higher than if the same cotton is ginned at the end of
the season, six months later. This also increases the
need and consumption of imported jute.



paid 6
(c) Luster of cotton is lost by long storage in sacks.
(d) Storage  pce required is more than that needed by bulk
storate.
(e) Ginneries have to stop work during rains in the Delta until
seed cotton becomes dry.
ii) Inside yards in new ginneries, sheds and bulk stores ver conceivyed
to eliminate above dismadvantages. In the Delta area, these improvments in
storage facilities will provide enough dry cotton to continue ginning even
daring rainy days.
12.      Effect of Ginstands on Grade
i)  Old ginstanda have three drawbacks that can affect lint grade:
(a) It is more difficult to aehieTe accurate roller setting
that will separate the mmature fibers frm lint.
(b) Present gins are powered by belt drives which with the
roller bearings require generous oil lubrication. This
reetlts in oil contamination of cotton lint.
(c) Output per ginstand is low due to manual feeding.
ii)  New ginstands, electric motor drives and nechadsed feeding of
giustands Yisulized in the modernization prigrsa should prevent grad.
deterioration due to factors listed above. In addition, they vil shorten
the ginning season and prevent deterioraWtm  00 sottoe Seed qualtY.
13.    Orade IMprv_   Expstod Du. to Y.bdern.saltn
-   i) The above factors ae expected to have different levels of infuence
in different ginneries. It is possible to divide these into four different
categories, i.e., treat the new and the rehabilitated gimneries in both
Delta and Upper igypt regions separately. Basic reasons for treating grade
improvement in these four categories are:
(a) No evidence was found of a relationship between the grade of
cotton ginned and the classification of a ginnery as bad,
very bad, good or very good.
(b) The Delta has rain while Upper !gypt does not.  TIhus the
iproved storage in bulk stores is more critical in the
Delta region ft'r keeping cotton dry and ths permitting
ginning operations even daring rainy daya. Thim will
shorten the ginning season.



(o) In rehabilitated gimeries, only th Delta ginneries
wiM have bulk seed c:otton stores.
(d) Upper EgYpt cotton contains more foreign matter and dust.
As a consequenoe, average grade improvuent should be
rater in suh cotton due to rowval of these materials
during pneumatec handling and eonveoynoe.
ii)  The beat estimates of grade improvment, due to the rehabilitation
prograx, in the above fotr categories are:
fLehabilitated      New
Gimeries       GiDnries
Delta                     2/16            3/16
Upper F4ypt               3/16             hA6
Howeewr, there is a considerable uncertainty in the actual level ef grde
iuproYsMent. After extensive discussions with vario4s experts in cotton
sinning re established the ranges, and the probabi1ities of values within
them, of likely grade improvement in each of the above categories. The
estimtes  are presented in the form of cmlativ probability ass euaments
in Tables 1.1 to i8.4.

reasons for -grde improvemnt in all the four cases are basaially the sum.
The difference in grade iproement is du to varying imortance of these
basic reasons for difftrent cases. For exmple, if the expected improvemnt
in grade due to better handling is one-eighth of a grade for rehabilitated
ginneries in Delta then it woud be about 3/16th for rehabilitated ginneries
in Upper Egypt which presently have nore dust and foreign matter in seed

f over L2 million. )v the premiums are more for the higher grade and the
average supply of higher gradea will incresee, the weighted average of the
pramium in future should incres$e if nothing elso changed. HIover, e
Egypt supplies a substantial part of the world's long: staple cotton and in
the long term it will process aE its crop in the modernised ginneries, the
world market may disoovmt premiume for higher grads from the

extensive diecussioze with EOGO, the export companies, GATT and other
parties concerned with t.he future of long staple cotton, IDA epecta thisa

Table 185$ Howevm, no, such drop is expected in the premium  paid in

i6.      Pove=6 Gains txpeted' from Grads IMrovement
To calculate the yearly revenue gains expected due to quality
(grade) i prcvements the quantity of cotton ginned in each category each
year was multiplied with the price premium expected that year with that
particulal qiantity and the grade improvement expected in  iat particular
category of ginni-iea. Without any consideration of the uncertainties in
the grade  mprovsent expected, revenue gain of LE3.81 million in 1978
was anticipated 4ram thia factor.  Risk analysis suggests that this
figure could va4ry b6tween E050 million aad L34.85 million with the
expected gain LEl.79 million. This anticipated range indicates the level
of uncertainty.

EGYPT - COTTON GINNING REAILITATION PROJECT
EFECT (F THE PROJECT Cll lSW&2LOT
1.        Consideration has been given thrbough project preparation and
appraisal, to the likely effects of the rehabilitation program on employment,
and the ways of mitigating some of the social hardship that may be entailed.
As a first step, a questionnaire framed by IDA was administered by EGGO's
consulting engineers to a number of employses in scattered ginneries during
the ginning season. The random sample that happened to be interviewed however,
proved to be too narrow for any dependable conclusicns to be drawn, alt]-ough
some interesting patterns were clearly discernible. IDA therefore organized
a more systematic study in March/April 1973, which was directed by ILO and
UNICEF, financed by the latter, and executed by the Egyptian Institute of
National Planning. Dr. M. A. Mongi and Dr. W. A. Hassouna were the principal
investigators, while numerous assistanta ),andled the fie;d work and data pro-
cessing. A preliminary report arising from this study,, provides a broad
background to the employment probless that may be encountered by modernizing
the ginneries.
2.        The main objectives of the study were to: (a) assess the magnitude
of labor displacement, (b) establish the demographic, socio-economic and
vocational characteristics of the workers to bo displaced, and (c) evaluate
availability of alternative employment opportunities and define training
requirements for such mploym.nt.
3.        On the first question, the study estimates that about 2,169 workers
would be displaced from employment in the 10 ginneries to be rehabilitated
under Phase I of the program. Since al workers in the 10 other ginneries to
be closed down under Phase I would also become redundant, this would place the
total labor displacemnt under Phase I at around 5,500, supporting IDA's own
estimate (Chapter VIII, para 8.02). Taking m  average family size of 5.1 which
emerges from the study, this level of unemployment would affect about 28,000
individuals by 1977.
4.        Projections of the socio-economic characteristics of the workers likely
to be displaoed have been made by analysing a sample comprising the whole work
strength of two of the ten ginneries to be rehabilitated, whD were interviewed
and studied by means of detailed questionnaires. Data processing and analyses
were done on a computer.
5.        The age and sex characteristics of the workers likely to be displaced,
are expected to be as follows:

6.        It is seen that adalt male contract workers and children would form
the two largest groups to be di*plaoed, and that 42% of the ohildren would be
under 12 years of age. F..om D he point of view of retraining, it is imortant
to note that 21% of male and 26% of female contract workers wxld be over 45
years of age. All adalt male woricers were married at the time of the stuty,
and of the adult females, 16% were married, 67% were widows and 15% divorced.

9.        It is expected that 85.2% of the w4rb rs Yho would be displaced would
have no additional personal income, and of the 14.8% that would have other income,
12.9% would be earning less than LE12 per month. Agriculture presently provides
the largest source of additional income, but expanding industry should take over
a large part of this in the future. A comparison of the workers' basic income
from the ginneries with the family income levels would suggest that many families
depend almost wholly on income from the ginneries. While 80.3% of the workers
would be earning up to LE±2 per month from the ginneries, about 74.9% of the
families would be living on monthly incomes of up to ;EM0 per month, indicating
very slender margins on which the families of the displaced workers could fall
back when displaced from the ginneries.
10.       The ILO/UNICEF study made a rapid survey of the new employment
opportunities likely to arise in the districts where the rehabilitated ginneries
are located, by identifying at the district level, the new projects included in
Egypt's five-year plan, 1973/1977.  The following new employment opportunities
are expected to be created:

11.       Against these new employment opportunities, the district-wise
redundancy would be as follows:

12.       Sixty nine percent of the redundancy would occur in the Gharbia
district (towns of Kafr el Zayat and Zefta) offering sizable concentrations for
the purpose of administering retraining and re-employment progrsms. New job
opportunities expected to arise in the four districts total 110,414 over the next
ten years, 57.8% of which will fortunately be located in Gharbia district.
Despite a rapidly increasing population, this level of new employment should be
more than adequate to absorb the displaced ginnery workers, probably in the same
towns as they are residing in now.
13.       Only 1.1% of the displaced workers would have received any previous
formal or on-the-job training, the balance of 98.9% never having had any training
whatsoever. Since 86.9% of the displaced workers would also be illiterate, it is
most essential for these people to be trained in the proper skills, to help them
move to the new jobs for which they would then be qualified. The program for
retraining and re-employment to be carried out in parallel with Phase I of the
project, will therefore aim at training the displaced workers in pre-vocational
and vocational centers and functional literacy training centers, fox placement in
new and better paid jobs expected to be created elsewhere in the economr, while
the ginnery modernization project is under implementation.
14.       Agreement has been reached with the Government and ECGO during nego-
tiations, that while the Government will be responsible for the retraining and
re-employment program, ECGO, will be its executing agency. It has been agreed that:
(a) The working group which had submitted its preliminary report to
IDA (comprising ECGO, ILO, UNICEF, Ministries of Manpower, Education
and Social Affairs) would be entrusted to carry on its work in order
to;
(i) complete its investigations to identify now demand for
employment in each town and district;
(ii) draw up a detailed program of training for re-employment
involving pre-vocational and vocational education, functional
literacy training as well as job training for new employment.
(b)  Thereafter a complete program of retraining will be presented by ECGO
to IDA by October 31, 1973 or such later date as may matually be agreed
between EOGO and IDA.
(c)  Implementation and administration of the training program as agreed
with IDA, may be entrusted by ECGO to ILO and UNICEF.
