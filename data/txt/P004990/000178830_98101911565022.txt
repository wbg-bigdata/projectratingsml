EGYPT
APPRAISAL OF THE
COTTON GINNING REHABILITATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a proposed project comprising Phase I (the
project) of a program for the modernization of Egypt's antiquated cotton gin-
ning industry. The project will cover rehabilitation of ten existing gin-
neries and construction of four new ginneries and will be executed by the
Egyptian Cotton General Organization (ECGO), a wholly-owned Government entity.
At the same time, ten of the existing ginneries will be closed down. Total
cost of the project is estimated at US$40.4 million equivalent of which the
International Development Associationt (IDA) has been asked to provide US$18.5
million. US$18 million out of the credit will be relent to ECGO (US$500,000
being given as a grant) which will repay them to the Government over 10 years
after 5 years of grace at an effective cost of 8-1/2% per annum. The credit
is to finance imported enuipment and materials, as well as the foreign exchange
component of engineering and technical assistance services and half the cost
of a program to retrain workers who will be dislocated by the project. Local
financing requirements of US$21.4 million will be provided from retained
earnings of ECGO, and US$500,000 given by the Government as a grant. The
project is expected to be completed by the end of 1977.
ii.       The whole program will be divided into three phases spanning a 10-
year period from 1973 to 1983, and have a total estimated cost of about US$125
million. During the program, 31 of Egypt's 73 existing ginneries will be shut
down, 42 completely rehabilitated, and 12 new ginneries built. Apart from
allowing the ginning of a 15% higher cotton output that Egypt expects to
achieve by the mid-1980's, the program does not entail an increase in gin-
ning capacity. The operation of obsolete, uneconomic ginneries - the ma-
jority are well over 50 years old - poses a threat to Egypt's cotton exports
which together with yarn and textiles earn 60% of the country's export
income.
iii.      The objectives of the rehabilitation program are mainly to over-
come the present deficiencies by forestalling major breakdowns which could
have a disastrous impact on the country's cotton production and hence its
economy; avoiding further increases in maintenance and operating costs; and
securing the highest returns on the volume of cotton grown in Egypt through
improved grades and better prices.
iv.       Another objective of the rehabilitation program and one that the
Government considers as very important and which is also strongly supported
by ILO and UNICEF, is the improvement of working conditions in the ginneries;
at present these are quite unacceptable. Many workers, including women and
children, some as young as seven years old, work continuously for 15 hours
a day, six days a week for the whole ginning season extending from about the
end of September to March. Cotton lint fills the air and affects eyes and
lungs and men regularly carry seed cotton sacks well over 100 kg on their



- ii -
backs. Children up to the age of 15 are drawing around 30-50 USU and adults
about 754 for a 15-hour work day. It is therefore not surprising that under
the work and employment conditions as they exist at present even in a coun-
try like Egypt with a plentiful labor supply, the ginneries find it increas-
ingly difficult to obtain certain types of labor.
v.        To achieve the objectives of the rehabilitation program, a higher
degree of mechanization is unavoidable. It has been attempted to find an
optimal balance between the economic targets of the program and the displace-
ment of labor, which is expected to be reduced by about 6,000 by the end of
Phase I from the existing level of about 44,500. This reduction however will
be exclusively in unskilled labor and affect primarily women and children;
at the same time, the skills of the remaining workers will be upgraded so that
the overall payment of wages will only slightly decline. Nevertheless, many
families depend on the meager incomes and the absence of some incomes will
undoubtedly be felt. At IDA's request, therefore, ILO with UNICEF's assis-
tance has been undertaking a study to evaluate the employment effects of the
project and make specific proposals for the retraining and reemployment of
the displaced workers to proceed in parallel with the project. The cost of
such a retraining program to be implemented in tandem with the project, is
estimated at about US$1.0 million, and will be borne by the project.
vi.       World per capita cotton consumption promises to grow but at a slower
pace t;han per capita income and consumption of synthetic fibers. Extra-long
staple cotton (ELS) - which together with long-staple varieties (LS) make
up Egypt's cotton output in a proportion of 40/60 - accounts for only 5% of
total world cotton production, and 30% of this is grown in Egypt, the world's
largest ELS producer. About 60% of the country's cotton lint is exported but
only one-third of this quantity is offered in developed and developing mar-
ket economies, the balance going to the USSR and other centrally planned
countries. It is not expected that this trade pattern will change drasti-
cally although during the past season shipments to convertible currency coun-
tries have again increased. ELS prices are firm, and have been keeping well
above ordinary cotton grades; also stocks of the grades Egypt has to offer
are minimal.
vii.      The assessment of future demand and price trends for Egypt's cot-
ton is influenced by the peculiar position of the USSR as a major emerging
ELS producer, which at the same time is a large importer of ELS cotton from
Egypt, and her specific trade ties with Egypt as well as the uncertainties
that this position implies. None of the other major producers of ELS and
LS cotton including Egypt, however, are expected to increase their produc-
tion by more than marginal amounts and while ELS prices could drop by as
much as 25% this would bring them down only to the level of the mid-1960's.
In any case such potential market uncertainties should not reduce the urgency
for the rehabilitation program because domestic cotton consumption will more
than absorb the modest increase in output; Egypt has substantial comparative
advantages in cotton growing; the project will retain Egypt's competitiveness
in the world's cotton markets; and the cost savings in processing arising from
the program would be independent of international price fluctuations.



- iii -
viii.     ECCO will establish a project management unit for the execution of
the project and will be assisted by outside engineering consultants in en-
gineering and project implementation. While Egypt has been operating its
cotton ginning industry in a laudable manner despite the difficulties that
the outmoded plants have brought about, ECGO has not carried out a project -
not to speak of one of the magnitude here under consideration - and there-
fore is seeking some assistance in project management to help assure timely
execution of the project and within the estimated costs. ECGO realizes that
success in project execution will heavily depend on the effectiveness with
which the project management unit and the engineering consultants will be
able to work together. ECGO has chosen L.H. Manderstam, the UK firm that
is now engaged by ECGO under the recent IDA engineering credit in detailed
project preparation, to become their engineering consultants.
ix.       ECGO will also introduce iiaproved accounting and cost control pro-
cedures. Foreign equipment to be financed by IDA will be procured under the
Association's guidelines for international competitive bidding. Equipment
available in Egypt at adequate quality and at prices expected to be below
imports will be reserved for competitive bidding in Egypt and financed by
local funds. Although cotton ginning does not involve a complicated tech-
nical process and operation of the gin stands will not be much different
from what it is today, the higher degree of mechanization will require a
substantial upgrading of skills, and training programs are being devised
towards that end.
X.        The incremental financial return of the project is about 18%; it is
estimated to vary on the basis of a risk analysis between 14% and 22% with
a 75% probability that it will exceed 16.7%. The economic return of the
project is estimated at about 25%.
xi.       Based on the assurances obtained during negotiations, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of US$18.5 million equivalent.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has requested a credit
of US$18.5 million equivalent from the International Development Association
(IDA) to meet the estimated foreign exchange requirements for the first phase
(Phase I or the project) of a program to rehabilitate Egypt's cotton ginning
industry. The project, which covers the modernization of ten existing and
the construction of four new ginneries, is estimated to cost about US$40.4
million equivalent and is expected to be completed by 1977. The overall
program, which will be divided into three phases and cost approximately
US$125.0 million, is presently estimated to cover a period of ten years
from 1973 to 1983 and call for the closing down of 31 of the 73 ginneries
now existing, the rehabilitation of 42 ginneries and the construction of
12 new ginneries. Phase I is fully self-contained; it represents essentially
a cross section of the program but being limited in scope permits the later
phases to be adapted to new conditions - such as in technological and market
developments - and the experience gained from implementation of the first
phase.
1.02      Rehabilitation of the ginning industry is an essential step in pro-
viding for efficient, reliable and high-quality cotton lint production; it
will thus help to maintain Egypt's competitive position in this field, and
ensure continuation of its important exports of extra-long and long staple
cotton. Benefits flowing from the project are expected to be very substan-
tial. Project execution will be the responsibility of the Egyptian Cotton
General Organization (ECGO), a Government organization, with the close in-
volvement of the five ginning companies, which are all wholly-owned sub-
sidiaries. ECGO handles all cotton operations from the purchase of seed
cotton from the farmers through to ginning and sale of cotton lint on the
domestic and export markets. Ginneries to be covered by the project are
located in the Nile Delta area as well as in Upper Egypt (Map 1, IBRD 10551).
1.03      The Government first approached the Bank Group for financing at
the end of 1971, after the required assistance had proved unobtainable from
other sources. IDA has been helping the Government in preparing the project,
including the initial financing of and guidance given to the consulting firm
of L.H. Manderstam and Partners (U.K.), Ltd., London, to prepare the feasi-
bility report. On November 7, 1972, the Executive Directors approved an IDA
Engineering Credit (P-1127 of October 25, 1972) of US$175,000 to cover the
foreign exchange cost of preliminary engineering, design work and certain
other aspects of Phase I. This work is in progress, and has defined more
precisely the project's scope and timing.
1.04      The project was appraised in December 1972 by a mission consisting
of Messrs. Aroon K. Basak (Chief), Antonio S. Tarnawiecki and Harinder S.
Kohli of the Industrial Projects Department and Mr. Omer L. Godaux, Consul-
tant. Discussions were also held with ILO and UNICEF concerning the issue
of the employment effects and social consequences of the project and with
the International Cotton Advisory Council (ICAC) and GATT on world prices
and trade prospects of cotton.
1.05      A glossary of cotton terms used in the report is given in Annex 1.

II. EGYPTIAN COTTON GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND GINNING COMPANIES
A.   History and Organization
2.01      Until 1961 both domestic and export trade and processing of Egyptian
cotton were in private hands. In 1961, Presidential Decree No. 1899 created
"General Organizations" under each Ministry to own and run undertakings in
nationalized sectors. ECGO was established in December 1961 as such a "Gen-
eral Organization" under the Ministry of Economy to deal with the cotton sec-
tor and during the two following years all the sector's activities were na-
tionalized. Private owners received a Government bond issue bearing 4% in-
terest and payable by the Treasury from 1973 to 1978, using as a basis for
compensation the book value of assets established in 1963 of approximately
EE13 million. A series of Presidential Decrees culminating with two in 1965
reorganized the corporate set-up of the numerous ginneries and export com-
panies and placed them under the ownership and control of ECGO as the holding
company. Twelve subsidiary companies were created, five for ginning, six
for exporting and one to cover a company in Alexandria that has been pressing
cotton bales for export (Annex 2).
2.02      Each subsidiary operates as an economic unit, and the six exporting
companies indeed compete with one another in foreign markets. The exporting
companies, which are also responsible for domestic sales of ginned and pressed
cotton, pay the ginning and pressing companies fees per unit of output. These
fees are determined by ECGO. All export contracts negotiated by the export
companies require ECGO's approval. The headquarters of ECGO and three gin-
ning companies are located in Cairo; the rest of the subsidiaries are based
in Alexandria.
2.03      Mr. Zakaria Tawfik, an able senior civil servant, is Chairman of
ECGO with the rank of a Deputy Minister. He chairs a Board of Directors con-
sisting of 20 members apart from himself, comprising the Chairmen of the 12
subsidiary companies, the Chairmen of the General Organizations for Trade and
for Spinning/Weaving, and officials from the Ministry of Economy and Foreign
Trade. ECGO's management organization is structured along functional lines
(Annex 3). The Chairmen of the 12 subsidiary companies report directly to
Mr. Tawfik.
2.04      All of the five ginning companies, each of which operates from 12
to 15 ginneries, have a similar organization structure. The Board of each
company consists of a Chairman, four executive directors, and four members
elected from amongst the employees. The four executive directors respec-
tively supervise: (a) operation of individual ginneries; (b) finance; (c)
administration and personnel; and (d) inspection control and planning.
2.05      In 1965 a "Higher Committee for the Planning of Cotton Affairs"
was created with the Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade as Chairman.
Amongst others, it determines the land to be sown with cotton each year,
the price to be paid to the farmers, and the allocation of cotton to export
and domestic markets. Membership of this high level policy committee on
cotton is given in Annex 4.

B.   The Cotton System in Egypt
2.06      Cotton is a perennial shrub but is cultivated as an annual to mini-
mize pest and disease problems. All Egyptian cotton, which is grown along
the whole length of the Nile, is irrigated and planting dates, areas and
varieties are regulated by various governmental agencies. All cotton is
handpicked (called seed cotton) and in the subsequent ginning process the
fibers (called lint after processing) are mechanically separated from the
seeds. Cotton is harvested once a year in August/September and the ginning
season as a rule extends from September to March. All cottons are classified
by their staple lengths. Almost all Egyptian cottons are long staple (LS) or
extra long staple (ELS) i.e. between 1-1/4" and 1-3/8" or over 1-3/8" respec-
tively. Unlike cheaper short staple cottons, which are often blended with
man-made fibers (MMF), the LS and ELS grades are used to make fine fabrics,
shirtings, knitted cotton underwear and sewing threads.
2.07      The organization of the cotton system in Egypt is explained in de-
tail in Annex 5. Cotton is grown by individual farmers on land owned or
rented by them, within the overall plan announced in advance each year by
the Higher Committee for the Planning of Cotton Affairs (para 2.05). Inputs
like State inspected planting seed, fertilizers and pesticides are supplied
to the farmer by the Ministry of Agriculture against credit granted by the
Agriculture Credit Bank. The cotton crop is conveyed by the farmer to the
nearest of about 2,000 official collecting centers or 10,000 private stores,
where he is paid for his crop at published prices depending on the varieties
and grading of the seed cotton.
2.08      Ownership of the seed cotton passes at this point from the farmers
to ECGO, which, as has been mentioned before, is responsible for all subse-
quent activities through the sale of lint in Egypt and abroad. The seed
cotton is routed to the ginneries which store, gin, press and ship the lint,
each ginnery handling only one variety of seed cotton. Cotton seed which
accumulates with the ginneries goes either for replanting or crushing to
extract cooking oil. All lint which is destined for export is shipped to
Alexandria and again pressed, baled and inspected before shipment. Lint
for the domestic textile industry (about 40%) goes to the units of the
General Organization for Spinning and Weaving.
C.   Recent Financial Position of ECGO and Subsidiaries
1.   ECGO
2.09      ECGO is one of the largest and most profitable commercial entities
in Egypt. It accounts for half of total Egyptian exports and has an annual
turnover of about EE180 million (US$461 million). In 1971/72, it contributed
over fE17.7 million as profits to the national treasury. Detailed income
and balance sheet statements for the past five years for ECGO itself as a
holding 1/ company are given in Annex 6 and are briefly summarized below:
1/   The balance sheets of ECGO show only the investments held in the sub-
sidiaries without consolidating assets and liabilities, while the in-
come statements show ECGO's direct income plus net transfers allocated
to it from the subsidiaries.

2.10      While sales to the export companies showed an increase of 24% be-
tween 1967/68 and 1970/71, sales value decreased by 11% in 1971/72 due to a
drop in cotton volume sold and a slight drop in the quality of cotton produced.
Although sales dropped in 1971/72, ECGO's aggregate income (arbitrage income
and income from subsidiaries) almost doubled between 1967/68 and 1971/72.
Arbitrage income (the difference between transfer prices to the export companies
and prices paid the farmers) shows significant fluctuations due to a time lag



-5-
in the changes in transfer prices to the export companies (fixed periodically
in relation to world LS and ELS cotton prices) and subsequent changes enforced
by the Government in prices paid to the farmer. Furthermore, as world prices
for Egyptian LS and ELS gradually improved during the period (reflected in
higher income from subsidiaries) aggregate income as a percentage of sales
increased from 8% to 15%.
2.11      The capital structure of ECGO is sound.  Neither ECGO nor the sub-
sidiaries have any long-term debt. ECGO's low current ratios in recent years
reflect accelerated payment of annual surpluses to the Treasury, but the oper-
ating companies have comfortable current ratios. ECGO's high sales turnover
despite its low equity capital is made possible because the export companies
purchase cotton from the farmers on ECGO's behalf, using short-term borrowings.
Being a non-operational holding company, ECGO's own fixed assets are naturally
small.
2.   Subsidiaries
2.12      Profits of subsidiary companies are distributed to themselves (as
reserves), their workers, ECGO and through ECGO to the Government. Subsi-
diaries charge depreciation on fixed assets at 10% for 10 years and at 5%
indefinitely thereafter to provide for rising costs of replacements. Trans-
fers to reserves amount to 15% of profit after tax. 1/ Special retentions for
contingencies may also be allowed by ECGO. Next, 5% on equity employed during
the year is distributed to the employees (1/4th) and ECGO (3/4th), and after
ECGO has received 10% of the remaining surplus as a management fee, any final
profit balance is again distributed to the employees and ECGO in the same
proportion. ECGO pays no tax on its direct arbitrage income. All of ECGO's
annual earnings after tax are transferred to the Treasury.
2.13      Internal policy of ECGO regarding the fee structure largely deter-
mines how profits are split among the different subsidiaries. In the recent
past, the largest shares of ECGO's earnings from subsidiaries derived jointly
(80Z) from the export companies and the Alexandria pressing company, the re-
maining 20% coming from the ginning companies. Financial statements of the
subsidiaries simply reflect the ECGO profit allocations and are therefore not
very meaningful. However, as mentioned previously the ginning companies have
no long-term debt outstanding, and their liquidity position, with one exception,
has been satisfactory. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile mentioning that operating
expenses per cantar of lint increased, though only from EEO.75 in 1967 to EEO.81
in 1971, or by 9% (Annex 7). This is a particularly impressive performance
since maintenance in these obsolete plants is a constant problem and expenses
for maintenance materials and supplies increased by more than 32% during the
period; the total wage bill rose by somewhat less than 9%.
1/   The tax rate works out to an average of 37.5%.

III. THE MARKET
A.   Production, Consumption and Trade
3.01      The world's cotton production and trade and Egypt's place in them
are discussed in some detail in Annex 8 and are briefly summarized below.
Cotton fiber (lint) is one of the most important agricultural commodities
in international trade. In spite of strong competition from man-made fibers
(MMF) - many of which have been developed to meet specific needs - cotton
consumption has continued to keep pace with world population, although its
share in total textile fiber consumption has dropped from an average of 67%
for the 1950/59 decade to 44% in 1971. The main consumers are the USSR, USA,
Mainland China and India followed by Japan, Pakistan, Brazil, Germany and
France.
3.02      The main cotton producing countries accounting for about three-
quarters of total output are again the USSR, the USA, 1/ Mainland China, India,
Pakistan, Brazil and Egypt but there are many other countries producing this
commodity. LS and ELS cotton production, on the other hand, is concentrated
in five countries only which produce close to 90% of world output and of which
Egypt is the largest producer.

LS and ELS cotton production, which accounts for about 15% of total cotton
production, has increased by 3.3% annually between 1960/62 (average) and
1970/72 (average), that is at a considerably faster rate than for all cotton
in the same period (1.9%/yr). ELS prices have been substantially higher than
those of other types of cotton (by an average of close to 70% since the mid-
1960's and about 56% in 1971 and 1972) and particularly during the last few
years have been much more stable than other cotton prices.
B.   Egypt's Cotton Exports and Domestic Sales
3.03      Egyvpt ranked in 1970/72 as the world's third largest exporter of
cotton (after the USA and USSR) and has a dominant position in international
marketing of ELS. Her cotton lint, yarn and textile exports earn 60% of her
total foreign exchange income from exports. The direction of Egyptian cotton
exports has shifted since the 1950's from developed market-economy to centrally
1/   The U.S.A. was surpassed by the USSR as the world's largest producer in
the 1970/71 and 1971/72 seasons, but is expected to take the lead again
in the current season ending July 31, 1973.

planned economy countries. During the last decade, fluctuations in purchases
by the USSR and Mainland China have resulted in changing export patterns as
shown in the table below. Preliminary indications for 1972/73 suggest that
the share of exports to developed market-economy countries has begun to re-
cover from the low level of the 1971/72 season.

payments agreements.
Total cotton production in Egypt increased from a level of around 400,000 tons
in the 50's and early 60's to more than 500,000 tons in the early 70's. Total
ELS exports to Western Europe from Egypt, Sudan and Peru declined from an annual
average of 133,000 MT in the 1966 and 1967 seasons to 67,000 MT in the 1970 and
1971 seasons, while exports to Japan remained substantially unchanged (at 26,800
and 25,700 MT respectively) during the same period. Preliminary 1972/73 indi-
cations show an upturn in ELS exports to Japan and other developed countries.
Figures for total imports of cotton into Western Europe, which also have re-
flected a downward trend, having dropped by 10.6% from 1,439,000 MT annual
average for the 1966 and 1967 seasons to 1,286,000 MT for the 1970 and 1971
seasons, unfortunately do not distinguish among cottons of different staple
lengths. Therefore, the observed trend in Western European trade of ELS based
on available statistics is inconclusive. Additionally, figures for USSR
cotton exports to Western Europe, which also are not broken down by staple
length, may include ELS of domestic production as well as trans-shipments of
Egyptian ELS cotton. ECGO has confirmed that the present LS and ELS supply
situation is tight and that Egypt has been unable to accept all orders so-
licited from Western Europe. There is thus no evidence of market weakness
of Egyptian cotton inasmuch as stocks have remained low and prices have firmed.
3.04      Egypt has also an important textile industry, consuming nearly 40%
of its cotton output and giving employment to 230,000 workers. Approximately
16% of the production of the textile industry valued at LE378 million in
1970/71 was exported, nearly one third to Western Europe, Africa and the



- 8 -
Middle East. While still modest, these textile exports have increased from
bE48 to 59 million between 1966/67 and 1970/71 or by somewhat more than 5%
per year.
C.   Future Demand
3.05      Numerous studies on the future demand for cotton have been made by
the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), FAO, the International Cotton
Advisory Council, the National US Advisory Commission on Food and Fibers,
and others. The USDA 1/ world cotton consumption projections for 1980, prob-
ably the most comprehensive, range between 14.6 and 15.0 million MT for prices
between 24 and 30 US cts per lb. 2/ as against 11.7 million MT in 1970/71 at a
price of 32 US cts per lb. The resulting average rate of growth - 2.4% annually -
is only slightly higher than the actual rate in the previous decade. This fore-
cast is based on separate projections for 39 countries or regions and on cotton
crop and yield estimates for 24 countries or regions. Such a level of cotton
consumption would represent about 38% of total projected fiber consumption in
1980 as compared to the present ratio of 44%. This would appear to be a con-
servative estimate. While there is no reason to believe in a reversal of the
past trend towards a lower share of cotton in total fiber consumption, the
past downward direction of prices of competing synthetic fibers has already
been arrested and in some instances reversed, and increased costs of petroleum
and gas feedstocks and the generally inflationary trends in developed countries
will tend to push up synthetic fiber prices in the future.
3.06      An assessment of the future demand and price trends for LS and ELS
is more d:.fficult to arrive at, primarily due to the peculiar position of the
USSR which is now a major ELS producer and probably an exporter (para 3.03),
but still continues as a large importer of ELS particularly from Egypt, under
specific trade ties between the two countries. Thus apparent consumption
of ELS in the USSR increased from 94,000 to 234,000 tons between 1966/67 and
1971/72, or by nearly 2.5 times. While it is not predictable whether the
USSR can be counted on to continue taking a major portion of Egypt's ELS
cotton exports (67,000 tons in 1971/72 or one third of her ELS production),
the other ELS cotton producing countries are not known to plan on any major
increase in their production. This is true also for Egypt, which is expected
to increase its total cotton production only by about 15% by 1985, or by 1%
annually, including new varieties of ELS presently being introduced. Partic-
ularly due to shifts in USSR policies, ELS prices could drop by as much as
25% though this would bring prices down only to the level of the mid-1960's. 3/
Furthermore, such price decrease could make ELS more competitive, depending
upon relative prices of shorter staple cotton and man-made fibers.
D.   Egypt's Competitive Strength as Cotton Producer
3.07      There are various reasons, however, why international market un-
certainties would not eliminate the need or reduce the urgency for the rehabil-

3/   The latest Bank commodity study dated May 4, 1973 predicts an average fall
of 10% by 1980 in export prices of all cotton.



itation of Egypt's cotton ginning industry. First, Egypt's textile industry
plans to increase by 1975 its installed capacity of yarn and textiles by 40%
and 25% respectively. Increased usage of cotton for domestic textile consump-
tion alone is expected to absorb most, if not all, of the increased lint output.
As regards textile exports, they could continue to grow at the recent rate of
about 5% annually, but the prospects for any greater growth are slim in view
of widespread import restriction policies.  Secondly, Egypt has a substantial
comparative advantage in cotton growing. It arises from a rare combination
of climate, soils and water availability at the right times as well as suc-
cessful genetic research and control and low rural wages. Cotton yields in
Egypt have increased by more than 80% over the past 15 years and are presently
796 kg/ha (as lint), or 2.1 times the world average of 379 kg/ha, surpassed
among the large cotton producers only by the USSR. As to LS and ELS cotton,
Egypt has higher yields than its major competitors, with the exception of the
USSR. As a result, lint cotton costs in Egypt are substantially below the
costs of even lower valued varieties in other countries such as the USA,
Mexico and Pakistan for which compar.able data are available. 1/ Thirdly, Egypt
has shown a marked ability in geneti: improvement of cotton varieties, plan-
ning of cotton crops and marketing of cotton abroad, and the phasing of the
program ensures the very flexibility that is needed to adapt to possible
changing market, price and technological conditions. Fourthly, but most
importantly, the project will contribute to retain the competitiveness of
Egyptian cotton in world markets, primarily through the increase of lint
yields and the upgrading of quality of lint production, rather than an ex-
pansion of cotton cultivation which, as is mentioned in the preceding para.,
will be very modest. Finally, the program of rehabilitation is essentially
designed to replace an obsolete industry with modern facilities without a
substantial increase in total capacity (para. 4.09). The cost savings in
processing would be independent of price fluctuations in international markets.
3.08      Area under cotton in Egypt has decreased from about 1.87 to 1.53
million feddans between 1960 and 1971 as a consequence of mounting demands
for and greater attractiveness to farmers of food crops and livestock products.
Continually increased yields have permitted Egypt to maintain cotton produc-
tion substantially at a constant level in spite of the significant cut in area
under this crop. In the next five years, Egyptian agricultural exports as a
whole are expected to grow by not more than 0.9% annually. While the optimal
use of agricultural land needs to be kept under constant review, the dominant
position of cotton and its manufactures in Egypt's exports will not easily
or rapidly be replaced.
IV. THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Rehabilitation Program
1.   Historical Development and Present Condition
of the Ginning Industry
4.01      The first ginnery in Egypt was installed around 1860 and the industry
grew fast under the incentive to supply the growing needs of the U.K. textile
1/   Lint cotton costs in these countries including ginning but excluding land
rentals, are on a weighted average some 45% above those in Egypt.



- 10 -
industry, whose cotton supplies from the USA were interrupted by the Civil War.
By 1950 there were 105 ginneries with 6,475 ginstands. Overcapacity led to
destructive competition among ginneries, and after the July 1952 revolution,
most of the owners, fearing nationalization, ceased to invest in their mills
and reduced maintenance to a minimum. As a result, upon nationalization in
1963, ECGO inherited ginneries which were not only antiquated, but also badly
run-down.  Many ginneries which were too old and uneconomic have been closed
down in the last decade, leaving 73 ginneries with about 4,700 ginstands now
running, but only three of these have been built in the last 30 years while
nearly one-half are well over 50 years old. In spite of the ingenuity of
maintenance personnel, the remaining ginneries are in precarious running con-
dition and liable to incur major breakdowns.
4.02      Almost all ginneries have seen towns growing up around them, so that
most of them are cramped for space, with totally inadequate yard areas inside
their premises. The yards must store a full season's requirements for seed-
cotton. Many ginneries are thus forced to rent or own outside, and sometimes
out-of-town, storage yards which lead to increased handling costs, damage
and physical loss to the cotton, and traffic problems in the towns themselves.
2.   Technology, Work and Employment Conditions
4.03      Ginning is essentially the simple process of separating the fiber
or lint from the cotton seed. Annex 9 contains a description of the project,
process and the equipment involved. There are two basic types of gins: the
"saw" gin and the "roller" gin.  The finer LS and ELS cotton needs the gentler
and slower treatment of roller gins which are used throughout Egypt. Modern
gins are basically still the same as those used in the early days, advances
being confined to mechanization of the blending operation and transportation
of seed cotton to the ginstands and of lint to condensing, humidifying and
pressing, so as to exclude contamination and damage that might be caused by
manual methods. A modern ginnery is therefore less labor intensive, but more
efficient in enforcing strict quality control.
4.04      Work conditions inside the ginneries are quite unacceptable and are
described in detail in Annex 10. Many workers, including women and even
children from 10 to 16 years of age, work continuously for 15 hours a day,
six days a week for the whole ginning season. To see boys and girls as young
as seven years old work in the ginneries is not uncommon and it is estimated
that about 17% of the present work force comprises children under 12. Male
porters regularly carry seed cotton sacks weighing well over 100 kg on their backs.
Cotton lint fills the air and affects eyes, noses and lungs and presents a
serious fire hazard. These conditions persist despite Law No. 91 of April 15,
1959, which forbids the employment of children under 12, and allows children
between 12 and 15 to work only under certain prescribed conditions. A sample
survey (Annex 10) revealed that children up to the age of 15 are drawing around
PT 15 to 20 (37 to 50 US cents) and adults about PT 30 (75 US cents) for a
15-hour work day. The law provides for a minimum wage of PT 30 per eight hour
shift, less one PT for each year of age below 21.
4.05      Since the ginning season extends from end-September to end-March,
the bulk of employment in the industry is seasonal; only supervision, main-
tenance and security personnel comprising about 12.5% of the total work force



- 11 -
are carried permanently and protected against dismissal. During the off-
season, the rest of the workers - men, women and children - either manage to
find alternative temporary work on farms and in households, or remain un-
employed. About one-seventh of these temporary hands, called "seasonal
workers", are directly employed by the ginneries and normally assured work
for the whole ginning season. The rest of the workers, called "contract
workers" never become direct employees of the ginneries.
4.06      While it is difficult to assess accurately the number of workers
in the ginneries, the present employment position is estimated as follows:

/1   Estimated to consist of 21,316 men; 6,570 women; and 6,132 children.
72   Estimated for 1972/1973.
4.07      Prom the time of the earliest ginneries, labor contractors have
procured contract workers and provided their services to the ginneries at a
fee based on output. Since this had resulted in considerable exploitation,
the Government stopped the use of labor contractors after nationalization in
1963 and set up "labor cooperatives". However, their main function has con-
tinued to be the supply of labor to the ginneries and still at a fee related
to output. There is little evidence to suggest that employment conditions
have gained much from the change. Each ginnery also has a labor union, but
it is not clear to what extent these have a separate existence from the
labor cooperatives. There has been no history of strikes or disruptive
labor disputes and yet it is not surprising that under such work and employ-
ment conditions ginneries find it increasingly difficult to obtain the full
contingent of certain types of labor.
3.   Objectives of the Program
4.08      The objectives of the rehabilitation program are mainly to overcome
the present deficiencies by (a) forestalling major breakdowns which could have
a disastrous impact on the country's cotton production and hence its economy;
(b) avoiding further increases in maintenance and operating costs; (c) secur-
ing the highest returns on the volume and quality of cotton grown; and (d)
improving working conditions in the industry, an aspect which is strongly

4.09      While it is now envisaged that 42 ginneries can be rehabilitated,
31 others will have to be closed down because the condition of their equip-
ment and buildings makes modifications uneconomic or, in some cases, because
they have no storage space or are too small and have no scope to expand.
Twelve new ginneries will be built to substitute for capacity closed down
during the rehabilitation program giving scope for improving location and
storage arrangements. Rehabilitation of the whole industry will be spread
over at least 10 years and into three phases. Although the number of ginneries
will decline from presently 73 to 55 at the end of the rehabilitation program
in 1983 and the number of ginstands from 4,722 to 4,594, ginning capacity
(on the basis of two-shift capacity as at present) will increase by 15% in
line with the modest rate of expansion of cotton production as described in
the previous chapter. A summary of the program elements is given below:

144 stands each.
/2   Four "single" units and nine "twin" units.
The overall program is roughly estimated to cost US$125 million, with Phase I
costing about US$40.4 million equivalent. Phasing of the program is designed
so as to reduce each phase to manageable size for implementation; to keep the
program flexible; and to allow individual ginneries to be selected in a way
which allows rehabilitated ginning capacity to be balanced with cotton varieties
and output available in each surrounding area.

B.  The Project
1.   Project Definition
4.10      The scope of Phase I - the establishment of four new ginneries and
the rehabilitation of ten existing ginneries - was defined by L. H. Manderstam,
an,d agreed to by ECGO. Size and locations of the four new ginneries (Map 1,
IB&D 10551) were chosen with due regard towards obtaining an optimal balance
between ginning capacity and the projected crops in the surrounding areas; the
need to gin different varieties separately; the existence of infrastructure
and availability of land, labor and services. The project will increase total
ginning capacity by about 5%, assuming two-shift operations.
4.11      The "unit" size of a new ginnery will comprise 72 ginstands.  Two
of the proposed new ginneries (like the one now being built with the help of
British Aid) will be "single" units of 72 ginstands and the other two "twin"
units of 144 ginstands. Construction of larger ginneries is not economical
because increased transportation costs from more distant cotton supplying
areas more than offset savings in annual fixed investment charges. In the
rehabilitated ginneries, the existing ginstands and most of the construction
will remain, but mechanical distribution and conveyance will be introduced
as in the new ginneries. More uniform feeding and lower down time for main-
tenance will improve both productivity and capacity utilization.
2.   Degree of Mechanization
4.12      ECGO, its consultants and IDA have studied alternative cut-off levels
for mechanization, and their effect on employment and economic returns. Ad-
ditional mechananization in the new and rehabilitated ginneries relates mainly
to feeding, distributing and conveying equipment but falls into several seg-
ments: (a) yard handling of seed cotton sacks; (b) pneumatic conveying of
seedcotton from reception to blending hall, directly or passing through bulk
storage; (c) pneumatic conveying of seed cotton from blending hall to ginning
hall; (d) seedcotton distribution (by scroll conveyor) to feeder hoppers and
automatic feeding of ginstands; (e) conveying of lint from ginstands and its
automatic humidifying and trampling into press boxes; and (f) handling (by
bale-lift trucks) of lint bales from presses to yards and dispatch.
4.13      The most important benefits flowing from the project are the in-
creased yield of lint and the improvement of its grade. To attain these
aims and improve working conditions, manual handling in any of the core seg-
ments (c), (d) and (e), which are interdependent, cannot be retained. Manual
handling in any one or all of these segments would continue to allow trash,
dust, and oil to contaminate the lint and lower the grades as it does today.
Mechanization of these segments will, therefore, have to be the minimum that
is implemented.
4.14      Annex 11 has a fuller discussion on alternative levels of mechaniza-
tion; some financial measures of the effects are as follows:

/1   Calculations at market prices; shadow pricing of labot in the ginneries
would leave results of the evaluation unchanged.  Capital costs do not
include training costs.
/2   Benefits (quality and yield improvement) less main costs related to
mechanization (labor, power, fuel, transportation and depreciation).
/3   Figures in brackets are indexes.
The above two ratios (4) and (5) would rank full mechanization slightly ahead
of intermediate mechanization but give the intermediate alternative a major
edge over the minimum mechanization level. ECGO favors full mechanization,
i.e. including mechanized handling at the initial and final stages. However,
the minor additional advantage in revenue terms of full over intermediate
mechanization, the fact that a decision on full mechanization need not be
taken immediately, and the disadvantage of full over intermediate mechaniza-
tion with respect to employment, all suggest that the intermediate solution
is the optimal one at present. This solution would permit a slow phasing out
of the manual handling in the yards. ECGO has agreed during negotiations to
limit mechanization to the intermediate level. The economic and social impact
of mechanization is discussed in Chapter VIII.
3.   Study of Employment Effects
4.15      Following IDA's discussions with the Government, ECGO, ILO and
UNICEF, and in response to a formal request from the Government, a study was
conducted in March/April 1973 by ILO with UNICEF's assistance and financing
to measure the employment problem that may emerge from the project, and also
formulate actions to be taken to retrain and re-employ displaced workers.
The Government, ECGO, ILO and UNICEF comprised a coordinating committee to
direct the study which was conducted by the Egyptian National Institute of
Planning. A preliminary report arising from this study was submitted to IDA
in April, 1973.
4.16      Agreement has been reached with the Government and ECGO during nego-
tiations, that a retraining and re-employment program for the displaced workers
will be carried out in tandem with the rehabilitation project. While the Gov-
ernment will be responsible for the program, ECGO will be its executing agency.
It has been agreed that the working group (comprising ECGO, ILO, UNICEF,



- 15 -
Ministries of Manpower, Education and Social Affairs) would continue its work
in order to (a) complete its investigations to identify new demands for employ-
ment in each town and district affected, and (b) draw up a detailed training
program involving pre-vocational and vocational education, functional literacy
training as well as job training for re-employment. Thereafter, a complete
retraining program will be presented by ECGO to IDA by October 31, 1973, or
a later date that may mutually be agreed. Active roles in the implementa-
tion of the retraining program, may be assigned by ECGO to ILO and UNICEF.
A provision of US$1 million equivalent to cover the cost of the retraining
program has been included in project cost estimates (para 5.01 and 5.02) and
in the calculation of the economic return of the project. An allocation of
US$500,000 will be available in the IDA Credit towards the retraining program,
up to half of which may be used to meet local currency expenditure.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCIAL PLAN
A. Project Costs
5.01      Detailed project cost estimates are given in Annex 12 while Annex 13
discusses the assumptions made and the techniques used in a risk analysis. The
cost estimates were prepared by the consultants and are based on enquiries for
equipment (both imported and local) and civil works of early 1973. They also
include the expected effect of the recent US dollar devaluation, and assume a
construction period of four years and project completion by December 1977.
Contingencies are expected to be adequate to absorb 55% of the risks of a
cost overrun; they are judged to be adequate to carry out the project.

No additional working capital is provided in the project cost for covering the
slightly higher level of operations, since the export companies will as usual
.over this with short-term borrowings. Interest during construction will not
!:2 capitalized, but paid out of current operations.
B. Financial Plan
5.02      An IDA Credit of US$18.5 million equivalent is proposed in order to
fiLnance all expected foreign exchange costs of the project and including 50%
of the retraining program, viz. US$500,000 equivalent, which should allow IDA
to exercise some control over execution of the retraining program. Up to
US$250,000 equivalent from the allocation of US$500,000 to the retraining
program, would be available to cover local currency expenditure. All other
local currency expenditures for the project would be met by retained earnings
of ECGO. Project financing would therefore be provided as 45% debt and 55%
equity as summarized below:
Financial Plan
US$ Million       _
Long-Term Debt - Relending of IDA Credit                 18.00       45

40.39     __
5.03      The proposed IDA Credit would be made on standard IDA terms to the
Government, which would onlend US$18 million equivalent to ECGO as a loan for
15 years including a grace period of 5 years at 6% interest. Repayment to
the Government would be in 10 equal annual installments, covering both prin-
cipal and interest. ECGO would also pay the Government a Ministry of Finance,
Economy and Foreign Trade charge of 2-1/2% per annum on the outstanding amount
of the loan, thus raising the cost of finance to ECGO to 8-1/2% per annum.
The Government has agreed to bear the cost of the retraining program, and
pass the IDA allocation of US$500,000 equivalent to ECGO as a grant. ECGO
will execute the project and be the ultimate borrower, but since project
expenditure on the ginneries will increase the fixed assets of the ginning
companies, ECGO will acquire corresponding shares in the ginning companies'
equity capital.
5.04      Reqtuirements for financing local costs of US$21.4 million equivalent
will also be generated during project implementation through the earnings of
ECGO, and invested (excluding interest during construction) in the equity
of the ginning companies. ECGO's level of cash generation in the last three
years has been in excess of two-and-a-half times the yearly local finance
required during project implementation. The Government has agreed during
negotiations that ECGO will be allowed to retain sufficient surpluses (instead
of passing them annually to the Treasury, para 2.13) to enable it to meet
local costs of the project as and when these occur, and that any additional
funds, both foreign exchange and local, that may be needed to complete the
project will be provided by the Government on terms satisfactory to IDA.

C. Allocation of the IDA Credit
5.05      The US$18.5 million IDA Credit will be used to finance the following:

5.06      Disbursements of the IDA Credit will be made in accordance with
normal Association procedures; except that disbursements for local costs of
re-employment training will be made against statements of expenditures, and
the supporting documents shall be retained by the appropriate organizations,
and shall be open to inspection by the Association. A projected disbursements
schedule is given in Annex 14.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Design, Engineering, Project Management and Training
6.01      L. H. Manderstam (LHM) is now engaged by ECGO under the recent IDA
engineering credit in the preliminary design of the new ginneries; the de-
tailed engineering of the first two ginneries to be rehabilitated; the identi-
fication of equipment suitable for local procurement; and the preparation of
bidding documents for imported and local equipment. The execution of soil
tests as well as the preparation of drawings and tender documents for civil
works are to be subcontracted under the supervision of engineering consultants
to a competent Egyptian contractor. ECGO has decided to continue working with
LHM and appoint them as their engineering consultants during the execution of
the project. IDA considers that Manderstam is qualified to perform such a
function satisfactorily. A detailed project execution schedule is shown in
Annex 15.
6.02      Neither ECGO nor the five ginning companies have at present the
necessary personnel with adequate experience in construction work to handle
project execution on their own. With construction proceding at 14 different
locations more or less at the same time, and procurement covering international
and local supplies as well as domestic fabrication of imported materials, the



- 18 -
project management function will be crucial for implementing the project effi-
ciently and on time. Agreement has been reached during negotiations with ECGO
and the Government on the following broad set-up for project management depicted
ax_ 16:
(a) ECGO will establish a project management unit ultimately staffed
with about 100 personnel, consisting essentially of a project
director and three functional departments under its control -
engineering, finance and administration. The engineering con-
sultants will form part of the office of the Project Director and
act through him. This team might hopefully be able to undertake
project implementation without expatriate assistance from Phase
II onward. The project management unit will be under the execu-
tfve supervision of ECGO's Chairman.
(b) Within the functions of the office of the Project Director and
with the staff support of the project management unit, the
engineering consultants will be responsible primarily for the
design and engineering work, the coordination and supervision
of procurement, the erection and commissioning of facilities
and the performance of equipment at both new and rehabilitated
ginneries. It is envisaged that the engineering consultants
will have about 5 people in the field plus any further temporary
backup that may be required from time to time.
(c) Locally recruited technical advisors, being either individuals
or a firm, will be appointed by ECGO to advise ECGO's management
in evaluating and assisting the work of the project management
unit including the engineering consultants, whenever required.
(d) A coordination committee consisting of the Chairman of ECGO as
Committee Chairman and including the chairmen of each of the five
ginning companies, the Project Director, a representative of the
engineering consultants, certain Ministry officials and the
technical advisors will be set up to allow the proper coordination
of project aspects concerning the different ginning companies and
to secure their agreement in the implementation of the project.
While the committee will not have executive power over the Project
Director and the project implementation unit any major disputes
arising in the committee will have to be resolved by ECGO's Board.
6.03      Success in project execution will heavily depend on the effective-
ness with which the project management unit and the engineering consultants
will be able to work together. Agreement has been reached during negotiations
that ECGO wlUl set up the project management unit and appoint enginesring con-
sultants acceptable to IDA (to be retained throughout project implementation)
within 60 and 30 days respectively, of signing of the IDA Credit Agreement.
ECGO and Manderstam are now preparing a contract for engineering consultancy
and implementation services with detailed terms of reference, which will need
to be satisfactory to IDA.



- 19 -
6.04      Although cotton ginning does not involve a complicated technical
process and operation of the ginstands will not be much different from what
it is today, the higher degree of mechanization in the new and rehabilitated
ginneries will require a substantial upgrading in skills of plant operators.
Training programs will be designed by the consultants and implemented by ECGO
and the ginning companies. Some workers are expected to be upgraded by the
vocational training institutes of the Ministry of Manpower; other key workers
and supervisors will receive special training from selected suppliers of equip-
ment. Ginning managers and senior executives will require orientation to new
management skills. During negotiations ECGO has agreed to submit to IDA by
March 31, 1974, for its approval, a detailed proposal for the training of
workers and supervisory personnel and implement it promptly as required.
Adequate provision has been made under the IDA Credit to cover the foreign
exchange requirements of the engineering services and the training.
B. Procurement
6.05      Equipment such as shaker conveyors, hopper feeders, fuel tanks, small
boilers and miscellaneous electricals are available in Egypt of adequate quality
and at prices expected to be below c.i.f. prices of imports. These would be
reserved for local competitive bidding against local financing. The Government
has agreed that it would allow this equipment to be imported if prolonged
deliveries should threaten to delay the project as measured against the agreed
implementation schedule (Annex 15). The rest of the equipment which has been
included in the IDA Credit will be procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines and the Government has agreed during
negotiations that all permits and licenses needed for the project will be ex-
peditiously issued. Roller ginstands representing 10% of imported equipment
cost, are manufactured mainly by Platt International of the U.K. and its
licensees in one or two other countries. Conveying and distributing equipment,
presses and imported seed room equipment are expected to be tendered for in
the U.K., U.S.A., Brazil, Belgium, Germany and some other countries. Civil
works would be carried out by Government owned civil engineering organizations,
following local competitive bidding among these organizations. The substantial
value of the civil works contracts will, under local rules, attract competition
only from the larger civil engineering contractors. Tentative bid packages for
both foreign and local procurement are listed in Annex 17.
C. Financial Accounting
6.06      Financial accounting, cost control and internal reporting procedures
within ECGO will need strengthening to provide improved management tools.
ECGO has agreed during negotiations that, where necessary with the assistance
of consultants, it will introduce within its organization and that of the
ginning companies by July 1, 1974 improved accounting, cost control and re-
porting procedures satisfactory to the Association. Financial statements
will continue to be audited annually by the State Audit Organization, in
accordance with sound auditing principles consistently applied in such scope
and detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A, Introduction
7.01      In the following financial analysis, projections are made on two
distinct bases. First, cost and benefits are given on an incremental basis
for the project, irrespective of how they will be reflected in the financial
statements of ECGO and its subsidiaries. The rates of return are calculated
or. an incremental basis from these projections. Second, financial projections
are given for ECGO as a holding company which, as the project sponsor and the
umbrelia organization, will receive all project benefits either through the
ginning companies (cost savings) or the export companies (revenue benefits).
Any changes in internal transfer prices such as the ginning fee cancel out
in this analysis.
7,02      Conventional sensitivity analysis in Bank/IDA appraisals points out
the variations expected in the rate of return if some variables change from
the best estimates assumed in the calculations. It does not give a judgement
on the likelihood of variations occurring in the key variables, nor does it
give an indication of the likely magnitude of such variations. In short, it
does not consider the "risk" in its calculations. Uncertainties regarding
costs, benefits and timing inherent in the project have been tackled by the
use of a risk analysis technique. This exercise considered these uncertainties
by eszablishing ranges of values with their likelihood, to arrive at a "risk
profile" of each major element. All projections in the appraisal are based
on the averages of values of all possible outcomes weighted by the chances
(probabilities) of each occurring. A complete description of the risk analysis
exercise is given in Annex 13.
B. Project Benefits on Incremental Basis
7.03      The project will yield benefits in three different ways:  (a) by
avoiding the cost penalty (through breakdowns, inefficient operation, and
capacity constraint) of not rehabilitating the ginneries, (b) by reducing
operating costs from present levels, (c) by increasing revenue (Annex 18).
Revenue gains will contribute about 75% of project benefits, more than half
of project benefits resulting from an improvement in the grade of lint which
will command higher average cotton prices in world markets.  By 1978, or about
one year after project completion, rehabilitation is expected to yield sig-
nificant operating cost savings; according to the estimates in the risk analy-
sis, operating costs would drop from the present average of 62.2 PT/Cantar by
13.2 PT/Cantar or 21% (Annex 13).
7.04      A summary of incremental project benefits is given below; Annex 18

7.06      ECGO's long-term debt service coverage is lowest in 1975/76 at 19.0.
Although this seems to indicate a very comfortable coverage, ECGO's cash flow
could change substantially with marginal decreases in world cotton prices and/or
increase in farmer prices for cotton. An average 5% drop in prices of Egyptian
cotton or a 5% increase (LE1.0/Cantar) in seed cotton price paid to the farmer,
can reduce ECGO's cash flow by over UE10 million. The Government has agreed
during negotiations to keep ECGO in a sound financial position, with a view
to maintaining a debt service coverage of at least two times. ECGO has also
agreed to consult with IDA prior to undertaking other major investments in
addition to the project. In view of the importance of cotton production and
particularly cotton exports to Egypt's economy, it is highly unlikely that
Egypt would not take the necessary measures to maintain ECGO's healthy finan-
cial position.
7.07      The incremental financial return of the project is 17.9%.  However,
this can vary from 14% to 21.8% as shown in Annex 19 with a 75% probability
that it will exceed 16.7%. The project is thus financially attractive.
D. Risks in the Project
7.08      The modernization program aims at mechanizing an industry which
hitherto has been manually operated except for the ginstands. There are no
precedents in Egypt to enable reliable estimates of the benefits of mechani-
zation in the form of quality improvement, productivity increase and cost
savings, although the basic technology of ginning is familar in Egypt, and
the mechanization processes are well-proven in other countries. Grade improve-



- 23 -
ment, ginning outturn and increased volume of lint production are therefore
subject to uncertainties. ECGO's inexperience with project construction could
lead to delays in implementation. This, coupled with uncertainties regarding
currency parities, leave project cost vulnerable to variations. The risk
analysis technique has been used to take these uncertainties into account.
7.09      Annex 19 gives the risk profiles of five key factors:  rate of return,
net present value, foreign capital costs, revenues due to grade improvement, and
net cash flows in 1979/80 chosen as an example. These risk profiles indicate
the range of uncertainties that exist in the project. The foreign component of
the capital costs (without price escalation) is projected at about hE6.2 million,
but it could be as high as about LE8.2 million. On the other hand, there is
about a 50% probability that this cost will be under UE6.1 million. Similarly,
substantial variations in net cash flows are possible. For example, in 1979/80,
the project cash flow is UE2.46 million. There is, however, a 25% probability
that the cash flow will be hE2.04 million or less; in the worst case, it could
go down to LE1.27 million. Annex 13 contains a full discussion of these re-
sults and their implications which are summarized below:

VIII. SOCIAL EFFECTS AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT
A.   Effect of the Project on Employment
8.01      The project will radically alter the composition of the work force
in the ginneries affected. Permanent and seasonal workers will increase in
numbers, but those under contract will be considerably reduced. All the
children and most of the women will be displaced by men with higher skills
required to operate new mechanical and electrical equipment. No worker in
future should work more than one eight-hour shift. ECGO has agreed during
negotiations that employment and working conditions in the ginneries to be
financed under the project will be improved upon implementation of the project.
8.02      The following table summarizes the employment effect of Phase I:

/1   Assumes two-shift operation, one eight-hour shift for workers, and "inter-
mediate mechanization."
Since Phase I is roughly one-third of the rehabilitation program total reduc-
tion in employment throughout its 10-year execution, assuming conservatively
that the yards (para 4.14) will by then all have been mechanized, may be around
17,500.
8.03      In macro-terms this volume of unemployment is small, particularly
because it relates largely to contract workers, not all of whom work through
the whole ginning season, to children who would no longer be allowed to
work in the ginneries, and to most of the women. The reduction in employment
must also be seen in the context of the intention of the Government to create
in the next Five-Year Plan (1973-1977) some 200,000 new jobs annually. Finally,
while the number of workers would be reduced by about 12% at the end of Phase I
(from 44,586 to 39,139), the wage bill would decrease by only 6%.  Neverthe-
less, as a sample survey (Annex 20) recently undertaken indicated, many
families depend on the meager incomes from seasonal employment and the absence
of some incomes will undoubtedly be felt. These social effects are offset
by the substantial economic benefits flowing from the project as explained
hereunder. These economic benefits, furthermore, provide sufficient resources
for the support of a reemployment training program, to be executed in tandem
with the project (para 4.16).



- 25 -
B.   Economic Return of the Project
8.04      As already discussed, the cotton sector is of vital importance to
the Egyptian economy. Egypt enjoys an important natural comparative advantage
in production of LS and ELS cotton due to a unique combination of its land
and climate. Egypt's high yield of LS and ELS cotton combined with its cheap
labor enables the country to produce cotton at very economical cost.  Annex 21
shows that the average cost to the country of exporting one cantar of cotton,
is 7.E16 against an average export price of approximately &E26 per cantar
leaving a margin of about LEIO per cantar for distribution as profits and
other transfer payments in the economy. This substantial margin enables Egypt
not only to export cotton competitively, but also to supply inputs to the ex-
isting local textiles and cooking oil industries at favorable prices. Domes-
tic prices of lint are 10-40% lower than equivalent export prices. Cotton
seed is made available to the oil extraction industry at about 1/7th of the
world price. It is important for Egypt to maintain its comparative advantage
in world trade by safeguarding and improving the quality of its cotton. The
rehabilitation program is designed to retain, during ginning, the highest
possible quality of Egyptian cotton.
8.05      In evaluating the economic costs and benefits, goods have been valued
at world market prices as far as these goods are tradeable, and at economic
costs where non-tradeable supplies are concerned. Duties, taxes and other
transfer payments within the economy, have been eliminated from costs. The
economic cost of the local component of capital expenditures has been arrived
at by eliminating such local transfer costs and shadow pricing unskilled labor
employed in the equipment and construction industries. Foreign equipment cost
has been taken at financial cost less import duties. On the revenue side,
economic value of exports has been taken as equal to the financial earnings
since cotton is exported under free world competition. 11 Domestic sales of
cotton, including long staple, are mainly for applications which could be
satisfied with short staple cotton. Egypt has considered exporting all its
long staple cotton and importing short staple cotton for domestic use but
decided against it because of the possibility of contamination of its cotton
crop, and the possible boomerang effect on world prices of Egyptian cotton
that might result from offering increased quantities internationally. Since
domestic long staple cotton prices are very near those of short staples in
world markets, the economic value of domestic cotton sales has been taken as
equivalent to prevalent domestic sales prices. In operating costs only labor
has been shadow priced and other relatively smaller components left at their
financial values.
8.06      For the local component of investment costs, skilled labor in the
construction and equ!ipment industry has been valued at market wage rates, and
unskilled labor has been shadow priced at 0.5. The economic cost of the
investment in the project with these adjustments is US$27.6 million (ME10.8
million) as summarized in Annex 21, which also gives the assumptions used in
the calculations.
1/   Sales to the centrally planned countries are reportedly also made at
free market prices.



- 26 -
aO07      The project will replace present old and inefficient equipment with
new and efficient facilities. This will reduce costs of production and bring
-at add itonal revenues through improved quality and marginal increase in
caoscity.  Total incremental economic benefits from the project are estimated
at inE4.2 miDllon annually.
,3060     ln calculating the economic benefits, assumptions giveni in Annex 21
have been used. Existing labor in the present ginneries, being ailmost all
unskilled, has been shadow priced at 0.5, i.e., the same as unskilled labor
for investment costs. The labor in the new and rehabilitated ginneries, on
the other hand, would be mostly semi-skilled. This labor was shadow priced
at a sactor of 0.7 of the market wage levels, which is between the factors
used for 8killed and unskilled labor in determining project cost. The latter
shadow prici, besides representing the opportunity cost of the labor, is
further justified as the external economies resulting from the project in the
form of the upgrading of this labor, are not accounted for in the calculation
of project benefits.
3. 09     The expected economic return of the project by using the above
shadow rates is calculated at 24.7%.
8.10      It should, however, be further noted that the unskilled labor force
presentlv eimployed in existing ginneries is to some extent coerced into working.
In addition, the workers, including children and women, work under unhealthful
conditions entailing future costs for the economy through health deterioration
and they, o90r at least some of the children, could realize a potential of
greater vaiue to the economy through further education.  IDA considers that the
elimiaation of these undesirable conditions is an important benefit of the
project. Ti.e shadow price factor for the existing labor in the present ginneries
of 0,5 makes no allowance for these penalties to the economy of the existing
system, Su6chi allowance can be made by raising the economic cost of the existing
labor from 0,5 to the full market wage rate, though even that might understate
the actual penalty to the economy.        I
8.11      If these indirect but important benefits of moving from the present
to the project situation were quantified by using the market wage rate for
unskilled labor in the present ginneries, the expected economic return would
rise to 28,9%, The actual return to the economy might be even higher since,
Pls -Lndcicated, the above quantification of the social benefits may be conserva-
tive; frtharmore, the project benefits disregard the external economies
resulting from the upgrading of the skills of the displaced workers through
the training scheme, for which US$1.0 million has been charged to the project.
8.12      As described in Annex 13 on Risk Analysis, the expected return is
the weighted average of probable likelihoods. Conventional sensitivity
analysis showed that even if revenue for grade improvement dropped 25% below
the expected values used in the risk analysis, the economic return would still
be about 19.8%. This return is considered to be well above the opportunity
cost of capital in Egypt. If it is desired to penalize the project still
further because of its higher degree of mechanization, this can be done by
notionally raising project costs. If project costs were thus increased by
50%, the return would be above 16.8%, which is still acceptable.



- 27 -
C.   Foreign Exchange Aspects
8.13      Primarily by improving the average quality of cotton exported, the
project will increase the export earnings of Egypt by about US$4.2 million
(1E1.6 million) annually, compared to the expected foreign exchange cost of
the project of US818.25 million.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      Agreement was reached during credit negotiations on the following
principal points:
(i)  The Government will,
(a) Provide ECGO from the IDA Credit, a grant of US$500,000
equivalent towards the retraining program and a loan of
US$18 million equivalent, to be repaid to the Government
in 15 years including five years of grace, with interest
at 6% per annum plus a Ministry of Finance, Economy and
Foreign Trade charge of 2-1/2% per annum on the outstanding
balance of the loan (para 5.03).
(b) Authorize ECGO to use the equivalent of US$21.4 million
from its earned surplus during project implementation,
to invest in the equity of the ginning companies for
financing of the local capital expenditures on the project
as and when they arise (para 5.04).
(c) Provide additional funds, both foreign exchange and local,
as may be required to complete the project on terms satisfac-
tory to the Association (para 5.04).
(d) Ensure that ECGO maintains a minimum long-term debt service
coverage of 2.0 until the proceeds of the IDA Credit have
been repaid to the Government (para 7.06).
(e) Allow equipment to be imported that was previously expected
to be supplied domestically if prolonged deliveries should
threaten to delay the project, and issue all permits and
import licenses needed for speedy implementation of the
project (para 6.05).
(f) Arrange for the on-going ILO study on the employment
effects of the project to be completed, and submit to
IDA a specific proposal by October 31, 1973, for re-training
and re-employing the workers displaced by the project,
and carry out such a program as agreed to by IDA, in
parallel with execution of the project (para 4.16).



- 28 -
(ii) ECGO will:
(a)  Appoint within 30 days of the signing of the IDA Credit
Agreement, engineering consultants and technical advisors
(both to be retained throughout project implementation),
and within 60 days set up a project management unit within
the ECGO organization9 as acceptable to IDA (paras 6.02
and 6.03).
(b)  Limit mechanization under the project to the intermediate
level (para 4.14).
(c) Provide improved employment and working conditions in the
ginneries to be financed under the project (para 8.01).
(d) Consult IDA before undertaking major capital expenditures
outside the project (para 7.06).
(e) Undertake to execute the project on an agreed implementation
schedule (para 6.01).
(f) Arrange for the consulting engineers to draw up a program
for training workers and supervisory personnel by
March 31, 1974, satisfactory to ECGO and IDA, and implement
it thereafter (para 6,04).
(g) Strengthen the accounting and reporting procedures of ECGO
and the ginning companies to the satisfaction of IDA, by
July 1, 1974 anid make auditing arrangements satisfactory
to IDA (para 6,06),
9.02      Based on the assurances obtained during negotiations, the project
constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$18.5 million.
