BRAZIL - RFFSA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        A Brazilian company, Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas SA (MBR), is
planning to develop a large scale project for the mining and export of iron ore.
The Federal Railways (Rede Ferroviaria Federal - RFFSA) will provide rail trans-
portation from a mine site at Aguas Claras (State of Minas Gerais) to a new
marine terminal at Sepetiba Bay (State of Rio de Janeiro), over a distance of
about 640 km. A 15-year contract has been signed between MBR and RFFSA cover-
ing the transport of a basic tonnage of between 10 and 12 million tons per
annum. MBR has requested a Bank loan of US$50 million toward the financing of
the mine and the port; this is appraised in IBRD Appraisal Report PI-10. The
present report is concerned with the appraisal of the railway transport com-
ponent of this project, for which RFFSA has requested a loan of US$46 million.
ii.       In appraising this railway transport project, a review has been made
of the railways' past performance and prospective role in Brazil's transport
sector. Since 1964 the Bank has had a continuiing exchange of views with the
Government of Brazil regarding the improvement and extension of the transport
system. In 1965 the Government undertook, with Bank assistance, a general
transport survey covering highway and railway transport, coastal shipping and
the operations of Brazil's three main ports. The survey, completed in 1969,
recommended a series of measures to improve transport services and defined
investment programs for each mode. Prior to financing the First and Second
Highway Projects (567-BR and 676-BR), the Government submitted to the Bank
two Plans of Action covering implementation of the survey's main recommenda-
tions. Both Plans are being followed satisfactorily.
iii.      The Brazilian railway network coiprises about 30,000 route-km, of
which 25,000 km are Federal (RFFSA) and 5,000 km State (Sao Paulo State
Railways). In addition, 603 km are owned and operated by a Government mining
company (Cia Vale do Rio Doce - CVRD) and carry mostly iron ore traffic. In
recent years RFFSA operations have been characterized by heavy financial
deficits. However, steady progress to reduce these deficits is apparent.
In 1969, the total loss from RFFSA's cperations was NCr$ 533.6 million
(US$131.4 million equivalent), a reduction in real terms of 8.3% and 16.3%
on the corresponding figures for 1968 and 1966, respectively. In the future,
the potential for an efficient railway system, as a long-distance bulk carrier,
is favorable and suits the characteristics of the country's growing transport
needs. However, realizing this potential will require continued efforts on
the part of RFFSA and Government to increase efficiency and reduce cost.
In conjunction with the appraisal of this project, RFFSA undertook the
preparation of a Corporate Plan covering a five-year period. A planning
group was established for this purpose and a preliminary outline plan
produced during 1970, which shows that, provided the measures outlined above
are implemented, there would be a prospect for RFFSA to eliminate its



- ii -
operating deficit by 1975 - before charging loan interest and depreciation.
A fully developed plan is to be prepared during 1971 which will include de-
tailed action programs covering all aspects of RFFSA's operations.
iv.       This would be the first Bank loan to RFFSA but there have been two
other railway projects financed by Loam 65-BR and 92-BR (US$12.5 million each)
in 1952 and 1953 to the Central do Brasil, which is now part of the RFFSA
system.
v.        The project consists of all facilities required to transport 12 mil-
lion tons of ore annually and provides for the purchase of locomotives and
wagons, and for the improvement of existing track, signalling, and structures,
as well as the construction of new track to connect the mine area with the
main line near Belo Horizonte and to bypass lines carrying high density traffic
in the Rio de Janeiro area. Total cost of the project is estimated at US$133.2
million equivalent. RFFSA is negotiating bilateral financing of US$26.7 mil-
lion to cover 90% of the cost of locomotives. The Bank loan of US$46 million
will finance 100% of the cost of freight cars, rails and accessories, work-
shop and rail welding equipment and the foreign exchange costs of consulting
services. The balance of US$60.5 million will be provided by the Government.
vi.       Procurement of equipment to be financed by the Bank loan will be on
the basis of international competitive bidding. Brazilian manufacturers will
have a preference of 15% or the amount of the import tariffs, whichever is
the lower, and they are expected to participate in bidding for freight cars
and part of the rails, accessories, and workshop equipment financed under the
loan. Assuming that all orders are placed abroad, the project's foreign ex-
change costs would be US$88.2 million equivalent. Should local firms win all
the contracts for those items which can be produced in Brazil, foreign exchange
costs would be reduced to US$52.6 million. As agreed during negotiations,
the same financing formula will be used in the latter case, and the Bank loan
would then include US$35.6 million equivalent of local costs. No disburse-
ments would be made for expenditures incurred prior to the signing of the
loan except for relevant engineering costs, which would be about US$100,000.
vii.      The railway project, as defined in the report, is expected to earn
an internal rate of financial return of 11.3% over a life of 15 years, which
is fully satisfactory and will make a substantial contribution to the planned
financial recovery of RFFSA. The economic rate of return on the project as a
whole (mine, rail and port) is estimated at 20% based on an ultimate pro-
duction level of 12 million tons.
viii.     The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to
RFFSA of US$46 million equivalent for a term of 18 years, including a four-
year period of grace.



BRAZIL - RFFSA
APPRAISAL OF A FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Rede Ferroviaria Federal SA (RFFSA), a publicly owned corporation,
has requested a Bank loan of US$46 million equivalent to cover part of the
required external financing for a transportation project estimated to cost
US$133.2 million. This project is associated with another for the develop-
ment of iron ore mining at Aguas Claras and the establishment of a marine
terminal at Sepetiba Bay, for which Bank participation in loan financing has
also been requested (IBRD Appraisal Report PI-10). The estimated costs of the
mine and port project are of the order of US$150 million and the two appraisal
reports are complementary to each other.
1.02      The mining company, Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas SA (MBR) has con-
tracted with Japanese purchasers for the sale of 7 million tons of iron ore per
year for 15 years; other contracts totalling 2 million tons have so far been
negotiated. MBR has contracted with RFFSA for the transportation from mine to
port of 10-12 million tons a year for 15 years with an option to increase to
15 million tons by giving 18 months' notice to RFFSA. Under the terms of the
contract, RFFSA is to provide all facilities, including motive power and roll-
ing stock, to start iron ore shipments within 30 months of obtaining the nec-
essary finance, with penalties for late completion by either side.
1.03      RFFSA has, along lines recommended by the Bank, prepared an Outline
Corporate Plan for the Railways as a whole covering (a) general rehabilitation
in order to provide better service, thereby attracting additional available
traffic; (b) a restructuring and reform of tariff policies to produce higher
revenues; and (c) a rationalization of services, operating patterns and work-
shop facilities to produce much needed economies and reduction of personnel.
The Plan will have as its financial objective the elimination of the heavy
deficits incurred by RFFSA from its present operations. Government and RFFSA
have already taken steps to improve the finances and organization of RFFSA as
a result of understandings reached with the Bank in the approval of other
transport sector loans.
1.04      This would be the first Bank loan to RFFSA but there have been two
other railway projects financed by Loans 65-BR and 92-BR (US$12.5 million each)
in 1952 and 1953 to the Central do Brasil, which is now part of the RFFSA
system. A highway maintenance project was financed by Loan 75-BR (US$3 mil-
lion) in 1953 covering the purchase of maintenance equipment for the State of
Rio de Janeiro. All these loans have been fully disbursed. Two highway con-
struction projects were financed under Loans 567-BR and 676-BR (US$26 million
and US$100 million), approved respectively in 1968 and 1970. Up to May 31,
1971, disbursements under these two loans were US$12.3 million (Loan 567-BR)
and US$1.2 million (Loan 676-BR). Both loans contribute to the rehabilitation
and expansion of the highway system.

1.05      This report has been prepared by Messrs. J. Ratter (Engineer),
B. Siret (Engineer/Economist) and J. Spencer (Financial Analyst), who appraised
the project in October/November 1970, and has been edited by Miss V. Foster.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      Brazil, with an area of 8.5 million km2, is the fifth largest
country in the world. The 1970 population was estimated at 91 million;
population growth in the 1960s averaged 2.7% per annum as compared with 3%
in the 1950s. In 1970, GDP at market prices was about NCr$ 167.9 billion
(US$36.5 billion equivalent). Per capita GDP was about US$396 equival-
ent.
2.02      Led by the industrial sector, Brazil's GDP grew by 8.4% in 1968,
9% in 1969 and 9.5% in 1970. Maintaining a high rate of growth in the
coming years is regarded by the Government as being essential to the
social and political stability of the country. High growth rates will
require rapid increases in investment outlays: for the 1971-1976 period,
Government agencies and public enterprises are expected to spend at least
US$25 billion on the formation of fixed capital (IBRD - Economic Report
Wi-203).
2.03      A major portion of this investment will be directed to the
transportation sector. Roughly 25% of total public fixed investment,
about US$1 billion equivalent p.a., will have to be invested in transport
infrastructure. At the same time there will be a need for better utili-
zation of existing facilities and improved coordination among modes.
B.   The Transport Sector
2.04      In 1965 the Government undertook, with Bank assistance, a general
transport survey covering highway and railway transport, coastal shipping and
port operations for Brazil's three main ports. The survey was financed in part
by UNDP. The study was conducted in two phases and was completed in 1969. It
recommended a series of measures to improve transport services and defined
priority investment programs for each mode. Prior to financing the First and
Second Highway Projects (567-BR and 676-BR), the Government submitted to the
Bank two Plans of Action covering implementation of the survey's main recom-
mendations. Both Plans are being followed satisfactorily (Annexes 1 and 2).
2.05      To coordinate and supervise the transport survey, a Government agency,
Grupo de Estudos para Integracao da Politiqua de Transportes (GEIPOT), was
created in 1965. Following completion of the survey, GEIPOT has been estab-
lished as a permanent planning agency within the Ministry of Transport. As



- 3 -
such, it is now responsible for the elaboration of a national transport policy
including coordination of investment plans for all modes, definition of pricing
policies and transport regulations. The definition of GEIPOT's new functions
should give this organization enough authority to play a decisive role in the
sector. However, due to inadequate staffing, GEIPOT has not yet fully suc-
ceeded in imposing its influence over established Government agencies.
3. THE BRAZILIAN RAILWAYS
A.   General
3.01      The Brazilian railway network comprises about 30,000 route-km, of
which 25,000 km are operated by a Federal company (RFFSA) and 5,000 km by a
State coordinated group of companies (Sao Paulo State Railways ) - see Map 1.
In addition, 603 km are owned and operated by a Government mining company (Cia
Vale do Rio Doce - CVRD) and carry mostly iron ore traffic. About 90% of the
network is meter gauge track. Between 1961 and 1969, raiLway freight traffic
(excluding CVRD) increased from 10.5 billion ton-km to 14.5 billion ton-km,
but passenger traffic declined from 18.0 billion pass-km to 13.0 billion pass-
km. In relative terms, the railways have been losing traffic to other modes
of transport.
3.02      The potential for an efficient rail freight system in Brazil is
favorable. Great distances lie between areas of production of raw materials,
the centers of consumption and the ports. The nature of the traffic lends
itself to efficient bulk transport in trains of high capacity, with mechanized
loading and unloading at terminals. Forecasts of freight traffic growth on
the railways indicate potential increases of at least 50% over the next five
years, if the railways can be properly equipped to carry it. However, they
have been starved of capital investment for many years. Investment has been
mainly geared to available funds rather than to the real needs of the rail-
ways and has been largely applied to the replacement of existing equipment
and track rather than to commercial requirements within a general business
plan. Great opportunities exist for reducing costs by rationalization of
the route system and by mechanization of track maintenance and freight hand-
ling and concentration of workshops. Heavy capital outlays will be required
to replace obsolete equipment and to expand capacity in accordance with busi-
ness needs while providing for greater operational efficiency. At the same
time, tariff structures will have to be remodeled to reflect costs of ser-
vices and maximize revenue while remaining competitive with those of other
transport modes.
3.03      The merger of the State Railways with the Federal system has been
under discussion since 1968, but no means have yet been found to satisfy the
conflicting interests of the Federal and State Governments in financial and
administrative matters. As a short-term measure and pending solution of these
problems, a joint committee of RFFSA and State Railways representatives was
established in 1970 to study and report on immediate means available for im-
proving joint operations between the Federal and State Railways. The report,
which has been produced and submitted to RFFSA and Sao Paulo Railways manage-
ments for approval, contains valuable recommendations by which service can be



- 4 -
improved and wasteful expenditure saved. Implementation is to follow immediate-
ly after approval. This is an important first step toward an ultimate merger
and the removal of an anomaly in the national railway system.
B.   The Federal Railways (RFFSA)
Organization
3.04      RFFSA was created in 1957 as a publicly owned corporation grouping
the 13 railways which formerly had been publicly owned but under separate
management. The whole of the ordinary share capital of RFFSA is held by the
Federal Government. The States and Municipalities hold preference shares
representing 23% of total capital. Management is undertaken by a board of
six members, chaired by the President of RFFSA. The former railways continue
to exist as "Divisions" under local management. In 1968, RFFSA's organization
was reshaped to provide for four regional systems. Economies in administration
are to be obtained bv concentrating responsibility in regional headquarters
for financial and personnel matters and statistics. RFFSA headquarters staff
includes six senior officers, responsible as "Superintendents" for Transporta-
tion, Engineering, Stores, Personnel, Finance and Administration. Their
responsibilities are confined to departmental policies, planning and standards,
leaving responsibility for overall planning and preparation of capital in-
vestment budgets to be carried out by an "Advisor" assisted by a small staff
and reporting directly to the President. An organization chart of RFFSA is
shown in Annex 3.
3.05      As a Federal enterprise, RFFSA comes within the portfolio of the
Federal Minister of Transport. Government control is limited to such items
as overall level of capital expenditures, annual budgets and accounts, maximum
tariff levels (para. 3.06) and matters affecting the public interest.
3.06      A separate Government agency, Departamento Nacional de Estradas de
Ferro (DNEF), established in 1941 and subordinate to the Minister of Transport,
also has responsibility in the field of rail transport. Until recently, this
agency was mainly concerned with the planning and construction of new railway
lines, setting of maximum railway tariffs (applicable to both Federal and State
Railways) and supervision of Federal and State railway enterprises. The Gov-
ernment's stated intention (Second Plan of Action - Annex 2) is to transform
DNEF into a Ministry department advising the Minister on railway matters in-
cluding the overall supervision and coordination of Federal and State Rail-
ways and the setting of maximum tariffs; responsibility for new line con-
struction will be transferred to RFFSA. Progress in implementing this re-
organization has been slow but it is expected that by the end of 1971 DNEF
would complete line construction works now in hand and relinquish its execu-
tive responsibilities.
Performance of RFFSA
3.07      In the past four years, freight traffic expressed in ton-km increased
from 9.3 billion to 11.3 billion. This increase was brought about by a growth
in tonnage handled from 28.5 million to 31.5 million and average hauls increas-
ing from 326 km to 359 km. In the same years, the number of suburban passenger



journeys increased from 255 to 266 million while the number of intercity pas-
senger journeys decreased from 47 to 37 million. Traffic units per employee
rose from 145 to 166, an increase of 15% (Table 1). Revenue and expenditure
accounts of RFFSA for the years 1966 to 1969 are shown in Table 2. The loss
from RFFSA's operations before taking account of normalization 1/ for 1969 was
NCr$ 533.6 million, a reduction in real terms of 8.3% on the corresponding fig-
ure for 1968. After normalization, the 1969 deficit was NCr$ 427.8 million.
No depreciation or loan interest is charged in arriving at RFFSA's loss. Per-
sonnel costs are 63% of gross expenditure; for railway operations they amounted
in 1969 to NCr$ 593.2 million against gross receipts of NCr$ 525.4 million.
During the first half of 1970, following a further increase in the volume of
freight traffic of over 9%, the financial results from railway operations
continued to show the improvement of the previous two years. Expressed in
current prices, total railway receipts increased by 40% and expenses by 18%,
but, in real terms, railway deficit decreased by 14%.
3.08      On a regional basis, results from railway operations (i.e., excluding
results of RFFSA subsidiary companies) in 1969 were as follows (Table 3 Parts 1
and 2):
Deficit               Operating
NCr$ Million               Ratio
North East                             111.9                   398
Central                                238.8                   189
South Central                           21.1                   121
South                                   51.0                   143

436.6                   183
The North East Region carries 6.5% of the total system traffic and employs 19%
of total personnel. The Central Region carries 62% of total system traffic,
employs 51% of total personnel and is by far the biggest contributor to RFFSA's
loss through underuse of the capacity it offers. Opportunity is now presented
to increase iron ore and other traffics which will make full use of its main
assets.
Balance Sheet
3.09      A reconstructed summary balance sheet of RFFSA at December 1969 is
shown as Table 4. Outstanding loans amount to NCr$ 467 million (US$107 million
equivalent), of which 90% are foreign currency loans on which Government pro-
vides the funds for debt service. Receivables and cash balances more than cover
current liabilities, but included in receivables are accounts of Government,
States and Municipalities amounting to NCr$ 58 million, the bulk of which goes
on accumulating. The subvention paid by Government to cover RFFSA's loss is
1/   Introduced in 1968, "normalization" provides for contribution by Govern-
ment to supplement low suburban fares and compensate for the extra cost
to RFFSA of employing former Government servants receiving higher compen-
sations than if employed under Common Labor Laws.



- 6 -
paid over in monthly quotas and RFFSA's supplies and services are paid for
promptly. Fixed assets appear at historical cost which bears no relationship
to present values, but a revaluation is being prepared and should be complete
during 1971. RFFSA intends to incorporate the results of the revaluation in
the 1970 balance sheet, and in the future, to make a charge for depreciation in
the Annual Accounts on the basis of the revalued assets. There are several un-
satisfactory features in the balance sheet which are summarized in the notes to
Table 4. Among the more serious deficiencies are the uncleared balances between
headquarters and the individual railways (Table 4, Note 11). Efforts have al-
ready been made to remedy many of the defects in accounting as a result of work
done by consultants (SOFRERAIL - France). A new Plan of Accounts has been pre-
pared by the consultants and agreed upon with RFFSA officials; the new proced-
ures are to be introduced in 1971 in three Divisions and, if successful, it is
intended to extend them to the remaining Divisions in 1972. Agreement was
reached during loan negotiations on the following matters:
(a) annual balance sheet of RFFSA will in the future disclose
the full liability for outstanding loans, including for-
eign loans converted at the ruling rate of exchange;
(b) RFFSA will take all steps necessary to ensure that amounts
owing to it by Government, States and Municipalities will
be settled promptly;
(c) RFFSA will take steps to present its balance sheet in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
(d) commencing with the year 1971, fixed assets will appear in
RFFSA annual balance sheets on the basis of current values
and an annual depreciation charge will be made in the revenue
account calculated in accordance with generally accepted ac-
counting principles.
Audit
3.10      In the past, RFFSA's accounts have been audited by an Inspector of
the Ministry of Transport but the audit has not been comprehensive nor has any
auditors' report been published with the accounts. However, RFFSA has now in-
troduced an efficient and comprehensive program of internal audit and it was
agreed during negotiations that, starting with the fiscal year 1970, its ac-
counts and financial statements for each fiscal year would be audited by the
Ministry of Finance and the auditors' report would be published with the ac-
counts and furnished to the Bank. These arrangements are satisfactory.
Staff
3.11      Staff reductions in the past have resulted largely from attrition
and are summarized as follows:



-7-
Total Staff
1969                   126,196
1968                   128,268
1967                   133,384
1963                   154,001
In recent monthls, major efforts have gone into staff reclassification, and
the total number of classifications has been cut from over 800 to about 200.
This will permit easier shifting of personnel assignments and better adaptation
to current needs. However, this does not eliminate the problem of redundancy,
and the fact that RFFSA is unable to discharge a large proportion of its person-
nel remains a major obstacle to railway efficiency. RFFSA has recently completed
a detailed review of present requirements, redeployment needed and redundancies,
which indicates that, under present conditions of operations, a total strength
of 115,000 would be sufficient.  It can be expected that mechanization and im-
provement of operations would permit furtlher substantial staff reductions.
Corporate Planning
3.12      In view of the many physical and financial difficulties facing the
railways, early action is necessary to prepare RFFSA for the vital role it
should play in supporting future economic development in Brazil. To achieve
this aim with minimum delay, it was agreed in negotiations with RFFSA that a
Corporate Plan should be produced during 1971 covering all aspects of RFFSA's
activities for the years 1972-1976. The objective of the plan would be to
provide efficient and economic services to transport the growing volumes of
traffic and to eliminate current financial losses. The plan will be based
on a detailed market survey and will define action programs regarding:
(a)  improvement of the main route system together with closure
of uneconomic lines, yards and stations, reduction of ser-
vices on low density lines, and mechanization of track main-
tenance;
(b)  improvements in train operations needed to maximize use of
equipment and staff, mechanization of load transfer at term-
inals, and definition of motive power and rolling stock poli-
cies for replacement of obsolete equipment and addition to
the existing fleet required to meet traffic needs;
(c)  concentration, reorganization, and reequipment of workshops;
(d)  definition of a staff policy geared to gradual reduction of
total labor force to attain high efficiency standards; and
(e)  definition of new tariff structures.
A very rough and preliminary analysis of these items was completed by RFFSA dur-
ing 1970 to (a) identify major problem areas, (b) inventory alternative courses
of action, and (c) provide a general framework for carrying out detailed analysis
during 1971. This is discussed in some detail in Annex 4.



- 8 -
3.13      The preliminary analysis showed potential for growth in rail freight
traffic of about 10% p.a., reaching 20 billion ton-km by 1975 (Table 5).
Substantial cost savings could be attained by the action proposed, and man-
power could be reduced to about 109,000 by 1975. During the same period,
selective increases to freight rates could produce an increase of about 18%
in revenue without adverse affects on demand for rail transport. Financial
implications are shown in Tables 6 and 7. It was estimated thiat with these
improvements RFFSA could achtieve by 1975 a working surplus of NCr$ 34 million
before depreciation and interest, compared with a deficit of NCr$ 427.8 million
in 1969. Preliminary estimates of new capital requirements indicated total
expenditure, of about NCr$ 5 billion over the period 1970-1975, but this is
likely to be substantially reduced after detailed evaluation of investment
items. The analysis, altlhough tentative, is sufficient to demonstrate the
opportunity open to RFFSA to overcome present difficulties and to provide an
efficient system for traffic best suited to rail transport.
3.14      In recent years, RFFSA's planning capacity has been notably in-
sufficient. l1owever, the Planning Group, created in 1970 at the Bank's
request to undertake the preparation of a developed Corporate Plan by the
end of 1971, is now working in close coordination with RFFSA's departments
and regions. Expertise in specialized planning techniques and transporta-
tion economics has, however, been largely lacking and additional qualified
staff should be appointed or services of consultants secured.
3.15      To ensure that planning work is carried out efficiently and accord-
ing to schedule, agreement on the following matters was obtained during loan
negotiations:
(a) RFFSA to prepare by the end of 1971 a comprehiensive
Corporate Plan, satisfactory to the Bank, covering
the years 1972-1976;
(b) RFFSA to retain on a permanent basis an adequately
staffed Planning Group for the purpose of preparing
investment, operational and commercial plans; and to
appoint qualified consultants wlhere necessary.
C.   The Sao Paulo State Railways
3.16      The Sao Paulo State Railways consist of three separate railway
systems, loosely coordinated by the State Secretary for Transport. All are
in heavy deficit and are in a rundown condition. Legislation is under way
providing for their amalgamation into a single system in 1971/72. This will
offer opportunities for rationalization and will simplify the ultimate step
of merger witlh RFFSA. Table 8 shows a summary of the revenues and expendi-
tures of the State Railways for 1968/69.
3.17      At the Bank's suggestion, a major planning effort was initiated in
1970 by the Sao Paulo Railways along lines similar to those adopted by RFFSA.
As a preliminary step, each of the three State Railways has prodpced an Out-
line Plan for 1971-1975. The planning work done has been useful' to establish



- 9 -
method and to indicate the order of magnitude of essential investment needed
to overtake arrears in renewal of equipment, for which a sum of about
NCr$ 2,400 million (US$600 million equivalent) is estimated to be required.
This is probably in excess of actual economic needs for new capital. The
preliminary work has not included the preparation of a financial plan showing
forecast revenues and expenditures.
3.18      The State Railways have recently appointed a group of consultants
(Montor - Brazil and Wyer Dick - US) to carry out market research of potential
freight traffic, and intend to engage additional consultants to produce
a Five-Year Corporate Plan on lines recommended by Bank staff, to be completed
by the end of 1971. Close liaison between RFFSA and State Railways is to
ensure consistency in final plans.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   Description of the Project
General
4.01      MBR is planning to develop a large scale project for the mining and
export of high grade iron ore (IBRD Appraisal Report PI-10). Implementation
of the MBR project is based upon the development of the Aguas Claras Mine
located near Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais (Map 2). Transport
of ore from the mine to a proposed new ocean terminal at Sepetiba Bay (state
of Rio de Janeiro) is to be provided by RFFSA's 6th Division (Central) on its
main line already carrying over 8 million tons of mixed traffic per annum.
Distance from mine to port is 640 km by wide gauge track (1.6m). RFFSA's
6th Division has wide experience in ore transportation, having carried
about 6 million tons of ore in 1969.  A 15-;'~ear transport contract between
RFFSA and MBR was signed on July 20, 1970 covering the movement of a minimum
of 10 and a maximum of 15 million long tons p.a. 1/ Production of ore is
expected to commence in 1973 and build up to an annual tonnage of 12 million
in 1976 with prospects for 15 million in 1978. MBR has entered into a 15-
year contract with Japanese steel producers covering the provision of 7 mil-
lion tons p.a. Further contracts with British and Argentine buyers for a
total supply of 2 million tons have also been negotiated.
4.02      Under the terms of the contract between MBR and RFFSA, the latter
is to provide all facilities required for the movement of a minimum of 10 and
a maximum of 12 million tons of ore annually. A further extension to a maxi-
mum of 15 million tons p.a. is envisaged under the contract but MBR is re-
quired to give 18 months advance notice to RFFSA if annual tonnage is to ex-
ceed 12 million tons. The proposed project covers the provision of all
facilities required for annual shipments of 12 million tons and consists of:
1/   Unless otherwise specified, all tonnages in this chapter are expressed
in long tons.

I.   Civil Works (Map 2)
(a)  construction of a 21-km rail spur connecting the mine and
the main railway line at Ibirite (near Belo Horizonte);
(b)  construction of a 37-km cutoff line between Japeri and
Brisa Mar (Itaguai);
(c)  rehabilitation of RFFSA's main line between Ibirite and
Japeri (552 km) and of the Brisa Mar - Pta. Santo Antonio
(near Mangaratiba) branch line (27 km) and construction or
extension of rail sidings;
(d)  rehabilitation of bridges and tunnels;
(e)  construction of a new workshop at Lafaiete;
(f)  installation of signalling and telecommunication facilities.
II. Equipment
(a)  provision of 78 locomotives (2,000 hp);
(b)  provision of 1,340 ore cars (95-ton capacity) and 14
cabooses;
(c)  provision of new rail and accessories for I (a), I (b) and
I (c) preceding;
(d)  provision of workshop and rail welding equipment;
(e)  provision of signalling and telecommunication equipment
for I (f) preceding.
III. Consulting Services
Provision of consulting services for design and supervision of works.
Civil Works
4.03      RFFSA is to provide a new rail link between the mine and the main
line at Ibirite, a distance of about 21 km, through rough terrain. The route
from Ibirite to Japeri forms part of the main line of the Central Division
of RFFSA, between Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro (Map 2). The line be-
tween Ibirite and Japeri (552 km) crosses a succession of hills and river
courses. Track alignment is full of severe curves and gradients and the
speed of freight trains is limited to 40 km per hour. The section between
Japeri and Sepetiba Bay requires the construction of a new line, 37 km long,
from Japeri to Brisa Mar bypassing the Rio de Janeiro area. Finally, a stretch
of existing track of 27 km from Brisa Mar to Sepetiba Bay will complete the
route to the port causeway to be constructed by MBR.



4.04      Main line track improvements are required to sustain thie new traffic,
and bridges require strengthening at 44 locations. One tunnel, 340 meters
long, requires reconstruction, and seven others require improvement to remove
speed restrictions imposed because of limited clearance. Trackwork will con-
sist of drainage, stabilizing of earthworks, renewal with heavier rail and
sleepers, welding of rail joints, and rehallasting. RFFSA has already planned
to introduce mechanized track maintenance on the route, and the first supplies
of equipment are expected during 1971, under existing authorization.  Priority
is being given in current maintenance work to track improvements on the route.
In addition to track improvements, new sLdings, 2,000 meters long, are re-
quired to provide passing loops for the scheduled trains, and reception sidings
are required near to the mine and port.
Equipment
4.05      Rail transportation is planned to provide for unit train operations
with mechanized loading and unloading at mine and ocean terminal sites. Un-
loading at the terminal is to be performed by a rotary car dumper without
uncoupling of cars. Based on its experience in iron ore transportation,
RFFSA has decided to use 2,000-hp 6-axle diesel electric locomotives with
special ballast to provide maximum adhesion. These locomotives are of well
proven type, and experience in Brazil shows that their reliability is good.
Higher power locomotives would not provide additional tractive force but
could theoretically permit higher operating speeds. However, alignment of
the main line contains many sharp curves and heavy gradients, thus limiting
operating speed for heavy trains to 40 km/h. RFFSA's selection is therefore
considered satisfactory. Ore cars will be solid bottom gondola type with
nominal capacity of 95 metric tons. Experience in Brazil and in the US has
shown this type of car to be best suited for the transport of large volumes of
ore over long distances.
4.06      Motive power and rolling stock requirements were estimated for
various levels of annual ore shipments assuming different train formation and
scheduling. A summary of the findings is given in Table 9. On this basis,
and to minimize transport costs, it was decided to operate trains with 6
locomotives, 105 cars, and 1 caboose. Net train capacity will be 10,000 me-
tric tons. Cycle time will be based on a 72-hour round trip, including allow-
ances of 6 hours for loading and 6 hours for unloading. (A more detailed
description of train operations is contained in Annex 5.)   Greater efficien-
cy resulting in better equipment utilization is expected to be achieved as
further experience develops.
4.07      The main line between Japeri and Lafaiete has recently been resig-
nalled with modern CTC equipment and the system is now being extended through
Ibirite to Belo Horizonte, under existing authorization. Under the MBR proj-
ect, it is intended to extend the system further to cover the operation through-
out between mine and port. Comparative cost studies have shown this to
be we].1 justified. Telephone and telex communications will be available
throughout, using the RFFSA network.



- 12 -
4.08      Calculations of the capacity of the line between the mine and port,
and particularly ont the main line section between Ibirite and Japeri, indi-
cate the ability to transport up to about 35 million tons per annum, with
the siding layout proposed under this project. There is, therefore, ample
capacity for growth of MBR traffic up to 15 million tons a year, after
taking into account other forecast traffic growth to a total of about 12
million tons for the same route over the next five years. If further
capacity is required during the following ten years, it can be made avail-
able with relatively low investment by increasing the number of long passing
sidings on the route.
Consulting Services
4.09      The services of Bechtel Overseas Corporation (US) were retained by
RFFSA to assist its staff in the preparation of the project feasibility study.
The same firm was employed by MBR for feasibility studies of the mining and
port projects and will be retained again for design and supervision of con-
struction works. Detailed engineering studies for civil works on the railway
are now under way with assistance from Brazilian engineering firms. It was
agreed during negotiations that consultants acceptable to the Bank would be
appointed to assist with control of progress of the project and to ensure
coordination with work at the mine and terminal. Because of the need for
close coordination, RFFSA intends to retain the consultants employed by MBR
on the mining project.

Cost estimates for civil works are based on preliminary engineering studies.
Unit prices are based on estimates of the consulting engineers checked against
unit prices from recent contracts awarded in Brazil. Equipment and material
costs have been estimate(d by reference to recent local and internat:Lonal
awards for equipment of similar type. Allowances hiave been included for
physical contingencies on track works at 5% and on the principal civil works
at 20% whiile price contingencies on civil, works and rolling stock have been
based on assumed annual increases of 4%' and 5%, respectively (Annex 6).
Further details regarding the cost of the project and the scheduling of
expenditures are sh1own in Table 10.
4.11      The forejgn exchange component of the project was calculated on
the assumptions that (a) contracts for civil works would be placed locally
(para. 4.17)? and (b) orders for locomotives, freight cars, rails and work-
shop equipment would be placed abroad. Brazil has the capacity to produce
freight cars and part of the rails and equipment required. If all those
orders were won by Brazilian firms, the foreign exchange component would be
reduced to US$52.6 million.
4.12      Of the US$88.2 million maximum foreign exchange costs, US$29.6
million consists of diesel locomotives for which RFFSA is negotiating bi-
lateral financing of US$26.7 million (90% of the cost). Signalling and
telecommunication equipment must be of standard type and will be acquired
by direct negotiations with suppliers. The proposed Bank loan of US$46
million would cover 100% of the cost of freight cars, rail and accessories,
shop and rail welding equipment and the foreign exchange costs of consulting
services (para. 4.09). Apart from locomotives, the loan would therefore
finance all equipment items in the project lending themselves to international
competitive bidding.
4.13      Local suppliers are expected to participate in the bidding and have
15% margin of preference or the amount of the relative import tariff, if
lower (para. 4.17). Nevertheless it is recommended that the same formula of
financing should apply whether contracts are won by foreign or Brazilian firms.
Local firms appear likely to win many of the contracts; should they win all
contracts for those items that can be produced in Brazil, the Bank loan would
cover about US$35.6 million of local currency expenditures as shown below:

4.14      RFFSA will be unable to provide from earnings any financing for
investment, and the portion not covered by loans from IBRD and the bilateral
financing for locomotives will have to be provided from Government sources
as a capital grant to RFFSA. This is about 45% of total project costs. As-
surance has been obtained that Government will make arrangements for all
necessary funds to be made available to RFFSA, including the financing of
any cost overruns; to enable RFFSA to carry out the project. The US Export-
Import Bank has already indicated its willingness to finance the acquisition
of locomotives for the project. It will be a condition of loan effectiveness
that the Borrower obtain a commitment, the terms and conditions of which are
satisfactory to the Bank, for financing the acquisition of 78 locomotives.
C.   Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
4.15      Execution of the project will be the responsibility of RFFSA.  Con-
sultants will be retained to assist RFFSA in construction supervision and
overall control of progress of work (para. 4.09). Agreement has been reached
between RFFSA and MBR that a high level project management group consisting
of representatives of both parties is to be established to coordinate con-
struction of rail with the mine and port works and procurement of equipment.
4.16      The loan will be to RFFSA with a guarantee from the Federal Govern-
ment.
4.17      All goods to be financed under the proposed loan will be acquired
through international competitive bidding. Brazilian manufacturers are
likely to participate in bidding for the freight cars and part of the track
materials and workshop equipment. Foreign and domestic bLds will be com-
pared by adding to the foreign c.i.f. prices the relative import duties or
15%, whichever is the lower. Civil works contracts, none of which is fi-
nanced under the proposed loan, will be open to bidding only by Brazilian
contractors, of whom there are a sufficient number with the experience neces-
sary to offer significant competition. Several bids for locomotives have
been invited from international suppliers.
4.18      Bids for freight cars and cabooses will be invited for a firm order
for 1,230 cars and 13 cabooses - which is sufficient for the transport of 10
million long tons p.a. - and for an option valid 18 months for an extra 110
cars and 1 caboose (estimated total cost US$2.2 million equivalent) required
for the transport of an additional 2 million tons p.a. If, as is now expected,
further iron ore sales contracts are signed requiring transport capacity of
12 million tons p.a., RFFSA will exercise its option. Otherwise it will be
cancelled. Similar provision will be made in the contract for the purchase
of locomotives. Foreign manufacturers will be allowed to import ore cars in
"knocked down" condition and assemble them in Brazil.
4.19      Iron ore rail shipments are to start 30 months after financing
arrangements are secured. All essential works and equipment acquisition will
he completed by that date. Ilowever, some track rehabilitation works not
required before starting of transport operations will continue well into
1974. A bar chart showing expected work progress is shown as Chart 1.

4.20      Disbursements under the proposed loan would cover c.i.f. cost of
equipment of foreign origin, or cost of equipment acquired from local sup-
pliers as a result of international competitive bidding. No disbursements
would be made for expenditure incurred prior to loan signature except for
engineering services of Bechtel Overseas Corporation at actual foreign ex-
change costs of about US$100,000 (para. 4.09). Any amounts not disbursed
would be cancelled from the loan. Estimated schedule of disbursements is
given in Table 11.
D. Revenue and Expenditures
4.21      Table 12 shows the forecast railway revenue and expenditure from
the transportation of 12 million tons p.a. of MBR iron ore throughout the
period 1973 to 1988 and a statement of cash generation and debt service
payments. Operating costs are the incremental costs of carrying the MBR
traffic, taking into account the conditions which would be applicable to
the MbK operation (Annex 7). Forecast revenue is calculated according to
the formula appearing in the contract with MBR (Table 14) and is based on
an iron ore price of US$8.10 per long ton. When annual transportation of
ore reaches 12 million tons in 1976, the annual financial return to RFFSA
on the new investment directly assigned to the MBR operation is 8.9%. The
internal rates of return over the whole period for a buildup to 10, 12 or 15
million tons are 11.1%, 11.3% and 11.8%, respectively. With a buildup to
12 million tons, cash generation during the first ten years of operation
is sufficient to cover debt service 1.7 times, rising to 3 times coverage
for the last four years. The net cash generation to RFFSA over the whole
period, after meeting all debt service, is forecast at NCr$ 474 million,
equivalent to US$117 million. Corresponding figures showing satisfactory
operating results, cash generation and debt service coverage for annual
transport of 10 million tons are shown in Table 13.
4.22      Depreciation of investment costs has been calculated by reference
to the useful life of each class of investment. Part of the total project
costs of NCr$ 541 million relate to improvements to the main line and branch
line which are recoverable from other traffic. The investment cost assigned
to MBR traffic has been estimnated at NCr$ 460 million and it is this figure
which has been used for the purpose of calculating depreciation and rates of
return applicable to the MBR project.
4.23      The basic tonnage to be transported is a minimum of 10 million tons
and a maximum of 12 million tons per annum. However, there is provision for
an increase in the basic tonnage subject to a provision that RFFSA reserves
the right to refuse an increase which would bring the total to more than
15 million tons a year if it is able to show the technical or economic non-
feasibility of the additional transport requested. These safeguards are
satisfactory as they permit RFFSA to expand its operations on more profit-
able freight traffic if this should be possible. During negotiations, it
vas agreed that rail rates for tonnages in excess of 15 million tons will be
a-reed with the Bank. The freight formula has been tested to judge the ef-
fect on RFFSA's finances at various traffic levels; the results in US dollar
equivalents are as follows:

Internal Rate of Return %                11.1        11.3       11.8
The investment cost at the 12 and 15 million ton level of operation is based
on the initial train operating pattern but, in practice, it is expected that
improvements in operations after reaching 12 million tons should permit the
transportation of increased tonnages with a less than proportionate investment
in locomotives and rolling stock.
4.24      Since MBR is committed to pay, subject to force inajeure exceptions,
for the transportation of at least 9 million tons of ore (para. 4.26), the
establishment of a break-even level of traffic should not be of great im-
portance but it has been calculated that, at 5 million tons a year, net cash
generation would still be sufficient to meet debt service payments. At pres-
ent price levels, and for the volumies of transport envisaged under the con-
tract, the MBR operation would therefore provide RFFSA with a satisfactory
return on its investments.
E. Contract with MBR
4.25      The transport contract between RFFSA and I1BR was signed on July 4,
1970; it was generally satisfactory to the Bank with the exception of the two
issues discussed below, which were resolved during negotiations.
Force Majeure
4.26      The contract between MBR and the railway provides for annual ship-
ments of 10-12 million tons with an effective contractual commitment of a
minimum of 9 million tons of ore and, unless excused by a force majeure event,
failure to ship would result in the defaulting party having to indemnify the
other for the losses arising from such shortage as stated in clause XI (3 h)
of the contract. Loss is not definedl in the contract but interpretation of



- 18 -
relevant local legislation indicates that it would include loss of profits.
Satisfactory protection to the railways would therefore be provided save for
events of force majeure.
4.27      Clause XI of the contract between MBR and RFFSA, after defining
specific circumstances which are to be considered as "Force Majeure", in-
cludes the following general statement as a tailpiece:
"any other facts, whether unforeseeable or unavoidable,
beyond the control of the contracting parties, which
may prevent or delay, either totally or partially, the
compliance with the obligations provided herein."
4.28      Brazilian legal advice indicates that a depression in the iron ore
market resulting in a slowdown or complete stoppage of iron ore shipments
could be interpreted as force majeure for the purpose of the rail contract.
Following loan negotiations, MBR has confirmed to RFFSA that normal business
risks such as market conditions will not be interpreted as force majeure.
4.29      The confirmation referred to above has the effect of making the
contractual obligation to ship 9 million tons (para. 4.26) a form of "Take
or Pay" clause.
Freight Rate
4.30      The freight rate formula included in the contract (Table 14) fixes
freight charges on the basis of annual tonnage shipped by rail and the f.o.b.
price of iron ore. The influence of variations in the price of iron ore is
minor, e.g., the freight rate rises by only US cents 5 for each US$1.00 in-
crease of the iron ore price at the 10 million ton level of annual shipment.
Variations with the tonnage are more significant with a range from US$3.14
per ton at the level of 6 million tons per annunm to US$2.45 per ton when
annual shipments reach 12 million tons.
4.31      A special feature of the contract, however, is that while the rail
frelghL' Is paid in (riuzei ros, tLhe rate per ton is fixed in dollar terms for
the wlhole contractual period of 15 years.  It ils the policy of the Bra.i-Ian

F. Economic Evaluation
4.33      A detailed analysis of the economic benefits of the MBR project
(mining, rail and port components) is given in IBRD Appraisal Report PI-10.
It covers the split of net project benefits betvc'en Government, Brazilian
shareholders and beneficiaries outside of Brazil and aives an estimate of
the economic return of combined project and net benefits to Brazilian rail-
ways. The internal economic return of the combined mining and rallway
project is estimated at 20% based on a sales buildup to 12 mIllion tons.
G. Environmental Considerations
4.34      A Bank mission inspected the mining and associated railway project
from the point of view of the potential effect upon the environment and human
health and wellbeing. Problems concerning thie railway project were brought
to light, including noise pollution, pedestrian and vehicular safety along
the right-of-way, soil erosion in new cuts and fills, ore dust control and
the relocation of some people (estimated at about 100). The measures neces-
sary to alleviate and/or mitigate these effects are technically feasible.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that RFFSA will take measures
satisfactory to the Bank to see that the potential adverse environmental and
social consequences of the project are minimized or, where possible, pre-
vented.
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMtENDATION
5.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached with the named
parties (Brazilian Government, RFFSA or MBR) on the following principal
points:
(a) RFFSA to prepare, by the end of 1971, a comprehensive Corpo-
rate Plan, satisfactory to the Bank, covering the years 1972-
1976 (para. 3.15);
(b)  RFFSA to retain consultants jointly with MR, satisfactory
to the IBank, to ensure coordination of the rail project with
work at mine and port and to assist RFFSA in control of en-
gineering work to ensure compliance with the plans for the
project (para. 4.09);
(c) the Brazilian Government to arrange for all necessary funds
to be made available to RFFSA and take all other actions neces-
sary, including the financing of cost overruns, to enable RFFSA
to carry out the project (para. 4.14);



- 20 -
(d)  RFFSA and MBR to establish a high level, project management
group consisting of representatives of MIIR an(d RFFSA, to co-
ordinate construction of rail with the mine and port works and
procurement of equipment (para. 4.15);
(e)  RFFSA and MIIPR to miake an aninnlitl automatic ad justment of the freigult
rate by reference to the US wlholesale price index subject to cer-
tain limits (para. 4.32);
(f) RFFSA to ensure that the potential adverse environmental conse-
quences Ahd human factors of the project are minimited or, where
possible, prevented (para. 4.34).
5.02      As a condition of effectiveness of the Loan, the MAX Loan Agreement
for financing the mining project will be signed and all condit^ions to the ef-
fectiveness of that Loan Agreement must be fulfilled. As a further condition
of effectiveness, the Borrower will obtain a commitment, the terms and condi-
tions of which are satisfactory to the Bank, for the financing of the acquisi-
tion of 78 locomotives by the Borrower (para. 4.14).
5.03      The MBR project provides a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of US$46
million. The appropriate terms would be 18 years, including a four-year pe-
riod of grace.

NOTES TO TABLE 4
Sheet 1
Unsatisfactory Features in RFFSA Balance Sheet, 1969
1.        Fixed assets include so-called Works in Progress NCr$ 457 million.
Completed works should be cleared more promptly.
2.        No classification of fixed assets is shown, e.g., Permanent Way,
Locomotives and Rolling Stock, Plant and Machinery, etc.
3.        The value attached to fixed assets is merely the historical cost
in cruzeiros of the years when acquired.
4.        Included in debtors is an item (A/C 5.030) for NCr$ 7 million,
called Diversos Responsaveis. It is said this represents advances to
employees for purchases of equipment with the object of avoiding the calling
of tenders, or to get work done without going to tender. It also includes
discrepancies in cash balances of cashiers, station masters, etc., pending
recovery.
5.         Included in debtors is an item (A/C 5.035) for NCr$ 8 million:
Depositos EsDeciais e Caucoes. It reDresents deposits pending settlement
of disputes but is in effect expense which has to be written off eventually.
6.        Debtors include:                        NCr$ million
Federal Government                          45.4
Federal Agencies                             5.2
States and Municipalities                    7.9
58.5
These accounts are not paid promptly. Government pays only rail charges,
other charges in the account just accumulate.
7.        Account 5.062:  Loss on winding up abandoned lines NCrS 1.5
million; should be written off to Capital account.
8.        Account 5.065:  Interest in Suspense NCr$ 59.5 million.  This
is shown in suspense as instructions have not been given for disposal. A
good deal of this usually gets charged "below the line" in the Revenue
account as 'Exoenditure related to earlier years". Comment: Interest
charges of each year should be correctly shown as an item of expense in
the year of accrual.
9.         In the published balance sheet is an item (A/C 5.068) described as
Valores Diferidos e Amortizaveis Diversos, NCr$ 166.9 million. Most of this
represents exchange adjustments to fixed asset values. In the reconstructed
balance sheet it has been added to fixed assets. Comment: This account
should be cleared promptly each year.



NOTES TO TABLE 4
Sheet 2
10.       RFFSA balance sheet includes A/C 5.079 NCr$ 1.1 million representing
assets awaiting authority for write-off. Comment: This account should
be cleared promptly.
11.       RFFSA balance sheet includes the following;
NCr$ million
Accounts of Associated and   DEBITS           1,064.2
Affiliated Companies           CREDITS          889.4
NET          174.8
Comment: The perpetuation of these balances is quite unacceptable. If, as
is likely, precise clearance is not possible, drastic action must be taken to
ensure that all current accounts between railways and between headquarters
and railways are reconciled and cleared promptly before closure of annual
accounts.
12.       A/C No. 5.113 records Responsibilidades Especiais Diversas NCr$
224.1 million and represents loan payments and interest already made by
Government through Banco do Brasil. It really represents an addition to
Government capital and should be so treated.
13.       A/C No. 5.129 represents the liability for domestic and foreign
loans. The amount shown in the published balance sheet does not properly
reflect the full liability in NCr$ at the current exchange rate but the
reconstructed balance sheet has been adjusted. The balance sheet should
distinguish between (a) foreign and (b) domestic loans and should indicate
the amounts covered by Government guarantees.
14.       Accounts 5.159 and 5.079 record the transfer of assets between
railways. Comment: There appears to be no sound reason for such items to
be uncleared.
15.       A/C 5.160 records a provision for contingencies which is created
by only one railway. Comment: A common policy should be adopted for the
entire system.
16.       The accounts are not audited.
General. Many of the problems referred to above could be solved if more time
were allowed for preparation of final accounts and if prompt decisions could
be given in order to avoid suspense items.

1.  Consolidation of Federal and State systems.                                                     A plan for integration of operations has been prepared.  Subject to
discusion of minor points agreement on implementation should be con-
eluded by end of 1970. Plans are at an advanced stage for merger of
Sao Paolo Railways into one organization with common administration and
operation procedures. These censures are more important than the formal
merger of the Federal and State oystens which for political and financial
reaso  will take some years to achienv.

ANNEX 4

BRAZIL - RFFSA
Preliminary Outline of Corporate Plan
Market Survey
1.        RFFSA has carried out a preliminary market survey in each division,
largely confined to bulk materials, which indicates a potential freight traf-
fic by rail of 25.2 billion ton-km by 1975, without taking into account MBR
iron ore traffics (Table 5). This compares with a total traffic of 11.3 bil-
lion ton-km actually carried in 1969, and represents an increase of about 15%
per annum which could not likely be accommodated by RFFSA. This has been ad-
justed by Bank staff in the light of past traffic growth records to reach 20
billion ton-km by 1975, i.e., at an annua-l rate of increase of 10%. This
should be regarded as a maximum feasible growth target. During 1971, RFFSA
will carry out a more detailed survey, which will include personal interviews
with shippers. In addition to refining present forecasts for bulk traffics,
attention will be given to attracting new traffics, including manufactured
products, where specialized services can be offered by the use of containers
and other packaging and handling arrangements. Consulting services will be
used to supplement railway staff as required.
2.        No specific market research has been undertaken covering passenger
traffics, but it is safe to assume that present trends of declining long dis-
tance traffic will continue, and that suburban services traffic will grow at
a steady rate for the next five years, governed by the capacity of service
that RFFSA provides.
Route System
3.        Out of a total of about 25,000 km of railway routes, 10,000 km had,
in 1969, a traffic density of less than 200,000 ton-km per km. This indi-
cates the scope for possible closure or rationalization of uneconomic lines.
Already traffic has been suspended on 4,952 km and RFFSA is continuing with
a program of rationalization of services covering a further 2,345 km. A
rough assessment suggests that line closure and rationalization would enable
RFFSA to dispense with about 10,000 staff.
4.        At present, the condition of track is generally poor throughout
the RFFSA system and in some areas is the cause of frequent derailments.
Lack of funds has restricted maintenance and renewal works. On routes where
market research indicates increasing traffic density, improvement in track
will be necessary to overtake arrears of maintenance and to provide for in-
creased speeds, heavier loads, and greater line capacity. Welding of rail
joints and mechanized maintenance will be introduced to improve track qual-
ity and reduce maintenance costs. Equipment for mechanized track maintenance
has been ordered for delivery in mid-1971 to cover the central division main
line (600 km). This line is to receive heavy iron ore traffics generated by
the MBR project (Chapter 4) and will serve as a pilot scheme for extension to



ANNEX 4
Page 2
important routes throughout the system. A second lot of equipment is sched-
uled for delivery in 1973, which will enable all routes carrying heavy traf-
fic to be covered. Estimates in saving of manpower engaged on track main-
tenance indicate that at least 11,000 men can be laid off by 1975 by mechan-
ization, rail welding and systematic track renewal.
Methods of Operation and Equipment Requirements
5.        Operating performance in RFFSA varies widely between the 13 Divi-
sions according to the nature and volume of traffic and the shape of the
route network, and there is large scope for improvement in the productive
use of locomotives and rolling stock.
(a) Locomotives
RFFSA possesses 1,689 locomotives, of which 1,051 are diesels, 553
steam and 85 electric. Average availability for service and distances run
in traffic is:
Average range of km in traffic
Availability              in divisions x 1,000
Diesel                   83%                      45 to 105
Steam                    70%                      11 to 75
Electric                 78%                      44 to 84
RFFSA already has plans for the elimination of steam traction, and
of 190 obsolete diesel locomotives whose maintenance is difficult and costly.
These plans will be satisfied in part from 180 diesel locomotives already on
order. Planned performance will set targets for improved maintenance to al-
low for 90% availability of locomotives in traffic, and for substantial in-
creases in kilometrage in traffic by improved timing of freight and passenger
services and scheduling of locomotives. The productivity of locomotives will
be increased by the operation of longer trains, including unit train operation
where possible. By these means, it is estimated that an increase of at least
50% in freight tonnage carried can be handled with an additional 200 diesel
locomotives after steam and other obsolete locomotives have been replaced.
(b) Wagons
The present total of the fleet of wagons is about 35,000 of all
types. About 2,000 of these are obsolete and require early replacement.
Average availability of the fleet is 91%. Wagon turn-around between loaded
journeys varies in divisions from 5 to 13 days. Wagon loading in many ser-
vices is less than half capacity. Planning for improving the productivity
of the wagon fleet will include:
(1) improvement in maintenance to attain availability of 95%;
(2) mechanization of loading and unloading; faster turn-around
at terminals;



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(3) full loading of wagons;
(4) reduction of delays by eliminating unnecessary marshalling
of trains;
(5) control of wagon distribution.
By these means, it has been assessed that after replacement or modernization
of obsolete wagons, an increase in the fleet by about 2,700 new wagons will
suffice to carry an increase in tonnage of at least 50%.
(c) Passenger Cars
Passenger cars of all types, including commuter services, number
about 4,000, of which a large number are aging and require replacement. Pre-
sent availability in service is 85%. Planning will anticipate a fall in de-
mand for lon, distance services, and a reduction in the total fleet is fore-
seen.  A small renewal program will be required, together with some addition-
al stock for suburban services, not yet assessedT.
Workshops
6.        RFFS. o7ns 56 main workslhops for locomotives and rolling stock.
In addition, there are 57 minor maintenance shops.  The total number of work-
shops staff employed is 22,000, including staff engaged at outlying service
and inspection points. RFFSA has prepared a preliminary plan to consolidate
and reorganize the workshops, and as a first stage intends to reduce the num-
bers to:
Main workshops: 26
Mlinor workshops: 36
Further concentration will follow as a second stage. Workshops to be re-
tained permanently will be re-equipped with modern machine tools. The first
stage will provide for a reduction in staff of about 4,000 men, and further
large reductions will follow.
Manpower Requirements
7.        A rougli computation has been made of the reductions in personnel
that would be made possible by the execution of the plan described. The re-
sult is:
- Mechanization of track maintenanc  and rail welding          11,000
- Consolidation of workshops (first stage)                     4,000
- Operating staff, due to line and station closures,
mechanization of loading and unloading                     10,000
25,000



ANNEX 4
Page 4
The total staff in 1969 was 126,000. The staff required by RFFSA at the com-
pletion of the planned modernizatioui and rationalization could therefore be
about 101,000, requiring, a redtuction running at about 4% per annum. However,
in view of the many difficullties ltl;ely to occur in staff reduction of this
order, it lhas been assumed in the prelinminary analysis that tlhe total staff
in 1975 will be 109,000, a reduction of 17,00).
Tariffs and Costs
8.       'Tle present freight classification contains approximately 230 itemiis
which are grouped inito five classes and itncludle all comiilo(lities except live-
stock.  Tle classification follows a general ad valorem pattern.  In addition,
there are special scales for main bulk commodities suclh as iron ore, cement
and gypsum, wlhichi taper off more rapidly with distance than regular tariffs.
Finally, special rebates are granted after direct negotiations with shippe2s,
conducted either by the divisions (maximum rebate allowed is then 20%) or by
headquarters. Special tariffs and rebates are used widely and only about 30%
of total traffic is transported at regular tariffs. Passenger fares for in-
tercity journeys vary with the kilometrage while suburban fares are fixed for
each metropolitan area and not by the actual length of journey. RFFSA is re-
sponsible for preparing new official tariff schedules, but these must receive
DNEF approval prior to introduction. Rebates are granted directly by RFFSA
and only notification to DNEF is required.
9.        Average receipt per ton-km of freight traffic on RFFSA in 1969 was
NCr cents 2.91, equivalent to US cents 1.05 per US ton-mile which is low
compared with other railways; (e.g., Argentina, 1968, at US cents 1.40).
The passenger receipts per pass-km are also very low. For 1969 the equival-
ents in US cents per passenger mile were:
US Cents
Interior                    0.650
Suburban                    O.304
which compares with:
Argentina (1968)            0.85
10.       A team of consultants (SOFRERAIL - France) has given assistance to
the railways for the costing of rail services and analysis of the present
tariff structure. A costing section has now been established within RFFSA
to pursue the work of the consultants. Three types of costs have been de-
termined: total, incremental and direct costs. These costs have been pre-
pared for iron ore (on the Central Division), freight other than iron ore,
passenger, suburban and intercity (averages for each Division). This anal-
ysis shows that there are great variations among Divisions, with increment-
al costs ranging from NCr cents 0.124 per ton-km (US cents 4.5 per US ton-
mile) for the Northeast Division (3rd Division) to NCr cents 0.030 (US cents
1.1 per US ton-mile) for the Central Division (6th Division). RFFSA is
continuing work to refine present estimates and determine costs for various
categories of commodities.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
11.       A comparison was made of official tariff schedules, average actual
1969 receipts per commodity and per division, and costs. The main conclu-
sions are as follows:
- official tariffs generally cover total costs;
- special tariffs (for bulk traffics) cover total costs for
relative short hauls but often drop below total costs for
longer hauls, although they always remain above increment-
al costs; and
- with the possible exceptions of the Santos a Jundiai Divi-
sion, actual receipts per ton-km resulting from the appli-
cation of rebates vary at random with commodities, dis-
tances and divisions.
Fares for suburban passengers (including normalization) more than cover total
costs while intercity passengers' fares cover only about 20% of total costs.
12.       Restructuring of RFFSA's rate and fare structure and raising of
average yield per traffic unit should be carried out without delay. In view
of the significant element of fixed costs in total railway costs, it is es-
sential that the former be spread over as large a volume of traffic as pos-
sible. When a full cost-based tariff cannot be applied, the recovery of any-
thing more than the incremental costs is therefore better than not carrying
the traffic. Incremental costs should be adopted as the general basis for
minimum prices, the margin by which actual tariffs exceed incremental costs
being determined by the railways' competitive position vis-a-vis other modes.
On the basis of the evidence now available, it appears that the following
targets could be attained in the next five years:
- selective increases to freight rates could be applied which
would produce by 1975 an 18% increase in freight revenues
without adversely affecting demand for freight transport by
rail;
- a 21% increase spread over five years could be applied to
intercity passenger fares; and
- suburban passenger fares should be kept at their present
levels.
Financial Implications
13.       Financial implications of the above measures have been estimated
and the results are summarized in Table 6. This shows the forecast revenue,
expenditure, results from operations and the volume of traffic during the
years to 1975, by which time the deficit would be reduced to NCr$ 143.8 mil-
lion. In making the forecasts of revenue and expenditure, there have been
taken into account:



ANNEX 4
Page 6
- an annual increase of 10% in the volume of freight traffic in
the years 1971-1975;
- a decrease in non-suburban passenger traffic of 12% over the
period 1971-1975;
- an increase of about 4% in suburban traffic over the period
1971-1975;
14.       The Outline Financial Plan, Table 7, shows the benefits which would
accrue to RFFSA from proposed tariff increases and the financial results of
the MBR operation (which is discussed in Chapter 4). It is estimated that
with these improvements RFFSA could achieve a working surplus of NCr$ 34 mil-
lion by 1975, before charging depreciation and loan interest.
15.       Table 7 makes provision for depreciation from 1971 onward at 12% of
gross revenue. This has been included purely as an interim measure. A reval-
uation of RFFSA's assets is to be finalized by the end of 1970 and it is
RFFSA's intention to keep the figures up to date on a permanent basis, making
annual adjustments for any fall in Brazilian currency values. Such annual re-
valuations would have to be approved by Government. The mission was informed
that the revaluation now being prepared will distinguish between depreciable
and non-depreciable assets and that from 1971 RFFSA intends to charge depre-
ciation in its accounts by reference to the useful lives of the depreciable
assets.
16.       Table 7 continues with a statement showing estimated capital spend-
ing and debt service payments for the years 1970-1975. Because the work of
the Planning Group started only in recent months, the program of capital in-
vestment is at this stage a preliminary estimate of requirements. A more re-
fined investment program and supporting action plans are to be prepared by
the end of 1971 and it is intended to revise the forward Five-Year Plan an-
nually on a continuing basis. The preliminary capital investment program is
summarized below:

MBR Train Operations
The 6th Division's major terminal at Lafaiete, located at km 460
on the line, will be the starting point of the MBR iron ore unit trains.
Empty trains returning from Sepetiba Terminal will be inspected, serviced
and dispatched to meet the loading schedules of the Aguas Claras Mine.
The run northward from Lafaiete to Aguas Claras (km 635) will be
via the "Paraopeba Line" 154 km to Ibirite, then up the new Aguas Claras
Spur, 21 km in length.
After being loaded on the "loop" at Aguas Claras, the trains will
return through Ibirite to Lafaiete. Upon leaving the mine site, the loaded
cars will be weighed in motion over a track scale system constructed by MBR.
The stop at Lafaiete will be only long enough to change crews, con-
duct a "rolling" train inspection and "top off" fuel tanks. The loaded
trains, designated Ks-102, Ks-202, Ks-302, etc., will proceed south on the
main line to Santos Dumont (km 324), 136 km from Lafaiete, where crews will
be changed.
At Barra do Pirai (km 108) another rolling train inspection will
be made, after which the train will be headed-in on a new siding to be con-
structed at about km 105.  Crews will be changed again, helper locomotive
units added, and the train prepared for the ascent of 18 km to Humberto An-
tunes followed by a 28-km descent to Japeri (km 62).
Helper locomotives will assist in ascending 1.8% grade, to the sum-
mit at Humberto Antunes. During the descent from Hlumberto Antunes to Japeri,
the dynamic brakes of the helpers will assist in retarding the train.
From Japeri, the trains will use the new 35-km Japeri-Brisa Mar Cut-
off. This newly constructed line not only saves 53 km over a route via Japeri-
Deodoro-Santa Cruz-Brisa Mar, but also avoids adding to the congestion of the
commuter traffic on the Japeri-Deodoro-Rio main line and on the Santa Cruz-
Deodoro-Rio suburban line.
At Brisa Mar the trains will enter the Mangaratiba Branch (MB-70)
for movement to Ponta Santo Antonio (MB-97), 27 km, where they will proceed
across MBR's trestle to the Sepetiba Terminal.
