FOR. AN IRON ORE MINING AND RORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
loans. both to be guaranteed by the Federative Republic of Brazil to:
^   (a)  IiWneracoes Brasileiras Reunidas, S.A. (MBR) for the equivalent
of US$50 million for a term of l5 years including 3 years of
grace with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum, and
(b)  Rede Ferroviaria Federal, S.A. (RFFS0) for the equivalent of
US$46 million for a term of 18 years including 4 years of grace
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annun.
PART I - DITRODUCTION
2.        Brazil has so far received US13958-3 million in loans from the
Bank, net of cancellations.  If the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed loans, Brazil will become the Bank's largest borrower. The un-
disbursed balance of effective loans at the end of May 1971 was US$385-9
million. These amounts reflect the significant increase in Bank lending
in Brazil from US$74.9 million in FY69 to US$205 million in 1970 and
US$16004 million in 1971.  The status of previous loans to Brazil is
summarized in Annex I.
3.        Two-thirds of the Bank's lending for Brazil has been for poaer.
Since 1968, however, there has been a marked shift in the sector dis-
tribution of Bank loans. Less than 40 percent of Bank lending since
FY68 has been for power and about 34 percent for transportation. In
this period, loans were approved for agriculture, industry, education
and water supply and pollution control, sectors in which the Bank had
not lent before.
4.        In financing projects in recent years and in selecting sectors
and projects for financing, the Bank has been concerned, not simply with
finding suitable vehicles for resource transfer, but also with iden-
tifying areas where Bank assistance would be particularly productive in
promoting institution building and in supporting policies and actions of
public and private agencies which would encourage Brazil's economic
growth.



5.        In power Bank lending has been crucial to new investment,
particularly in the Center-South of Brazil, helping to finance the
installation of over 6,000 FIVI of generation capacity and complementary
transmission and distribution facilities. Furthermore, partly as a
result of Bank association with the power sector, the utilities in
Brazil have developed a sound tariff structure which enables them to
earn a reasonable return on their investments and to generate a sub-
stantial part of their investment requirements.
6.        The Bankts association with transportation started in 1965
with the Transport Survey, financed by the Bank, the UNDP and the USAID
and supervised by the Bank. The Survey pointed to the need for sub-
stantial new investments in all modes of transportation and for najor
institutional and financial reforms. The Government is implementing the
recommendations of the Transport Survey in railways, highways and ports.
Bank lending for transportation has been in support of high priority
investments and the reorganization and reform being undertaken by the
Government.
7.        Although relatively limited in scale, especially by comparison
with support provided for transport and power, Bank lending for industry,
agriculture, water supply and pollution control and education in Brazil
has been significant and should be regarded as a prelude to additional
support in these sectors. The Bank has lent for an industrial credit
project in the Northeast in suppor  o   ne   venment1s effort to
encourage-pFoducti on and provide employment in this-underdeveloped
region9 ani ior an aluminum plant to exploit BrazilIs bauxite resources.
aii dgriCUlture, the only loan so far is for livestock production in the
Center-South of Brazil. Loans for technical education, water supply and
pollution control were signed recently.
8.        In general, execution of Bank-financed projects in Brazil has
been satisfactory, but has varied from sector to sector. Disbursements
have been rising. Disbursements in FY69 were US$28 million, equivalent
to about 11 percent of the undisbursed balance of effective loans at
the beginning of the year, whereas in FY71 they were US$75 million or
about 30 percent. In electric power, where the utilities are well-
established and well-managed, the execution of projects is excellent,
despite some initial delays in those financed in 1965 and 1966. Bank
financing in recent years has been largely for hydroelectric projects
and associated transmission lines and it is in the nature of these
operations that disbursements are slow and bunched towards the end of
the disbursement period. The experience in transportation has been
satisfactory, although there have been minor delays in the first and
the second Bank highway projects. In agriculture, the experience has
been less than satisfactory. The Livestock Project which involves long-
term lending based on farm development plans is a completely new concept
in Brazil and has required considerable training of personnel, the
establishment of new institutions and education of farmers. In the
last year there has been an improvement in the execution of this project.

9.       The institutional reforms and investment progranming which the
Government is undertaking in various sectors of the economy are designed,
among other things, to improve the formulation and execution of projects
and it is hoped that in the traditional sectors of Bank lending as well
as in new areas there will be steady improvement.
10.      The project sponsors, the CAEMI Group of Brazil and Hanna Mining
Company of the U.S.A., first approached the Bank for financing in 1965,
and numerous discussions took place over the next four years as the proj-
ect concept; evolved.  Appraisal by the Bank could not begin, however,
until early 1970, when I4BR reached agreement with RFFSA on a rail freight
contract and signed a long-term ore sales contract with Japanese buyers.
The MBR Project was appraised by missions which visited Brazil in June,
October-Novemoer, 1970 and in January, 19710 The Railway Project was
appraised by a mission wnich visited Brazil in October-November, 1970.
Negotiations for the M4BR Project took place April 12 - June 4, 1971. IIBR
was represented by Dr. Arnaldo Blank, its President, Mr. Jack W. Buford,
a Senior Vice-President of Hanna Mining Company and Mr. James Courtney,
a partner of the law firm Jones, Day, Cockley and Reavis.   RFFSA was
represented by General Antonio Adolfo Manta, President of RFFSA and Dr.
Pedro Rocha Santos, Director of RFFSA. The Guarantor was represented in
both negotiations by Dr. Jayme Alipio de Barros, Attorney General of the
Ministry of Finance.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
11.      Since 1964 Brazil has been ruled by a leadership drawn from the
Armed Forces, although periodically elections have been held for the
National Congress and State legislatures. The Governments of Plaishalls
Castello Branco and Costa e Silva and General Medici have depended on
support of the Armed Forces, but have entrusted economic leadership to
well-trained and higldy qualified civilians, whose main objectives have
been to ensure the growth of the Brazilian economy, the improvement of
the balance of payments and to a lesser extent the control of inflation.
12.      Although there has been considerable progress towards these
objectives, major problems await solution. Some of the most serious of
these problems, such as unemployment, uneven income distribution, and
differences in the prosperity and growth of different regions, can
be resolved only if there is rapid economic growth. The Government, has
in fact, taken specific measures to improve income distribution and
alleviate regional disparities including, inter agia social security
reform, housing and urban development programs, a massive adult literacy
campaign and other educational efforts and tax sharing and fiscal mea-
sures to transfer resources from the richer to the poorer regions of
the country.
13.      Prospects are that Brazil will continue to be guided, for some
time to ccme, by the Armed Forces with the assistance of carefully
selected civilians in the economic and social matters, and that both



- 4 -
military and civilian members of the Government will place major emphasis
on the resolution of domestic economic and social problems.
14.       An economic report on Brazil (WIi-203a) dated January 22, 1971
has been distributed (R71-39).  A summary of recent economic developments
based, among other things, on some preliminary estimates of economic
trends in 1970 was included in my report and recommendation on the Sao
Paulo Water Supply and Pollution Control Project (P-927), dated May 6, 1971.
A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex II.
15.       An economic mission has just returned from Brazil and is prepa-
ring its report.  The following is a brief surnary of recent economic devel-
opments and prospects of the Brazilian econornyJ, based on the mission's
findings.
16.       For three years in succession, 1968, 1969 and 1970, domestic
product has maintained a rapid growth, averaging 9 percent during these
years. The growth has been led, as in the past, by a rapid increase in
industrial production. Agricultural production increased on the average
by about 4.5 percent per annum, permitting higher per capita consumption
and an increase in agricultural exports. The growth of employment has
been more rapid than that of the labor force.  Brazil appears to have
resumed the rapid growth characteristics of the 1955-62 period although
it is now more outward looking.
17.       Concurrently with the rapid growth in production and employment,
the Govermnent has tried to increase and diversify exports. Merchandise
exports, wlich stood at about US$1.9 billion in 1968, increased to about
US$2.7 billion in 1970. Furthermore, despite the windfall from higher
coffee prices in 1969 and 1970, the share of agricultural products in
exports declined from 70 percent in 1968 to about 63 percent in 1970.
Export promotion policies, such as the flexible exchange rate and tax
subsidies for manufactured exports, and exploitation of rich natural
resources, such as iron ore, have led to a significant diversification
of exports. Between 1968 and 1970 exports of iron ore and manganese
increased from US$130 million to US$240 million. Exports of manufactures
increased from US$130 million to US$330 million. Brazil's manufactured
exports range from sports cars to special steels. Markets for these
products have been found in Europe, the United States and Asia as well
as in the Latin American Free Trade Area countries.  Although highly
significant from the Brazilian point of view, these manufactured exports
in no case account for more than one percent of the total manufactured
imports of the various regions concerned. Thus, there appears to be ample
room for additional expansion.
18.       The rapid growth of output and investment has placed heavy demands
on Brazilts capacity to pay for imports, particularly as production and
investment accelerated further in the latter part of 1970. Imports were
about US$1.9 billion in 1968 and US$2.5 billion in 1970. Most of the



increase was in the import of capital goods - a growth of about 50 per-
cent over this period - and raw materials for Brazil's growing industry.
19.      External capital requirements, averaging abcut US$800 million
in the last three years, have been financed largely by medium and long-
term borrowing which averaged about US$500 millioIn per annum. For the
rest, Brazil depended on direct investments and, much more substantially,
on short-term credits iihich have increased significantly in recent years.
Brazil has also been able to build up its external reserve and to main-
tain an adecuate margin of liquidity. IWet foreign exchange reserves
increased from US$0.3 billion at the end of 1968, to about US$16 billion
at the end of 1970. External debt, including short-term financial cre-
dits, was US$3.7 billion at the end of 1968 and about US$5.2 billion at
the end of 1970. Including all interest payments and the amortization
of medium and long-term debt, the debt service ratio was 21 percent in
both yearsv. While the Government's balance of payments managetent has
been skillful there is need for constant attention to the structure of
Brazil's external debt and its possible effect on Brazil's future liquid-
ity. At the end of 1970 debts with maturities of up to three years
amounted to more than 40 percent of Brazil's external debt. The Govern-
ment is keenly aware of this and has taken steps to raise new financial
credits for longer terms. In the next few years the management of
Brazil's external indebtedness and capital flows will be a crucial ele-
ment in Brazil's economic policies.
20.      Tle Brazilian Government has not found a way to reduce signi-
ficantly the rate of inflation while preserving its objective of ensuring
continuous rapid growth. The annual rate of inflation was reduced to
about 20 percent in 1970 from about 25 percent in 1968, The Government
feels that a reduction of the rate of production and employment growth
which may result from efforts for a more rapid decline in the rate of
inflation, would be unacceptable socially and politicallyO  Moreover,
to some extent, the Government's efforts to reduce the distortion of
prices, such as public utility tariffs, rents, agricultural prices and
price of coffee for domestic consumption, have inevitably led to some
"cost push." Nevertheless, the Government is committed to continue
measures in various fields to minimize the adverse effects of inflation
on resource use through flexible prices.
21.      The Government is currently preparing a development plan for
1972-74. It is expected to be ready towards the end of this year. Unlike
previous plans, this one will be detailed and specific and indicate
economic goals, investment priorities and projects and resource mobili-
zation. The Government's primary goal is a continuance of economic
growth at around the rate achieved in recent years. Towards this end,
it proposes to make large direct investments in infrastructure, such
as transportation, power and in education and in primary industries,
such as steel. To permit continued rapid growth of private industry
and agriculture, the Government proposes to extend liberal credit, often
directed to specific inputs such as fertilizers, and to specific areas,



such as the Northeast. To meet the problem of regional disparities, the
Government's policy is not only to divert public and private resources for
industrial, agricultural and infrastructure development within the North-
east, but also to use large public resources to open up new areas in the
Amazon and the western part of Brazil for settlement by unemployed and
landless Northeasterners. The construction of the Transamazonica Highway
is a step in this direction.
22.       The Government has undertaken a series of measures to increase
domestic savings to ensure that the investment resources necessary to
support rapid growth rates are available. The above mentioned adjustments
of public utility tariffs have contributed substantially to the savings
capacity of public enterprises in the energy and communications sectors.
The current account deficit of the Central Government, which equalled
0.9 percent of GDP in 1967, has been transformed into a surplus equal to
3.3 percent of GDP in 1970, primarily as the result of improved tax
performance>. To encourage private savings the Government has taken
measures to provide adequate returns to private investors channeling
their savings into the capital market.  Thus, the private savings cap-
tured by investment banks, mutual funds, finance companies and savings
and loan associations increased by 175 percent in real terms over the
1967-70 period.  Efforts to promote domestic savings are likely to con-
tinue as investment requirements increase.
23.       Brazilts resources are plentiful.  The Government's eccnomic
management has been efficient. The country has a vigorous private sector
and a skilled managerial class. Continuance of growth achieved in the
last few years should not, therefore, be beyond reach provided that the
Government's efforts to rationalize policies affecting the use of key
resources are continued and strengthened. However, a crucial factor in
Brazilts ability to achieve its goal would be the extent and the quality
of support it receives from external lenders. IrJhile the Government is
keen on promoting the growth and diversification of exports and the pros-
pects for Brazilts exports are bright, Brazil will continue, for quite
some time, to depend heavily on foreign capital to meet its development
objectives. The Bank's current estimate is that in the next few years
Brazil will need more than US$1 billion annually to finance its current
account deficit and to make amortization payments on its medium and long-
term debt. Additional medium and long-term borrowing may be needed in
order to improve the structure of the external debt, reducing the pro-
portion of short-term debt in the total. External capital requirements
may appear large, but relative to the size of the economy and the
imaginative and ambitious developmental objectives which Brazills eco-
nomic managers have adopted, they are modest. Net capital inflow in
1970 was 10 percent of total investments. Brazil continues to be credit-
worthy for substantial amounts of Bank lending.
24.       Brazil has made considerable progress in the last few years in
formulating investment projects suitable for external financing. How-
ever, its gross external capital requirements, taking into account heavy
charges for service on external debt, cannot be met if external assist-
ance is tied entirely to the foreign exchange component of project



-7-
costs. Although the capital investment needed to support Brazil's economic
growth targets is substantial, a large part of the capital equipment com-
prising this investment will be produced in Brazil, generating needs for
raw material and intermediate goods imports not directly attributable
to externally financed investment projects, Hence, it is appropriate
for external lenders to finance some local expenditures in Brazil, es-
pecially on projects having a relatively loJ foreign exchange component.
PART III -PROSPECTS FOR BAINK LENDING
25.      Bank commitments to Brazil have increased sharply in the last
two years. Nevertheless, Bank loans represented no m.ore than 12 percent
of total medium and long-term loan commitments in 1969 and 1970. WjJith
substantial new Bank lendi'ng for Brazil in prospect for the near future,
the Bank's share in medium and long-term lending may well increase.
26.      The very large investment requirements of the power sector will
necessitate continuing financial assistance from international institu-
tions and at least modest support from the Bank. The Bank is, therefore,
working on a loan for the installation of generating facilities at Sao
Simao on the Paranaiba River and complementary transmission lines. This
project was developed within the framework of a very large power develop-
ment program which has been formulated for South-Central Brazil. I also
envisage continued substantial Bank support for the Government's efforts
in transportation. A Bank loan is being prepared for the construction
of a number of highways to which high priorities were attributed by the
Trasnport Survey. Both of the aforementioned loans should be ready for
presentation to the Executive Directors during the current fiscal year.
27.      The largest component of the Bank's prospective lending to Brazil
during that Deriod consists, howjever, of the proposal to provide financing,
jointly with the IDB, for the expansion of Brazil's three principal in-
tegrated steel mills. Nhen completed, these projects w-,ill increase
Brazil's steel production capacity by 3 million tons. The steel projects
are designed to exploit Brazil's rich iron ore resources to meet the
rapidly increasing demand for steel at economic costs. Another project
likely to be ready for Bank financing during the next 12 months is the
creation of a capital market fund designed both to improve the structure
of the capital market and to channel private savings into industry. WJe
have also for some time been working with the Government to develop
additional projects in agriculture and I hope to have ready for considera-
tion by the Executive Directors by mid- or late 1972 a loan for land
settlement in the Northeast and one for financing agricultural storage
facilities in the principal producing areas. As regards education, the
recent Bank loan for technical education includes funds for a study of
the education systems and manpower requirements in the two Northeastern
states of Ceara and Pernambuco; this study may provide the basis for a
future Banlc project.

PART IV - THE PROJECTS
28.       Brazil has immense deposits of high quality iron ore.   Its re-
serves are estimated at over 30 billion metric tons, or 12 percent of
known world reserves, and far exceed the needs of its steel industry.
Iron ore has, therefore, become a major Brazilian export, now second only
to coffee. The development of new ore deposits will make iron ore mining
one of the most dynamic sectors during the 1970s. Ln 1970, Brazil exported
about 28 million tons, valued at US$210 million. Current plans are to
raise exports of iron ore to about 70 million tons annually by 1975. The
long-term market outlook for iron ore is favorable and future prices are
expected to remain relatively stable.
29.       Although two separate Bank loans are being presented, one to
MBR, a mining company, and another to RFFSA, the federally-olmed railway
corporation, the projects to be constructed by these enterprises are inter-
related ancd serve a common purpose: to develop the large Aguas Claras iron
ore deposit located near Belo Horizonte in the State of Minas Gerais and
export the ore. This deposit contains proven and inferred reserves of over
375 milliorn tons of high grade mineable open-pit hematite containing 68
percent iron and very low percentages of phosphorus, sulfur, silica and
alumina. Facilities will be provided by MBR to mine and process the ore,
and the railway system of RFFSA will be improved to carry the ore 640 km
to a new marine terminal to be constructed by MBR at Sepetiba Bay, south-
west of Rio de Janeiro. The railway project will be the responsibility
of RFFSA arid the mining project of MBR. RFFSA and MBR have already created
a high-level committee consisting of representatives of the two organizatioiv3
to coordinate the execution of the two projects.  Furthermore, both RFFSA
and MBR have agreed to retain a single consulting firm to supervise the
construction of both projects.
30.       The projects will result initially in the export of 10 million
tons of ore annually.  It is expected that the facilities provided in the
first phases will later be expanded with little additional investment to
produce and export 15 million tons or more of ore per year within five
years of thle start of operations. The Aguas Claras deposit has sufficient
proven reserves to produce ore for export at the rate of 15 million tons
per year for 17 years.  MBR has entered into long-term ore sales agree-
ments to sell annually 7.3 million long tons of Aguas Claras ore to five
Japanese steel companies, 1.3 million tons to British Steel Corporation and
700,000 tons to SOMISA in Argentina. Eich of these contracts provides for
periodic renegotiation of the sales price. These contracts and a further
700,000 tons of expected spot sales will account for the initial planned



- 9 -
production of 10 million tons a year. MBR has been able to negotiate
favorable contract terms, due primarily to the quality of its ore, which
gives it a competitive advantage over most iron ore sources elsewhere
in the world.
The MBR Project
31.      A report, "Appraisal of the MBR Iron Ore Project" (PI-10) dated
June 16, 1971 is being distributed separately. A summary of it is in
Annex III.
32.      Companhia Auxiliar de Empresas de Mineracao - CAEMI, a Brazilian
holding company, and St. John D'el Rey, a British holding company 52 per-
cent owned by the Hanna Mining Company of the United States, propose to
consolidate their iron ore properties in MBR in accordance with a re-
organization agreement which must be approved by the Government and which
the MBR Loan Agreement makes a condition of effectiveness. Through hold-
ing companies and subsidiaries, IIBR will be owned effectively about 31
percent by CAEMI, 25 percent by Hanna, 10 percent by several Japanese
steel and trading companies, 10 percent by a Liberian subsidiary of a
U. S. shipping company, National Bulk Carriers, and 24 percent by minority
shareholders in St. John. MBR and its subsidiaries, following the con-
solidation, will possess mining rights over an area of 45 km2 in the
vicinity of Belo Horizonte containing 36 deposits of iron ore with re-
serves estimated at over 1.6 billion tons. Aguas Claras, the mine being
developed, is the largest of these deposits. Planning for the project
reflects the sponsors' extensive experience with iron ore mining in
Brazil, Canada and the United States.
MBR Financing and Use of Proceeds
33.      The cost of the project is equivalent to US$142.6 million to
which has to be added US$12.6 million for financial charges on long-
term debt during construction to give total financing requirements of
US$155.2 million, of which US$86.4 million would be foreign and US$68.8
million local. This financing would come from the following sources:
Sponsors' New Equity                                          30.0
Long-Term Debt
IBRD                                           50.0
Japanese Trading Companies                     50.0
Japanese Suppliers' Credits (to be negotiated)   7.0 a/
U.S. Eximbank and Commercial Banks              26.3 a/    133.3
Total Financing available to cover ex-
penditure estimated at US$155.2 million                163.3
a! The utilization of Japanese suppliers' credit and the U.S.Eximbank and
commercial bank loans will not be known until contract awards have been
made. UJnused portions of these loans will remain available as addi-
tional contingency financing.



- 10 -
34.       The proposed Bank loan to MBR of US$50 million would be for
15 years, including a grace period of about 3-1/2 years. The Government
of Brazil would charge MBR a 2 percent per annum guarantee fee on the
outstanding disbursed amount of the Bank loan, thereby bringing the cost
of the Bank loan to IBR to 9-1/4i percent.
35.       Since lIMR has contracted to start shipping iron ore from its
terminal in 1973, some orders for equipment are presently being placed
and contracts are being awarded for some civil works, all in accordance
with Bank guidelines. It is, therefore, proposed that the Bank loan
cover expenditures from June 1, 1971; it is estimated that this would
result in retroactive financing of about US$1 million.
36.       All contracts in respect of items financed by the Bank will be
subject to international competitive bidding. Brazilian manufacturers
of equipment and materials will be given a 15 percent margin of preference.
The proposed loan would provide some local expenditure financing, estimated
not to exceed US$7 million.
37.       The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million and the US$50 million loan
being provrided by Japanese banks and trading companies at an effective
interest rate of about 9.6 percent and with a 15-year term, will be secured
by a first mortgage on l4BRls properties and other assets. lMIBT has agreed
that US$0.60 per ton shall be withheld from payment for the first 84 mil-
lion tons of ore shipped on the Japanese ore contracts in order to service
the Japanese loan. This arrangement may result in full repayment in about
12-1/2 years after project completion. The proceeds of the Japanese loan
may be spent anywhere including Brazil; the Japanese suppliers' credit s
would be used for purchases of equipment from Japan. Of the US$26.3 mil-
lion commitment from the EBimbani and U.S. connercial banks, which has an
effective interest rate of about 7.5 percent and a term of 12-1/2 years,
US$22.5 million is available for parchase of U.S. goods, and US$3.8 million
for local expenditures.
NEBR-Overrun Undertaking; Financial Projections
38.       Although it is considered that the project cost estimates in-
clude adequate allowfances for price escalation and contingencies, and
although the financing presently available or under negotiation would pro-
vide up to US$8 million over and above the cost estimates, CAEMI and St.
John have severally agreed in the Shareholders' Agreement, to Provide up
to US$20 million to finance cost overruns and working capital deficiencies
until the Project is operational. The proportionate responsibilities
of the primary sponsors are: CAEMT 51 percent and St. John 49 percent.
CAEMI's obligation is secured by an agreement not to sell or pledge,

Industria e Comercio de Minerios, S.A. - ICOMI, CAEMI's major subsidiary
and principal source of income.  In the Security Agreement, Hanna Mining
Company has agreed to provide US$7-5 million to meet St. John's obliga-
tion under the Shareholders' Agreement in case the latter is unable to
do so. As further security, St. John has agreed to a pledge of its IWTBR
shares in favor of the Bank.
39.      Projections of MBR's financial statements for the Aguas Claras
operation, assuming sales of 10 million tons per annum, indicate an
internal financial rate of return, after taxes, of about 19 percent.
They also show long--term debt service coverage after capacity is reached,
ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 times. The M4BR Loan Agreement contains pro-
visions to protect MBR's liauidity through restrictions on dividends,
borrowings, and non-project investments. The Bank, the Eximbank and
the Japanese lenders would be protected proportionately by a provision
that if 14BR pays out dividends in excess of US$7-5 million in any year,
MBR will apply an equivalent amount to repayment of their loans. How-
ever, to the extent that dividend payments by MBR are less than an
aggregate of US$15 million in any two successive years, in the third
year MBR would be able to pay dividends in the amount of US$7.5 million
and in addition the above mentioned difference between US$15 million and
actual dividends paid,without having to prepay long-term debt. In the
case of the Bank loan this could mean pre-payments starting in or after
1979 leading to full repayment twzo or three years ahead of the scheduled
final maturity date.
Ecology
40.      The findings of a special ecological mission sent by the Bank
to the project sites were discussed with the project sponsors and agree-
ment was reached during negotiations that the execution and operation of
the project would be carried out with due regard to ecological and
environmenltal factors. The iron ore terminal proposed to be built by
MBR at Sepetiba Bay is in the vicinity of beaches used for recreation
and waters used for fishing. During loan negotiations MBR has agreed
to take measures acceptable to the Government and the Bank to deal with
oil and other slops from incoming ships, as well as accidental oil spills.
Furthermore, N4BR has agreed to consult with the Bank before any decision
is made to establish a pelletizing plant at the terminal.
The RFFSA Plroject
41.      A report, "RFFSA - Appraisal of the First Railway Project"
(PTR-77a) dated June 14, 1971 is being distributed separately. A summary
of it is included in Annex III.
42.      R?FFSA was created in 1957 as a publicly-owned corporation group-
ing 13 railways which formerly had been publicly-owned but under separate
managements. The States and Municipalities hold pieference shares re-
presenting 23 percent of total capital, while the Federal Government holds
the controlling interest. Management is undertaken by a board of six



- 12   -
members, chaired by the President.  In 1968, RFFSA's organization was
re-shaped to provide for four regional systems. Economies in adminis-
tration are being sought by concentrating responsibility in regional
headquarters for financial and personnel matters and statistics.
Government control of RFFSA is exercised in respect of capital expen-
ditures, overall budget and tariffs,
43.      In 1965 the Government undertook with Bank assistance a Trans-
port Survey, including the railways. The Survey pointed to the need for
major institutional, financial and managerial reforms in RFFSA, in addi-
tion to substantial new investments.  [n 1968 and 1970 the Government
formulated so-called Plans of Action to implement in RFFSA and other
transport entities the major recommendation of the Transport Survey.
Progress in the reform of RFFSA has been satisfactory. The operating
deficit of RFFSA, which was US$200 million in 1964, was reduced to
US$100 million in 1970. In this perid some 6,oCo km of uneconomic lines
were closed and the labor force reduced by 25,000 persons. RFFSA is
currently preparing a 5-year corporate plan which would cover investments
and a detailed program for the improvement of management, operations and
finances in order to eliminate its operating deficits by the middle of
the decade. This plan may provide a basis for Bank financing of further
railway investments.
44.      To provide transport of iron ore for the MBR mining project
between the Aguas Claras mine and the Sepetiba Bay terminal, RFFSA will
acquire 78 locomotives and 1230 ore cars. RFFSA will also construct a
new rail connection to the mine and a bypass line to avoid dense traffic
in the Rio de Janeiro area. The existing main line will be improved
by track works, resignalling and bridge and tunnel wqorks. The iron ore
traffic is expected tio make a significant contribution to RFFSA's revenues:
transportation of 12 million tons per annum 1/ over the 15-year period
ending in 1988 is expected to result in net cash generation to RFFSA of
US$117 million after meeting debt service.
RFFSA Financing and Use of Proceeds
45.      The cost of the project is equivalent to US$128.9 million to
which has to be added interest on external loans during construction of
US$4.3 million to give total financing requirements of US$133.2 million,
This financing would come from the following sources:
IBRD                                 46.0
Suippliers Credits                   26.7
Brazilian Government                 60.5
Total Financing                133-2
1 Whereas the MIBR projections have covered a build-up from 10 to 15
million tons annually, projections for RFFSA are based on the present
projects which covers a build-up to 12 million tons only, beyond whi-ch
further investment in equipment would be necessary.



- 13 -
46.      Th.e proposed US$46 million Bank loan would finance 100 percent
of the cost of freight cars, rails, workshop and track equipment and
the foreign exchange cost of consultant services, thereby covering about
35 percent of the costs of the project.  It wiould have a maturity of 18
years, including a grace period of four years. A longer grace period
for the RFFSA loan than for the IRBR loan is being recommended because
some improvements of the main railway line to be financed from the pro-
posed loan would continue until the end of 1974, and disbursements are
likely to continue into 1975. Shipments of iron ore would begin, how-
ever, in 1973. The longer term of the proposed loan to RFFSA is based
on the economic life of assets financed under the loan and the projected
cash flowz of RliFSA. All Bank financed items, other than consultants
services, would be purchased under international competitive bidding,
in which Brazilian suppliers would participate with a 15 percent margin
of preference. Insofar as some orders for equipmen-t are placed with
Brazilian suppliers, a part of the loan, estimated not to exceed US$23
million, would finance local expenditures. The proposed loan would
also include retroactive financing of US$100,000 for consulting services
incurred since June 1, 1970 in connection with project preparation.
47.      Suppliers credits will be used to finance about 80 diesel loco-
motives in the United States. The Brazilian Government's contribution,
about 45 percent of total project cost, will be provided as a capital
grant, and will be used for civil works a d other expenditures.
RFFSA-MBR: Iron Ore Transport Contract
48.      RFFSA has signed a 15-year contract with MBR for the transport
from the Aguas Claras mine to YiBR's Sepetiba Bay terminal of a minimum
of 9 million tons of ore per year, with provision for higher tonnages if
necessary. The contract initially negotiated between RFFSA and MBR pro-
vided for a fixed tariff (depending on tonnage transported) in dollars
for the life of the contract, and thus provided no protection against
price increases in the United States. MBR and RFFSA have now agreed
to modify thle contract, providing for an annual adjustment of RFFSA's
tariff beginning in 1974 on the basis of increases in the U. S. Wholesale
Price Index since 1970. To protect MBR against an open ended commitment
to tariff adjustments, RFFSA's tariff would not exceed specified per-
centages (depending upon tonnages shipped) of iron ore prices obtained
by MBR. The escalation formula agreed upon by MBR and RFFSA would pro-
vide reasonable protection to RFFSA against cost increases while pro-
tecting MBR in case of a substantial lag of world iron ore prices behind
prices in the United States.
49.      The iron ore transport contract includes a broad force majeure
provision, but MBR has agreed that it will not in any lawsuit, arbitra-
tion, or ther proceeding take the position that the force majeure clause
extends to any commercial risks of MBR, such as a decline in demand or
in the price of iron ore, or any increase in the cost of production thereof.



50.      With the above mentioned adjustment of tariffs and assuming
iron ore shipment of 10 million tons per annum, RFFSA's internal finan-
cial rate of return on its investment in this project should be some
8 to 9 percent. Since about 45 percent of RFFSA's financing will be
from the Brazilian Government grant, the return on the new investment
should be more than adequate to cover service on the Bank loan and
suppliers credits.
Benefits to Brazil
51.      MBR and RFFSA together propose to invest close to US$290 million
in these projects. The economic return on this investment, making the
conservative assumption that exports will not exceed 10 million tons of
iron ore per year, is expected to be of the order of 18 percent. Net
foreign exchange earnings for Brazil, after allowing for debt service,
overseas dividend payments and the foreign exchange component of operating
costs of MBR and RFFSA, will average about US$50 million per annum.
About 84 percent of net financial benefits will accrue to Brazil, 73
percent to the Brazilian Government through various taxes and the guaran-
tee fee and 11 percent to Brazilian shareholders. Total direct revenues
accruing to the Brazilian Government over the assumed 15-year period
with only 10 million tons per year exported are projected to be US$215
million. Net cash generation from NIBR ore traffic would reduce the
annual operating deficit of RFFSA, currently estimated at about US$100
million, by an average of about US$10 million per annum during this
period. Total revenues accruing to the Government and RFFSA taken to-
gether over l1 years are thus estimated at US$339 million.   With a 50
percent increase in ore sales to 15 million tons annually, total revenues
accruing to the Government and RFFSA from the MBR-RFFSA projects would
come to about US$585 million. A notable feature of these projects is
that the share of total benefits received by the Government is substan-
tially higher than that received by the host country in othcr mining
projects financed by the Bank.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.      The draft Loan Agreements between the Bank and Mineracoes
Brasileiras Reunidas, S.A. and Rede Ferroviaria Federal, S.A.; the
draft Guarantee Agreements between the Federative Republic of Brazil and
the Bank for both loans; the Shareholders Agreement between the Bank and
Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas, S.A., and Companhia Auxiliar de Empresas
de Mineracao - CAEMI and St. John D'el Rey Mining Company, Ltd.; the
Security Agreement between the Bank and Yineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas,
S.A., and St. John D'el Rey iMining Company, Ltd., and Hanna Mining
Company; and the Reports of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii), of the Article of Agreement and draft Resolutions
approving the proposed loans, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.



- 15 -
53.      Most of the major features of these agreements have already
been described in this report. In addition, the Loan Agreement with
TBR contains debt limitation and dividend and investment restriction
covenants which are usual for this type of transaction. As already
mentioned the Baik's loan and the Japanese loans will be secured by
a first mortgage on all of MIBR's properties and assets. A Lender's
Agreement between the Bank and the Japanese Group will provide for
consultation before either party acts to enforce the mortgage.
54.      I am satisfied that the proposed loans will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOM ENDATION
55.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loans.
