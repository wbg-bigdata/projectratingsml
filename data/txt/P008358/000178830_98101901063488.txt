SOUTHERN CONVEYOR PROJECT FOR WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:    Republic of Cyprus
Amount:      US$27 million
Terms:       Fifteen years, including three years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project      The project is the first phase of a two phase development to
Description: harness the Republic of Cyprus' last substantial remaining
surface water resources. Different supply options, phasing and
technical alternatives were examined. The proposed Phase I
project is the least-cost alternative to meet the Republic's
priority water needs. The project's primary objectives are (i)
to ensure adequate water supplies to three major cities as well
as to rural areas and (ii) to maintain vitally important
irrigated crop production in an area threatened by aquifer
seawater intrusion. The project also aims to rationalize further
the utilization of the country's scarce water resources in Cyprus
through the establishment of appropriate institutions and the
implementation of realistic cost recovery measures for both
domestic and irrigation water. The project components include
(a) a major dam (115 MCM) and appurtenant structures; (b) a main
conveyor (110 km) and connecting pipelines; (c) a pressurized
irrigation network; (d) a terminal reservoir; (e) domestic water
treatment and conveyance works; (f) establishment of project
administration including a central control system; and (g)
provision of consultant services. The project would directly
benefit nearly 0.6 million domestic water consumers and 10,000
persons in the irrigated farming community who, without the
project, would have to discontinue highly profitable irrigated
farming. Major risks to the project would arise only if the
second phase were not implemented. Without a second phase water
for irrigation would have to be gradually curtailed and
eventually even eliminated because of increasing domestic water
demand. This risk is, however, highly unlikely to be faced since
the Government considers the implementation of the entire project
(two phases) to be critical to the country's economic well being
and has given assurances during negotiations that it will
promptly implement the second phase.

CYPRUS
SOUTHERN CONVEYOR PROJECT FOR WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government has placed water resource development among its
highest priorities. Most groundwater resources have now already been
developed and many aquifers overpumped. Prospects of further development of
minor aquifers is limited, and in most instances surface water has been
tapped. In light of this situation, shortage of water for domestic and
irrigation use is moving steadily close to the danger point. The major cities
of Nicosia and Larnaca are already experiencing acute shortages of water, and
it is expected that another major city, Limassol, as well as the area of
Famagusta will be faced with severe shortages before the end of the decade.
Tourist development along the coast is increasingly constrained on account of
water shortages. As to irrigation, depleted groundwater resources threaten
highly profitable export production in a major production area (Kokkinokhoria).
If no surface water supplies are made available before the end of the decade,
salt water intrusion into the aquifer will render the area permanently
unsuitable for agriculture. In summary, the urgency to provide additional
water is evident.
1.02     Preparation of the Southern Conveyor Project for Water Resources
Development (SCP) was initiated by the Government of Cyprus in March 1978 with
assistance from the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the UK. The
study was carried out in two stages. Stage one, the prefeasibility study,
concentrated on appraising the viability of alternative options. In June
1980, the Council of Ministers decided on the preferred option to be
considered in more detail and stage two, the feasibility study, commenced in
1980, for which consultants were appointed by the Government. The overall
management of the study was the responsibility of the Director General of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), who was advised by the
Southern Conveyor Project Management Committee. The Bank participated
actively in the discussions of major issues and the overall concept of the
project.
1.03     Though convinced of both urgency and need to augment water supplies,
the Bank rigorously examined all possible supply alternatives and project
phasing opportunities. The Government of Cyprus has requested a Bank loan to
assist in financing the first phase of the SCP. This first phase project aims
at reconciling the urgency of early implementation with the need to keep
investments within bounds, while maximizing overall economic benefits.
Nevertheless, because of the bulkiness of major components, investment in
Phase I is considerable. Thorough examination of key parameters leads to the
conclusion that neither the balance of payments nor the budget are likely to
be unduly strained by the project which is the least cost alternative to meet
priority water needs.
1.04     This report is based on the Government feasibility study of 1982, the
updated main reports of January and of February 1983 and the findings of the
Bank appraisal mission in April/May 1983.

II. THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
Water Resources
2.01     The average annual precipitation in Cyprus ranges from 290 mm in the
west to 1,190 mm on the Troodos mountains for a total of about 4,500 million
cubic meters per annum (MCM/a) of water on the entire island. Surface
evaporation and evapotranspiration from forests and pastures account for about
2,520 MCM/a and from cultivated and irrigated crops about 1,030 MCM/a. An
estimated 350 MCM/a infiltrate the ground, resulting in about 600 MCM/a net
surface runoff.
2.02     Most of the groundwater resources have already been developed, and
the prospect of further development of minor aquifers is limited because of
quantity as well as water quality. Therefore, surface water is assuming more
importance as the predominant source of water for development. Presently, it
is estimated that about 175 MCM/a of surface water are utilized for
agricultural and domestic uses, and the remaining 425 MCM/a are lost to the
sea during floods.
2.03     The total storage capacity of reservoirs in Cyprus, mostly for
irrigation, including the recently completed Asprokremmos dam near Paphos, is
116 MCM. These provide an average water yield of 86.7 MCM/a of which about 5
MCM/a is being used for domestic water supply. The groundwater schemes
provide about 20 MCM/a and 360 MCM/a for domestic water supply and irrigation,
respectively. The Vasilikos-Pendaskinos Project (VPP), which is presently
under implementation, would add about 32 MCM of storage capacity and, on
completion, would provide 7 MCM/a for domestic use and 7.4 MCM/a for
irrigation of about 1,600 ha. The Khrysokhou Irrigation project will provide
23 MCM of storage capacity at the Evretou dam to serve 2,000 ha of irrigation
area.
Sector Organization
2.04     Despite efforts to rationalize existing legislative and institutional
arrangements related to water resource management there has been little
substantial progress in that direction. The existing management of water
resources is fragmented at both the policy level as well as at the upper
levels of execution. As a consequence there are many instances of inadequate
planning and duplication of effort. The Government is aware of the
inefficiencies resulting from such divisions of responsibility and favors the
establishment of an integrated national water entity, which would be
responsible for the development and use of all water resources in Cyprus and
for the implementation, operation, and maintenance of all major water supply
schemes for both domestic water and irrigation (para 7.03).
2.05     The responsibility for domestic water distribution is vested in the
local Governments for which water boards have been established in Nicosia,
Limassol, and Larnaca, and village councils for rural communities. The water
boards, which have representatives from the central Government level, function
rather independently but budget and tariff increases are subject to approval
from the Council of Ministers. Sewerage boards have been established in
Nicosia, Limassol, and Larnaca and function in a way similar to the water
boards.



-3-
Water Supply and Sewerage Services
2.06     The water scarcity situation has induced a general awareness of water
conservation which has resulted in a comparatively low per capita water
consumption. In both urban and rural areas virtually the total population is
provided with piped water supply of satisfactory quality. Only Nicosia has a
sewerage and sewage disposal system. There are plans of expanding the sewage
system coverage in Nicosia and constructing new systems in Larnaca and
Limassol.
Sector Objectives
2.07     The Government's objectives for the water supply sector could briefly
be formulated as follows: (i) optimal utilization of the scarce water resources
with domestic water supply given first priority for its use; (ii) development
of available fresh water resources in order to maintain a continuous and safe
water supply; (iii) improvement of water conservation practices and main-
tenance of an adequate tariff structure to discourage high water consumption;
(iv) introduction of high degree sewage treatment enabling water recirculation
for irrigation; and (v) establishment of a national water entity.
Sector Investment and Cost Recovery Policies
2.08     An analysis of past and projected sector investments indicates that
the domestic water supply sector has consistently received a high priority.
Thus, during the Third Emergency Economic Action Plan (1979-1981) the sector
investment amounted to CL5.4 million or 3% of total capital investments, which
corresponds to an annual investment of CL3.5 per capita. During the current
Fourth Emergency Economic Action Plan (1982-1986) sector investments are
projected to CL22.4 million or about 6% of total capital investments, which
would correspond to an annual investment of CL8.4 per capita.
2.09     Through a decree (no 21023, dated November 12, 1981) by the Council
of Ministers, the Water Development Department (WDD) of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources is obliged to maintain bulk water rates
corresponding to actual costs for the water. According to the Water Supply
Law of 1951, the water boards have to set water tariffs to cover all operating
costs and debt service. These rules also apply to Municipal Departments or
Village Councils responsible for the provision of water supply. Water boards
and village councils' retail water tariffs are based on a progressive
surcharge on the water consumption and a fixed fee for each category of
consumer. F'ollowing the September 1983 increase of WDD's bulk water tariffs
(para. 8.34), the water boards have consequently increased their own retail
tariffs as shown in Annex 2, Table 5. The progressive tariffs structure
adopted by the water boards supports the Government policies aimed at ensuring
affordabilty for the less affluent domestic customers while creating incentive
for water conservation among high domestic, administration, industrial and
touristic consumers whose water consumption represents about 40% of the total
consumption and is charged at CE 0.55 and above per cubic meter.
Bank Involvement in the Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
2.10     Bank involvement in the water supply and sewage sector was initiated
in 1971 through the following projects: (i) Nicosia Sewerage Project (Loan
729-CY, US$3.5 million) and (ii) Famagusta Sewerage and Drainage Project



-4-
Loan 730-CY, US$1.9 million). The projects provided for sewage collection and
disposal facilities and were well advanced, when the events of 1974 took
place. The Famagusta project was suspended while the Nicosia project was
successfully completed in 1980. The project performance audit report, which
was issued in 1981, recognized the institutional development resulting from
the project.

III. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Agricultural Production
3.01     In 1982, about 70% of sector value added was generated by the crop
subsector, 20% by livestock activities and the balance by fisheries, forestry
and hunting. Though irrigated crops occupy only about 10% of the total
agricultural land area, these generate nearly 80% of value added in crop
production, the balance coming from rainfed, mainly cereal production on 90%
of the area. These productivity differentials clearly indicate that, on the
physical resources side, development of Cypriot agriculture is severely
constrained by scarcity of irrigation water supplies. During the period
1979-82, value added for irrigated crops increased at about 1.2% p.a., for
rainfed crops at about 0.5% p.a., whereas value added in livestock production
remained virtually unchanged.
3.02     Long-term sector growth prospects mainly depend on the Government's
socio-economic policy objectives. It would appear, however, that, even under
very favorable external conditions and Government policies, long-term sector
growth, for three primary reasons, is not likely to exceed 2-3% per year.
First, growth of crop production will depend mainly on expansion of the
irrigated area. This is expected to increase by about 8,000 ha over the next
10 years, or by about 2% per year. Such increase is not likely to result in a
corresponding gain in value added because the real cost of inputs in modern
irrigated agriculture is likely to increase considerably. Second, though
there is still scope for productivity increases, both in irrigated as in
rainfed crop production, corresponding value-added increments will be modest
for the same reason as stated above. Third, livestock production depends
largely on subsidized imported feed. It appears to be undesirable to continue
to increase such feed grain imports and subsidies, and hence it is unlikely
that the performance of this subsector can be improved.
Agricultural Exports
3.03     Agricultural exports play an important role in Cyprus' foreign
exchange earnings; in 1982, they accounted directly and indirectly for nearly
25% of all commodity export earnings. The most important commodities in value
terms are potatoes, citrus, grapes and wines while in recent years the value
of vegetable exports has been increasing steadily. The above commodities
accounted for 36%, 24%, 13%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of the total
agriculturaL export earnings in 1981.
3.04     Export prices of most horticultural commodities, citrus, and grapes
rose only moderately in current terms and stagnated in real value; only unit
export values of vegetables registered a substantial increase (20%) in real
terms. Significant increases in future sector export earnings will mainly
depend on Cyprus' ability to shift exports to high-value vegetables and exotic
fruits (e.g., avocados and kiwis) and to increase exportable volumes of
traditional items such as potatoes, citrus fruit and table grapes. Such
changes require continued investment in water development projects, on-farm
irrigation systems and commensurate attention to applied research and
extension coupled with effective export marketing mechanisms.



-6-
Export Marketing
3.05     Part of Cyprus' agriculture was developed to produce specific fruits
and vegetables for the UK market. The realignment of UK trade policies,
following UK entry into the European Economic Community (EEC), resulted in
Cyprus' loss of preferential entry into that market. Interim policies were
replaced in 1978 by the Special Commonwealth Preference for Cyprus which
stipulated preferential tariffs for a variety of horticultural products. The
UK continues to be the main market for Cyprus' horticultural products (e.g.,
85% of potatoes, 50-60% of citrus), though modest diversification to other
European countries and the Middle East is in process.
3.06     The main problems facing Cypriot exports of horticultural products
are (i) concentration in one particular market, (ii) lack of coordination
among exporters on one hand and between exporters and producers on the other,
and (iii) absence of a long-term export marketing strategy. These problems
are being addressed under the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (Loan
1988-CY).
Land Resources, Use and Tenure
3.07     Of the total land area in Cyprus of 925,000 ha, only 424,000 ha are
available for agriculture. Dryland field crops (mainly barley) occupy some
380,000 ha, and only 44,000 ha (about 10%) are under controlled irrigation
(excluding spate irrigated areas). Horticultural crops, e.g., citrus,
vegetables, potatoes, deciduous fruits and table grapes, are the principal
crops grown on irrigated lands.
3.08     Private ownership, in the area under Government control, accounts for
93% of the agricultural land, 1  the balance comprising Government, church
and communal lands. Eighty percent of private land is farmed by the owners
while rental contracts account for about one quarter of the total farm area.
The total number of holdings in the area under Government control is about
44,500, with an average farm size of 4.5 ha.
Irrigation Development
3.09     In 1978, the area under systematic irrigation in the Government-
controlled area of Cyprus was 43,610 ha. Out of this around 9,040 ha were
irrigated by surface water and 34,570 ha by groundwater. In addition there
were about 18,000 ha under spate irrigation. The completed Paphos irrigation
scheme, when fully developed, would add 5,000 ha to the area irrigated by
surface water. The Vasilikos-Pendaskinos project, expected to be completed by
the end of 1985, and the Khrysokhou project, expected to be completed by the
end of 1986, would add another 1,050 ha and 2,100 ha respectively. Therefore,
the surface irrigated area would be increased by 1987 to about 17,200 ha. No
substantial change is expected to occur in the area irrigated by groundwater
and spate irrigation. Irrigated crops include potatoes, citrus fruit, winter
and summer vegetables, table grapes and bananas.

-7-
Northern Cyprus
3.10     A feasibility study for integrated water development in areas of
northern Cyprus was prepared in 1974. The events in that year prevented its
subsequent execution. The Turkish Government is now reportedly assisting in
at least partial implementation of that project. Because this project is
located in a different hydrological basin and it would serve other areas, its
implementation would not have any effect on the SCP.
Agricultural Policies and Programs
3.11     The Government continues to consider agriculture as one of its
priority areas. Within an overall framework of actions to maximize
production, of improving income levels and of balancing regional growth, the
sector objectives of the Fourth Emergency Economic Action Plan (FEEAP),
1982-86, are (i) to expand irrigation; (ii) to modernize the sector;
(iii) to improve the marketing system; and (iv) to restructure price and
subsidy controls.
3.12     Because of the high unit cost of investment in irrigation, the FEEAP
allocates nearly two-thirds of the total sector investment budget of
CL150 million (US$300 million) to water development programs.l/ In addition,
the FEEAP includes the provision of about CL25 million (US$50 million) in
loans to farmers to facilitate, in conjunction with extension, further
modernization of the sector. The Government's strategy of promoting exports
is a sensible one considering the constraints imposed by a small domestic
market and the various comparative advantages of Cypriot agriculture.
Improvement of present export marketing, coordination of producers' and
exporters' efforts, and elaboration of a long-term export strategy is a
prerequisite for further large increases in agricultural exports.
3.13     The Plan recognizes that the financial and economic cost of a set of
price controls and subsidies in the sector has grown substantially, and, as a
result, the FEEAP includes, among agricultural policy objectives, "the
restructuring of controlled prices and subsidies with a view to increasing the
efficiency of the agricultural sector." In 1982, these subsidies corresponded
to about 28% of agricultural GDP. By far the most important subsidy was the
grain subsidy (CL18.7 million), caused by Government purchases of grain (wheat
and barley) at comparatively high prices from farms, coupled with substantial
imports of grain which are sold at less than import prices to food-processing
industries and feed-mixing firms, hence distorting the monetary value of feed
and food in relation to their real value. The wine subsidy is of much lesser
importance in aggregate terms (CL4.6 million). Irrigation subsidies amount to
about CL3 million.
Irrigation Charges and Their Legislation
3.14     Government operates presently 13 irrigation schemes:  the smallest
delivered, in 1983, 40,000 m3 water, the largest 15 MCM.  Total volume for
sale in 1983 amounted to 25.2 MCM. Total weighted average capital cost of
these schemes (discounted at 9% over 40 years) is CL 0.085/m3.  Their
weighted average of O&M cost amounts to CL 0.017/M3, making for a total
average unit cost of CL 0.102/m3 (1983 prices). In the same year, the

Five-Year Plan, 1982-86. IBRD Report No. 4069-CY (January 19, 1983).



-8-
average water charge was about CL 0.0251/m3; hence the average calculated
overall cost recovery was about 25% (for the notion of overall cost recovery
see paras 3.16 and 3.17 below). The Government, in past years, substantially
revised water charges; in 1979 the average rate was only about CL 0.010/m3.
In September 1983, rates were increased to about
CL 0.032/m3.  Hence, rates were nearly tripled in real terms over the past
four-year period.
3.15     The Government Waterworks Law of 1929 sets out the basic legislation
for irrigation water use and charges. The water rates according to this law
are decided by the Council of Ministers. For this purpose the Council of
Ministers may issue regulations which may include provisions for:
(a) "Fixing the maximum fees, rates, and any other money considerations,
which may be levied or collected on or from any person by virtue of
this Law, such fees, rates, or other money considerations being
capable of being fixed either per donum of land, or according to kind
of crop, or according to the volume or time of the water supplied or
used or according to the benefit accruing or capable of accruing to
any person or any property by the water or any waterworks.  Provided
that in fixing such maximum rates regard shall be had to:
(i) interest on capital expended; (ii) adequate provision for a
sinking fund and insurance of the works;  (iii) cost of repair and
maintenance and administration of the works.
(b)  Establishing a fund wherein shall be deposited all fees, rates, and
other monies and monetary penalties in respect of any waterworks, and
manner of disposal of such sums and generally the manner of operation
and control of such fund" (para 2a and 2b of Section 24)."
3.16     The rates or fees, according to para 3(a) of section 24 of the Law,
shall not be more than 40% of the weighted average cost of the water. In
special cases, taking into account the heavy expenditure on any waterworks or
special economic, technical, and social conditions prevailing in the project
area, the aforesaid rate may be increased up to 65% of the weighted average
cost of the water.   Such cases reflect the conditions of the inhabitants, the
kind of crops cultivated, soil fertility, irrigation methods practiced in the
area, and other similar and relevant data. The regulations for fixing rates
must be published in the Official Gazette of the Republic, and they are
effective from the date of publication.
3.17     The Government calculates the capital unit cost of water using the
present worth method of analysis. According to this method all capital costs
and water quantities that occur during the economic life of the project are
transformed (compounded in the case of past expenditure or quantity) into
present worth values and volumes accordingly, using a rate of interest
presently equal to 9%. This rate has been determined by the Council of
Ministers and is the maximum legal rate. In most cases the economic life of
the projects is assumed to be 45 years after commencing construction. The



-9-
capital unit cost of water is calculated by dividing the present worth of the
cost by the present worth value of the volume of water, both discounted at the
same rate. The O&M cost of the water is calculated using the actual annual
cost and the actual amount of water for sale in the year under consideration.
The weighted average unit cost is the sum of the weighted O&M unit cost plus
the weighted capital unit cost of the projects. It is important to note (i)
that the law defines cost recovery ratios in relation to the sum of O&M and of
capital costs and (ii) that these ratios are not necessarily economic cost
recovery indices. Responsibility for enforcement of the law is with the
District Officers who are also responsible for the assessment and collection
of water charges. Government reports no default in payment of irrigation
water charges.
Bank Involvement in the Agricultural Sector
3.18     The Bank has, so far, focused its lending to agriculture primarily on
the development of new and more efficient use of existing water resources, the
sector's most limiting physical factor. Second in priority has been the
increase of the sector's low labor productivity to promote productive
employment and to achieve a more equal distribution of economic growth among
sectors. The Bank's participation in the sector has also served as a catalyst
to attract development financing from other sources.
3.19     The Paphos Irrigation Project (Loan 960-CY, US$14 million), started
in 1974 and completed in 1982, provided essential irrigation infrastructure
mainly for export production and assisted in financing on-farm investments.
An OED project performance audit report was issued in December 1983. The
project was successfully implemented and farmers' use of the new facilities is
increasing rapidly. There were no major problems during implementation. The
ongoing Pitsilia Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1483-CY,
US$10 million), started in early 1977 and essentially completed at the end of
1983, emphasizes productive and social infrastructure investments directed
towards the poorest parts of Cyprus. The ongoing Vasilikos-Pendaskinos
Project (Loan 1658-CY, US$11 million), started in 1979, is intended to develop
water resources for irrigation and to reduce the shortages of domestic water
in the areas of Nicosia, Larnaca, and Famagusta. Both these projects are
progressing satisfactorily and demonstrate Government's ability to smoothly
implement large engineering projects. The Fruit and Vegetable Export Project
(Loan 1988-CY, US$14 million), started in 1981, complements previous Bank
investments in the sector by initiating a set of institutional and
organizational changes in the fruit and vegetable export trade and improving
the utilization of scarce water resources, creating further employment
opportunities and improving productivity. The marketing components of this
project which are coordinated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI)
have been slow to start, mainly due to the exporters' reluctance to group
themselves. However, the project marketing advisor is presently studying
alternative organizational arrangements (e.g. marketing boards) and will make
concrete proposals in the near future. The latest project undertaken so far,
the Khrysokhou Irrigation Project (Loan 2279-CY, US$14 million), will provide
irrigation on about 2,100 ha in western Cyprus. Construction is scheduled to
start early 1984.

IV. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
4.01      The area covered by the full-size Southern Conveyor Project for Water
Resources Development is shown on map IBRD 17484. It extends from the
Dhiarizos river catchment in the west, taking in the catchments of all rivers
draining the mountains of the Troodos massif eastwards to the Tremithios
river, and then extending north-eastwards to the east coast. In the center it
extends northwards to embrace Nicosia and its environs. Four administrative
districts are involved, Limassol, Larnaca, Famagusta, and Nicosia.
Population
4.02      In 1982, the three main towns of the project area, namely Nicosia,
Limassol, and Larnaca had a population totalling 310,000. The rural
population in the area is estimated to be in excess of 150,000. Therefore,
the population living in the project area is about 460,000 representing about
85% of the total population in the Government controlled part of Cyprus. In
addition, there are those residing at the two British sovereign base areas
within the project area and the large numbers of short-term foreign tourists
totalling over 300,000 in 1982 and expected to reach around one million by
2010 in the project area alone. These tourist totals represent a permanent
annual equivalent of around 15,000 and 50,000 respectively.
Soils
4.03      Although lowland soil textures tend to be on the heavy side, internal
drainage is generally good owing to the well developed structure. Except for
areas close to salt lakes, the watertable is well below the soil surface and
artificial drainage is not necessary. The selection of project irrigation
areas was directed towards the most suitable land, and despite the need to
delineate reasonably compact blocks for irrigation, class I and II land
(according to the US Bureau of Reclamation classification) account for 73% of
the total delineated area. Given good management, all land classes suitable
for irrigation are capable of producing sustained high yields of a wide range
of crops.
Water Resources
4.04      There are seven catchments in the project area, the most important
being Kouris, Dhiarizos, Khapotami, and Yermasoyia, with a combined mean
annual runoff of 140 MCM, of which some 80 MCM will be available to the
Southern Conveyor project. In general, the most important catchments are
located in the western part of the project area, where there is surplus of
water, while the eastern part is much drier with considerable water deficit.
4.05      Within the project area there are three major aquifers each extending
over an area in excess of 40 kmz (Akrotiri, Kiti, and Kokkinokhoria), and
seven other recognizable aquifers ranging in extent from 1 to 30 km2.
Although the water balance of several of the aquifers is rather precarious,
with seawater intrusion gradually extending in places, it is the Kokkinokhoria
aquifer which is in a dire situation due to overexploitation. Since 1960,



-11-
when groundwater abstractions commenced on a commercial scale, depletion of
the reserves has averaged 10 MCM/a so that now only 15%-20% of the original
reserves remain. Due to the decline in watertable, seawater is now intruding
around the coastal fringe, thus destroying potential freshwater storage
areas. Some 2,500 boreholes, most of them private, are in operation in the
Kokkinokhoria aquifer irrigating 7,100 ha with around 25 MCM/a of water of
deteriorating quality, pumped from ever increasing (and thus costlier)
depths.
Water Supply Aspects
4.06     Population projections.  Population projections in the project area
as prepared by WDD and reviewed and accepted by the Statistics and Research
Department of the Ministry of Finance are shown in Annex 2, Table 1, and

The annual population growth rates in the SCP area have been assumed to be
1.6% for the years 1982-1990, 1.1% for 1991-2000, and 0.7% for 2001-2010.  The
population data have been prepared in the light of master plans for urban
development and regional statistical analysis, taking into account factors
such as growth potential, land availability and touristic, agricultural, and
industrial developments.
4.07     Population served and standard of services.  The total population in
urban and rural areas is served by piped water supplies. Existing water
supply systems are shown on map IBRD 17484. The water supply in Nicosia and
Larnaca has for some years, particularly during the summer season, been
intermittent and the rapidly increasing water demand for Limassol is
approaching its maximum water production capacity. The village water supply
in the Famagusta area is mainly based on groundwater which, because of
overpumping, is increasingly turning saline. The Khirokitia water treatment
plant is the only existing one, operating since 1974. In general, all
existing water supply systems are well maintained and operated.

Water consumption for tourism is added separately and has been assumed to be
500 lcd. The above projections were based on the following considerations:
(a) For Urban Areas
(i)   the feasibility report on household water demand projections had
assumed an increase to 180 lcd by 2010, but this figure was
subsequently revised to 160 lcd after taking into account the high
cost of the water; the assumed increase in water demand would
approximate 1% per year, which is reasonable when compared to a
projected annual increase of 4% in GNP;
(ii)   the industrial/commercial water consumption averages about 16% of
water consumed and its increase is estimated at about 2.3% per
year.   This consumption would be less price sensitive than the
household water demand;
(iii)   the unaccounted for water is expected to decrease only gradually
from the present level of 25% (which is a reasonable level for
countries with similar conditions to those in Cyprus) to about 20%
by 2010, through improved operation and leak detection.
(b) For Rural Areas
(i)   The household water consumption, which also includes minor
industrial and commercial water use, in the Famagusta area has been
assumed to be higher than in the other areas because of the greater
impact of tourism on its economic development;
(ii)   The unaccounted-for-water has been assumed to be maintained at the
very satisfactory level of 16%.

2010             60.9              26.0             34.9
Agricultural Aspects
4.10     Agricultural use of land  In the lowlands the main differentiation
relates to water availability and there are four basic categories of land
use: (i) rainfed cropping, principally comprising cereals; (ii) seasonally
irrigated cropping, often in rotation with rainfed crops and usually including
vegetables and potatoes; (iii) perennially irrigated orchards, mostly citrus
or table grapes; and (iv) fallow. Specialization in the production of
irrigated crops already occurs in many areas. Throughout the lowlands
livestock also plays a significant role in the overall economy, but tends to
be concentrated in specialized units rather than being integrated in the
arable farms.
4.11     Farm structure and tenure  Farm holdings throughout the project area
are generally small. The average size of holding in the areas likely to
benefit from irrigation is around 5 ha, ranging from 2.7 ha in the Akrotiri
area to 12.4 ha in the Kiti/Mazotos areas. Without irrigation these small
farms are usually insufficient to provide a livelihood to the full-time
farming family. In addition to their small overall size, holdings are usually
fragmented, consisting on average of five plots or more. Thus, it is
difficult to introduce large-scale mechanization, and land consolidation
measures are being increasingly adopted.
4.12     Turkish Cypriot land holdings occur throughout the study area except
in Kokkinokhoria. The former land use pattern on Turkish Cypriot land
differed little from that of the Greek Cypriots. Since 1974, the majority of
these holdings has been leased by refugees who grow annual crops, the planting
of permanent perennials only being permitted in extraordinary cases; uprooting
permanent crops on Turkish Cypriot land is not permitted.
4.13     Existing Irrigation in the Project Area.  Since 1966 a number of
irrigation schemes have been or are in the process of being developed. These
are as follows (Map IBRD 17484):
1/ Year for the commissioning of the VPP.
2/ This signifies a temporary reallocation of water from irrigation to
domestic supply.



-14-
(i) Pissouri project. Completed in 1981, this project provides for
late-winter and spring irrigation by portable sprinklers on about
800 ha of table grapes;
(ii) Yermasoyia-Polemidhia project. This project includes a pressurized
distribution system completed in 1978 and commands some 1,900 ha west
of Limassol;
(iii) Kiti project. A surface irrigation system of concrete canaletti
commanding 660 ha and supplied from Kiti reservoir was completed in
1966. Because of irregular flows and leakages, the reservoir
principally provides groundwater recharge;
(iv) Vasilikos-Pendaskinos project. This Bank-assisted project, in
process of implementation, will provide domestic water for Nicosia
and develop modern irrigation systems on 1,265 ha.
4.14     Potential Irrigation Development Areas.  Irrigation potential exists
in all lower elevation southern coastal areas, a guideline being that land at
lower elevations should be selected so as to ensure irrigation by gravity,
wherever possible. However, since one of the main objectives is to sustain
irrigation in the Kokkinokhoria area, priority has been accorded to this
region even though some pumping will be involved. The total area identified
as suitable for irrigation is about 27,000 ha while, at full development of
the Southern Conveyor Project (SCP), there will only be sufficient water to
irrigate about one third of this.
4.15     Agricultural Research.  Facilities for undertaking agricultural
research are reasonably developed and center on the Agricultural Research
Institute (ARI) based near Nicosia. There are two research substations
especially concerned with irrigated agriculture in southern Cyprus: the 26 ha
Akhelia Horticultural Research Station near Paphos and a new 7 ha site,
currently under development within the area of the VPP. At these stations
there is special emphasis on citrus and other fruit trees and vegetables. The
program of work is mainly devoted to applied research. In addition, the
Department of Agriculture undertakes trials on farmers' fields, though
principally concerned with demonstrations of proven techniques.
4.16     Extension Service.  This operates from the three District
Agricultural Offices (DAO) responsible for sectors of the delineated SCP areas
- Limassol, Larnaca, and Famagusta - backed by 17 specialist sections (e.g.
plant protection, soils, water use) operating out of Nicosia. Apart from the
officers in charge, there are 40 subject matter specialists based in Nicosia
plus a further 18 in the three districts. Each of the districts is divided up
into several smaller areas, according to size and intensity of land use; these
are termed "beats". Each beat, comprising from four to twenty villages, is
served by an agricultural beat officer. The average number of villages and of
farmers per beat officer are 13 and 1,500, respectively. There are two beat
officers within each of the three DAOs (i.e. six in all) who are specifically
responsible for extension within sections of the delineated SCP area.
Extension staff operating within the SCP areas include the staffing for the
VPP office. Extension methods have recently developed a greater emphasis on
personal contacts, in-depth group training at the two farmers' training
centers, and more intensive use of bulletins and mass media. Use is made of
specialized, short training courses at the village level, field trips, trials,
demonstrations, and local lectures.

V. THE FULL-SIZE SOUTHERN CONVEYOR PROJECT FOR WATER RESOURCES
DEVELOPMENT(SCP) AND ITS PHASING
Project Concept and Alternatives
5.01     The problem of meeting Cyprus' medium and long term water needs is a
complex one. In principle, the objectives are: (i) to meet very urgent
domestic water needs and keep up with increasing demand thereafter; (ii) to
maintain highly productive irrigation from a mined and threatened aquifer
(Kokkinokhoria) and (iii), if feasible, to expand irrigated crop production
elsewhere. In economic terms, the net marginal benefits of water in these
three applications are estimated to be about CL 0.500/m3, CL 0.395/m3 and
CL 0.350/m3, respectively (1983 values)(para 8.45).
5.02     In principle, these requirements can be met, wholly or partly, from
one or more of the following sources; (i) desalinization of seawater; (ii)
contraction or elimination of irrigation in the Vasilikos/Pendaskinos Project
(VPP) and Kokkinokhoria perimeters; (iii) construction of a single purpose
domestic water supply project fed by a small Kouris dam and (iv) construction
of a dual purpose, domestic/irrigation supply project fed by a larger Kouris
dam.
5.03     The present cost of seawater desalinization (CL 3/m3, US$ 6/m3)
is virtually an order of magnitude larger than the cost of water produced
under any of the other alternatives. This effectively rules out the first
option. Reallocation of irrigation water in the VPP to domestic uses would
not materially relieve the domestic water shortage. Furthermore, irrigation
in VPP is economically justified (net marginal product of about CL
0.350/m3), apart from the fact that such reallocation would be unacceptable
on social and political grounds.
5.04     As to the Kokkinokhoria aquifer, the cost of groundwater, measured in
terms of net economic value of agricultural production foregone, is about CL
0.395/m3, plus conveyance costs to the urban areas of about CL 0.150/m3,
making for a total cost at least 10% above the estimated marginal value of
domestic water. Measured in terms of net economic value added foregone, i.e.
accounting for the permanent loss of agricultural employment, the cost of
transferring that water to urban use would be more than 30% above the marginal
value of domestic water. Furthermore, the safe yield of that aquifer is
estimated to be only 8 MCM/a, whereas domestic water demand in 1990 is
estimated to be as much as 11 MCM/a, and would be doubled three years
thereafter.
5.05     Subsequently, the economics of a single purpose domestic water supply
project, consisting of a reduced size Kouris dam and conveyor, were analyzed.
Such project was found to have a net present value (NPV), discounted at the
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 12%, or about CL 3.4 million.
5.06     The economics of the dual purpose project were then examined.  Such
project captures all surface resources in the Kouris reservoir and produces
water in excess of domestic demand, which is therefore available for
irrigation. The marginal benefits of such project, measured against those of
the single purpose domestic water project, far outweigh its marginal cost;



-16-
the NPV of the full dual purpose proiect, executed in two phases is estimated
to be CL 17.0 million. Of all options summarized above, this one can meet the
stated objectives (para 5.01) and maximizes overall net economic benefits.
The option thus selected constitutes the Southern Conveyor Scheme for Water
Resources Development (SCP); it would supply about 70 MCM/a.
5.07     In turn, within the SCP, various alternative technical and phasing
solutions are, in principle, available. The immediate water production
objectives are to satisfy medium-term domestic water demand and to preserve
irrigated crop production in the Kokkinokhoria area. These priorities are
consistent with the estimated net marginal benefits of water in both
applications (para 5.01). Meeting these objectives constitutes Phase I of the
SCP; this phase would produce about 33 MCM/a.
5.08     The justification for phasing is two fold.  First, since net marginal
product of domestic water is higher than irrigation water, maximizing the
economic benefits of the overall project requires that the development of
domestic demand, not irrigation needs, determines the commencement of Phase
II. Second, phasing allows to stretch over a longer time the very large
investments. By 1992, increased urban demand requires that supplementary
Phase II supplies are available. Because of the bulkiness of the works,
however, there will be in Phase II for a long time a substantial surplus over
domestic requirements. Though of lesser economic benefit per unit of water
(para 5.01), this surplus can be beneficially allocated to irrigation
expansion along the main conveyor. In summary, the proposed phasing and the
timing of Phase II are such as to maximize overall economic benefits.
5.09     Below follows a detailed description of SCP objectives and
components. The various technical alternatives examined within the overall
concept of the project, i.e. river diversion vs dam, one-stage vs two-stage
dam, single vs twin conveyor, phasing of treatment works etc., are summarized
thereafter.
SCP Objectives
5.10     The Southern Conveyor Project for Water Resources Development (SCP),
when fully developed, will collect and store surplus water from the south
catchments of the island and convey this water to areas of demand for both
domestic water supply and irrigation. An additional source of water for
irrigation could be at a later stage the effluents from a proposed tertiary
sewage treatment plant for Limassol. In total, SCP will provide an
incremental water supply of about 70 MCM/a which ultimately will be allocated
to domestic supply and irrigation in varying proportions (Annex 1, Table 3).
5.11     The main SCP objectives at full development would be:
(a) to secure a safe domestic water supply until at least the year 2010
to the four major population areas (Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca, and
Famagusta), which combined represent 72% (435,000) of the present
population of the Greek part of the island and which is projected to
increase to 80% (589,000) by 2010; water will also continue to be
provided to the Turkish Cypriots in Nicosia and Famagusta and their
consumption is estimated at 12% of total consumption in the project
area;



-17-
(b) to provide irrigation water in order to maintain present agricultural
production in Kokkinokhoria in a gross area of 5,125 ha and to expand
irrigated agriculture in four other areas along the southern coast of
the island, totaling about 3,000 ha gross;
(c) to implement policies and take institutional measures in order to
improve overall cost recovery through increased revenues and to
further enhance the efficient use of both domestic and irrigation
water and to establish an integrated institutional framework so as to
ensure the efficient use of water resources and the uniform
application of policy measures.
SCP Components at Full Development
5.12     SCP at full development will comprise the following components:
(a) Kouris reservoir, with a gross capacity of 115 MCM behind the 103 m
high earthfill Kouris dam;
(b) main conveyor, a 110 km long pipeline, ranging in diameter from 1400
mm to 800 mm, running from Kouris reservoir to Akhna reservoir,
including connecion with VPP;
(c) Akhna terminal reservoir, with a gross capacity of 5.8 MCM behind the
16 m high Akhna dam;
(d) Dhiarizos diversion, conveying water from Dhiarizos river through a
16 km long, pressurized pipeline and tunnel to Kouris reservoir,
collecting water from Khapotami river en route;
(e) tertiary sewage treatment plant at Limassol, as a source for
additional water supply for irrigation;
(f) pressurized irrigation distribution networks on about 8,125 ha;
(g) domestic water supply works, for urban and rural areas, consisting of
water treatment works, river aquifer development, pumping stations,
transmission mains, and storage tanks;
(h) central control system, operated jointly with the Vasilikos-
Pendaskinos project;
(i) project administration, buildings, equipment, and workshops; and
(j) study, to determine the appropriate structure for the establishment
of the water entity.
Full SCP Cost
5.13     The full Southern Conveyor Project for Water Resources Development
requires an implementation period of about ten years. The cost of the full
project, estimated at 1983 prices 1/, including physical contingencies, is
CL127 million (US$254 million) of which CL43 million (US$86 million) are local
cost and CL84 million (US$168 million) foreign cost. Cost estimates are given
separately for Phase I (1984 prices) in Annex 1, Table 1 and for Phase II
(1983 prices) in Annex 1, Table 2.
if Cost estimates for Phase I were later updated to 1984 prices.



-18-
Evaluation of Technical and Phasing Alternatives
5.14     Different alternatives regarding technical solutions and the phasing
of major project components have been subjected to a least-cost analysis.
This is summarized below.
5.15     Diversion at Kouris with full-size conveyor.  This alternative
considered the maximum possible delay in the construction of the Kouris dam.
In an "average year" the divertable water from Kouris was estimated at 21 MCM
which is considerably lower than the demand of 33.4 MCM for water supply and
irrigation projected for in year 1992 (Annex 1, Table 3). Even if the
irrigation demand for Kokkinokhoria is reduced to 9 MCM (to assure irrigation
of just the winter crop of potatoes in part of the area) the water demand for
the year 1992 will be 25.4 MCM. This alternative was rejected since (i) the
"average year" flow is inadequate to satisfy the demands, is subject to
significant variations, and does not provide satisfactory reliability; and
(ii) operational difficulties could occur because of seasonal high
sediment-laden water.
5.16 Phasing of the construction of the Kouris dam. The full-size dam with a
storage capacity of 100 MCM (net) was designed to store the annual flows of
the Kouris river and its tributaries, as well as those of two other western
rivers that would be captured later via the construction of Dhiarizos
diversion. Since the net mean annual inflow at the damsite (without the
Dhiarizos diversion) is 40 MCM, it was considered that for Phase I a dam of a
storage capacity of 65-70 MCM would be sufficient to provide the safe annual
supply of 40 MCM. However, it was found that the investment cost for a
reduced-size dam would be only 7% less than for a full-size dam, while the
dam, if built in two stages, would cost 28% more than if built in one stage
only. Since by the year 1993 it will be necessary to have on stream the
Dhiarizos diversion and the full-size dam, the alternative of a reduced-size
dam for Phase I is not economically justified.
5.17     Phasing of the construction of the conveyor.  A possible phased
extension of the main conveyor to match the gradual increase in the water
demand was evaluated. Because of the soil and topographic situation the
conveyor could feasibly be twinned only on a length of about 55 km. Because
of the progressive and rapid increase in water demand the full conveyor
capacity should be operational not later than 1993. A cost comparison based
on present values of relevant investment and operational items showed that a
phased conveyor would be about 13% more expensive (at a discount rate of 12%)
than a non-phased conveyor.
5.18     Water treatment works and their phasing.  Treatment works were
initially proposed to be constructed for the areas of Limassol, Larnaca and
Nicosia, and Famagusta (Ormidhia) to supplement the existing Khirokitia plant
and the Kornos plant presently under construction. Based on a cost
comparison analysis it was decided to omit the Ormidhia plant and the future
domestic water demand in the Famagusta area would instead be covered by the
extended Khirokitia plant.
5.19     The Limassol water supply is presently partly based on water
infiltration and subsequent extraction from the Yermasoyia river bed. This
arrangement is proposed to be extended and the timing for the need of a water



-19-
treatment plant will partly depend on the operational experience to be
obtained. The extension of a water treatment plant has been concluded to be
deferred to a later stage.
5.20     The Tersephanou treatment plant will be located in the Larnaca area
but will also serve the Nicosia area. A comparative cost analysis has shown
the feasibility to extend the Khirokitia treatment works and also to provide
for river bed infiltration and extraction arrangements similar to those for
the Limassol area. This would enable a postponement of the construction of
the Tersephanou treatment works to a later stage.
5.21     The Khirokitia water treatment works are currently receiving water
from existing dams. At the time the VPP will be commissioned the water will
instead be provided from the Kalavassos dam (VPP) and later by the SCP. The
Khirokitia treatment works will be extended in a first phase, and two booster
pumping stations along the existing transmission main to the Famagusta area
will have to be provided at a later date.
Proposed Phasing of the Southern Conveyor Project
5.22     Phase I would include the full-size Kouris dam, the full-size
conveyor, the irrigation system for Kokkinokhoria, the extension of the
Khirokitia treatment works, intermediary arrangements for river aquifer
infiltration and extraction for the Limassol and Larnaca areas and extensions
of rural water supply works on a priority basis. All other works would be
postponed to Phase II. Phase I, which would be the subject of the proposed
Bank project, would be executed over a six-year period, 1984-1989, while the
remaining works would be included in Phase II and be executed over a five-year
period 1988-1992 with a two-year overlapping with Phase I.

VI. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Brief Description
6.01     The proposed Bank project will include Phase I of the SCP and would
consist of the following components:
(a) Construction of the Kouris dam to its ultimate capacity of 115 MCM
(gross) to store flows from Kouris, Zyghos, and Kryos rivers.
(b) Construction of the main conveyor to its ultimate capacity of a total
length of 110 km, to convey water from Kouris dam to the demand
points along the southern coast, up to Akhna reservoir.
(c) Construction of the Akhna terminal reservoir to regulate water
deliveries for irrigation in Kokkinokhoria.
(d) Construction of pressurized irrigation distribution networks at
Kokkinokhoria, covering a gross area of 5,125 ha.
(e) Construction of a connecting pipeline 2 km long from the main
conveyor to the VPP to increase operational flexibility through the
integration of the VPP and SCP systems.
(f) Development of the Yermasoyia river bed aquifer for a capacity of
about 10 MCM by the construction of a subsurface dam, boreholes with
pumping plants, chlorination facilities, and transmission mains.
(g) Development of the Tremithios riverbed aquifer at Larnaca for a
capacity of about 3 MCM with the same arrangements as under (f).
(h) Extension of the Khirokitia water treatment works and village water
supply works mainly consisting of transmission mains and storage
tanks and to improve the water supply for a rural population of about
100,000.
(i) Establishment of a central control system, to be operated jointly
with VPP with telemetric transmission for monitoring and control.
(j) Land acquisition including resettlement for villagers displaced by
the construction of Kouris dam.
(k) Land consolidation in part of the Kokkinokhoria area.
(1) Project administration, including office buildings, workshops, office
equipment, and vehicles.
(m) Consultant services for construction supervision and project
management and for final design of Phase II.
(n) Study to review existing organization and management of Cyprus' water
resources and to determine and recommend an appropriate structure for
an entity with responsibility for the development, management and
allocation of all water resources as well as the operation and
maintenance of all major water supply schemes for both domestic water
and irrigation.



-21-
Detailed Features
6.02     Kouris Dam.  The earthfilled dam will be 103 m high with 560 m crest
length having a volume of about 8.3 million m3. The gross storage capacity
of the reservoir is 115 MCM of which 15 MCM will be left for dead storage to
provide for siltation over the life of the project. The dam will be
constructed with a central clay core and upstream and downstream shells of
river gravel. The spillway will be of the open channel type with a design
flood of 1,500 m3/s and a probable maximum flood of 2,600 m3/s 1'. The
draw-off arrangements designed for a peak discharge of 3.77 m3/s consist of
the intake tower and a 1,200 mm diameter pipe laid in the diversion tunnel.
The inflow to the reservoir will be from the 300 km2 catchment area upstream
the dam which covers the Kouris, Kryos, and Zyghos rivers watersheds. The
Kouris dam will be the largest dam ever constructed in Cyprus. Installation
of a small hydropower plant was found to be uneconomical-2.
6.03     Main Conveyor.  This pressurized 110 km pipeline, with a diameter
varying from 1,400 mm to 800 mm, will connect the Kouris reservoir with the
Akhna terminal reservoir including along the way several branch pipelines for
water supply. The conveyor, which has been designed to enable gravity flow,
will generally follow the coastline and will be buried throughout its length.
The peak flow of the conveyor is about 3.8 m3/s at the outlet of Kouris dam,
reduced progressively to 0.5 m3/s in its last section supplying water to the
Akhna reservoir. In order to avoid excessive static head and water hammer
pressure, break-pressure tanks have been provided at four different
locations. Two pipe materials, steel and ductile iron, have been evaluated
and, according to the present assessment, ductile iron would be the most
economical. However, at the tendering stage the option will be left open for
both materials with the final decision to be made at tender evaluation.
6.04     Akhna Reservoir.  This reservoir is required to balance the water
supplies from the Kouris dam with the irrigation demand of the Kokkinokhoria
area. The 16 m high dam, creating a reservoir capacity of 5.8 MCM, will be a
homogeneous earth embankment with impervious fill material. After deduction
of evaporation and seepage losses, the usable storage capacity of the
reservoir will be 5.3 MCM, which is adequate to balance the supply and the
requirements for the irrigation of Kokkinokhoria.
6.05     The VPP Connection.  Water will be diverted from the main conveyor to
a balancing reservoir of 100,000 m3 of the Vasilikos-Pendaskinos project
through a 2 km gravity pipeline of 600 mm in diameter. This water, estimated
at about 6 MCM/a will be used for the irrigation of the Vasilikos area. In
exchange an equal amount of water from the Kalavassos dam will be diverted for
domestic use in Nicosia and Famagusta through the Kornos and Khirokitia
treatment plants.
1/ The spillway is designed as a service spillway to accommodate the inflow
design flood of 1,500 m3/s; an emergency spillway will also be added to
accommodate the total inflow flood of up to 2,600 m3/s in case this maximum
probable flood will occur.
2/ Southern Conveyor Project; Hydroelectric Power, MANR, November 1981.



-22-
6.06     Kokkinokhoria Irrigation.  About 17 MCM/a of water from the SCP will
be used for the irrigation of a gross area of 5,125 ha in Kokkinokhoria. It
is estimated that groundwater underlying the delineated area will yield safely
an additional 1.5 MCM/a. The total available water of 18.5 MCM/a is
considered sufficient to sustain present agricultural production in the area.
Water will be supplied throughout the year from the main conveyor and
seasonally from Akhna reservoir to 48 central distribution points (CDP), each
comprising an operational reservoir.  Groundwater from selected, licensed, and
metered boreholes, operated either by their owners or by farmers organizations
(Irrigation Divisions) will be pumped to the CDPs and mixed with the SCP
water. A small pumping station will be constructed at each CDP which will
boost the water through the downstream network and provide sufficient pressure
for operation of the on-farm systems.
6.07     The distribution network downstream of the CDPs will consist of
asbestos pipes up to the irrigation hydrants. Each hydrant will serve a
number of farmers who will irrigate on rotation using the whole flow delivered
at the hydrant. Project water supplied to CDPs will be measured upstream of
the distribution reservoirs, but the management and distribution of water
downstream of the CDPs will be the responsibility of the farmers. To this
effect Irrigation Divisions would be formed (according to the Irrigation
Division Law) which will be based in the villages. Land consolidation will be
applied only in the Larnaca district on an area of about 1,800 ha since
Famagusta district cannot be covered (the deeds are under custody of the
Turkish-Cypriot administration).
6.08     Land Acquisition and Compensation for Resettlement.  Land acquisition
will be required for the construction of Kouris dam, main conveyor, Akhna dam,
and the Kokkinokhoria irrigation networks. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the Government will take the necessary action to acquire all
land required for carrying out the project by December 31, 1984.
6.09     Compensation for resettlement will be paid to the inhabitants of the
small Khalassa village which will be inundated by the Kouris reservoir. The
resettlement cost has been calculated on the basis of the present market value
of the land and houses that will be lost. The number of households which will
be affected by the inundation in Khalassa village is 55. The Department of
Agriculture has already identified the resettlement site and plans for site
development have been designed and undertaken in close consultation with the
villagers. The training of affected farmers for employment in other sectors
will be considered within the framework of the overall training program of the
Government.
6.10     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government will
make arrangements satisfactory for the Bank for the relocation of the
residents of the Khalassa village not later than December 31, 1984 and that
affected people will be adequately compensated.
Water Availability
6.11     The reservoir inflows from the Kouris catchments will yield on
average 44.5 MCM/a. Evaporation and seepage losses from the reservoir are
estimated at an average of 4.4 MCM/a. Therefore, the net amount of water that
will be available from Kouris reservoir during Phase I of SCP will be on



-23-
average 40.1 MCM/a. The construction of Kouris dam will significantly affect
the replenishment of Akrotiri aquifer, where the safe yield will be reduced
from 14 MCM/a to 6 MCM/a. In addition, the Mavromata springs with a 2 MCM/a
yield will be flooded by the Kouris reservoir and the spate irrigation
downstream the Kouris river will also be affected. In total about 11.4 MCM/a,
representing compensation for riparian rights, should be provided from SCP.
This would reduce the net amount available for SCP from the Kouris dam to
28.7 MCM/a. On the other hand, the possibility of storing a considerable
amount of water in the Kouris reservoir will allow a more efficient operation
of the Yermasoyia reservoir. It is expected that the average yield from this
dam will increase from the current 11.5 MCM/a to 15 MCM/a immediately after
the commission of the Kouris dam. Thus, the incremental net amount of water
that will be available from Kouris and Yermasoyia dams combined (without the
Dhiarizos diversion) to cover domestic and irrigation demands during Phase I
of the SCP will be on average 32.2 MCM/a (Annex 1, Table 3). Domestic and
irrigation demands from SCP during Phase I are estimated at 13.3 MCM/a in the
year 1989 and will progressively increase to 33.4 MCM/a in the year 1992
(Annex 1, Table 3). The comparison of the projected supply and demand figures
during this period shows that, on average, the demand can be met. Assuming
that impoundment of the dam will start in the 1987-88 wet season, the
probability of meeting all yearly demands during Phase I is estimated at 95%.
6.12     After completion of the Dhiarizos diversion and the Limassol tertiary
sewage treatment plant (Phase II) the net incremental amount of water from SCP
will be 59.5 MCM/a in 1993 and will increase gradually to 69.5 MCM/a in 2017.
The domestic and irrigation demand from SCP is estimated at 43.1 MCM/a in 1993
and will progressively increase to 68.6 MCM/a in 2020. Thus, in average
rainfall years the future water demand can be met. However, in the rare event
that 3-4 consecutive dry years occur at the later period of the life of the
project, when the demand is high, water shortages might occur. Raising the
Kouirs dam to increase its storage capacity and prevent water shortages is not
considered to be an economic solution, since it will involve substantial
investments at the early implementation stage of the project. If water
shortages were to occur they could be alleviated by temporarily using the
water stored in the main aquifers of Akrotiri, Yermasoyia and Kokkonokhoria
(the latter is expected to be restored by that time). To this effect,
Government agreed to carry out studies and engineering design for the
recharging of the aquifers during water spills from Kouris and Yermasoyia dams
and to prepare emergency plans and operating rules for the joint use of
surface and ground water (including mining of the aquifers for short periods)
during water shortages. Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.
Status of Engineering
6.13     Final design and tender documents for the Kouris dam have been
prepared by SOGREAH Consultant (France) and approved by the Government and the
Bank. Final design and tender documents for the main conveyor, Akhna
reservoir, Kokkinokhoria irrigation systems, and connection of main conveyor
with the Vasilikos-Pendaskinos scheme have been prepared by the Water
Development Department in collaboration with Sir William Halcrow and Partners
Consultants (UK). Design for the extension of the Khirokitia water treatment
works for village water supply and for the Yermasoyia and Tremithios aquifer
works, will be prepared in due course by the Water Development Department with
consultant assistance, as needed.



-24-
Consultant Services
6.14     Provision is made in the project for consultant services as follows:
(a) Project management during implementation period: Two project
managers, one for Kouris dam and the other for the Main Conveyor and
Kokkinokhoria Irrigation will be recruited, to assist the government
in the coordination of activities related to the implementation of
the project. Both managers will stay for a period after completion
of works to assist in the commissioning, initial operation, and
management of the project. Consultants for these posts have already
been prequalified.
(b) Construction supervision: Government will recruit one resident
engineer and two assistant engineers for the supervision of the
Kouris dam and one resident engineer and three assistant engineers
for the supervision of the Main Conveyor, Akhna dam, and irrigation
networks at Kokkinokhoria. The resident and assistant engineers will
be provided from the consulting firms which carried out the design
i.e. for Kouris dam from SOGREAH (France) and for Main Conveyor,
Akhna dam, and irrigation networks from Sir William Halcrow
Ltd.(England). Agreements for the provision of consultants for the
construction supervision have already been signed with both the
consulting firms.
(c) Design for Phase II: Provision was also made for consultant services
for the preparation of design and tender documents for Phase II.
(d) Short-term specialists: Provision also was made for short-term
specialists who may be required to solve particular technical
problems.
6.15   In total it is expected that some 444 man months of expatriate
consultants and 288 man months of local consultants will be required for the
implementation of the project. Expatriate consultants' average cost was
estimated at US$8,250 per month including fees, overhead, international travel
and subsistence. The consultants will be supported by a team of Cypriot
technicians and by sufficient administrative accounting and secretarial
staff. Terms and conditions of the appointment of consultants will be subject
to Bank's approval. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that consultants
as above will be appointed by the Government according to the Bank Guidelines.
Safety of Dam
6.16   The panel of experts, which was designated by the Government to review
the plans and designs and provide guidance during the construction of the
Vasilikos-Pendaskinos dams (Loan 1658-CY), was also assigned to review the
designs of the Kouris dam and for review and inspection of the Kouris dam
construction. Assurances were obtained from the Government during
negotiations that this panel of experts which is acceptable to the Bank, will
be retained for the Kouris dam to inspect the dam at least twice a year during
construction; once on the completion of the dam, annually for the next five
years, and, thereafter, every five years.

Cost Estimates
6.17   Cost estimates for Phase I are based on the quantities of work for each
component computed by the consultants and the WDD and reviewed during
appraisal. The unit costs were based on detailed cost analysis and
information obtained of similar works recently tendered in Cyprus as of
January 1984 A factor of 10-15% was used for physical contingencies for
various civil works components depending upon the level of design and the
complexity of construction works. Price contingency estimates assume an
increase in local currency costs of 6% per annum (based on expected domestic
inflation) and in foreign exchange costs of 7.5% in 1984, 7Z in 1985, and 6%
per annum thereafter. Total costs thus estimated are CL 101.1 million
(US$202.3 million) including physical and price contingencies. The foreign
exchange component has been estimated at CL69 million (US$138 million) or 68%
of the total costs. The project costs are free of taxes and duties as these
are not levied on goods and services destined for public projects. The cost
estimates are summarized below and shown in detail in Annex 1, Table 1.

Project Financing
6.18     Cyprus will be the borrower for loans required to finance the project.
The Government will provide from its own resources funds for financing the local
expenditure component estimated at US$64.3 million. A World Bank loan of US$27
million will finance part of the foreign exchange component, estimated at US$138
million. This leaves a financing gap of US$ 111 million for which co-financing
assistance was sought by the Government. In this connection a co-financier's
meeting was held in Paris in December 1983 in which the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development and the European Investment Bank (EIB) participated. The
Kuwait Fund agreed in principle to provide an amount of US$ 10 million
equivalent. It was also agreed that Cyprus will take the necessary steps to



-26-
obtain a contribution of about US$28 million equivalent to the project under a
protocol agreement with EIB. Government plans to finance the remaining foreign
exchange gap of US$73 million mainly through suppliers' credits (US$68
millionl). The relatively small amount of the remaining gap (US$5 million) would
be readily covered through the Government's regular borrowing from the
international financial markets. A condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan
is that (i) all conditions for the effectiveness of a co-financing agreement in
an amc,unt of US$28 million for the Kouris dam have been fulfilled, and (ii) the
Kuwail. Fund Agreement for about US$10 million has been signed. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the Government will conclude co-financing
agreements (including export credits) amounting to about US$40 million by
December 31, 1984 and for the remaining financing gap by December 31, 1985 and
that such agreements will become effective by June 30, 1986. These dates were
selected to ensure timely availability of funds in accordance with the project
implementation schedule. The financing plan as presented by the Government to
the Bank at negotiations is as follows::
Amount

Procurement
6.19     The Bank loan of US$27 million will be used for financing the foreign
cost for Kouris Dam (partly), Akhna reservoir, consultants and office
equipment. Procurement of these components will be carried out in accordance
with the current Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank loans. Domestic
preference will apply to goods manufactured locally. Contracts exceeding
US$350,000 for equipment and US$1,000,000 for civil works will be subject to
ICB, and bidding documents will be sent to the Bank for prior review. For
other contracts local competitive bidding will be accepted. Bank financed
contracts and procurement arrangements are shown below: (figures include

6.22                  The Bank's historical disbursement profiles for Cyprus,
covering the period FY71-81, were considered in formulating the aforementioned
estimates. Disbursements for the proposed project are expected to be faster
than the historical ones because (i) the nine and a half year country average
disbursement profile includes the year 1974 when, due to the events in Cyprus,
activities were seriously affected for at least two years; (ii) the tender for
Kouris dam was issued in October 1983 and the award of the contract is
expected to take place in June 1984, therefore, disbursements could start
immediately after the loan effectiveness; (iii) the consultants for
supervision of construction have already been selected. The closing date of
the loan will be December 31, 1990.
Environmental Impact
6.23                  The construction of the Kouris dam will not have any
serious negative effect on the environment. On the contrary, the artificial
lake will provide an attraction to people and could be developed to an
important recreation center. There are no archeological monuments in the area
to be covered with water. The inhabitants of the few village houses that will
be submerged will be fully compensated for their loss (para 6.09). Increase
of water supply implies increased sewage disposal, which could impose a



-28-
problem but only in densely populated urban areas where on-site excreta
disposal and infiltration arrangements are inadequate. However, this matter
will be handled through the extension of the Nicosia sewerage and sewage
disposal system and through the proposed implementation of such systems in
Limassol and Larnaca.

VII. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
Implementation Schedule
7.01     Phase I of the project would be implemented over a six-year period
starting from June 1984. The tender for the construction of the Kouris dam
was issued in October 1983.  Award of the contract is expected in May 1984.
Construction of the dam would begin in September 1984 and be completed by
April 1989.  The impounding of the dam would commence during the 1987-88 wet
season.  Tenders for the main conveyor will be issued in March 1984 and
contracts are expected to be awarded in August 1984.  Construction of the
conveyor would begin in October 1984 and be completed by April 1989.  Tenders
for the construction of the Kokkinokhoria irrigation systems will be issued in
June 1984 and contracts are expected to be awarded in August 1984. Works
would begin in January 1985 and be completed by April 1989. Tender for the
construction of the Akhna reservoir will be issued in October 1985 and
contract is expected to be awarded in February 1986.  Construction would begin
in April 1986 and be completed by October 1988. All other project works will
be constructed before April 1989. The contractor's maintenance period and,
hence final payments, would extend into 1990. Details on the implementation
schedule of the project works are shown in Chart IBRD 25460.
7.02     Phase II of the Southern Conveyor Scheme will be executed over a
five-year period 1988-92 with a two-year overlapping with Phase I. Full
economic and productive use of the investments included in the project can be
made only if Phase II is timely implemented. To this effect, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that Government will prepare not later than June 30,
1986, in consultation with the Bank, a schedule and plan for the implemen-
tation of Phase II of SCP and will start its construction not later than
January 1, 1988.
Project' Organization
7.03     Present institutional arrangements for water development and works
operation are described in paras 2.04 and 2.05. The Government plans to
establish a suitable entity which would be responsible for the development and
management of all water resources, as well as water allocation between
different uses. The establishment of such an integrated institutional
framework is considered as essential to the proposed project. Government will
carry out a study to assess the existing organization and management of its
water resources and put forward proposals for the design of a new legally and
financially autonomous public entity to manage those resources. Government
agreed to start the study for the Water Entity not later than July 31, 1984
and to submit it for Bank's review by June 30, 1985. Draft terms of reference
for this study have been reviewed and agreed at negotiations. Furthermore,
the Government agreed to take all measures necessary for the establishment of
such entity not later than December 31, 1985 taking into account the Bank's
views. Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.
7.04     As an intermediate step the following organizational arrangements are
proposed for the Southern Conveyor Project, which, at a later stage, could
readily be integrated into the newly created entity.



-30-
7.05     Project Organization During Construction Period.  An adequately
staffed Project Implementation Unit will be established within the WDD of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources for the implementation of the
Southern Conveyor Project (Chart 25461). This unit will be responsible for
all project construction works and should be functioning by July 31, 1984.
On-farm works will be designed and their construction supervised by the
Department of Agriculture of the Ministry of Agriculture. In charge of the
Project Implementation Unit will be the Project Director, assisted by two
Project Managers, one for Khouris dam and one for the main conveyor and
Kokkinokhoria irrigation networks. The Unit will be supported by consultants
as described in paras 6.14 and 6.15.
7.06     In order to coordinate the activities of the Project Implementation
Unit with those of the other departments involved, a high level Project Policy
and Coordination Committee (PPCC) will be set up by July 31, 1984 under the
chairmanship of the Director-General of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Natural Resources. Other members of the Committee will be the Directors-
General of the Ministries of Finance, Interior, Commerce and Industry, and
Planning Bureau, Director of WDD and the Project Director who will act as
Secretary. PPCC would review the annual programs of work and progress in
project execution and coordinate the activities of the implementing agencies.
It will meet as and when necessary but not less than once a year.
7.07     In addition, two Project Advisory Committees (PAC) will be
established by July 31, 1984, to advise the Project Director on domestic water
supply affairs (PAC-DWS), and on affairs related to the irrigation in
Kokkinokhoria (PAC-IRR). The PAC for domestic water supply affairs will be
chaired by the Director of WDD and will include the Project Director and the
District Officers for Famagusta, Larnaca, Limassol and Nicosia. The PAC for
Irrigation will also be chaired by the Director of WDD , and will include the
District Officers for Famagusta and Larnaca, the District officers of WDD and
of the Department for Agriculture, and three farmers' representatives.
7.08     Organization During Operation Period.  A Project Operation Unit will
be established within the Water Development Department not later than. June 30,
1985 and will be integrated into the Entity upon its establishment. The POU
will be located in Nicosia and will be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of all facilities constructed under the VPP and the facilities
constructed under the project. Its responsibilities shall include: (a) the
billing and collection of all irrigation charges and all bulk domestic water
charges related to the facilities constructed under the VPP and under the
project; and (b) the establishment and maintenance of a separate accounting
system for the joint operation of said facilities. The Project Director
assisted by a deputy will be in charge of the Project Operation Unit (Chart
25462).
7.09     The same Project Policy and Coordination Committee (PPCC) and Project
Advisory Committees (PAC), described in paras 7.06 and 7.07 will continue to
function during the operation stage. PPCC in addition to the functions
described will be responsible to rationalize water allocations and charges and
to ensure that Government funds are timely available for the operation and
maintenance of project works. The proposed organizational arrangements during
the implementation and operation phases are similar to other Bank financed
irrigation projects in Cyprus and have proved to be satisfactory.



-31-
7.10     Assurances on the organizational arrangements for implementation and
operation as discussed above were obtained at negotiations. Furthermore, the
Government indicated that they will take steps to establish the above units
and committees before the agreed dates.
Future Protection of the Kokkinokhoria Aquifer
7.11     As mentioned in para 4.05, the Kokkinokhoria aquifer, being
overexploited, has undergone depletion during the last twenty years at an
increasing rate. The Hydrology Section of WDD estimates that the safe yield
of the aquifer is only 8 MCM/a, while present extraction amounts to 25 MCM/a.
Therefore, there is an immediate need to supply the area with 17 MCM/a surface
water and to limit extraction to the safe yield of 8 MCM/a, as otherwise the
aquifer would be irreversibly damaged.
7.12     For the protection of the Kokkinokhoria aquifer, the Government will
take the following action:
(i) during the period, when water from SCP is not yet available, the
aquifer will be monitored regularly and adequate measures will be
taken to ensure protection of the aquifer once it becomes evident
that saltwater intrusion is imminent. These measures will be
introduced not later than December 31, 1985 and will include the
establishment of safety thresholds beyond which salt water intrusion
is likely to endanger the aquifer and the drawing up of contingency
plans to put into immediate effect in the event that there is any
indication that salt water intrusion is approaching the safety
thresholds referred above;
(ii) WDD will carry out, before completion of the project, the necessary
studies to determine number, locations, and extraction rates of
boreholes to be used in the Kokkinokhoria area and will subsequently
supervise, from the technical point of view, the application of
extraction rules. The administrative supervision of the irrigation
divisions will be carried out by the district officers;
(iii) in the area of 5,125 ha which will receive SCP water the use of
groundwater will be limited to 1.5 MCM/a, while in the remaining area
of Kokkinokhoria, which will not receive SCP water, the use of
groundwater will be limited to 6.5 MCM/a. Such volumes will be
pumped by means of selected licensed and metered boreholes;
(iv) in order to assume equal charges of water to all farmers in
Kokkinokhoria the area will be divided in a number of irrigation
divisions. The irrigation divisions may include areas irrigated both
with SCP water and groundwater. All farmers in each irrigation
division will be charged a uniform volumetric water rate which will
cover the charges for SCP water and the pumping cost of groundwater.
The selected wells will be operated either by the divisions or by
their owners. In the second alternative the owners will be
reimbursed for their pumping expenditures by the irrigation
division.



-32-
7.13     Assurances on the above measures were obtained at negotiations.
Accounts and Auditing
7.14     As a department of the Ministry of Agriculture, WDD maintains its
accounts within the framework of its recurrent and investment budgets.
Consolidation of all budgetary proposals is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Finance, with final approval requiring legislative action. Accounting
information is limited to commitments and does not register payments. This
reduces the usefulness of the budget accounting system, but WDD does maintain
manually its own internal system of cost accounting to control payments. Due
to the large number of data to be compiled by WDD for each irrigation and
domestic water supply scheme, the manual accounting procedures are very
cumbersome and are proposed to be upgraded to a computerized system.
7.15     The present cost accounting provides information on annual
maintenance performed for each irrigation and domestic water supply scheme.
However, a more detailed cost breakdown should be required in order to have a
useful management tool. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(i) separate detailed accounts will be kept for each scheme by WDD; and (ii)
these accounts will be presented in such detail to assess whether the
requirements set forth in the maintenance program, in the billing and
collection program and in the debt service charges are met. These
arrangements would lay the groundwork for the establishment of the proposed
national Water Entity (para 7.03).
7.16     Such- accounts will be audited annually by the office of the Auditor
General of the Ministry of Finance, whose accounting and auditing procedures
have proven to be adequate under other Bank-financed projects. Audit reports
will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the close of the
Cypriot fiscal year and will expressly include an opinion on the use of funds
disbursed for works executed under the SCP project. Assurances on the above
were obtained at negotiations.
Billing and Collection
7.17     Irrigation and domestic water supply charges are based on water
consumption, and WDD's customers (water boards or village councils for
domestic water and district officers for Irrigation) are billed on a rotating
basis every two months. The district officers, who at the regional level
represent the farmers' committees, are in charge of dividing WDD irrigation
water bills in accordance with each farmer's water consumption. They are also
responsible for revenue collection and for its transmission to the Treasury.
The domestic water supply charges are collected directly by WDD. Collection
by WDD and the district officers need to be improved. As of December 31,
1982, accounts receivable 1/ from water boards amounted to about 3.6 months of
billing, while those from irrigation water consumers amounted to about 4.7
months of billing. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the
necessary measures will be taken to ensure payment of irrigation and domestic
water bills within 90 days of their issuance.
1/ After deduction of outstanding balance for non-Government controlled areas
for which no collection can be anticipated under the present circumstances.



-33-
Monitoring and Evaluation
7.18     This activity will be carried out by the Monitoring and Evaluation
Unit to be established in the Ministry of Agriculture not later than January
1, 1985. Routine records will be kept on project actions, programs, budgets,
and expenditures.   The responsible staff will collect and analyze technical
and financial data to evaluate the effects of the project and to follow its
progress against the project implementation schedule. The Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit will submit periodically progress reports to the concerned
financing agencies through the Ministry of Agriculture as well as a final
report on completion of the project which will include an expost economic and
technical evaluation of the project as it was actually implemented.
Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.
International Commodity Agreements
7.19     None of the commodities to be produced under the proposed project is
governed by international commodity agreements, and hence the Bank's Economic
Analysis and Projects Department has advised that consultation with
international commodity organizations is not required. It should also be
noted that the increments are relatively small. Consequently, the project's
output of commodities is not likely to affect international prices.

VIII. PROJECT BENEFITS, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS, AND JUSTIFICATION
Agricultural Production
8.01     Land and water use.  The primary purpose of the project's irrigation
component is to maintain irrigated agriculture in the Kokkinokhoria area by
substituting SCP surface water for rapidly declining local groundwater
supplies. Consequently, the project will, in general, not augment production
but merely prevent the progressive elimination of irrigated crop production on
about 4,735 ha net. This includes the area which can be safely irrigated by
withdrawing 8 MOM/year from the aquifer. However, since the cost of SCP water
to the producer will be about 50% higher than present average private pumping
costs, it is reasonable to expect, within the constraints imposed by markets,
labor availability and agronomy, some further change in cropping patterns
towards crops with comparatively high returns per unit of water consumed, i.e.
towards winter crops. In the without-project situation, on the other hand,
the entire 4,735 ha would by 1989 be either abandoned or planted to rainfed
crops (cereals) (para 8.45). The net value of such rainfed wheat production
would only be about 3% of the net value of production in the with-project
situation. In other words, the value of production in the with-project
situation is virtually all incremental. Present and expected with-project
land and water use, as well as crop yields, are tabulated below.

-35-
It is to be noted that the cropping pattern includes composite groups, i.e.
citrus, vegetables, the latter including about 20 different species and hence
the variety of the cropping pattern is much larger than is at first apparent.
With many alternative options available in the face of changing constraints
and with new introductions being made available regularly through the
extension service, farmers' decisions until the year 2000 and beyond can,
evidently, not be predicted with any precision. Given the main constraints,
the with-project crop mix is considered a probable initial development, at the
time when SCP water becomes available.
Crop Yields
8.02     It is possible that present crop yields in parts of the project area
are suppressed on account of too high groundwater salt concentrations.
However, as this matter is not well documented and researched, it is assumed
here that current and with-project crop yields are essentially identical.
Prices
8.03    As nearly 80% of project output is expected to be exported, both
farmgate as well as export prices (FOB) have been considered. These are
tabulated below. Both sets are expressed in 1983 values and the produce
prices shown there are identical to those applied in the project financial
analysis. Different margins between the two price sets reflect unequal export
marketing costs as well as differing shares of produce destined for export
relative to their total production.

8.04     Potato exports will continue to account for more than two thirds of
the project area's gross value of production. With the exception of two
years, 1976 in which unusually high export prices were realized following a
bad harvest in western Europe and 1980 in which Cypriot export prices were low
on account of adverse weather which delayed the crop, Cypriot potato export
prices in past years remained essentially constant in real terms. In fact, in
recent years real prices have actually increased somewhat, following the
expansion of very early varieties with an export price premium; the scope for
further plantings of such varieties in future years is considerable.



-36-
8.05    With respect to vegetables and citrus, the above prices are based on
historical Cypriot price series, adjusted upward or downward to reflect
anticipated changes in export prices or seasonal specifics of project output.
It should be noted that the prices adopted for the two vegetable categories
represent the weighted average export price of about ten different
vegetables. In all instances, it was assumed that Cyprus' position regarding
EEC import tariffs would remain the same. It is considered that the above
price sets are conservative and, in general, reflect the price outlook for the
commodities concerned.
Marketing
8.06    Potatoes evidently constitute the project's major export commodity but
the project will not generate any increment relative to the present
situation. In principle, therefore, no marketing problems are expected to
arise. The Cyprus Potato Marketing Board (CPMB) organizes and coordinates all
production and exports and is generally considered to efficiently adjust
production to demand as regards quality and quantity. In most years, about
80% of all exports were to the UK, but the CPMB is now rapidly increasing
exports to West Germany in an effort to improve its bargaining position in
general and in the UK market especially. Cyprus' closest competitor,
particularly in the UK market, is Egypt. The CPMB considers that improvements
in Egyptian export marketing strategy would be beneficial to both exporting
nations, for an early high quality Egyptian product would accelerate the shift
in western European markets from domestic to imported new potatoes.
8.07    The project's estimated incremental export volume of winter vegetables
is estimated between 4,000 and 5,000 tons. Measured against present or
projected imports into the European and Middle Eastern markets, such volume is
very small. No market absorption problems are expected to arise for the
project's incremental production because of (i) the relative insignificance of
expected incremental export volumes, (ii) the earliness of production, and
(iii) the flexibility to respond to changing demand conditions for
vegetables. The main problem concerning fruit and vegetable marketing in
general is one of export coordination and strategy, and this is being
addressed in the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project, Ln. 1988-CY,
(para 3.19).
Farm Incomes
8.08    Without the project, the net value of crop production in the
Kokkinokhoria project area would fall from a present level of about
CL6.2 million to less than CLO.3 million by 1989 (constant 1983 prices).
Because an irrigated area of about 4,700 ha would revert to rainfed cereal
production, agriculture would cease to be the main economic activity of that
area's population. Below are compared the present average farm incomes for
typical farm-size groups, with the expected average incomes in the
with-project situation. Farm incomes in the with-project situation are
expected to fall somewhat below present levels (real terms) on account of the
increased cost of water. However, it has also been assumed that for the same
reason farmers will switch cropping patterns, within the constraints
operating, towards crops which maximize returns to water (para 8.01). The
proposed project area is very close to a major, and expanding, tourist zone.
The slack period in agriculture coinciding with the tourist season, it is
reasonable to expect that part of the area's population will continue to earn



-37-
supplementary incomes in the tourist industry. However, no data on such
present or expected non-agricultural incomes are available. The estimated
agricultural income distribution in the present and with-project situation is
shown below:

It can be seen from the above that overall agricultural area income is estimate(d
to go down by about 10%, on the smallest farms by about 15%, on the others
somewhat less, principally because the former have virtually no room for crop
substitution.
Project Beneficiaries
8.09     Irrigation Beneficiaries  The total number of direct beneficiaries in
the Kokkinokhoria area is about 2,000 families or 10,000 persons. About 85%
of these depend on the project in the sense that without it they would not be
able to continue irrigated crop production; 15% will benefit from the improved
distribution system in areas directly adjoining that of the former category.
8.10     Domestic Water Beneficiaries  The project will benefit by 1990 about
495,000 inhabitants or about 76% of the total Greek Cypriot population, and
the Turkish Cypriot population of Nicosia and Famagusta.
Cost Allocation for Domestic and Irrigation Water Use
8.11     The cost allocation of this dual purpose project to irrigation and to
domestic water, respectively, has been made using the separable cost/remaining
benefits method. The general principles underlying this method can be
summarized as follows: (i) all costs incurred for one purpose only should be
allocated wholly to that purpose; (ii) no project purpose should be assigned a
cost that is in excess of the value of its benefit, and (iii) no purpose
should be assigned a cost that is any greater than would be incurred if that
function were to be supplied by the most economic alternative single-purpose
project. Domestic water benefits are valued at CL 0.500/m3, the same value
as used in the project economic analysis. Irrigation benefits are based on
the net economic value of incremental agricultural production (para 8.45).



-38-
The alternative costs are the discounted capital costs of a single purpose
domestic water or irrigation project. For the purpose of joint cost
allocation, which is based on economic criteria, project costs and benefits
were discounted at the estimated opportunity cost of capital. Assuming this
to be 12% p.a. and a project life of 40 years, the determining parameter
estimates fcr the full project are as follows:
Project Cost Allocation

Cost Recovery Policy
8.12     Because of the magnitude of the proposed project and the present
state of water use, one of the main objectives of the project is to gradually
implement a cost recovery policy for both domestic and irrigation water which
aims at maximizing rational use of SCP water, as well as of non-SCP water and
which increases overall Government revenues.
8.13     Cypriot law stipulates that, for the purpose of computing cost
recovery in irrigation, system capital and O&M costs must be discounted at a
rate not exceeding the legal maximum interest rate in the country. The
current legal maximum nominal rate is 9% p.a. (para 3.17). In view of this
requirement, all irrigation cost recovery computations in the following
paragraphs are based on a 9% p.a. discount rate; the corresponding cost
recovery indices have been termed the legal cost recovery indices. The real
cost recovery indices are, of course, those derived from discounting costs at
the opportunity cost of capital, i.e. 12% p.a. The real subsidies to
irrigation, i.e. the difference between real costs and actual water charges,
have been summarized in para 8.32.
Water Costs
8.14     The application of the joint cost allocation percentages, established
in para 8.11, to the capital cost of the Phase 1 project, yields the following

Irrigation Water Charges
8.15     Farmers in public schemes are presently charged rates which
correspond on average to about 25% of the combined capital and O&M cost of the
system-'. At CLO.024/m3 (US$0.05/m3) such water is comparatively cheap
measured against the estimated returns to water. Cypriot irrigated
agriculture is technically advanced; sophisticated on-farm delivery systems
are common and water losses in a technical sense are minimal. Nevertheless,
because of present low water charges, an estimated 75% of all water is used on
crops which return less than CLO.250-0.300/m3 on average, and there is
considerable scope to shift cropping patterns towards more remunerative crops,
thus enhancing the overall productivity of the sector. The most important
constraints operating against such changes are (i) export marketing problems
and (ii) seasonal labor constraints. Fruit and vegetable marketing problems
arise from the highly fragmented structure of the export firms. These
problems are being addressed in the Fruit and Vegetable Marketing Project
(Loan 1988-CY). Labor constraints will call for further mechanization and can
to some extent be circumvented through staggering of production. Provided
farmers are given time and means to switch their cropping pattern towards more
remunerative commodities, overall sector efficiency can be greatly enhanced
through a policy of realistic water charges. Because SCP irrigation water is
estimated to be about three times as expensive as non-SCP water, it is
necessary to formulate separate water charge policies for the beneficiaries of
various sources of water.
8.16     SCP Water Charges  The average present (1983) private cost of pumping
in the Kokkinokhoria area is estimated to be about CL 0.120/ M3. Whereas for
the majority of farmers, pumping costs are at least CL 0.100/m3, more than
one-third have an estimated average pumping cost of only CL 0.085/m3 or
less. There are no data which permit the differentiation of farms by size
and/or cropping pattern with private unit pumping costs. In addition, the
dynamics of aquifer behavior and the corresponding swings and changes in
private pumping costs, render meaningless an analysis of farm budgets for
varying pumping cost classes. Consequently, farm budgets for four farm types
were prepared, based on an average present (1983) private cost of pumping of
CL 0.120/m3 (Annex 1, Table 5).
8.17     On the basis of the farm cost and revenue estimates and having
carefully examined the implications regarding rent recovery, it is concluded
that a water charge of CL 0.180/m3 (US$ 0.36/m3), in 1983 prices, would be
reasonable. Such charge would correspond to a legal rent recovery index of
55% to 65%, depending on the farm size (Annex 1, Table 5). As all farms will
be equipped with water meters, the imposition of a volumetric charge will be
technically feasible. Considering the degree of control over production and
the relative stability of potato export prices, the range of rent recovery
indices appears reasonable. The rate of CL 0.180/m3 compares to the
estimated average private pumping cost at about CL 0.120/m3, and which could
well further increase in the years before 1989. The cost of SCP irrigation
water (at 9% p.a.) being estimated at CL 0.280/m3, in 1983 prices (para
8.14), the legal cost recovery index is about 65% and corresponds to the legal
maximum level. Though the law defines cost recovery ratios only in relation
to the sum of O&M and of capital costs (para 3.17), the charge would cover all
O&M costs as well as about 60% of the capital cost of the irrigation
component.
1/ This includes the September 1983 rate increase (para 3.14).



-40-
8.18     The 1.5 MCM/year which will be extracted from the aquifer is, once
the project is operational, just as much a renewable resource as is SCP
surface water. Furthermore, such water will be mixed with SCP surface water.
In view of the above, the same charge will apply to the 1.5 MCM/year
groundwater supply.
8.19     In order to allow farmers, particularly those who have presently low
private pumping costs, to adapt their field distribution systems and cropping
patterns to the proposed SCP irrigation charge of CL 0.180/m3 (1983 prices),
it appears both necessary and desirable to impose the full increase in a
gradual manner over a period of three years upon first delivery of SCP water
to the project area (1989). More specifically, water charges during the
first, second and third as well as all further consecutive years should be set
at 45%, 55%, and 65% of the total cost of SCP irrigation water (O&M cost plus
capital cost discounted at 9% over 40 years).
8.20     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that (i) the Government
will undertake the appropriate studies to determine the proposed water charges
for the 1989 season (first year of irrigation in the project area) and
communicate these to the Bank for its review no later than December 31, 1988;
(ii) upon the availability of irrigation water, an irrigation water charge
will be collected from project beneficiaries so as to recover in the first,
second and third as well as consecutive years, 45%, 55%, and 65%,
respectively, of the full 0 & M plus capital cost of water distributed for the
purpose of irrigation in the project areas, discounted at 9% p.a over 40
years; and (iii) the proposed water charge will be applied equally to both
surface and groundwater delivered to the project area.
8.21     Non-SCP Water Charges.  Whereas SCP surface irrigation water supplies
will amount to 17 MCM/a by the beginning of the next decade (Phase 1), present
non-SCP supplies are about 25 MCM/a and will reach more than 60 MCM/a by the
beginning of the next decade. With exception of one, the partially developed
Bank-assisted Paphos Irrigation Project (PIP) (Ln 960-CY), all twelve schemes
presently in operation, are comparatively small, do not generally deliver
pressurized water to the farm gate and have nearly all been financed by
Government. Excluding the PIP, the schemes sold in 1983 about 12 MCM of
irrigation water.
8.22     On the other hand, there are three large-scale Bank assisted
irrigation projects; the PIP mentioned above, the Vasilikos/Pendaskinos
Project (VPP) (Ln 1658-CY) and the recently approved Khrysokhou Irrigation
Project (KIP)(Ln 2279-CY), all of which have or will have sophisticated farm
delivery systems. Of these, presently only the PIP is partly operational;
1983 water sales were 15 MCM out of 32 MCM at full development in 1987. The
VPP is under construction and construction of the KIP will commence in early
1984. Between them, the three schemes are expected to produce about 54
MCM/year at full development (1992).
8.23     Because of the important difference in delivery systems between the
fully operational schemes on one hand, and the three large Bank-assisted ones
on the other, as well as difference in farm productivity, it appears
reasonable that the cost recovery policy for non-SCP irrigation water reflects
such differences. The validity of this distinction is further enhanced by the
fact that some of the smaller schemes were designed specifically to alleviate
rural poverty.



-41-
(A) Small operational irrigation schemes
8.24     The average annual equivalent capital cost of these projects,
discounted at 9% p.a. over 40 years, is about CL 0.085/m3, whereas their
average O&M cost is about CL 0.012/m3 making for a weighted overall cost of
about CL 0.097/m3.  In 1983, the weighted average water charge in these
schemes was about CL 0.024/m3, corresponding to an overall legal cost
recovery of about 25% 1/.
8.25     In view of the fact that the schemes which are already operational
generally did require private investment in distribution works which the other
category of new schemes does not require, it appears reasonable to conclude
that irrigation water in schemes already operational cannot be qualified as
being exceptional as defined under the law (para 3.16). It follows that the
maximum legal water charge for these schemes cannot exceed 40% of the national
weighted average cost (O&M plus capital cost) of such schemes. Within that
constraint, the Government may wish to continue, for practical reasons,
levying differential charges in the various individual schemes.
(B) Large incomplete irrigation schemes
8.26     Three schemes comprise the group of incomplete projects and projects
under construction. Whereas these presently sell about 15 MCM/a 2/, this will
increase to about 40 MCM/a by 1988 when all of them are expected to be
physically completed and to reach a maximum of nearly 55 MCM/a by 1992. The
average annual equivalent cost of these projects, discounted at 9% p.a. over
40 years, is about CL 0.125/m3 in 1983 prices, CL 0.015/m3 of which is the
O&M cost 3/. In 1983 the average water charge in the scheme presently in
operation was CL 0.025/m3, corresponding to an overall cost recovery about
24% 1/.
8.27     In order to further enhance efficient use of water (para 8.15) and
decrease the burden on the National Budget, water charges for these three
schemes should be raised in such a way that (i) in any scheme, at a date not
later than six years following its physical completion, the full water charge
for that scheme be applied i.e. 65% of the weighted average unit cost (O&M
cost plus capital cost discounted at 9% over 40 years); (ii) that in the
preceding five years the charge be increased in the first, second, third,
fourth and fifth so as to recover not less than 30% to 40%, 45%, 50% and 60%
of the weighted average unit cost respectively. The six-year period reflects
(a) the time required by farmers to adjust themselves from rainfall farming to
irrigation farming conditions and (b) the fact that cropping patterns include
perennial crops (trees) which require several years to reach full producti-
vity. Within these provisions, Government can, of course, continue to have
different rates for the various individual schemes.
1/ This includes the September 1983 rate increase (para 3.14).
2/ Only the Paphos Irrigation Project is presently in operation.
3/ The estimated unit costs of the schemes are (1983 prices); Paphos
Irrigation Project CL 0.105/m3, Khrysokhou Irrigation Project
CL 0.135/m3, and Vasilikos-Pendaskinos Project CL 0.190/m3.



-42-
8.28     Such charge would amount to about CL 0.080/m3 (1983 prices), six
years after completion of the last project in this category, which is 1994,
and would correspond to a real rate increase of 150%, or CL 0.048/m3
(US$0.10/m3) in 1983 prices.  Crop and farm budget studies in the SCP
Feasibility Report 1/ indicate that, for the areas involved, such average cost
recovery level is fully feasible; furthermore, it may be emphasized that the
charge of CL 0.080/m3 (1983 prices) is less than half the charge proposed
for SCP water.
8.29     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that (i) the Government
will undertake the appropriate studies to determine the proposed water charges
for both categories of non-SCP schemes and communicate these for the Bank's
review no later than December 31, 1984; (ii) irrigation charges will be
collected from beneficiaries in all schemes so as to recover (a) for the ten
small schemes already in operation, in 1984, 1985, 1986 and thereafter, not
less than 28%, 35% and 40% respectively of their combined average unit cost
(O&M cost plus capital cost discounted at 9% over 40 years); and (b) on
average in the Paphos, Vasilikos-Pendaskinos and Khrysokhou schemes, at a date
not later than six years following physical completion of any of these, 65% of
the total unit cost (O&M plus capital cost discounted at 9% over 40 years) of
all water sold in such scheme and its predecessor(s), it being understood that
charge increases during the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth year would
correspond to 30%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 60% of the total unit cost.
8.30     Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that all water
charges for both SCP and non-SCP schemes will be reviewed annually before the
end of the Cypriot fiscal year to ensure that the charges be adjusted for
inflation and that the new charges be implemented in the month of March of the
following year taking into account the Bank's comments.
Irrigation Cost Recovery and Subsidies
8.31     The anticipated impact of the proposed water charge policy on
revenues and the estimates of legal and real cost recovery percentages in the
various categories are tabulated below. The year 1994 is when all schemes
presently or shortly under construction, will be operational.

-43-
8.32     It can be seen that revenues are expected to increase more than tenfold
(in constant prices), one-third of the increase being on account of increased waLter
sales and two-thirds due to water rate increases. The overall real cost recovery
index is expected to increase from 20% in 1983 to about 50% in 1994. Real economic
subsidies, as contrasted to financial subsidies, are expected to increase overall
by about CL 5.6 million between 1983 and 1994. On the other hand, export earnings
from irrigated crop production are expected to double about to CL 80 million, an
increment of CL 40 million (1983 prices). In as much as this will give rise to an
equal increase in imports, on which an average duty of 15%-20% is charged, the net
overall impact of the subsidies is unlikely to be cause of much concern.
Domestic Water Tariffs
8.33     One of the objectives of the proposed project is to ensure full
implementation of the Government's cost recovery policy for domestic water suppLy
which requires full recovery of O&M costs and capital costs. The existing and
projected water supply systems for the Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Famagusta
areas (project area) including the SCP as well as VPP which will be interconnected,
have to be considered as one integrated operational unit for which a unified bulk
water tariff will be applied. The remaining systems which represent less than 5%
of the total supplies of bulk water, would continue to have their own individual
tariffs.  Water tariffs would be set according to the following principles:
(i)   for both project area and non-project area domestic water supply scheimes,
the Government would review annually the bulk water tariffs to ensure
that they are maintained at a level which would cover at least the full
O&M costs including appropriate contingencies to cover working capital
requirements together with depreciation and interest plus any loan and
government advances repayments in excess of depreciation. Government
advances are to be amortized over 40 years at 9% interest per annum 1/;
and
(ii) Government would ensure that the water boards and village councils
adjust regularly their retail water tariffs according to the same
cost recovery policy. During negotiations, it was further agreed
that the annual bulk water tariffs' review will include comparisons
with and consideration of long run marginal cost of providing bulk
water.
Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.
8.34   In March 1982, the Government bulk water supply tariffs were increased
in the project area by 115% in real terms and the related revenues in FY 1982
were sufficient to cover the O&M costs, the working capital requirements, and
about 38% of the debt service. The water boards and village councils
increased their retail tariffs accordingly which, because of the tariff
structure, affected mainly industrial, touristic, and high domestic
1/    No Government equity contribution is involved.  Instead, to ensure full
recovery of costs, all Government contributions towards the project would be
considered as advances to be amortized in the above defined terms.

consumption (Project File, C. 13). In September 1983 the Council of Ministers
decided a new increase on WDD's average bulk water tariff of about 62% in real
terms corresponding to CL 0.154/m3 on average.
8.35     With the latest tariff increase sufficient revenues would be
generated to meet WDD's cost recovery objectives during FY84 and FY85 plus a
portion of its capital expenditures. No further increase before 1986 would be
required. For the period 1986-1992 required tariff increases are projected to
be about 16% on average per year in current terms or 9.5% in real terms.

During the project implementation period total financing requirements would be
provided as follows: various loans for SCP 29%, Government advances for other
projects 35%, other existing loans 9%, Government advances for SCP 17%, the
proposed IBRD loan 7%, and the Government grant 16% to offset the negative net
internal cash generation (13%) and the working capital requirements 3% of the
irrigation component. This financing plan supports the Government and WDD's
cost recovery objectives. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the Government will provide all local fund requirements for the implementation
of the project including possible cost overruns.
Future Financial Performance

Financial assumptions have been summarized in Annex 4, and a detailed computer

printout for each domestic water supply and irrigation scheme is presented in
the Project File. A tentative investment program (1984-1990) discussed with
WDD assumes investments of the order of CL83 million (US$166 million), in
current value, for domestic water supply and of CL103 million (US$206 million)
for irrigation (SCP and non-SCP projects). This program would eventually be
augmented between 1988 and 1992 by the construction of SCP phase II which is
estimated at CL25.1 million (US$50.2 million) for domestic water and CLl9
million (US$38 million) for irrigation. This objective is realistic and aims
at maintaining the service level for irrigation and improving the level for
domestic water supply.
8.38    Up to the end of 1992, WDD's revenues for all water supply schemes are
expected to grow from CL1.7 million in 1983 to CL18.7 million in 1992 (current
terms), while its operating expenses before depreciation would grow from CL1.5
million to CL4.1 million, leaving gross margins sufficient to cover all of its
projected debt service and working capital requirement. After the project
implementation period (1989) its operating ratio will gravitate around 35,
while its debt service coverage ratio would not drop below 1.1.
8.39    During the period 1983-1992, WDD's overall irrigation revenues, which
have been planned in such a way as to meet the irrigation cost recovery
objectives, would grow from CL 0.66 million to CL13.1 million (current
terms). After deduction of its operating expenses which, during this period,
would increase from CL 0.54 million to CL3.1 million, the irrigation component
would generate a gross margin covering 2% of its debt service in 1984, 25% in
1986, 43% in 1989, and 61% in 1992. The government will cover through grants
the remaining portion of debt service together with working capital
requirements.
8.40    Overall, for both domestic water supply and irrigation, WDD's
operations would generate a gross margin covering 13% of its debt service in
1984, 54% in 1986, 82% in 1989, and 87% in 1992, while the Government grant
for irrigation would represent 85% of sources in 1984, 30% in 1989, and 23% in
1992. Since the revenues for irrigation water are deposited at the Treasury,
assurances were received at negotiations that the Government will provide
sufficient funds to cover all project maintenance and operation expenses.
8.41    There is a possibility that the recent and projected tariff increases
may produce a reduction in domestic water demand. Detailed calculations
showed that a 5% lower level of water demand by 1990 would have a negligible
impact on WDD's future financial performances. The volume of water not used
for municipal consumption, i.e. 1.84 million cubic meters, could partly be
stored in the dams to maintain a better long-term reliability or it could be
used for irrigation in the same year. If the volume of domestic water "saved"
is allocated to irrigation, the potential shortfall in WDD's operating
revenues is estimated at CL236,390 or about 1% of total WDD's revenues. Given
the cost recovery policy stated in para 8.33, this potential revenue shortfall
would be offset by a marginal increase in bulk water tariff.
Project Justification
8.42    Bank support for the project is important.  The cost of the project is
very large indeed relative to the country's economy, and Bank's participation
in its funding has contributed to facilitate co-financing. Furthermore, Bank
participation is expected to facilitate implementing the cost recovery

measures for both domestic and irrigation water which are of vital importance
to Government finances as well as to promote water conservation.
8.43    The concept of the proposed project and the rationale for selecting it
from a number of alternatives, are described in paras 5.01-5.09. That
presentation leads to the conclusion that the proposed project constitutes the
most sensible solution towards meeting Cyprus' water needs, in that it tends
to maximize the total net present value of the least-cost project alternative
which can meet the objectives. In addition, the resulting integration of a
multitude of supply sources and storage points into one system, will greatly
enhance its flexibility and make it possible to further rationalize water use.
(para 8.50).
Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
8.44    In the first phase of the SCP both the Kouris dam and the conveyor
will be build to full capacity. Because of considerable sunk costs, the
marginal net benefits of the full project will be substantially above those of
the first phase only. Also, from a water use point of view, the first phase
cannot be considered in isolation from the full SCP. Without a second phase,
irrigation supplies to the Kokkinokhoria area would have to be gradually
curtailed starting in the third year following completion of the first phase
because of increasing domestic water demand, and would be completely
eliminated about a decade thereafter. Such scenario would be entirely
inconsistent with the objectives and investment decisions of the proposed
SCP. Consequently, as the economics of the first phase cannot be meaningfully
determined, only the economic rate of return (ERR) of the full project has
been estimated.
8.45    The following facts and assumptions underlie the ERR estimate:
(a) Government has stated that, in the absence of alternative water
supplies to the Kokkinokhoria area, it is not in a position to
enforce existing water legislation and to compel farmers there to
reduce or stop pumping from existing private boreholes, as long as
these are not severely contaminated by seawater intrusion. Hence, it
is assumed here that farmers would continue to mine the aquifer and
that the existing trend of losing areas of irrigated land at an
increasing rate would continue. Consequently, the without-project
situation is that one in which present irrigated agriculture on about
4,000 ha in the Kokkinokhoria area, using 17 MCM/a, would be
eliminated by 1990 and would at best be replaced by rainfed cereal
production. The economic benefits attributable to the 17 MCM/a made
available to that area in Phase I and thereafter are, therefore,
equal to the net economic value of irrigated crop production from
that annual volume of water less the net economic value of the
rainfed cereal crop which would be grown if the project were not to
take place (para 8.01). In terms of net incremental benefit per unit
of water supplied this is estimated to be CL 0.395/m3 (1983 prices).
(b) Irrigated crop production in Phase II would probably much resemble
that of the Vasilikos-Pendaskinos and Khrysokhou projects, presently
under construction. These Phase II irrigation benefits are, of
course, very far removed from the present date and many changes in



-47-
production and marketing can be expected to occur in the intervening
period. It was considered appropriate, therefore, to estimate the
benefits in a prudent, approximate manner, rather than presenting
detailed crop specific projections for which presently no ground
exists. The net benefits per unit of water consumed, therefore, were
estimated to lie halfway between those of the cropping patterns of
the two projects mentioned above (CL 0.350/m3, US$0.70/m3); the
project specific values are estimated at CL 0.325/m3 and CL
0.375/m3, respectively (1983 prices).  All incremental production
and farm input utilization were phased in accordance with the
anticipated build-up of the areas irrigated and projected yield
developments. It has been assumed that, for annual crops, final
yield levels would be attained after four years; for perennial crops
final yields have been assumed to be reached after 15 years for the
entire project area.
(c) All benefits and costs were calculated in constant mid-1983 values
and adjusted for future changes in real prices wherever appropriate
or feasible. Investments in public enterprises are exempt from taxes
and duties; there is no reason to assume shadow exchange rates
different from the market rate. Tradable production inputs in the
project area carry no subsidies; hence market prices approximate
economic values. Border prices of tradable outputs were derived from
the Bank's commodity price data (citrus), from Cyprus export data
(potatoes), or EEC import prices (vegetables). Employment in
agriculture is highly seasonal. In the off-season, many find
temporary employment in other activities, e.g. tourism,
construction. On balance, there is little structural unemployment.
Hence the economic wage rate was considered to correspond to the
actual wage rate structure for male and female labor in the project
area which is very close to national averages. Other non-tradables,
e.g. transport, were costed at market prices.
(d) The benefits from domestic and industrial water can conservatively be
estimated through an analysis of the consumers' willingness to pay 1/.
The price that the consumers actually pay at the retail level
provides a lower bound for the estimate. However, the SCP would
provide bulk deliveries of water and thus, to measure the consumers'
willingness to pay for bulk water the retail tariff needs to be
adjusted downwards to reflect losses in the distribution system and
the costs for building and operating this system. At present, the
water tariffs in Nicosia (the main consumption center) range from CL
0.20/m3 to CL 0.80/m3.  Already today some 38% of the water is
sold to consumers that pay between CL 0.55 and CL 0.80/m3.
However, Nicosia is experiencing water shortages and especially
during the summer season the supply has been rationed. Consequently,
the tariff does not fully reflect the consumers' willingness to pay.
Furthermore, the cost recovery policy stated in para 8.33 would
result in gradual increases in the future in the retail tariffs to
1/ Such an estimate is conservative because it measures only private benefits
and neglects the important social benefits of domestic water. For
commercial and industrial consumers, the willingness to pay is a more
accurate measure of benefits.



-48-
reflect the cost of providing SCP water. Taking all these
considerations in account, it was judged that a bulk rate of CL
0.50/m3 would adequately reflect the consumers' future willingness
I/
to pay for domestic and industrial water.
(e) Alternative projections for domestic demand indicate that the highest
expected possible increase in retail tariffs could cause demand to be
about 15% below the projected base values. The water not used for
municipal use could partly be stored behind the dams to maintain a
better long-term reliability, or it could be used for irrigation.
The net decrease in overall project benefits would be, if this were
to happen, about 5%.
(f) The analysis was based on a project life of 45 years. Specific
investments (e.g. water treatment equipment, on-farm irrigation
equipment) were assumed to be replaced, when necessary, at the end of
their useful life. No salvage values were imputed.
8.46     Based on these criteria and the data summarized in Annex 1, Table 7
the basic ERR of the full project iG estimated at 12.8. The sensitivity
analysis shows the following ERR values for deviations from baseline project
performance:
(1)  Base value                                     12.8%
(2)  Irrigation & Domestic Water Benefits
down 20%                                      10.6%
(3)  Investment & Operating Costs up 20%            11.0%
(4)  Irrigation & Domestic Benefits lagging
one year                                      11.7%
(5)  Irrigation & Domestic Benefits lagging
two years                                      10.8%
(6)  Costs up 20% and benefits lagging two years  9.3%
(7) Costs up 20%, benefits lagging two years,
lowest expected increase in domestic
water demand                                   8.8%
(8) Costs up to 20%, all benefits down 20%,
and lagging two years                          7.3%
8.47     Switching Values.  In addition, the switching values for key
variables have been calculated. For example, a decrease of about 5% in net
benefits or an increase of about 10% in investment costs would cause the ERR
to equalize the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Cyprus (12%). The
Net Present Value (NPV) was estimated at CL 7.0 million or about 8% of present
value costs, discounted at 12%.
8.48     At the estimate of the value of domestic water used here, about 55%
of all benefits are due to that component. About 30% of the remaining
1/ Given the social importance of an adequate supply of quality drinking
water, the estimated economic rate of return is only indicative (para
8.46). However, estimates of the benefits derived from domestic and
industrial water are needed for the resolution of certain project design
issues and determination of cost allocations between municipal and
agricultural uses.



-49-
benefits are attributable to maintaining potato exports, a comparatively
risk-free enterprise. The balance of expected benefits, 15X, is on account of
additional fruit and vegetable productions and their exports in Phase II.
Export prices, a decade from now, cannot be estimated with confidence, and a
decline in real export prices is a definite possibility. The proportion of
total benefits which is susceptible to a decline, however, appears to be
modest. On the cost side, detailed designs and cost estimates render unlikely
the occurrence of large cost overruns, provided the implementation schedule is
kept. Ample resources have been set aside for construction supervision.
Furthermore, the substantial experience gained in Cyprus during the last
decade in the area of large dam and other hydraulic construction, renders
plausible a reasonable adherence to the projected implementation schedule.
Possible technical and other risks are discussed in paras 8.53 to 8.56 below.
Other Benefits
8.49     The implementation of a water tariff policy for SCP and non-SCP
domestic and irrigation water which is closely related to the cost of
producing water is expected (i) to significantly increase Government revenues
from public schemes (paras 8.38-8.39); (ii) to further induce water
conservation practices, and (iii) to cause farmers to gradually shift
production patterns towards higher returns to water, hence enhancing overall
sector efficiency.
8.50     Implementation of the SCP will be a major step towards achieving a
very high degree of integration of different sources of supply and of storage
reservoirs. This will make possible the formulation of a set of operating
rules for the entire system which would help to reduce the marginal cost of
water development as well as the average cost of operating the system. The
formulation and continued refinement of such a set of operating rules for the
project area will be the core of water planning and conservation.
Macro-Economic Impact
8.51     Budget Impact:  During the six-year construction period, the average
annual expenditure on the project will be CL 14-17 million. Assuming that the
foreign exchange component of the project is financed from external borrowing,
the internal budget requirement will be between CL 5 million and CL 6 million
annually. This is about 0.5 percent of GDP and can be accommodated in the
investment budget, which in turn represents a small part (about 16 percent in
1983) of the total Government expenditures. Investment in the SCP therefore
is not a decisive factor which determines the success or failure of the
Government's efforts to remove its budget deficit which currently stands at
about 8 percent of GDP.
8.52     Foreign exchange amounts to be borrowed from external sources to
finance Phase I of the project represent about 16% of the 1982 external debt
of CL 422.5 million (US$845 million) outstanding including undisbursed
principal. The peak repayment will be around CL 14 million (US$28 million)
per year or about 10-11 percent of the debt service burden of the without
project situation. This additional burden, however, will be totally covered
by the continued potato exports. The entire Kokkinokhoria area currently
produces about CL 22 million (US$44 million) in foreign exchange from potato
exports. While not all this amount would be affected in the without project
situation, it is estimated that, if SCP were not implemented potato exports
would decline for all time by CL 15 million (US$30 million) per year, starting



-50-
in about 1989. The imports needed for this project, about US$23 million per
year during construction, will add to the total imports. This amount, however
is relatively small - about 1.6 percent of total imports of goods and services
in 1982 - and would not become a significant burden on the balance of payments.
Project Risks
8.53     The project has been well prepared and the availability of detailed
designs makes it possible to proceed early with project execution. There are
no unusual technical risks associated with the project, and those which are
normally related to benefits, costs, and development period have been
evaluated in the sensitivity analyses.
8.54     Continued overpumping of the Kokkinokhoria aquifer in the period
1983-89 could result in seawater intrusion on such scale that parts of the
proposed project area would be irreversibly damaged. Therefore, the entire
aquifer needs to be monitored regularly and during negotiations assurances
were obtained from the Government that strict measures will be applied to
prevent saltwater intrusion, regardless of whether or not water is already
available from the project (para 7.12).
8.55     If a number of conscutive dry years were to occur, water shortages
would be envisaged, particularly if this happened during the later period of
the life of the project. Such shortages could be alleviated by temporarily
using the aquifers. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the
Government that studies and plans will be prepared for the recharge of
aquifers during water spills and for the joint use of surface and groundwater
during water shortages (para 6.12).
8.56     Because in Phase I both the dam and the conveyor will be built at
full size, the marginal investments required to implement Phase II are
relatively small while generating disproportionately large benefits.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government will prepare
plans and start construction of Phase II before January 1, 1988 (para 7.02).
In the unlikely event that Phase II would not be executed, the Phase I ERR
might fall to a value between 10% and 11%.

6.12).
(b) Government will prepare not later than June 30, 1986, in consultation
with the Bank a schedule and plan for the development of Phase II of
SCP and will start construction under Phase II not later than January
1, 1988 (para 7.02).
(c) Government will carry out a study to review the existing organization
and management of its water resources and to determine the structure
for the national Water Entity, exchange views with the Bank on the

design of Kouris dam for periodic review and inspection of the dam
during and after construction, as proposed (para 6.16);
(g) Government will take the proposed measures for the protection of the
Kokkinokhoria aquifer (para 7.12);
(h) WDD will establish and maintain separate accounts for each irrigation

project accounts not later than six months after the end of each
Government fiscal year (paras 7.15 and 7.16);
(i) Government will take the necessary measures to ensure payment of
irrigation and domestic water bills within 90 days of their issuance
(para 7.17).
(j) Government will establish a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit within the
Ministry of Agriculture not later than January 1, 1985 to carry out
monitoring and evaluation activities as proposed and submit
periodically progress reports and a final report on completion of the
project (para 7.18);



-52-
(k) Government will undertake studies to determine irrigation charges for
SCP and non-SCP water, collect these charges as proposed (paras 8.20
and 8.29), and review them annually to ensure that they be adjusted
for inflation (para 8.30);
(1) Government will apply the proposed water tariff system for domestic
water and review annually the bulk water tariffs to ensure that they
are maintained at a level which would cover the full O&M cost and
working capital requirements together with depreciation and interest
plus any loan and Government advances' repayments in excess of
depreciation. Also the Government will ensure that the water boards
and village councils adjust regularly their retail water tariffs to
reflect bulk water tariff increases (para 8.33);and
(m) Government will conclude co-financing agreements amounting to US$40
million by December 31, 1984 and for the remaining financing gap by
December 31, 1985 and that such agreements will become effective by
June 30, 1986 (para 6.18).
9.02     Conditions of effectiveness are (a) that all conditions for the
effectiveness of a co-financier's agreement providing for an amount of not
less than US$28 million for the project have been met and (b) that the Kuwait
Fund loan agreement has been duly signed (para 6.18).
9.03     Agreement having been reached on the above conditions, the proposed
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$27 million to the Republic of Cyprus
for a term of 15 years including 3-year grace at the standard variable
interest rate.

SOUTHERN CONVEYOR PROJECT FOR WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT - PHASE I
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL PROJECTION
1. Operating revenues
Revenues from water supply and irrigation tariffs over the projection
period are assumed to meet the proposed financial covenants, i.e. water supply
tariffs would be sufficient to cover operating expenses, debt service or
depreciation, whichever is higher, and working capital requirements; SCP
irrigation tariffs would be set to recover during the first, second, and third
as well as all further consecutive years 45%, 55%, and 65% of the cost of SCP
irrigation water (O & M plus capital costs discounted at 9% over 40 years);
for the ten small irrigation schemes already in operation, the charges should
be set so as to recover 28% by 1984, 35% by 1985 and thereafter not less than
40% of their weighted average unit cost; charges for each of the large
irrigation schemes currently under construction would increase progressively
from the first year following physical completion of each project to the sixth
year so as to recover 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60% and 65% of the respective cost.
2. Operating Expenses
All operating expenses have been inflated at an annual rate of 6%
during the period 1984-1992. In addition, salaries have been increased by
1.5% per year representing a productivity bonus, and the recent government
decision to increase the tariff for electricity by 15% was taken into account
to calculate the energy cost. Assets were depreciated on a straight line
basis. Interest during the construction period has been capitalized.
3. Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheet
Government advances include advances to the WDD investment program as
well as advances on WDD's debt service to various lenders. It was assumed
that: (i) during the implementation of the on-going projects (Paphos, VPP and
Khrysokhou) and of the SCP, the Government would advance 100% of WDD's debt
service; (ii) after the takeover of projects' works by WDD the proportion of
advances by the Government would decline proportionally to the increase in the
volume of water sold in each scheme and would be determined when each
project's facilities have reached full development capacity (i.e., 1987 for
Paphos, 1990 for VPP and 1992 for Khrysokhou and SCP); (iii) during these
first two periods, Government advances on debt services would be capitalized;
and (iv) during the period thereafter, Government advances on debt services
would be amortized in forty equal installments at a 9% interest rate per annum.

The onlent proceeds of the Bank loan of US$27 million are assumed to
carry an interest rate of 10.08% p.a., a commitment charge of 0.75% on the
undisbursed balance and would be repayable over 15 years including a
three-year grace period. The Government would pay directly the front-end fee
of 0.25%. Other loans for the project were assumed to be made by the Kuwait
Fund (US$10 million, interest rate 4.5%, amortization 17 years including 4
years grace period), the European Investment Bank (US$28 million, interest
rate 10%, amortization 15 years including 5 years grace) and export credits or
unidentified other loans (US$73 million, interest rate 10%, amortization 12
years including 2 years of grace). All Government advances carry an interest
of 9% p.a., and are amortized over 40 years.
Inventories are estimated at the equivalent of six months of supplies
for maintenance and chemicals. Accounts receivable were assumed to represent
an average of about three months of total sales. Cash on hand has been
forecast at levels sufficient to cover normal operations. Accounts payable
was estimated to be equivalent to three months of energy, chemicals, and
purchase of water. Suppliers represent the provision for retention money
which was estimated to represent about 15% of total proceeds.
The values of the existing irrigation and water supply schemes are
provided for at their aggregated historical costs in 1986. These are based on
the Government current capital expenditures from 1963 to 1982 plus the
forecasted expenditures from 1983 to 1986. The net value of the existing
schemes at CL 46.729 million in the opening balance of 1986 has been treated
as equity on the assump'tion that the systems would be transferred to the Water
Entity free of charge. The project assets were not revaluated and the
following depreciation rates were used:
Civil works                             2.5%
Mechanical & electrical equipment    6.6%
Dams                                    1.0%
Irrigation networks and pipes           2.5%
