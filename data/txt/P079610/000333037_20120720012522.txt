F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The overall Project development objective is to reduce the major negative environmental
and health impacts of rapidly increasing concentrated livestock production on the open
waters and thus on the people of East Asia. Its global environment objective is to reduce
livestock-induced, land-based pollution and environmental degradation of the South
China Sea.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 Country Background. The project addresses one of the most significant and
rapidly growing sources of land-based pollution of the South China Sea –
environmentally unsustainable intensive and geographically-concentrated livestock
production in China, Thailand and Vietnam. Without wide-scale preventive action,
livestock production would become the single most important source of organic and
chemical pollution of the main catchments that drain into the South China Sea, an
international body of water that harbors the world’s most biologically diverse shallow-
water marine ecosystems.
1.1.2 The East Asia region is the world leader in pig and poultry production, with China,
Thailand and Vietnam accounting for over 53 percent of pig production and 28 percent of
chicken production globally. These shares were expected to grow during project
implementation and continue to do so over the coming decades, fuelled by a growing
population, rising incomes and rapid urbanization. This, coupled with economic and
technological evolution in the sector, has led to increasing concentration of livestock
production, resulting in large-scale industrial production accounting for an increase of
about 80 percent of the total livestock production in Asia since 1990. These intensive
production farms are principally located around major urban centers that lie in, or close to,
the coastal regions of the South China Sea.
1.1.3 Concentrated livestock production has become a major threat to human health, as
evidenced by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Avian Influenza outbreaks,
and is also responsible for causing significant local, regional and global environmental
damage, particularly to freshwater and marine aquatic systems. At appraisal, waste
management practices in the three participating countries consisted of discharging
directly, or indirectly, untreated wastes into streams and rivers that flow into the South
China Sea. The main sector issues identified were:
   (a) the lack of demonstrated technical solutions with which to address the problem of
       nutrient imbalance associated with concentrated livestock production; and
   (b) the lack of policy instruments and replication strategies to promote sound
       livestock waste management practices.
1.1.4 Rationale for Bank Assistance. The project was consistent with the objectives of
the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) in China, Thailand and Vietnam and in
line with a global piece of analytic economic and sector work (ESW) being undertaken
by the World Bank on livestock externalities. In line with the World Bank’s role as an
Implementing Agency of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project was seen to
contribute to the strategic priorities of the GEF’s International Waters (IW) Focal Area,
in particular IW-1 which sought to catalyze financial resource mobilization for the
implementation of reforms and which stressed reduction measures through elaboration of
Trans-boundary Diagnostic Analysis and Strategic Action Plans, as well as IW-3, which
promoted innovative demonstration of barrier removal to sustainable industrial livestock
management. The project also fit with the objectives of the GEF Contaminant-based


                                             1
Operational Program, whose goals were to demonstrate how to address land-based
pollution; demonstrate ways to overcome barriers to best practice in limiting
contamination of international waters; address an imminent and high priority threat, on
which neighboring countries want to take collaborative action; underscore action towards
pollution prevention versus remediation; leverage private investment; involve close
cooperation with other GEF agencies; and show potential for regional and global
replication. In addition, the project aims were aligned with the objectives and eligibility
criteria of the proposed GEF-World Bank Strategic Partnership Investment Fund for
Land-based Pollution Reduction in the Large Marine Ecosystems of East Asia, that was
being proposed at the same time. The project also contributed to the objective of the GEF
Focal Area of climate change and OP2 Costal, Marine, and Freshwater Ecosystems.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
1.2.1 The overall Project development objective was to reduce the major negative
environmental and health impacts of rapidly increasing concentrated livestock production
on the open waters and thus on the people of East Asia. Its global environment objective
was to reduce livestock-induced, land-based pollution and environmental degradation of
the South China Sea. Achievement of the project’s development objective was to be
monitored by the following key performance indicators:
   (a) Demonstrated Livestock waste management practices in the participating
       farms/villages within the project area;
   (b) Reduced livestock production related surface water pollution in the project area,
       including nitrates, phosphates, biological oxygen demand (BOD), COD and E.
       coli bacteria;
   (c) Development of a Replication Strategy and other policy measures for addressing
       livestock waste management, and their local and national adoption and
       enforcement;
   (d) Development of plans, programs and capacities to achieve a spatial distribution of
       livestock production better aligned with environmental and health objectives;
   (e) Reduced human health risk as a result of improved risk management of pathogens,
       antibiotics and virus transmission from livestock to humans; and
   (f) Increased public awareness and regional exchange of information on pollution
       threats and health problems from livestock waste.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
1.3.1 Neither PDO nor GEO was revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 Project main beneficiaries included the following:
   (a) Farmers, employees and their families of participating farms benefitted firstly
       from increased on-farm investment leading to improved nutrient management and
       quality of domestic waterways. This resulted in reduced overall human and
       animal health risks posed by ill-managed livestock wastes, and reduced
       complaints from local communities. These stakeholders further benefitted from
       reduced workloads, increased availability and knowledge of innovative


                                            2
       technologies for livestock waste management through training and introduction of
       the technologies, as well as alternative, local energy generation supplied through
       biogas or electricity generated from livestock waste management facilities.
   (b) Local communities and neighboring villages benefitted from improvement of
       their natural environment including lower insect populations (flies), reduced
       livestock production pollution of air and waterways, reduced human health risks,
       and increased public awareness. Certain communities were also able to benefit
       from biogas supply from participating farms.
   (c) Officials from national and local governments in participating countries improved
       their capacities and skills in developing and enforcing livestock waste
       management policies, in introducing and supporting innovative and proven
       livestock waste management technologies, and in regulating, supporting and
       monitoring a more environmentally friendly and sustainable intensive livestock
       production industry.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 The project adopted a comprehensive approach to integrate technological
solutions, policy development and enforcement, capacity building and regional synergy
to achieve its development objective. The project includes the following components: (a)
Component 1: Livestock Waste Management Technology Demonstration (US$14.2
million); (b) Component 2: Policy and Replication Strategy Development (US$4.4
million); (c) Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring (US$3.9 million), and
(d) Component 4: Regional Support Services (US$1.5 million). The first three
components were implemented by the three participating countries while the fourth was
implemented by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) through its Regional
Facilitation Office (RFO) in Bangkok, Thailand.

1.6 Revised Components
1.6.1 Project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 The project closing date was extended for Vietnam (6 months), Thailand (12
months) and FAO (6 months). The slower than expected project implementation progress
was the main reason for the extensions granted for Thailand and Vietnam. In Thailand,
this was due to a number of factors including: (a) distraction caused by the project
implementing agency’s participation in the preparation of two associated carbon finance
projects on the margins of the GEF project’s approval, which limited the Project
Management Office’s (PMO) capacity to initiate timely project implementation; (b) a
delay in the approval of counterpart funding by the Thai Cabinet; and (c) the social unrest
experienced in the country in April and May 2010. In Vietnam, project implementation
progress was largely the result of: (a) a change in project areas (see 1.7.2); (b) a major
restructuring within the implementing agency in 2008; (c) unexpectedly severe storms in
2009 and 2010; and (d) the weak capacity of the Project Management Office in first years
of the project’s implementation. As a consequence, the project closing date was also
extended for FAO, to allow for organization of the final project completion workshop and
last Regional Coordination Group (RCG) meeting in June 2011, once all three countries


                                            3
had generated sufficient implementation results to share with each other. These
extensions contributed to the achievement of the project development objective and the
global environment objective in all three countries.
1.7.2 The project areas were defined at the time of project appraisal. They included,
Boluo County in Guangdong province, China, Ha Tay and Dong Nai provinces in
Vietnam, and Ratchuburi and Chonburi provinces in Thailand. Any other counties in
China’s Guangdong province and other provinces in Vietnam and Thailand selected by
the participating countries were also welcome to participate in the project, contingent on
prior concurrence with the Bank. During project implementation, and with the Bank’s
prior concurrence, Dongyuan and Lianping Counties in Guangdong province, and
Phetchaburi, Rayong, and Kanchanaburi provinces in Thailand, encouraged by the initial
results of the project’s implementation, joined the project in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
In June 2008, Ha Tay province was merged into Hanoi, bringing Hanoi into one of two
project provinces in Vietnam.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Background analysis. Project preparation was based on a thorough analysis of the
sector issues identified by pre-project studies, and on available technical solutions and
their assessed suitability given participating countries’ contexts. The project focused on
one of the most significant and rapidly growing sources of land-based pollution
threatening the South China Sea – environmentally unsustainable intensive and
geographically-concentrated livestock production – and selected China, Thailand and
Vietnam, the three most important countries in East Asia in terms of livestock
production to participate. It recognized that livestock wastes, if not managed
appropriately, are a recognized pollutant, a human health threat, and a source of
anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the background analysis
conducted, key challenges in managing livestock wastes in the three countries were
identified: (i) a lack of available technical solutions to address and deal with the problem
of nutrient imbalance; (ii) a lack of policy instruments and absence of a replication
strategy for LWM; and, (iii) a lack of capacity, awareness, and collaboration to promote
sound LWM practices. Furthermore, the project preparation process collected experience
and lessons learned from World Bank rural environmental and livestock operations, from
results of diagnostic work and field investigations under the Area-Wide Integration
(AWI) pilot projects conducted in China, Thailand and Vietnam under the FAO’s
Livestock, Environment and Development Initiative (LEAD)1, as well as from ongoing
government programs in the three countries. In line with the Bank’s previous project
experience and sector work, the project emphasized the importance of on-the-ground
demonstrations of innovative, cost-effective LWM technology options by private
livestock producers, complemented by country specific replication strategies to promote
the broader adoption of such technologies.

2.1.2 Project design. The project design was timely, focused, of high quality and took
on board input contributed by all participating countries and the FAO, as implementing
agency for the Regional Support Services component. World-class leaders in the field
participated in project preparation and brought their experience to project design. It is
worth noting that the current PDO and GEO, largely defined by GEF requirements and
accepted by Bank management, are the higher level objectives against which project
interventions were expected to contribute. The PDO/GEO indicators and intermediate
outcome indicators, which reflect project level intervention results considered realistic
and achievable, were properly defined. Key features of project design included:
   (a) The project design supported an integrated and comprehensive implementation
       approach that called for the involvement of FAO and various government
       agencies from 14 national ministries in three countries, and covered 8 provinces.
       The $7 million GEF grant project proposed the introduction of an integrated and
       comprehensive package of technological solutions, policy development and
       enforcement, national capacity- and regional synergy building to achieve the
       development objective. Emphasis was placed on on-the-ground demonstration of
       effective and affordable technological solutions for sound livestock waste
       management. Policy, capacity and strategy development activities were carried
       out based on successful results of technology demonstration and thus, were well
       received by all stakeholders. The project’s intelligent design has contributed
       significantly towards guaranteeing the long term sustainability of project
       interventions.
   (b) With regard to technology demonstration, the project promoted those innovative
       technologies that are technically, agronomically, geographically, economically
       and institutionally acceptable to a broad audience drawn from different political
       groups, at various levels of social and economic development. Livestock
       production patterns and trends in the three countries were carefully assessed.
       Effective and affordable proven technologies, not yet been adopted in the countries,
       were identified and demonstrated selectively in each of the three countries. This
       design approach increased the likelihood that demonstrated technologies could be
       easily replicated in the project countries.
   (c) The project’s design also emphasized the importance of providing financial
       incentives and technical support to mobilize interest and participation on the part
       of livestock farms to pilot sound waste management technologies. Based on
       country situations, different combinations of financial incentives were devised for
       each of the three countries. The thorough analysis of the cost effectiveness of
       manure management systems for different types of farms that was undertaken
       helped establish affordability thresholds for various technological options. The
       actual construction and successful operation of the first few LWM facilities in all
       three countries became positive showcases that attracted the participation of
       additional farms.
   (d) The project’s regional approach maximized its contribution to the GEF objectives
       by ensuring that the region’s three most important countries in terms of livestock
       production and waste pollution, were acting together under a common interest to
       protect the ecosystems of the South China Sea. This approach also promoted


                                            5
       cross-country learning and knowledge sharing and thus increased project impacts
       in the region. Further, the value of the regional approach in facilitating knowledge
       sharing between countries was shared with other countries in the region and
       around the world, through various international and regional knowledge exchange
       activities, the FAO and the GEF networks.
2.1.3 Government commitment and stakeholder involvement. Governments at all levels
in all three participating countries actively participated in and were fully committed to the
project design and implementation processes. In each participating country a project
preparation team was assigned to work closely with FAO on project conceptualization
and design. This lay the groundwork for the positive engagement of government
throughout the project’s duration including through provision of financial resources to
support implementation and sustainability beyond the project’s completion, as well as the
establishment and maintenance of effective institutional structures at all levels during
project implementation. Other key stakeholders, including farms, urban businesses,
nearby urban dwellers, local communities and NGOs, were actively involved and
participated throughout the project design and implementation phases in all three
countries. Stakeholder Participation Plans were prepared by the participating countries
and closely followed during project implementation.
2.1.4 Risks. A comprehensive assessment identified potential risks and mitigation
measures at time of appraisal. In addition to risks associated with government
commitment and institutional capabilities that are common to all projects, the key risks
identified, and mitigation measures proposed were: (a) operational failure resulting from
provision of inadequate financial incentives to stimulate private sector investment in
waste management systems – this potential risk, rated moderate, was mitigated by
providing sufficient incentives through the project, the government and other sources; (b)
failure of the waste management technologies demonstrated – this was considered a low
risk because the project was designed to introduce proven and effective technologies and
provide all participating farms with intensive technical trainings and support, but
ultimately, no technical failures were reported; and (c) failure in coordination among
participating countries due to ineffective regional coordination arrangements, lack of
country ownership, failure to observe commitments, etc. This last risk was considered
moderate and was mitigated through close project supervision, Regional Coordination
Group (RCG) meetings whose minutes clearly recorded agreements and commitments,
and effective regional coordination through training, workshops, study tours, and the
FAO RFO sponsored project website and newsletter.
2.1.5 QAG “Quality at Entry?. The project was interviewed by QEA8 in May 2007, and
in June 2007 received a Satisfactory rating on all dimensions with the exception of
Fiduciary Aspects, which was rated as Moderately Satisfactory due to certain
inadequacies related to financial management. The project’s Master Capacity Building
Development Plans were rated highly satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation
2.2.1 Overall, project implementation was successful. A number of proven LWM
technologies were successfully demonstrated at project farms. This, in turn, attracted the
interest of a large number of non-project farms’ in learning from the project and


                                             6
requesting project support. The actual standing pig population covered by project farms
exceeded 57% of the appraised target. Project results were presented in a SmartLessons
note, which later received a First Award in a Bank-wide SmartLessons Special
Competition2 in February 2012.
2.2.2 With only one exception, all project activities were successfully implemented
under the project and completed by the closing dates stipulated in the respective Grant
Agreements with each recipient. The one exception was the Support for the Treatment
and Recycling of Animal Waste (STRAW) activity under the RSS component, which was
not completed by the closing date due to failure on the part of the consultants to deliver
the expected output on time. The development of STRAW remains ongoing under FAO
financing. A draft version was available at the time of the writing of this ICR.
2.2.3 In January 2009, two cases of procurement collusion in Vietnam were identified
and reported to the Bank’s Institutional Integrity Unit (INT). In response, the Vietnam
PMO, with the Bank’s close supervision, undertook the necessary corrective actions to
sanction the firms involved and to ensure that the two contracts concerned were properly
rebid. In response, the Vietnam PMO adopted a procurement action plan in October 2009.
Together, these actions ensured the integrity of project implementation in Vietnam.
2.2.4 Project implementation progress was slower than expected in the early years of
project implementation in all three countries. While most components were implemented
as scheduled, physical construction of demonstration facilities did not start until early
2008 in China, mid-2008 in Vietnam and late 2009 in Thailand. These delays were
caused mainly by the initial lack of experience on the part of all project implementing
agencies, by the preparation of two associated clean development mechanism (CDM)3
projects in Thailand following approval of the GEF project, by natural disasters in
Thailand and Vietnam, social unrest in Thailand and, the time-consuming governmental
processes for internal review and approval of project endorsements and budget
allocations. To address these issues, the project provided intensive training to build the
capacity of the executing agencies, organized workshops to exchange experience among
participating countries and provided overall support through regular routine
communications and increased numbers of supervision missions. This spared the project
being classified a “Project at Risk?, and allowed implementation to be completed as
planned in China by December 31, 2010, in Vietnam by June 30, 2011, and by Thailand
and the FAO by December 31, 2011, following extensions of 6 and 12 months
respectively. In summary, project implementation lasted 4.5 years in China, 5 years in
Vietnam and with the FAO, and 5.5 years in Thailand.
2.2.5 Mid-term Review (MTR). A mid-term review was carried out in each country in
concert with the FAO RFO during the third supervision mission held from January 12 to

22, 2009. The MTR concluded that no MTR adjustment was required by the project. This
conclusion was endorsed by all three countries.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 M&E design. Design of the M&E component was based on project design,
experience drawn from other similar projects, GEF requirements for IW projects, and
individual country situations. With the agreed Results Framework and key performance
indicators, the three countries prepared their respective M&E plans and included them in
their country-specific project implementation plans (PIPs). Process indicators, stress
reduction indicators and environmental status indicators relevant to IW projects were
included in the M&E plans. These M&E plans were realistic and owned by all
participating countries.
2.3.2 M&E implementation. Based on their respective M&E plans, the three countries
developed thorough M&E systems and implemented M&E activities in an orderly,
organized, and effective manner. Designated M&E staff members in each PMO were
assigned at both the national and local levels, specialized training was provided, and the
required funds were budgeted for implementation of the M&E plans. National PMOs
were responsible for overseeing all M&E activities, while monitoring assignments for
sampling, analysis, and reporting of livestock waste reduction were contracted out to
independent professional firms or institutions. A summary of monitoring results was
routinely reflected in semi-annual project progress reports. At project completion, a total
of 52 environmental monitoring reports were submitted. A final aggregated M&E report
was submitted by each country as part of its ICR package. Data collection and surveys for
other M&E results were carried out by the PMOs, supported by the countries’
environmental and public health agencies, to track implementation of project activities
and related expenditures. Regular semi-annual progress reports, environmental
monitoring reports and specific studies provided reliable information and data on project
implementation.
2.3.3 M&E utilization. M&E results were carefully reviewed to evaluate project
implementation status and identify issues that may require attention. Specifically,
monitoring results were used to evaluate the performance of the demonstrated technology
packages in comparison to the baseline. Ultimately, the M&E results were used as the
major instrument by which to assess achievement of project impacts. The M&E results
were also used for research and academic purposes by the Guangdong Academy of
Agricultural Sciences and the South China Agricultural University, as well as for
decision making purposes with respect to the development of livestock waste
management policies at the county, municipal and provincial government levels in
Guangdong Province. To collect post-project monitoring data, the project facilitated the
mobilization of grant support from the Global Methane Initiative (GMI) to continue
environmental monitoring at a selected number of participating farms for one additional
year in Thailand and Vietnam, and two years in China, following the same protocol and
parameters specified in the project PAD. The project also supported the wide
dissemination of its M&E practices, to support the adoption of project practices in
additional livestock farms in the three countries.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


                                            8
2.4.1 Safeguard compliance.
   (a) Environmental Safeguard. Assessed as a Category “B? project, the project
      prepared an environmental assessment and an environmental management plan
      (EMP) in each of the three countries, in accordance with each country’s and the
      Bank’s safeguard policies and requirements. All implementing agencies
      established independent environmental management teams responsible for
      supervising and monitoring the EMP’s implementation. Internal and external
      environmental monitoring results confirmed that efficient implementation of the
      EMPs mitigated and controlled the adverse environmental impacts resulting from
      project construction to acceptable levels. No complaints with respect to
      environmental issues were reported during the course of the project’s
      implementation. In conclusion, project implementation was fully in compliance
      with the Bank’s environmental safeguard policies.
   (b) Social Safeguard Instruments and Implementation. OP 4.12 and OP 4.10 were
      triggered due to possible impacts on Indigenous Peoples and from Involuntary
      Resettlement. A set of Framework/Guidelines were prepared during project
      preparation covering Indigenous Peoples and Involuntary Resettlement. These
      Framework/Guidelines were applied by the three countries during project
      implementation. It was concluded that implementation was in compliance with
      the Bank’s social safeguard policies.
2.4.2 Fiduciary Compliance
   (a) Procurement. Overall, procurement was carried out in a satisfactory manner. All
       goods, works and consulting services were procured as planned. Both the Bank’s
       Procurement and Consultant Guidelines were closely followed by all PMOs and
       the FAO RFO. As noted above, delayed initiation of project implementation led to
       slow procurement progress in the early years of project implementation. General
       procurement issues were addressed and resolved through timely communications,
       and provision of clarifications, between the PMOs and the Bank team. No
       substantial issues with respect to the procurement process were identified, save
       the two cases of procurement collusion noted above, that were resolved in 2010.
       The project’s implementation allowed the three PMOs to significantly improve
       their procurement capacity.
   (b) Financial Management. A sound internal control system was put in place by most
       recipients as of project effectiveness, to ensure that project funds would be used
       for their intended purposes. The financial management covenants and
       requirements contained in the Grant Agreements were, on the whole, complied
       with by most recipients. The financial management (FM) was rated satisfactory
       for China and the FAO, and moderately satisfactory for Vietnam and Thailand.
       For Vietnam, persistent weaknesses were identified in the capacity of the FM staff
       regarding financial reporting, internal control system management and monitoring
       of counterpart funding for project supported LWM facilities. In addition, several
       of the project’s annual financial audit reports had to be returned due to
       inconsistencies and errors, and during some supervision missions, ineligible
       expenditures were identified. For Thailand, the principal concern was that the


                                           9
         majority of FM and audit reports were submitted with delays. Ultimately however,
         it is to be noted that the three governments provided greater amounts of
         counterpart funds than had been committed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 It is expected that the project financed livestock waste management facilities will
continue their operations and provide benefits to the project farms by generating biogas
and/or biogas-generated electricity that reduces farm energy and pig production costs,
and through the marketing of digested manure. In Thailand, the potential revenue from
the sale of certified carbon emission reductions (CER) provides an additional incentive
for the Thai farms to continue operating their livestock waste management facilities, as
these revenues would be adequate to cover operating and maintenance (O&M) and re-
investment costs. Furthermore, strong commitment on the part of the three participating
countries to provide continued technical support services to project financed facilities
will further enhance the sustainability of project interventions.
2.5.2 At project completion, all participating countries expressed strong commitment
toward implementation of their country-specific Replication Strategies, which will allow
for replication and scale up of the technologies demonstrated, and eventually allow for
the integration of successful demonstration results into each country’s overall livestock
waste management strategy. In fact, an additional 679 farms in China, Thailand and
Vietnam, with an estimated total of 1.9 million SPP, have adopted the project’s practices
within the context of the project’s replication efforts. Such strategies are still being
implemented in the three countries. Specific actions, by recipient, include:
   (a)   China (Guangdong province) has included all participating farms in its technical
         support and extension system and will provide continued technical support to the
         farms. In addition, Boluo County and Heyuan City each issued a decree, in 2009
         and 2010 respectively, promoting the adoption of sound LWM practices
         demonstrated by the project among their pig farms. Such policy actions are
         critical to incentivize continued operations of project financed facilities. Finally,
         based on the positive results achieved under this GEF-funded project, China
         launched the preparation of the Guangdong Agricultural Pollution Reduction
         Project, a $100 million IBRD loan matched by $100 million in co-financing,
         which figures in the Bank’s FY14 lending program. The lending project will
         address agricultural pollution issues, and over 50% of the project financing will
         support further LWM investments in about 300 large commercial pig farms in
         Guangdong.
   (b) Thailand continues to implement the two associated CDM projects which cover
       16 out of the 20 farms that were financed by the project. In addition, the Thai line
       ministries have agreed to continue promoting sound LWM in the country. They
       will maintain continued collaboration within the sector on LWM issues, provide
       guidance, information, and financial resources to project and non-project farms,
       and finance long-term technical support services, as well as strengthen
       cooperation with international and regional organizations and other countries to
       disseminate Thai experiences. Moreover, the Department of Livestock
       Development (DLD) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives launched a


                                              10
       demonstration using liquid manure in rice paddy fields, expanding the project’s
       replication potential, and the Pollution Control Department (PCD) of the Ministry
       of Natural Resources and Environment planned to develop new regulations,
       including effluent standards for small livestock farms and odor standards for pig
       farms, based on project results. Government grants are being mobilized to support
       post-completion operations including long-term environmental impact monitoring,
       performance evaluations of demonstrated technologies, and workshops to share
       project farms’ experiences.
   (c) Vietnam has focused its efforts on replication and scale up through
       implementation of various initiatives. A documentary film developed by the PMO
       was broadcast in many communities to improve awareness amongst key
       stakeholders on demonstrated technologies and their environmental and economic
       benefits. Results of the GEF project have also been shared with the Bank’s
       ongoing Livestock Competitiveness Project, which includes a component that
       addresses similar livestock waste management issues. Furthermore, a Hanoi
       cooperative has applied and obtained a government subsidy, complemented by a
       low interest loan, to replicate demonstrated anaerobic digestion (AD) technologies
       in five large pig farms and purchase 10 engines for biogas power generation.
   (d) The UN FAO facilitated the development of “A Global Agenda of Action for
       Sustainable Livestock Sector Development?, co-chaired by the World Bank and
       the International Livestock Research Institute. Drawing on the results and
       experiences of the project, the Global Agenda defines one of its three areas of
       focus as Reduced Discharges, which promotes full recovery of nutrient and
       energy from animal manure.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 The project and its objectives, as designed and implemented, remain highly
relevant as it addresses one of the most significant and rapidly growing sources of land-
based pollution of the South China Sea: the environmentally unsustainable and
geographically-concentrated intensive livestock production in China, Thailand and
Vietnam. The project demonstrated viable and replicable technological packages and
developed country-specific replication strategies to guide the process into the future. The
successful results and experiences generated by the project are also of regional and global
significance for other countries bordering the South China Sea, as well as for other
countries that face similar issues.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
3.2.1 The project results provide clear evidence that both the PDO and GEO were
achieved. The project reached or exceeded virtually all the outcome targets set at
appraisal (see Section F of the Data Sheet), resulting in reduction of the major negative
environmental impacts associated with concentrated livestock production. Ten proven
livestock waste management technological packages were demonstrated on a total of 56
participating farms and in one village. These technological packages covered a total of
653,000 SPP, which is 57 percent more than the appraisal target. Based on monitoring


                                            11
results, the demonstrated AD technological packages removed an average of 89% of P,
87% of N, and 95% of BOD from all participating farms. These are 152%, 58% and
280% more effective than the benchmark option targets for P, N and BOD removal,
respectively. The quality of treated livestock waste water now meets the national
discharge standards of each participating country. The actual pollution reduction effect
was even more significant because the treated effluents from almost all participating
farms were not discharged into public water bodies but rather, used as liquid fertilizer and
on-farm recycled water. It is estimated that a total of 219,200 tCO2e of greenhouse gas
(GHS) emission reduction was achieved during project implementation, and that an
additional annual reduction of about 149,500 tCO2e will be achieved starting in 2012.
With tangible financial benefits gained from the project, much improved and workable
livestock waste management skills being applied and increased awareness regarding
environmental protection issues, participating farms are motivated to sustain operation of
project-constructed livestock waste management systems and to move away from the
unsound management of livestock wastes.
3.2.2 The project also achieved significant reduction of health risks associated with
concentrated livestock production activities by introducing sound livestock waste
management practices including: (i) treatment of the wastes from all livestock
populations on the participating farms and prohibiting the sale of fresh wastes; (ii)
separate composting solid wastes not treated by AD facilities; and (iii) proper disposal of
all treated solid and liquid wastes to avoid secondary pollution. Anecdotal evidence from
surveys and data collected by the participating countries showed that project activities
reduced over 90% of total E. coli on participating farms. 4 Such positive results with
respect to health risk reduction have encouraged local Thai authorities to issue health risk
business licenses for pig farms adopting demonstrated AD-based livestock waste
management technologies. 5 In Vietnam, residents of the participating farms and
neighboring communities reported6 that they suffered from fewer infectious diseases - all
closely associated with pig production - as a result of project implementation. It is
estimated that intestinal disease infections dropped from 53% to 12%, surface water
caused allergies dropped from 35% to 6%, methane caused eye diseases were reduced
from 24% to 12%, and respiratory diseases dropped from 18% to 6%, following
completion of the project financed livestock waste management facilities on the
participating farms. It was also reported that project implementation contributed to the
reduction of headache occurrences from 29% before the project to 18% after the project
among of residents living at the participating farms and their neighboring communities.
However, the project had no impact on the use of antibiotics and other residues in animal
feeds as originally expected.


4
  This result is consistent with the findings of a study funded by the US Environmental Protection Agency,
which observed that AD technologies could kill over 90% of indicator organisms and potential pathogens
(Eastern Research Group, Inc., 2005, An evaluation of A Mesophilic, Modified Plug Flow Anaerobic
Digester for Dairy Cattle Manure. EPA Contract No. GS 10F-0036K).
5
  According to the Thai Public Health Act (1992), pig-raising is legally identified as a business posing
public health risks. At the local level, TAO (Tambon (sub-district) Administrative Office) issues a "health
risk business license" to permit establishment of a pig farm.
6
  Note that this report was not statistically corroborated.


                                                    12
3.2.3 The project’s global environmental objective was achieved through
implementation of the well designed and executed project activities, and the replication
and scale-up of the project’s demonstrated technological packages. During project
implementation, it is estimated that a total reduction of 2,100 T of phosphorus, 3,600 T of
nitrogen, 23,900 T of BOD and 63,100 T of COD was achieved. Based on the removal
rates highlighted in Section 3.2.1, it has been estimated that an annual total of 1,500 T of
phosphorus, 2,600 T of nitrogen, 17,200 T of BOD and 45,400 T of COD will be avoided
from discharges into the South China Sea following project completion.
3.2.4 The project’s long term impacts are aligned with the implementation of country-
specific replication strategies and the dissemination of project results via various national
channels (photographs, DVDs, documentary etc.), project newsletters, a project-dedicated
website and regional and international workshops and conferences, that will facilitate
regional and global replication and scale-up of sound livestock waste management
practices.7 Specifically, country-specific replication strategies were adopted and enforced
in a total of 679 farms (570 in China, 14 in Thailand and 95 in Vietnam) during project
implementation. The country-specific spatial distribution plans were developed in all
participating countries and implemented in selected local areas during project
implementation. The implementation of the national replications strategies and the spatial
distribution plans are still ongoing in the three countries after project completion.
Moreover, the project-sponsored International Conference on Water Pollution Reduction
and Climate Change Mitigation held in China in September 2009, played an important
role in dissemination of project experiences.8 In addition, project posters were presented
at the World Water Day event hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific, held in Bangkok, Thailand on March 22, 2010. As
of June 2011, 15 provinces in China and 7 countries bordering the South China Sea have
requested project countries’ support on livestock waste management training and
extension programs. Visitors from 7 regional and international organizations and about
20 countries have visited various project farms.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 Consistent with the approach adopted at project appraisal, a cost-effectiveness
analysis was performed to evaluate the project’s efficiency with respect to achievement



7
  Including: (i) International Conference on Nutrient Pollution Control in the Danube- Black Sea Basin
(October 2006 in Moldova); (ii) East Asia Sea Congress (December 2006 in China); (iii) Fourth and Fifth
Biennial IW Conference (August 2007 in South Africa and October 2009 in Australia); (iv) Methane to
Markets Partnership Expo (October 2007 in China); and (v) International Conference on Water Pollution
Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation (September 2009 in China).
8
  The International Conference was jointly sponsored by the World Bank, FAO, GEF, M 2M, ADB, China
(MOA), Thailand (MOAC), Vietnam (MONRE), and Guangdong Provincial People’s Government from
August 31 to September 2, 2009 in Guangzhou, China. The conference was a major project event attended
by 146 participants including 88 Chinese national participants from 30 provinces and Hong Kong SAR,
China; 58 international participants from 7 regional and international organizations and 13 countries.
During the Conference, a total of 26 speakers shared their experiences and exchanged views, and many
more participants used the Conference as a platform to learn from experiences, share ideas and explore
potential opportunities for cooperation.


                                                  13
of project objectives. This analysis included carbon emission reductions as an important
co-benefit that emerged during project implementation.
3.3.2 Economic analysis. The project’s economic analysis examined and assessed the
efficiencies of the various technical solutions for sound livestock waste management
promoted by the project. This analysis concluded that the ten AD technology packages
demonstrated by the project were, as a whole, cost effective in reducing pollution
discharges from the project farms. The weighted average unit investment cost for the ten
AD technological packages was higher than the benchmark option estimates at appraisal,
but this is justified by the following factors: (a) the unit cost of nutrient removal at ICR
was 16.9% and 8.1% lower than the benchmark option estimates for P and N reduction
respectively; (b) the project achieved higher nutrient removal efficiency than the
benchmark option targets by achieving 152%, 58% and 280% more for P, N and BOD
respectively; (c) the project-introduced technology packages required higher initial
investment costs but yielded better than projected financial returns to participating farms;
(d) the demonstrated technological packages included additional features covering
additional efficiency and operational safety; and (e) the market price of the major project
inputs were significantly increased during project implementation.
3.3.3 Financial analysis. A financial analysis was conducted to evaluate the
attractiveness of the project’s financial incentives for participating farms. Up front, the
project subsidized in the order of 60% of farm investments and contributed positive
impacts on the participating farms’ revenues resulting from technological upgrades. This
ensured sufficient interest on the part of pig farms to participate in the project. A cash
flow analysis on typical farms participating in the project showed that the Financial
Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) on full costing was 8.7%, 14.7% and 8.2% respectively
for the Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese farms. The higher FIRR for the Thai farms was
directly due to their expected certified emission reduction (CER) revenues, and their
additional sales income from dried digested sludge. The analysis concluded that from a
financial perspective, the project presented an attractive option to all participating farms
in converting their livestock waste management facilities to more sustainable modes of
operation. However, as was documented at project appraisal and later confirmed during
interviews with non-project farms, it is clear that subsidies will continue to be required
for future sound LWM investments. This is due to the public goods nature of sound
LWM actions, and the low investment interests of farmers on waste management
facilities given that pig production remains a high-risk business affected by frequent
epidemic diseases and volatile market conditions, and where pollution enforcement in the
sector is lax due to the strong governmental interests in ensuring a sufficient and
affordable supply of pig products.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
3.4.1 The project’s Satisfactory rating for overall outcome is justified by its high
relevance to current country, regional and global priorities, as well as the Bank’s country
partnership strategies. Almost all PDO and GEO indicators were achieved (see details in
Annex 2 on achieved outputs). Sound technology packages were demonstrated with high
efficiency in achieving performance targets (see details in Annex 3). Furthermore, the


                                              14
project’s long term impacts – replication of demonstrated practices in the three
participating countries as well as in other countries bordering the South China Sea – has
been witnessed by solid post-completion actions undertaken by all three countries (see
details in paragraph 2.5.1) in line with their respective country-specific Replication
Strategies. All participating countries reported, and Bank supervision missions confirmed,
that all project stakeholders were satisfied with the project’s overall outcome. It is also
recognized that two outcome indicators were partially achieved: (a) health risks
associated the use of antibiotics and other residues in animal feeds were not tackled as
originally planned, and (b) one of DSTs was not completed by the project closing date.
However, such deficiencies have negligible impacts on the overall impacts of the project
– successful technology demonstration and scaling up in the three most important pig
production countries in the world.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 The project was not designed with any specific poverty impact in mind. However,
some farm-led initiatives did contribute positive poverty reduction impacts. Specifically,
Luoxing Farm in Guangdong province provided free biogas to two local schools serving
about 1,200 students and their teachers. Part of the saved energy cost at the two schools
has been used to finance poor drop-out students to return to their studies, and to improve
teaching facilities. Sa-ard farm in Thailand offered free biogas to a nearby elementary
school whose student population are mostly from poor families. The sales revenue from
dried digested sludge on the majority of participating Thai farms was partially distributed
to poor farm workers. And, the supply, free of charge, of treated wastewater by
participating farms to nearby crop farms in the three countries, reduced production costs
for the mostly poor smallholder crop farmers.
3.5.2 Project implementation also yielded positive gender impacts in China and
Vietnam. In Guangdong, a total of 529 households have shifted to project-produced
biogas as cooking fuel and are paying a nominal charge to cover the operating and
management costs of the biogas supply system. Of these, 441 households replaced fuel
wood with biogas supplied from project financed facilities. In addition to the fuel cost
savings achieved, this shift has reduced the labor intensity of 1-1.5 days per week, per
household, on average required for fuel wood collection and cooking, which has
traditionally been borne by women. This has provided women with time to undertake
alternative activities, and the use of biogas has improved the indoor air quality in these
households. Following the project’s demonstration, this model was extended to cover a
total of 5,187 households, or 25,935 persons, in Boluo County by the end of 2010.
Similar benefits have positively affected women in Vietnam. In Thailand, no such
benefits have been directly observed as all participating farms (except Sa-ard farm that
has supplied biogas to a local elementary school) have used biogas to generate electricity
for their own needs.
3.5.3 The project’s social impact was positive and significant. By improving local
environmental quality (reduced odors, improved local water quality, reduced health risks),
the project improved relationships between the participating farms and their neighboring
communities that had been negatively affected by livestock production related pollution


                                            15
issues prior to project interventions. In addition, the project supported waste management
facilities created new job opportunities on the farms. A further positive social impact on
the Thai farms was observed, as these farms not only improved the quality of the working
and living conditions for their workers, many of whom come from Myanmar, but also
and assisted these employees in obtaining their Thai work permits. All workers were
trained to adapt to the new production environment after project implementation.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.4 Successful implementation of the project-supported Master Capacity Building
Development Plans has greatly improved capacity of all stakeholders and strengthened
collaboration among key government agencies involved in livestock waste management.
In addition, FAO provided capacity building support through various FAO training
sessions, workshops, and regular RCG meetings. Support from experienced international
and national consultants was also mobilized to assist the PMOs on key technical issues.
All participating countries viewed the institutional strengthening activities as the project’s
top priority and described the project’s contribution as comprehensive including, support
for project management, policy development and enforcement, technical assistance, and
physical investment on livestock waste management). Support provided was inclusive,
benefiting all involved in the project at the national, provincial and local levels, with
noticeable long term impacts in terms of awareness raising, development of replication
strategies, improved collaboration among relevant government agencies, financial
institutions, academia, and farmers, and cross-country and regional collaboration.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
3.5.5 In addition to the two aforementioned positive impacts on poverty and gender in
Thailand, an additional unintended outcome was the project’s integration with two CDM
projects during project implementation. This integration enabled 16 of the project’s 20
participating farms to generate up to a total of 148,000 T of CO2 equivalent emission
reductions, plus an expected revenue of about $1.9 million over the next 5 years. This
additional CDM benefit was a great incentive for other eligible farms to seek project
support in Thailand. One last unintended outcome of the project was that the project
farms were able to produce and provide, or sell, the digested liquid and sludge waste as
safe, inexpensive and good quality fertilizers and soil conditioners. Sales of these
products provided further revenues to the project farms in Thailand.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

4.1.1 For project farms, the financial and economic analysis conducted at ICR has
confirmed that project investments are financially sustainable. It did however, identify
possible financial risk to the sustainability of project outcomes, as the analysis also
showed that financial incentives would be required to incentivize additional farms to
replicate the demonstrated project practices. This implies a risk that the three countries



                                             16
might not be able to mobilize the incentives needed for replicating and scaling up project
demonstrated technological packages after project completion. However, as discussed
earlier in Section 2.5.2, the three countries have taken a series actions to implement
country specific Replication Strategies to scale up demonstrated project activities. This
risk is therefore considered to be low.
4.1.2 There is also a potential risk that some of the project farms may stop supplying
biogas to the neighboring communities, villagers and schools, resulting in conflicts at
community level. This risk is expected to be low as local authorities, farmers and
communities in the project areas have developed strong social awareness. More
importantly, there were relevant agreements signed among all parties involved.
4.1.3 The environmental benefits achieved under the project are significant and will be
sustainable during the lifetime of the project financed LWM facilities. There might be a
potential environmental risk if wastes are not properly managed at the time of major
maintenance of the facilities, however this environmental risk is low as it would be
temporary in nature and sufficient mitigation measures have been built into the operations
manuals of each facility.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.1 As the GEF implementing agency of this project, the Bank ensured that the
project design was technically sound and could achieve the proposed measurable project
objectives in a cost effective manner. The Bank also ensured that fiduciary arrangements
were adequate and that provision of safeguards mitigation measures was guaranteed. The
Bank achieved all these by working closely with all three countries and the FAO to
identify sound technical proposals to address the key sector issues based on actual
country situations. This ensured the joint development of a final product that was owned
by all parties.
5.1.2 Technically, the project’s design was informed by a group of highly experienced
international and national experts. It also incorporated FAO experience from previous
pilot projects in the three countries, the results from consultations with key stakeholders,
and the experience and lessons learned from many other initiatives and programs funded
by the Bank, as well as other international and regional organizations. By aligning closely
with the governments’ priorities and strategies, this project design was guaranteed the
strong support of all stakeholders during implementation.
5.1.3 The project was interviewed by the QAG panel and rated Satisfactory for quality
at entry in almost all aspects. The project’s Master Capacity Building Development Plans
were rated highly satisfactory (see Section 2.1.5).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory



                                            17
5.1.4 The Bank carried out consistent project supervision with highly qualified staff
members from both the Bank’s headquarters and country offices. In addition to routine
communications and frequent review of project documents, the seven supervision
missions conducted by the Bank over the course of project implementation served to
ensure that implementation progress remained on track, Bank policies were followed,
legal covenants were observed, required technical support was being provided, issues or
concerns were identified and addressed and ultimately, that project objectives were being
achieved. All supervision mission arrangements, mission findings and recommendations
were fully discussed and agreed between the Bank and the three participating countries.
The mid-term review was carried out as scheduled.
5.1.5 Issues, including the two cases of collusion in procurement, were flagged and
resolved in a timely manner. The Bank team’s six project procurement and financial
management country offices-based specialists provided adequate oversight and efficient
and effective support to address fiduciary compliance. This was particularly important
with respect to procurement issues, since all procurement documents were drafted in the
local languages. The Bank’s country office-based environmental safeguards and social
development specialists supervised compliance of the Bank safeguard policies in all three
countries and thus maintained cross-country consistency on safeguards supervision. Such
arrangements and efforts were highly appreciated by all three participating countries. The
Bank team’s quality of supervision was recognized positively by the September 2009
QAG assessment, but no rating was provided. In April 2012, the Bank awarded a 2012
East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) Vice Presidency Unit (VPU) Team Award to the project
for its successful implementation and significant developmental impacts.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.1.6 Despite the constraints and challenges that such an innovative, multi-country
demonstration project presented during project preparation and implementation, the Bank
maintained a highly responsive team throughout the project design, implementation and
completion phases, which resulted in solid provision of support on every aspect of project
implementation to the country teams and FAO. The Bank team played a decisive role in
the success implementation of the project, as well as facilitated follow-up actions in all
three countries at project completion.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.1 The governments of all three participating countries provided strong political and
financial commitments to the project. They were responsive and supportive to the project
activities, and actively coordinated project preparation and implementation in their
respective countries. The contributions and support made by each government, which are
considered adequate, flowed through each government’s designated project implementing
agency. Both the national and local governments of the three countries participated in
project interventions actively. At project completion, it was calculated that the three
governments had each provided higher levels of counterpart funding than had been
committed at appraisal.


                                            18
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.2 Four implementing agencies were involved in project preparation and
implementation: three country PMOs and the RFO of FAO. All implementing agencies
contributed significantly to project preparation and implementation, delivering
counterpart funding committed by the three countries and FAO, establishing functional
institutional arrangements for project implementation, and mobilizing needed technical
support to facilitate project implementation. In addition, the Bangkok-based FAO RFO
provided regional support services to the three country implementing agencies for
capacity building, coordination and facilitation and knowledge dissemination.
5.2.3 As noted earlier, the lack of experience with Bank projects and organizational
adjustments within the three country implementing agencies did contribute to a slow
project implementation start. However, implementation was quickly accelerated
following PMO reorganization and improved understanding of Bank operations
generated through “learning by doing?, training, study tours and hands-on support
provided during Bank supervision missions. Ensuring the functionality of the three PMOs
allowed project implementation to be successfully completed, despite the challenges
experienced, in particular by Vietnam and Thailand, during implementation. Overall, all
the implementing agencies were responsive to implementation issues identified by
supervision missions, and closely followed the Bank’s recommendations in order to
resolve issues in a timely manner. All implementing agencies also carried out the M&E
activities in accordance with the agreed M&E plans. Although the FM performance of
two PMOs (see 2.4.2 for details),is rated as only moderately satisfactory, given the
overall complexity of the project and the well-structured and well-managed overall
management performance which allowed problems to be quickly identified and resolved,
this aspect is not considered to sufficiently tilt the balance away from an overall
Satisfactory rating.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
5.2.4 Despite an initial steep learning curve for the three country implementation
agencies, each of which was new to Bank operations, the three governments and their
implementing agencies demonstrated strong commitment with regard to the project’s
objectives and its implementation, as well as on replication and scaling up of the project’s
demonstrated practices in their respective countries. Successful project completion and
ongoing implementation of replication actions underscore the borrowers’ satisfactory
performance.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1    Stakeholders’ strong commitments. To ensure project ownership, sustainability
and success, strong commitments are needed - from government partners (for compliance,
enforcement, and provision of incentives) and from key stakeholders (for full
involvement in project preparation and implementation). The project succeeded in
gaining strong commitments from all stakeholders through: (a) integration of project
interventions with the governments’ mainstreamed programs; (b) implementation based


                                            19
on existing institutional mechanisms; and (c) identification and involvement of key local
stakeholders such as, village committees and the women’s federation in China, pig
cooperatives in Vietnam, and local administrations, communities, and nongovernmental
organizations in Thailand, on project design and implementation.
6.2     Technology selection based on actual country situations. Livestock waste
management technologies should be simple to operate and compatible with the various
waste-handling practices and methods of livestock farms, be cost-effective and offer
financial returns and, be able to be locally developed and serviced. A number of LWM
technologies exist, ranging from simple to complex, with various cost implications that
range from moderate to high. As demonstrated by the project, selection of such
technology should be based on country specific conditions to ensure acceptance,
feasibility, efficiency and sustainability of project investments.
6.3     Comprehensive approach for long-term sustainability. This project’s
comprehensive approach integrated a suite of actions ranging from demonstration of
technical solutions, development of policy development and improvement in enforcement,
capacity building and awareness-raising, to regional coordination and dissemination.
Successful demonstration of technical solutions provided concrete waste management
practices that are financially viable, environmentally sound, socially beneficial and
locally accessible, showcasing what could be studied and further replicated in the
countries. Such demonstration also formed the basis for development and implementation
of country specific policy actions such as the Replication Strategies and improvement in
environmental enforcement. The needs and results of such demonstration then helped
refine capacity building activities to match the actual needs, as did increased awareness
among all stakeholders, which improved acceptance of project interventions and
replication actions. Knowledge sharing among the project countries and at the regional
and global levels was also key.
6.4     Procurement lessons, including (i) selecting qualified procurement consultants
and maintaining designated PMO procurement staff unchanged throughout the project
implementation period are critical for procurement success; (ii) a sub-grant approach
instead of using the conventional procurement method could be considered with detailed
procedures specified to ensure fair competition, economy, efficiency, quality, and
transparency; and (iii) contracting period could be more realistically estimated and
contract implementation should be well managed for timely completion.
6.5     Financial management lessons, specific for Vietnam, including: (i) adequate FM
staff should be designated for project financial management; (ii) adequate training should
be provided to FM staff to ensure effective management of project accounting works; (iii)
management of FM documents on counterpart funding provision for project financed
waste treatment facilities should be improved; and (iv) the Project Operational Manual
should be updated regularly to improve internal control weaknesses.

7.1.1 The following is a summary of the Bank team’s comments on the general issues
raised by the participating countries.
      The World Bank shall continue to focus on the global environmental issues -
       livestock waste management in particular; promote new technologies and
       experience sharing; follow up on long term monitoring of this project and
       implementation of Replication Strategies in the participating countries; and
       launch a second phase demonstration project.
       Bank team comment: The Bank is committed to the areas proposed and values
       highly the close cooperation with all participating countries and the FAO as
       demonstrated during the project preparation and implementation. The Bank is
       willing to work with Thailand and Vietnam and is working with China to scale up
       demonstrated practices under this GEF project in Guangdong. While interested in
       exploring opportunities for future cooperation, the Bank thanks Thailand and
       Vietnam for take continued actions to ensure project sustainability and promote
       replication as committed.
      The World Bank’s procurement regulations have too many processes and are not
       flexible. Time taken for World Bank’s review was excessive in earlier years of
       project implementation. The disbursement procedures were complicated which
       often caused delay in project implementation.
       Bank team comment: These are the lessons learned. Procurement delays were
       often related to misunderstanding and lack of experience with Bank procurement
       policies. As witnessed in final years of project implementation, timely and cordial
       communications between the Bank and the clients, procurement training and
       learning from experienced PMOs of other Bank financed projects have helped
       address such delays.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1       As designed during project preparation, it was expected that on-the-ground
demonstrations of innovative, cost-effective LWM technologies by private livestock
producers and development of country specific replication strategies would be the
project’s principal outputs. Many other outputs were also achieved under the project, but
most were not targeted because the actual physical demonstration sites for improved
LWM (number of sites and covered SPPs) could not be pre-decided during project
preparation. The demonstration sites were selected on a yearly basis by each participating
country according to agreed selection criteria, specific technologies to be introduced and
availability of project funds.
Component 1: Livestock Waste Management Technology Demonstration
2      This component addressed the need to demonstrate technically, geographically,
economically and institutionally workable solutions to reduce regionally-critical livestock
waste pollution caused by industrial or concentrated livestock production, with a focus on
reducing excess nutrients (nitrates and phosphates in particular) and human health risks.
This was achieved through construction of LWM facilities supported by training
programs. These were achieved with the following key outputs.
   (a) A total of 58 LWM systems supported by 10 proven LWM technological packages
       were constructed. An estimated total of 653,000 SPP were covered by these systems
       in the three participating countries, which is 57 percent higher than the appraisal
       target.
   (b) An additional 679 farms with an estimated total of 1.9 million SPP followed the
       project practices in the participating countries as part of the project’s replication
       efforts.
   (c) An average of 89 percent of P, 85 percent of N, and 95 percent of BOD were
       removed from the participating farms and the quality of treated livestock wastes
       on participating farms now meet the national discharge standards of the respective
       countries. This implies that an annual total of 1,500 ton of phosphorus, 2,600 ton
       of nitrogen, 17,200 ton of BOD and 45,400 ton of COD were prevented from
       reaching the South China Sea. During the project implementation period, a total
       reduction of 2,100 ton of phosphorus, 3,600 ton of nitrogen, 23,900 ton of BOD
       and 63,100 ton of COD was reported.
   (d) Over 90 percent of total E. coli was reduced in participating farms in China and
       Thailand. In Vietnam, important reductions in infectious diseases (all closely
       associated with pig production) were reported as a result of project
       implementation including, intestinal diseases down from 53 percent to 12 percent,
       surface water-caused allergy reduced to 6 percent from 35 percent, methane-caused
       eye diseases down from 24 percent to 12 percent, and respiratory diseases reduced
       to 6 percent from 18 percent.




                                            23
   (e) A total of 219,200 tCO2e of greenhouse gas emission reductions was reported
       during the project implementation period and an annual reduction of about
       149,500 tCO2e, as of 2012, has been estimated.
   (f) A total of 10.1 million m3 of biogas was generated during the project
       implementation period and an annual generation of 5 million m3 of biogas, as of
       2012, has been estimated.
   (g) A total of 46.4 million Kwh of biogas-fueled electricity was generated during the
       project implementation period and an annual generation of 27.6 million Kwh of
       biogas-fueled electricity, as of 2012, has been estimated.
   (h) A total of 16,000 ton of dried digested pig manure was sold during the project
       implementation period and annual sales of 13,500 ton of dried digested pig
       manure, beginning in 2012, have been estimated.
   (i) Three manuals for the operation and maintenance of livestock waste treatment
       system were developed.
   (j) During the project implementation period, the following were organized: (i) 114
       workshops, attended by 809 persons; (ii) training of 3,100 person-days and 3,600
       person-days respectively for staff and farmers; (iii) 36 domestic study tour groups
       involving 422 persons; and (iv) 11 international study tour groups involving 111
       persons.
Component 2: Policy and Replication Strategy Development
3      This component supported the establishment of a policy and regulatory framework
for environmentally sustainable development of livestock production in each country that
would induce further policy reforms and encourage farmers to adopt improved manure
management practices. This was achieved through the development and testing of a
Replication Strategy and other policy measures in each country. These were achieved
with the following key outputs.
   (a) A total of three Country-specific Replication Strategies were finalized by
       respective country. The Replication Strategy report was submitted by each
       country in accordance with their project’s respective closing date. In order to
       incorporate the Bank’s comments, as well as the latest results of project
       implementation, experiences and lessons, policy developments and study tour
       results, the three countries took some additional time to finalize their Replication
       Strategies. These were all received by the Bank in April and May 2012.
   (b) Three Spatial Distribution Plans were developed and implemented, generating
       improved capacities in all three participating countries.
   (c) Fifty-eight (58) nutrient management plans for livestock waste were developed
       and then integrated in farm specific mini-PIPs for all participating farms.
   (d) Other policies developed during the project implementation included: (i) Nutrient
       Flux Management for Demonstrated Farm (China); (ii) Code of Practice for Livestock
       Waste Management Project (China); (iii) Code of Practices and Regulation for
       Environmental Management in Pig Farms (Thailand); (iv) Technical Base for
       Regulation on Environmental Protection in Animal Husbandry Activities


                                            24
       (Vietnam); and (v) Emission Norms of Livestock Waste Water Pollutants
       (Vietnam).
Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring
4      This component supported the establishment and operations of a national
(provincial in China) PMO and other implementing units in each participating country
and effective project monitoring and evaluation. These were achieved with the following
key outputs.
   (a) National Steering Committees (NSCs) and a Project Leading Group (PLG) in
       Guangdong province were established and maintained throughout the project
       implementation period, and assigned with functions and responsibilities
       satisfactory to the Bank.
   (b) One PMO in each participating country was established and maintained
       throughout the project implementation period, and furnished with sufficient
       resources and an adequate number of competent staff.
   (c) Local implementing units were established and maintained throughout the project
       implementation period.
   (d) About 9,100 copies of implementation manuals, 134,100 copies of project
       brochures, and 1,100 copies of DVDs and VCDs were disseminated.
   (e) A total of 63 monitoring reports were prepared. In addition, periodic evaluations
       were carried out and monitoring results were reflected in semi-annual progress
       reports prepared by the participating countries.
Component 4: Regional Support Services
5        This component focused on capacity building support and coordination and
facilitation support. The key outputs achieved included the following:
   (a) Three decision support tools (DST) were developed together with the participating
       countries: Cost of Compliance Simulation Model (CoSiMo), Spatial Planning,
       and Environmental Monitoring Guidelines. The CoSiMo was developed and
       disseminated in the three participating countries. The Spatial Planning served
       Thailand only because the other two countries did not request the service. The
       Environmental Monitoring Guidelines were developed to provide guidance to
       participating countries on water, odor sampling and their analysis. The fourth
       DST,the STRAW, which was not completed by the project closing date, is being
       finalized with FAO financing. A draft version of the STRAW is available.
   (b) Four training modules were developed and various trainings were organized
       including five training courses for CoSiMo, four development sessions for
       STRAW, continued support to the Thailand PMO during the last year of project
       implementation via a Thai consultant for Spatial Planning, and presentation of the
       Environmental Monitoring Guidelines in each country.
   (c) A total of six RCG meetings were held. Meeting minutes were prepared in each
       case to share information and exchange experience during the project
       implementation period.


                                           25
(d) A regional pool of experts has been formed.
(e) The project website was developed and maintained by the RFO and used to
   transfer main project results on to the FAO website to ensure long-term
   availability. Five issues of project newsletters were distributed to all participating
   countries. A project brochure was prepared, printed and distributed to countries. A
   Project Experience Note following the IWLEARN format was also prepared.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      Consistent with the approach adopted at project appraisal, a cost-effectiveness
analysis was performed to evaluate the project’s efficiency in achieving project
objectives. This analysis however included carbon emission reduction as an important
benefit that emerged during project implementation.
A.     Economic Analysis
2.      The project’s main economic benefits were derived from: (a) direct energy
savings by using project produced biogas and biogas-generated electricity; (b) the sale of
dried treated sludge and pig manure; (c) increased on-farm and off-farm agricultural
production (crop, orchard and fish); (d) reduced carbon emissions; (e) reduced pollution
in the public waters leading to the South China Sea; (f) improved environment for
participating farms and for neighboring communities; (g) reduced human health risks and,
(h) the expected improved efficiency of government agencies in public administration
and improved capacity of government staff in managing livestock waste in the three
participating countries through similar domestic investment programs. As many of the
above economic benefits cannot be easily quantifiable and some benefits are remotely
relevant to the project objectives, this project’s economic analysis focused on cost
effectiveness of project intervention to assess the efficiencies of various technical
solutions.
3.      Various technological packages are available to remove excess nutrients and
organic matter from livestock wastes, such as composting, aeration processes and
anaerobic digestion (AD). Composting is the least-cost option suitable for farms that
handle solid wastes only, with very low carbon-reduction potential and no biogas
generation. Aeration processes are effective only when adequate retention time and a
series of processes are ensured. The aeration processes are very costly if electricity is
used to provide adequate oxygen to satisfy the biological demand of the livestock waste.
Such processes require sizable land areas and are suitable for farms that handle dilute
wastes, where emissions can be high. AD is an anaerobic (without oxygen) biological
process that stabilizes waste material, reduces BOD, produces biogas, and trace amounts
of hydrogen sulfide. Biogas is combustible and when recovered may be used in
renewable energy applications such as electrical generation, heating, cooking fuel, and
lighting, among others. Digested solids are used as fertilizer for crops, orchards and
gardening while digested liquids are used as liquid fertilizer for crops, orchards and water
plants, as well as for fish feed. In some cases, such liquids, post-sanitation and
disinfection processes, are recycled as cleaning water for pig barns. In addition, AD
reduces carbon emissions which bring real or potential carbon emissions reduction
revenue to participating farms. As a result, all participating countries sought to adopt the
AD biogas-recovery technological packages.
4.      Various commercially proven ADs are available for farms of various sizes, with
an associated range of operational complexity and costs. To achieve the project
objectives, the project introduced and demonstrated a total of ten proven technological
packages (combined AD treatment and various other processes) to effectively remove


                                            27
nutrients and prevent discharge of untreated livestock waste into the waterways. These
AD technologies are proven to be highly efficient in reducing fluxes of critical nutrients
(N, P) and organic matter (BOD) originating from livestock waste into the environment.
The following table provides a comparison of nutrient removal efficiencies and costs of
project-demonstrated technological packages against the Using Combined Treatment and
Recycling Technology option (the benchmark option) developed at project appraisal.
5.       The nutrients and organic matter removal rates of the benchmark option listed in
the above table were considered, at appraisal, realistic, optimal and best able to contribute
to achievement of project objectives. These rates and the associated costs were therefore,
used as the benchmarks against which the project’s demonstrated technological packages
would be compared. All project demonstrated technical solutions used the combined AD
treatment with additional processes including: (a) composting; (b) land application or sale
of composted or digested solids; (c) aerobic exposure in series storage ponds for digested
liquids; (d) growing water plants (green algae, water spinach etc.) and raising fish in
storage ponds; and (e) on-farm recycling of treated liquids to achieve the maximum
results.
6.      The comparison indicated that the unit investment cost per pig cycle of the
aggregated average of all ten technological packages was $2.06 in constant 2005 prices.
This number is higher than the estimate of the benchmark option - $1.42. The higher unit
investment cost is due mainly to the following reasons: (a) demonstrated AD
technologies required high investment costs but yielded robust financial returns to
participating farms; (b) actual AD investment included additional components for
improved treatment efficiency and operational safety; and (c) CDM-related requirements
added investment costs of the facilities in Thailand (e.g. large digesters were required for
long hydraulic retention time and wastewater/biogas flow meters were installed to
properly monitor biogas generation). Exclusion of such additional facilities in Thailand
would have resulted in no, or reduced carbon emissions reduction credits and thus, was
not accepted. This higher unit cost is considered reasonable and justified for the
technological packages because (a) the cost/ton of the nutrient removal at ICR was
actually 16.9% and 8.1% lower than the benchmark option estimates for P and N,
respectively; and (b) the project achieved higher nutrient removal efficiency i.e. removal
of 152%, 58% and 280% more than the benchmark option targets on P, N and BOD
respectively.

7.      Such AD technological packages are more effective in removing nutrients and
organic matter than the benchmark option. Nevertheless, variations in unit investment
costs existed among ten technological packages due to (a) local availability of equipment,
(b) fluctuating market prices of major inputs, (c) local capacity to design, build, and
operate such facilities, and (d) preference and affordability of participating farmers.
Variations also existed in unit costs associated with nutrient removal among the ten
technological packages for P, and N. Noticeably, the Red-mud Plastic Baffled Reactor
and the Modified Covered Lagoon technological packages yielded a cost/ton for nutrient
removal higher than the benchmark option for both P and N indicating a lower efficiency
of nutrient removal than the benchmark option. This was caused primarily by: (a) higher
unit investment cost; (b) higher cost/pig cycle for nutrient removal on one percentage
point base; and, (c) lower than average nutrient removal rates among ten technological
packages.
8.      The benchmark option was based on combined treatment (non-biogas techniques
– composting, lagoons) and recycling (land application). Such a combination, at a lower
unit investment cost, yielded a relatively lower efficiency in removing nutrients and
organic matter. The ten AD technological packages however, required higher investment
cost for the AD process but removed higher rates of nutrients and organic matter (through
combination of AD and post-treatment processes). These AD technological packages
therefore, contributed more significantly to the achievement of project objectives. As
more nutrients and organic matter were removed, the higher unit cost presented as a form
of geometrical progression. And, while recycling was fully promoted wherever
appropriate under the project, various other alternative post-treatment options were also
used including, drying bed for digested slurry, more and larger exposure and sludge
storage ponds, water planting and fish raising, etc., but all came at a higher unit cost.
9.      Farmers’ interest in participating in the benchmark option was low even with a
full financial subsidy to cover all investment costs. This was due to the fact that the
benchmark option yielded a minimal financial return for the participating farmers -
primarily from savings by using less chemical fertilizers and more pig manure on their
land, and that no recovery of investments was projected under this option. In contrast, all
participating farmers accepted an average subsidy of about 60% of their total investment
cost and selected technological packages based on their specific farm conditions. These
10 AD technological packages have generated significant financial returns (see next
section on Financial Analysis) to the project farms. This will make partial and even full
recovery of the farm investment costs feasible.
10.     The waste water discharge from benchmark option could partially meet the
respective national standard of each participating country. However, all ten AD
technological packages yielded satisfactory results which also met national discharge
standards. The participating countries were convinced of and recognized that these
technological packages could serve as models for national long-term replication and
dissemination, as well as the basis for policy development and enforcement. They also
highly valued all other economic benefits, both quantifiable and non-quantifiable, derived
from project implementation of the ten AD technological packages.
11.   Based on the above, it is reasonable to conclude that the ten AD technological
packages introduced and demonstrated by the project were overall, highly efficient and


                                            30
cost effective. Note that the variations in nutrient removal efficiency among the ten AD
technological packages suggest that the selection and construction AD technological
packages need to be carefully done to minimize unit investment costs and unit nutrient
removal costs while maintaining efficiency for the delivery of optimal results in future
programs.
B.        Financial Analysis
12.     The project initially projected financing comprised of 25% of GEF grant, 25%
grant from the government, matched by a 50 % investment from each participating farm.
With additional support provided by the GMI in the form of power generators, gas flares
and training, the actual share of the total cost of technology demonstration activities was
21%, 34%, 40% and 5% respectively for the GEF grant, government, participating farms
and the GMI. The actual contributions made by the participating farms varied among the
countries ranging from 26% in Vietnam, 36% in China and 54% in Thailand. Overall, the
project provided in the order of a 60% financial subsidy to farms and contributed to
improving participating farms’ revenues. This helped mobilize the strong interest from all
participating farms’ in the project.

     (a) Despite the mostly public goods nature of the project, a financial analysis was
         conducted to evaluate the project’s financial attractiveness to participating farms
         and draw conclusions for future promotion. To assess the project’s financial
         performance, a financial cash flow analysis, with the following assumptions, was
         carried out for one typical participating farm in each country. Inputs and output
         prices. The analysis was based on market prices for all tradable goods and labor,
         using 2012 constant prices.
     (b) Calculation period. A 20-year period was used for cash flow analysis purposes
         based on commonly accepted depreciation period for the major AD facilities
         constructed.

    (c) Opportunity cost of capital (OCC). An 8 percent OCC was used to estimate the
        NPV, and as a benchmark in computing the financial internal rate of return
        (FIRR).
    (d) Financial benefits. The main financial benefits included biogas; biogas-generated
        electricity; sale of dried digested sludge and pig manure; saved labor costs;
        increased fish production (in Vietnam only) and revenue from transaction of
        certified carbon emission reduction for the first two years (in Thailand only).
    (e) Financial costs. The financial costs included both investment costs and operating
        costs.
    (f) Only incremental values were used in the analysis.
    The results of the financial analysis were shown in Table 3.3.

14.    The financial analysis indicated that the FIRR of the typical farms on full costing
was 8.7%, 14.7% and 8.2% respectively for China, Thailand and Vietnam, with an NPV
of US$2,578, US$186,185 and US$1,602 respectively for the three participating
countries. The much higher FIRR for Thailand was driven by CER revenues (3.5%) and
the sale of dried digested sludge (5.9%) under a well developed market for treated

manure. The marginal FIRR for China and Vietnam was acceptable to the participating
countries and the participating farmers, and indeed was beyond the initial expectations on
the part of key stakeholders’ with regard to an environment-focused project. These
financial analysis results justify the project financing arrangement. For all three countries’
typical farms, the cash revenues were adequate to cover all operating costs of the AD
technological packages and partially or even fully recover their investment costs. The
following should be noted:
   (a) With farmers’ own contributions in the range of 36%, 54% and 26% of the total
       investments respectively for China, Thailand and Vietnam, participating farmers
       were able to construct one of the project-introduced technological packages with
       the necessary technical support which resulted in them being able to meet
       government LWM requirements. In addition, the project helped achieve an FIRR
       of about 20% (China), 19% (Thailand) and 31% (Vietnam) on the participating
       farmers’ own investments based on analysis of undertaken at typical farms. These
       were the obvious incentives that attracted the strong interest of farmers in
       participating and secured their commitment to contribute.
   (b) This calculation did not include a number of other non-cash revenue and off-farm
       benefits such as supply of free biogas and free digested slurry to neighbors,
       improved crop quality and increased crop yield by other farmers using digested
       sludge or slurry, or savings from on-farm recycling of treated waste water,
       suggesting that the actual financial returns are likely to be even higher than those
       calculated.
15.     Overall, the project’s financial analysis concluded that the project is financially
attractive to all participating farms to sustain operations of their LWM facilities, and that
the significant subsidies provided helped mobilized farm participation to demonstrate
selected AD technological packages. Clearly, the initial capital cost may be a barrier to
such investments, even though the financial pro forma shown by the project is favorable.
In addition, local consultations held during project implementation with farmers to
determine their willingness to pay have indicated that once the technology is seen and
accepted as efficient, medium and large farms are willing to shoulder the majority of the
cost. However, almost all farmers interviewed were not willing to pay for more than 60%
of investment costs because pig production remains a high-risk business suffering from
frequent pig epidemic diseases and unpredictable market price changes of pig products.
Furthermore, it was indicated that farmers would be more willing to act and take on these
extra costs if: (a) regulations and their enforcement were strengthened; (b) increased
market demand for treated manure products was in evidence; and, (c) public pressure
demanding improved farm environmental performance increased.
16.    As shown in the Thailand case, an additional benefit is the carbon emission
reduction credits that may be generated from project financed facilities. Such a steady
stream of additional CDM revenue will further improve financial incentives of the farms
to manage their wastes properly even though the CDM process so far has been slow and
complicated for the two associated Thai CDM projects.

Summary of China ICR
1.      Governments at all levels (national, provincial, county) demonstrated their
continued commitments. Collaboration among government agencies has been working
effectively and government line agencies played their respective and active roles in the
project. Involved government line agencies included the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environmental Protection at the national level;
the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
Environmental Protection and the Department of Health in Guangdong Province; the
Bureaus of Agriculture in Boluo and Heyuan counties. The Guangong PMO was
established and located in the Guangdong General Station of Agricultural Environment
Protection and Rural Energy Resources under the Guangdong Department of Agriculture.
All participating farms showed their strong interests in the project.
     (a) The project has played an exemplary role in demonstration and dissemination of
         sound livestock waste management practices in Guangdong. The project
         supported 23 participating farms with a total standing pig population (SPP) of
         262,000 in four types of AD technological packages for livestock waste
         management – large scale up-flow fixed domes, red-mud plastic cover baffled
         reactor, underground series domes, and factory-fabricated and field-assembled
         steel reactor units. All were recognized as the best practices in efficiency,
         effectiveness and sustainability in livestock waste management technologies in
         Guangdong. During construction and operation of these technological packages,
         about 1,600 visitors from Guangdong and other provinces of China as well as
         international visitors from 13 countries visited the demonstration farms. As
         immediate results of the project, (i) the project area was extended to Heyuan
         County of the province; and (ii) as of December 31, 2010, about 75% of the total
         number of pig farms in Boluo County had followed the project practices, an
         increase of about 78% against the pre-project situation in 2006.
     (b) Project has promoted the development of a harmonious society in rural areas
         through various social undertakings such as (i) four participating farms offer
         alternative supply of bio-gas energy as cooking fuel to a total of 529 households
         which increased to 5,187 households by end of 2010 in Boluo county; (ii)
         Luoxing farm provide free biogas to the Yihe Primary and Middle Schools of
         about 1,200 students and teachers to support poor drop-out students to come back
         to school and improve teaching facilities with the saved energy costs; (iii)
         Mashigang farm and Yihu farm provided treated sludge free of charge to a
         vegetable farm and a greenhouse farm respectively, and the practice was followed
         by many other participating farms.

         Vietnam PMO as well as the supported farmers.
     (d) Suggestion. China proposes that the World Bank continues to focus on the world-
         wide development and environmental issues, especially in livestock waste
         management in China, to continue providing technology, experience,
         management mechanism and funds to help developing countries; to help relevant
         countries and regions in the way of projects or other cooperation, communication,
         professional and management training for their progress and development;
         continue promoting the technology and experience exchange, enhancing
         communication and concerning about the effects of replication in the countries or
         different parts. We recommend that the World Bank continue to assist the
         developing countries to promote the above task.


Summary of Thailand ICR
2.     Eleven government line agencies from four ministries – the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MONRE), the Ministry of Public Health – and governments at relevant
provincial and Tambon levels were involved in project preparation and implementation.
The national PMO was established and located in the Department of Livestock
Development of the Thailand Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.
     (a) The project supported 20 participating farms with a total SPP of 286,000 in three
         types of AD technological packages for livestock waste management – channel
         digester plus, channel digester and modified covered lagoon. These packages are
         proven technologies with robust design and no negative impact on environment.
         Close cooperation with PCD, DEDE, ERDI and consultant team ensured technical
         support and services to participating farms.
     (b) The PMO has organized 10 workshops with a total of 500 participants, various
         training, public awareness-raising campaigns, and distributed environmental



                                                 39
   campaign poster for pig farms through PLOs, pamphlet of DLD biogas system for
   small pig farms and delivered various training for about 6,600 trainees.
(c) There were encouraging practices found during project implementation (i) despite
    significant delay in physical construction of demonstration facilities, Thailand
    successfully integrated two CDM Livestock Waste Management Programs into
    the project; (ii) Sa-ard farm has been sharing its biogas with the nearby Ban Huay
    Yang Elementary School of about 150 students for lunch preparation since 2009,
    and (iii) with the soft loan kindly provided by other participating farms, one farm
    was able to overcome its financial liquidity problem and continue its participation
    in project.
(d) Challenges. The project has been implemented with some main challenges which
    shaded unfavorable impact on project implementation: (i) frequent change of
    DLD management (5 deputy director generals and 4 directors of Bureau of
    Livestock Standard and Certification in 6 years); (ii) slow government internal
    process for funding by the Cabinet and within DLD; (iii) frequent typhoons,
    floods and social unrest in 2008 and 2009; and (iv) DLD’s lack of experiences in
    implementing a co-financed project that required a process for the Cabinet
    resolution.
(e) Feedback from participating farmers. Their feedbacks focused on (i) positive
    experience which included that they were happy with their new technology and
    receive full support from consultant teams; they improved relationship with their
    neighbors in general with improved environment and with cropland farmers in
    particular who utilized treated wastewater as fertilizer; they achieved improved
    financial returns by saving on-farm power expense from using biogas generated
    electricity and sale of the dried digested sludge; the GEF grant, government
    subsidy and other financial support built their confidence and greatly reduced
    their financial pressure for investment; (ii) suggestions for improvement which
    included that project be implemented faster without delay and investment cost be
    lower;
(f) Feedback from government agencies. Their feedbacks in general were mostly
    positive. The national PMO had close collaboration with the MONRE, the
    Ministry of Public Health and local government offices. They provided very
    useful information, shared their experience and rendered their services for project
    implementation. Provincial, district and TAO officials in project area have been
    very positive and supportive to the project. They assisted the PMO in
    communication with farmers and making meeting arrangements. The suggestion
    is that more workshops and trainings should be organized for government
    agencies to get them more familiar with COPs developed under the project and
    more efficient and effective in applying such COPs.
(g) Feedback from the consultant teams. Several consultant teams were hired to
    provide services on project site survey, technical design, construction of livestock
    waste management facilities, and O&M. They shared their feedbacks in the
    following areas: (i) the PMO and consultant teams shared good experiences; (ii)
    with clear working scope, consultant teams could plan and work within an agreed


                                        40
        time frame; (iii) the PMO had an efficient management for project
        implementation; (iv) the electricity generator, instrumentation or biogas flare
        should be separated from the construction bidding package; and (v) a minimum of
        one year service contract for system operation and maintenance should be signed
        to ensure sustainability.
     (h) Procurement Aspects. (i) Training was well provided to PMO; (ii) good
         explanations were given for any queries; (iii) the World Bank Procurement has
         too many processes and takes long time; and (iv) procurement was not so flexible.
     (i) Concerning three types of AD technological packages for livestock waste
         management – channel digester plus, channel digester and modified covered
         lagoon – actually the project should have demonstrated more various types of AD
         treatment systems because Thailand has various different areas that must be
         considered together with the cost of system. Finally farmers will select
         appropriate types for them. It will be better if we have many types of solutions for
         them. However Thai PMO had very limited opportunities to choose any AD
         systems other than Channel Digester and Channel Digester Plus because they are
         proven technologies according to the CDM program condition and every farm
         participating in the project needed to bundle together under the same technology
         to meet the GHG mitigation target.
     (j) Concerning Recycling, PMO focused more on treatment system than recycling.
         So Integration of crop and livestock sector was not done efficiently and
         systematically. The model of Area Wide Integrated farming project (crop and
         livestock) was not demonstrated and evaluating the result of the project.
     (k) COP is well developed with complicated options, it needed to be tested by TAO
         in different area. So COP must be distributed for TAO testing.
     (l) Suggestion: (i) M&E for Channel Digester Plus and Modified Covered Lagoon
         should continue after project completion; (ii) M&E for CDM projects should
         continue after project completion; (iii) various models of Area Wide Integrated
         farming project (zero waste) should be developed and promoted to crop and
         livestock farmers for sustainable environment; (iv) COP test in the area of TAO
         before COP announcement; (v) extension of spatial planning to TAO application;
         and (vi) international study tour among participating countries should be
         promoted for exchanging experience on waste management.


Summary of Vietnam ICR
3.      The State Bank of Vietnam and five ministries – the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
(MARD), the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and
Investment – and governments at relevant provincial and district levels were involved in
project preparation and implementation. The national PMO was established and located
in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.
     (a) The project supported 14 demonstration systems with a total SPP of 105,000 in
         three types of AD technological packages for livestock waste management –


                                             41
   covered lagoon, large scale up-flow fixed domes (Chinese technology) and
   household based small sized fixed underground dome. These proven technologies
   fit the country’s situation very well. This was achieved with unremitting efforts of
   everyone involved and with the excellent technical support and backups of two
   leading Chinese biogas specialists who paid two visits to Vietnam during 2009
   and 2010. The Manual on Operation and Maintenance of Livestock Waste
   Treatment System was developed and disseminated to many provinces in Vietnam.
(b) The PMO had been working under the direction of the National Steering
    Committee and also worked very closely with line government agencies at
    national, provincial, district levels, participating farms and consultant teams
    during project preparation and implementation. The PMO has also worked in
    close collaboration with FAO team in developing three major decision support
    tools. The PMO organized workshops to share information and exchange
    experience in demonstration of livestock waste management technology systems
    with different technologies in relevant biogas project conducted by MARD such as
    the Biogas Program for the Animal Husbandry Sector in Vietnam funded by the
    Netherlands Development Organization. During the implementation, the PMO, NSC
    members and representatives of farm owners attended the International Conference
    on Water Pollution Reduction and Climate Change Mitigation, RCG Meetings and
    the final workshop on project to share information and exchange experience in
    project results, outcomes with colleagues from China and Thailand.
(c) During project implementation, 92 training courses and workshops were held at
    national, provincial, district to commune levels for a total of about 9,000
    participants; 19 national study tours and 2 international study tours were
    organized to (i) introduce and disseminate the project outcomes and livestock waste
    management technology; and (ii) contribute to effective project management and
    implementation.
(d) There are encouraging practices found during project implementation: (i) Dong
    Nai province is the first province in Vietnam to develop a master plan for
    livestock development and livestock waste management for the next 5 to 10 years;
    (ii) The Co Dong Livestock Cooperative and Thanh Hung Farm in Hanoi and Mrs.
    An farm in Dong Nai played an active and leading role in the project and their
    dedication and commitment greatly contributed to the successful project
    implementation; (iii) many neighboring villages and pig farmers visited the
    livestock waste management facilities of the participating farms and expressed
    their favorable impressions and strong interests in participation in the project.
(e) A communal village scale system was constructed in 2008 in Tu Duong village of
    Ha Tay province. Though no evidence of technical design failure was identified
    and the system had resulted in positive environmental and human health benefits,
    the communal system however was experiencing significant operational
    difficulties attributable basically to a fifty year storm event in November 2008
    which caused extensive flooding in the area and had washed out all anaerobic
    reactors; and reduced SPP (from agreed 1,000 to only 300) due to epidemic pig
    diseases and declining pig prices in market. Despite various efforts made,



                                        42
        restarting operation of the non-functioning communal system has not been
        successful.
     (f) At project preparation, pig farms were typically small, involving confined
         household-based production that was concentrated in particular villages. This
         structure led to project design for livestock waste management technology
         demonstration activities on a communal (village) rather than individual farm basis.
         However, this situation changed dramatically during the project implementation.
         Though small scale pig farms were still typical, medium and large sized pig farms
         were growing rapidly representing the obvious trend of pig production in Vietnam.
         To reflect this trend, medium and large farms were included in the project and
         became the dominant beneficiaries of the project. This had a far-reaching
         significance to guide the entire pig industry in its future development in terms of
         livestock waste management.
     (g) Challenges. The project has been implemented with several major challenges
         which slowed down overall project implementation: (i) epidemic disease out-
         breaks and severe floods; (ii) change of project implementing entity within
         MONRE and change of national project coordinator; (iii) overwhelmingly long
         time taken for going through government internal process for approval of budget
         adjustment due to project adjustment; and (iv) dealing with the World Bank’s INT
         investigation on three contracts in 2009 (see paragraph 2.4 for more details).
     (h) Comments. The Bank financing mechanism was very complicated and required
         long procedural process. It often caused a long delay in project implementation. In
         the first three years, the WB approval sometimes took too much time, maybe
         there haven’t achieved the consensus on activities of the plans between the WB
         and PMO; and planning capacity of PMO was limited. Nevertheless, the late
         approval of the procurement plans had affected the project implementation
         progress.
     (i) Requests. Due to real demands, the follow-up project should be designed. At
         many workshops held in provinces, especially the final workshop held on June
         24-25th, 2011 in Son Tay, Hanoi, many mid- and large scale size farm owners
         proposed PMO to find the opportunity for second phase of the Project so that
         some more farms could be participated and benefited by livestock waste
         management technology.


Summary of FAO ICR
4.     FAO is one of the Grant recipients responsible for implementation of the Regional
Support Services component through the RFO physically located in its regional office in
Bangkok of Thailand and with members from both its headquarters in Rome and its
regional office. This was based on FAO’s previous experience in providing services for
both technical support and project coordination and facilitation. All three participating
countries were strongly committed to the Regional Support Services Component, as
demonstrated by their active attendance and consistent contributions to all RCG meetings.




                                             43
(a) Capacity Building Support. Three DSTs were developed together with the
    participating countries i.e. CoSiMo, Spatial Planning, and Environmental
    Monitoring Guidelines. The CoSiMo was developed to provide guidelines and
    approaches to support the design of policy framework to reduce land and water
    pollution from livestock production while acknowledging other objectives such as
    poverty reduction, public health improvement, economic growth and animal
    disease control; which is a process rather than a standalone tool and was
    developed to satisfy individual country needs. The Spatial Planning was a GIS
    and multiple criteria evaluation based tool to achieve spatial distribution of
    livestock production better aligned with environmental and health objectives at
    national and local levels which served Thailand only because the other two
    countries did not request the service. The Environmental Monitoring Guidelines
    were developed to provide guidance to participating countries on water, odor
    sampling and their analysis. The fourth DST i.e. the STRAW, not yet completed
    by project closing, was an ambitious programme developed to identify and select
    manure management options for confined pig production in rapidly growing
    economies and is still under finalization by FAO financing and a draft version of
    the STRAW is available. Four training modules were developed and various
    training on using DSTs for farmers, extension agents, policy makers, project
    implementing agencies and professionals were organized i.e. five training courses
    for CoSiMo and four development sessions for STRAW were organized, and the
    Environmental Monitoring Guidelines were presented in each country. Continued
    support to Thailand PMO during the last year of project implementation via a
    Thai consultant for Spatial Planning was provided. A regional pool of experts has
    been formed. An impressive project website (www.lwmeap.org) was developed in
    2007 to provide information available for sharing including semi-annual progress
    reports, approved annual work programs, good models, impressive photos,
    summary of important meetings, etc. However, the Grant Letter of Agreement
    stipulates a total of six DSTs to be developed and six training modules to be
    delivered. The decision to consolidate 2 of the tools identified during project
    preparation (i.e., Nutrient flux models, Technical validation of on-farm manure
    management technologies) into one (i.e. STRAW) was taken in agreement with
    the three participating countries.
(b) Coordination and Facilitation Support. The regional coordination and facilitation
    support was carried out by the RFO. Specific activities included facilitating the
    six RCG meetings serving as secretariat; communicating with all relevant regional
    programs; evaluating partnership potential; making recommendations for follow-
    up to the RCG. Activities for regional dissemination included organization for
    ICR workshop; continued liaison with the national PMOs. RFO’s service focused
    primarily on the three participating countries, but eventually also on other
    countries draining into the South China Sea for replication through (i) study tours,
    (ii) internet portal, and (iii) publications. As a result of the September 2009
    International Conference on Livestock Waste Management and Climate Change
    Mitigation in Guangzhou, several countries expressed their interests in learning
    more about the two DSTs.



                                        44
(c) In addition, the RFO also tried hard to provide technical and monitoring supports
    to the participating countries as agreed during the second RCG meeting in April
    2007. However, this service was discontinued in 2009 due to limited demand
    expressed by participating countries.
