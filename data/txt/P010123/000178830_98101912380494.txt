GLOSSARY
Broken Orange Pekoe (BOP), BOP Fannings (BOPF), and DUST I
are among top tea grades. They are listed in descending order
of particle size. Ability to vary grade proportions permits
responsiveness to changing market conditions.
Clonal or vegetatively propagated tea gardens outyield seedling
tea because the bushes are identical and selected from superior
mother bushes; seedling tea is heterogeneous and contains poor
yielding bushes.

TREE CROP REHABILITATION (TEA) PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
The Agricultural Sector
The Role of Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      Agriculture plays a major role in Sri Lanka's economy, accounting
for 37% of GDP, 55% of total employment, about 80% of export earnings and
a large share of public revenue. Approximately 80% of the country's total
population lives in rural areas. Thus economic growth in the country depends
largely upon performance in the agricultural sector. During the 1960's, con-
siderable progress was made in increasing food production as GOSL pursued a
firm policy of increasing food self sufficiency. Paddy production expanded
from 840,000 tons to 1.6 M tons (6.5%/year), as a result of area expansion
(175,000 ha), increasing yields - from 725 kg/ha to 1,050 kg/ha - and in-
creased cropping intensity. After 1970 area expansion continued at a similar
rate but yields and cropping intensity declined so that production grew at
only 0.7%/year. Major reasons for the fall-off in productivity were farm
power shortages - reflecting foreign exchange constraints - and high fertilizer
prices. However by 1977 Sri Lanka was 68% self-sufficient in rice compared
with 50% in 1960.
1.02      While GOSL's basic policy of promoting food production was sound
it was unfortunately combined with systematic neglect of the tree crop sector,
which in the early 1960's accounted for over 90% of the value of merchandise
exports. During the 1960's production grew at only 1% per annum, and that
mainly from rubber which was benefiting from substantial replanting in the
early 1950's. Since 1970 conditions in the tree crop sector have further
deteriorated, with output of tea, rubber and coconuts all tending downward.
Declining quality has also been evident, especially in the tea industry. The
disappointing production trends in the tree crop sector were primarily a
reflection of declining profitability, associated with lower prices and high
taxes, the uncertainties associated with GOSL land reforms and inadequate
foreign exchange allocations for vital inputs such as fertilizer and spares
and replacements for machinery and vehicles.
1.03      The importance of the traditional export crops (tea, rubber and
coconut) lies not only in the fact that, in the foreseeable future, they will
continue to be the main source of foreign exchange earnings, but also in their
vital importance for all aspects of the economy. These three crops account
for 70 to 80% of export earnings, about 45% of agricultural employment, 40% of
the value added in the agricultural sector, and in addition, are expected to
contribute about 50% of government revenues according to the 1978 budget.
Tea alone accounts for approximately half of the value of the country's total
merchandise exports.



-2-
Land Reform
1.04      The first phase of land reform, initiated in 1972, limited private
holdings to: (i) 25 acres if exclusively paddy land or (ii) 50 acres if not
exclusively paddy land, with paddy land not to exceed 25 acres. In the first
phase takeovers, implemented in 1973 through 1975, about 225,000 ha of land
were vested in rhe Land Reform Commission (LRC). Of this about 60% was under
tree crops which included about 23% of the total tea area, 15% of the rubber
area, and about 10% of the coconut area. The State Plantations Corporation
(SPDC), under the Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI) was given about 40 of
the larger well--maintained tea and rubber estates, covering about 10% of the
tree crop land taken over. The management of most of the remainder was placed
in the hands of cooperatives.
1X05       In the second phase, initiated in October 1975, all land owned by
Sri Lankan and foreign companies, which included the country's major tea and
rubber estates, was vested in the LRC. About 65,000 ha were assigned to SPC
and nearly 95,000 ha to the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) which
was established for the purpose under the Ministry of Agriculture. The com-
pensation tenrms for foreign-owned plantations were agreed in 1976 and payments
have commenced. Comipensation negotiations for rupee company a-nd private
estates are still in progress.
1.06      Of Sri Lanka's 240,000 ha total tea area, nearly 135,000 ha (56%)
are: vested in the LRC. In late 1977 the management of much of this land was
significantly rationalized. JEDB was transferred to MPI and the Upcountry
Estate Development Board and Electorate Level Cooperatives, which had mis-
managed the estates they controlled, were disbanded and their estates divided
between JEDB and SPC. Now, over 70% of the tea estate land vested in the LRC
is managed by governTrent corporations with most of the remainder still managed
by various cooperative groups. In addition, tea smallholders own 48,000 ha
(average holding 0.39 ha) and 42,000 ha are owned by individuals with an
average holding of 15 ha.
The Tea Industry
1.07      Tea production in Sri Lanka rose from 100 M kg in 1933 to an average
level of 223 M kg over the four years 1965 to 1968. Since 1969, production
has never exceeded 218 M kg and in the last three years (1974-76) has averaged
205 M kg. This deterioration in output is partly attributable to drought,
but mostly to a policy induced neglect of the sector, which has resulted in
inadequate replanting, fertilization and weeding, and other pocr management
practices. Fertilizer use, for example, declined steadily from 43,000 tons
of nutrients in [965 to 24,000 tons in 1973, and then recovered slightly to
30,000 tons in 1975. This low usage was due to pre-nationalization uncertain-
ties, rising fertilizer costs, low returns, the transfer of fertilizers from
tea to other crops, and persistent drought. Fertilizer availability to the
tree crop sector may improve in the post- nationalization phase, but neglect
of replanting, particularly in the mid 1970s, will continue to affect produc-
tion adversely over the next decade.  Thus, for example, even on an optimistic
calculation, 70% of the tea bushes in Sri Lanka in 1985 will be over 50 years
old, and as much as 50% will be over 70 years old.



- 3 -
1.08      Nearly 90% of the country's tea lands are planted to seedling tea.
The rate of replanting with higher yielding clonal tea has fallen from a
peak of 2,770 ha in 1970 to 890 ha in 1976 in spite of subsidies, because of
land reform uncertainties and temporarily higher prices which discouraged
uprooting of old tea. Government's replanting goal, of 3,000 hectares per
year, is unlikely to be realized before the early 1980s and tea output in
1990 is expected to be in the region of 227.0 M kg, still below the 1965
peak of 228.2 M kg.
1.09.     Institutions.  The Sri Lanka Tea Board was created in 1975 with
wide powers including: sales promotion; advising government on tea policy;
administering tea subsidies; collecting and collating industry statistics;
and, through its agency the Tea Research Institute, carrying out tea research.
The Chairman is appointed by the Minister of Plantation Industries, the
Secretary of the Ministry is an ex officio Board member. A Tea Smallholdings
Development Authority was established in 1976, responsible for overseeing tea
growers who do not have their own manufacturing facilities. Its major func-
tions are to provide extension advice and to ensure that smallholders receive
fair treatment from greenleaf buyers. However it is poorly staffed and has
barely started work.
1.10      SPC and JEDB between them manage 105,000 ha of tea estates (SPC
45,000 ha and JEDB 60,000 ha). Their chairmen are appointed by, and respon-
sible to, the Minister of Plantation Industries. Policy making, marketing,
financial control and input supply functions are centralized in Colombo,
while responsibility for day-to-day management is decentralized to regional
offices. Largely because of recent high tea prices, it is projected that the
1977 trading profit for SPC will be about Rs 77 M (US$5.0 M) and for JEDB,
Rs 106 M (US$7.0 M).
1.11      Marketing.  Over 90% of Sri Lanka's tea production is sold at the
Colombo auctions (the world's largest), most of the rest at the London auc-
tions.  All the major buyers are represented in Colombo and the marketing
system operates well. The only problem of any significance has been the delay
sometimes experienced in transporting tea from the estates to Colombo; delays
occur because transport contractors cannot provide satisfactory service,
being unable to obtain spares and replacement vehicles.
1.12      Most SPC and JEDB managerial staff were previously employed by es-
tate owners or agency houses. After land reform takeovers some were employed
on terms poorer than they had pre-reform, others, the majority, were employed
on their pre-reform terms but only on a temporary basis. This resulted in
poor staff morale. GOSL has recently introduced new staff terms but staff
reaction to them is not known.
1.13      Labor Supply.  Tamil workers continue to be the majority of the labor
force on the estates, especially in higher areas. With the continuing program
of Tamil repatriation to India, and the difficulty of attracting Singhalese
into the industry, some estates in high areas now have labor shortages during
peak periods. Major disincentives to potential new workers are the generally
low health and welfare standards on the estates, particularly the overcrowded
and primitive housing. GOSL, however, intends to address the basic needs of
the estate workers.



- 4 -
1.14      Taxes and Subsidies.  For many years the tea industry has been sub-
ject to excessive taxation and thus inadequate incentives. In its November
1977 budget GOSL changed the tax structure to take account of a substantial
devaluation of the-rupee. However tea prices are declining and the new tax
rates, if not adjusted, will soon be excessive once more.
1.15      The tea industry benefits from the universal 75% subsidy on ferti-
lizer. Replanting costs - about R 48,000/ha - are partially offset by a GOSL
payment of R 14,800/ha. This is not strictly a subsidy (though commonly re-
ferred to as such) because the funds come from an industry cess. The replant-
ing "subsidy" is paid in installments upon completion of successive replanting
operations spread over 5 to 7 years. It has not been sufficient to induce an
adequate replanting rate in the past nor, unless amended, is it likely to be
in future for the considerable amount of privately owned tea, particularly
that owned by smallholders. The impact of the subsidy on a smallholder's cash
flow is shown at Annex 4, Table 7. Factory rehabilitation is also subsidized -
one-third of capital cost and half of interest charges - and so are tea chests
and diversification out of tea.
1.16      The system of taxation and subsidization is costly to administer and
its overall impact is unknown. A "Tree Crop Incentive Study", a component of
the Agricultural Development Project (Credit 595-CE), is presently being under-
taken to provide GOSL with a policy framework, indicating clear alternatives,
such as the trade-off between using the sector as a major source of taxation
while at the same time attempting to enhance exports and employment.
1.17      Policy Development.  In May 1976 IDA unsuccessfully appraised a GOSL
project the main components of which were tea diversification and rehabilita-
tion. A major problem was lack of a policy framework for tea industry develop-
ment, particularly important following almost a decade of declining production
and the major upheavals of land reform. At IDA's suggestion GOSL agreed to
prepare a Master Plan for tea industry development.  Preparation began in
January 1978, with assistance from the Canadian International Development
Association (CIDA), and is expected to be completed in early 1979. The Master
Plan will recommend on industry structure, fiscal policy and investment pro-
grams and priorities.
Financing of Tea Development in Sri Lanka
1.18      Under existing Bank Group policy, as stated in Mr. McNamara's memo-
randum to the ]Executive Directors of August 17, 1973, (Document No. R73-206),
no financing of projects involving tea production is to be undertaken, except:
(i) "financing for increases in output in countries with no investment alter-
natives yielding an acceptable rate of return; and (ii) financing for rehabi-
litation involving no increase in output (this implies reduction in acreage
and encouragemient to diversification)."
1.19      It would be difficult to establish that alternative projects "offer-
ing an adequate rate of return" do not exist or cannot be developed in Sri
Lanka. The proposed project, however, qualifies under the second exception
(paragraph 12 of the policy paper):



-5-
"Financing for replanting or rehabilitation projects could
be considered if the project does not lead to increased
production in the near or medium term. Such projects
would lead to increases in yield, and these would have
to be offset by shifting the acreage saved to other purposes.
Tea bushes last with slowing declining yield, for 75 years
and more. Since the alternative to replanting or rehabili-
tation is usually to allow old bushes to continue their
slow decline, the principal result of such projects is the
long run extension of the period of production. The dis-
counted present value of their effects upon world tea
prices is, therefore, likely to be very small. The purpose
of such a policy would be to give encouragement to diver-
sification. The Bank is prepared to provide financing for
this purpose." (emphasis added).
1.20      Sri Lanka is the only major tea-producing country suffering a long-
term structural decline in its tea production; its share of world production
declined from an average of 18.6% in the late 1960s to about 12.2% in 1976.
The primary purpose of the proposed project would be to support a replanting
program designed to prevent further decline in Sri Lanka's production rather
than to increase output over its historic peak levels. Tea production in
1995 in Sri Lanka, including the proposed project, is estimated to be about
227 M Kg, still below the peak reached in 1965; at this level Sri Lanka's
share of world production would have declined to about 8.6%. This estimate
does not take into account any diversification of tea lands, yet GOSL has an
ongoing diversification program and is expected to assign to the Agricultural
Diversification Division in the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands the tasks
of: (i) preparing an inventory of lands suitable for diversification; (ii)
assigning development priorities to the inventory; and (iii) preparing future
diversification projects. GOSL has also requested IDA support to finance an
initial project in the Kandy area which will diversify 4,850 ha of marginal
tea to spices and food crops, dairying, and forestry. This project was ap-
praised concurrently with the project now proposed, and is expected to be
presented to the Board in FY78 or early FY79. It is expected that together
these two projects would be a first step in the critically important task of
revitalizing the Sri Lankan tea industry.
II. PROJECT AREA
A. General
2.01      GOSL is preparing a Master Plan for development of the tea industry
which will be complete by early 1979. In order not to delay an obvious
priority, tea estate rehabilitation, GOSL decided to go ahead with the pro-
posed project, selecting a high potential area to avoid preempting Plan policy
options. The economy of the project area is almost entirely dependent on tea
to which there is no economically attractive alternative. Area teas command



-6-
among the highest prices in the world. The average area yield (1,150 kg/ha),
though not high is well above the Sri Lankan average (850 kg/ha) and the yield
potential, as clemonstrated by existing clonal blocks, is excellent for high
altitude areas producing quality teas. The estimated project yield for clonal
tea of 1,900 kg/ha compares well with the Kenya estate tea average of 1,600
kg/ha.
2.02      The project area is located about 80 km east of Colombo, in the plant-
ing districts of Maskeliya and Upper and Lower Dickoya in the Northwestern
portion of the administrative district of Nuwara Eliya. The area includes
about 18,000 ha of tea, managed by the State Plantations Corporation (SPC)
(.0,000 ha in 30 estates) Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) (7,600 ha
in 29 estates), and by small scale producers (300 ha owned by 183 individuals).
2.03      Climate.  The area has a mean annual temperature of 21 C, and a
mean annual rainfall of 5,403 mm. Temperature is almost constant throughout
the year.  Rainfall varies from a low monthly mean of about 100 mm in January,
to a high of 900 mm in June, and is fairly predictable.
2.04      Soils and Topography.  The area ranges in altitude between 1,000 m
and 1,800 m with the greater part in the range 1,200 m to 1,500 m.  Topography
is broken and steep. Soils are mostly red-yellow podsols and wet mountain
regosols, which are markedly acid, with pH around 5.  Neither soils nor
tcipography are well suited to land uses other than tea, forestry or pas-
ture. The areav embraces large portions of the watersheds of the Castlereigh
and Maskeliya Reservoirs which are the impoundments for hydro-electricity
generation supplying about 90% of the island's power. Declining standards
of estate management over the past several years have led to increased soil
erosion which could curtail the useful capacity of the two reservoirs.
2.05      Socio-economic Conditions.  The economy of the project area is al-
most entirely dependent on tea. Hatton and Maskeliya are the only substantial
urban areas, and they exist to serve the tea industry. There are few of the
traditional village settlements which characterize the mid and low country
tea areas, and the majority of the area's population, mostly Tamil, 1/ lives
on tea estates. This population is declining, because of GOSL's Tamil repa-
triation program, causing labor shortages at times of peak demand. To prevent
labor shortages becoming a critical constraint, non-traditional labor will
have to be attracted onto the tea estates.
2.06      lypical accommodation for an estate laborer's family consists of a
tiny (20 m ), two room row house. Families share toilet facilities and water
supplies. Housing areas are usually congested because estate developers de-
sired to minimize housing costs and to maximize tea area. Most housing is in
poor repair. Poor housing is a major factor in the sub-standard health of
estate labor (para 2.07) and is a major impediment to attracting Singhalese
labor into the tea industry to replace the traditional Tamil labor.
1/   Mainly non-citizen Tamils of Indian origin.



- 7 -
2.07      Education of estate labor, until recently an estate responsibility,
has now been assumed by the Ministry of Education. The quality of estate
schools is below the national average, a fact accepted by GOSL. Remedial
action is proposed as an integral part of the policy of bringing the social
welfare of the estate population into line with the rest of the country.
Medical facilities are below national standards, though there are base hos-
pitals in Hatton and Maskeliya, district hospitals in Bogawantalawa, Dickoya,
Maskeliya and Wattawala (all in, or immediately adjacent to, the project area),
and all estates have dispensaries, some equipped for minor surgery. Infant
mortality in the project area has been increasing in recent years and is now
twice the national average. Overall mortality is about 50% above the national
average.
2.08      Communications are good.  Hatton is served by rail and there is a
good network of public all-weather roads through the area. This is supple-
mented by a considerable network of gravelled estate roads providing good
access to most areas.
B. Tea Production
Field
2.09      Average yield in the area is about 1,150 kg/ha, well above the
national average of about 850 kg/ha but about the same as the average for
all JEDB and SPC managed estates. Yields vary greatly, from 500 kg/ha for
seedling tea to over 3,000 kg/ha for clonal tea. SPC managed estates in the
project area yield on average about 80 kg/ha more than JEDB estates. SPC
generally took over estates which were better managed pre-land reform; this
is reflected in the levels of replanting:
Project tea area in hectares
Total   Seedling   Mature VP        Immature VP   Grass /a
SPC        10,077    7,939    1,339 (13.3%)   438 (4.3%)         361
JEDB        7,590    6,366        810 (10.7%)   253 (3.3%)       161
Private        302      249        24 ( 7.9%)    12 (4.0%)        17
TOTALS      17,969   14,554    2,173 (12.0%)   703 (3.9%)        539
/a   For rehabilitation prior to replanting.
Nationally about 13% of the tea area had been replanted with clonal material
by 1976, thus the project area is slightly better than average in this regard.
Replanting is economically justified when yields are below 560 kg/ha, assuming
Bank forecast prices.   Fields yielding above this level should be in-filled to
maintain plant population (bush deaths are continuous from pests, diseases,
and failure to withstand stresses, such as from pruning). However, in-filling
has not been widely practiced for many years and vacancies are now common.



2.10      Fertilizer application is generally based on comprehensive Tea
Research Institute (TRI) recommendations which cover the ranges of plant
maturity, yield levels and fertilizer materials. These recommendations have
remained essentially the same for many years, despite the fact that fertilizer
and tea prices have changed dramatically; an illustration of the need for
an economic focus to TRI's research (para 5.19).
2.11      Weeding is mainly by hand and is very expensive, costing about
Rs 2,000/ha/year. The weed problem is aggravated by the low plant densities
of old seedling tea and the low pruning level adopted which lead to poor
ground cover for the first two years of each four year pruning cycle. Major
reliance on hand weeding coupled with poor ground cover and absence of mulch
(para 2.12) accentuates the serious soil erosion problem (para 2.13). A
change to major reliance on chemical weed control would: reduce costs;
minimize tea root damage; and reduce soil erosion.
2.12      Removal of Prunings.  Reflecting a national problem the project
area lacks fuelwood. As a result most tea factory driers are fueled with
imported oil. More serious, however, is the fact that the laborers remove
all prunings for firewood. This is the start of a chain of events which must
significantly reduce production and productivity. The removal of prunings
prevents the build up of surface mulch which would: suppress weeds; encourage
the development of surface feeder roots which would improve the efficiency
of fertilizer utilization; and prevent pan formation by pluckers, thus obviat-
ing the need for the deep forking now practised which is expensive and damages
tea roots.
2.13      Erosion.  The soils of the project area are inherently quite stable,
though the steeply broken terrain creates an erosion hazard. This has long
been recognized and land being developed for planting was almost always well
protected with soil conservation structures. Latterly, in common with gen-
erally reduced management standards, maintenance of soil conservation works
has been neglected and erosion has increased.  In areas being replanted soil
zonservation structures are rebuilt to a good standard.
2.14      Plucking standards are generally adequate.  Plucking efficiency
however, is poor. Because of a great shortage of green leaf transport,
pluckers spend unnecessary time carrying leaf over long distances. Lack
of green leaf transport also adversely affects made tea quality. Leaf is
handled excessively and packed too tightly, both resulting in bruising and
premature fermentation. The damage is worsened because too much time elapses
between plucking and manufacture.
Manufacture
:2.15     All 59 factories in the project area manufacture by the orthodox
process, producing quality teas which command high prices in world markets.
tiost of the factory buildings are between 30 and 45 years old and are struc-
turally sound., Withering takes place on tats - multiple tiered wire racks -
on which green leaf is thinly spread. In modern factories tats have been
replaced by withering troughs, which are more efficient and occupy far less



- 9 -
space, but only a few have been installed in project area factories. Through-
put could be greatly increased if troughs were installed universally; and this
potential for increasing capacities would permit substantial factory ration-
alization.
2.16      Processing machinery varies tremendously in age and condition and
much of it needs replacement to safeguard or restore quality and to increase
efficiency. New rollers and driers are the major requirement. Material
handling, from green leaf to made tea, is generally inefficient and labor
consuming; particularly important because labor is becoming scarce.
2.17      Power supplies are satisfactory except that additional standby gen-
erating capacity is required to provide minimal back-up during power failures.
In several factories machines are indirectly, and inefficiently, belt driven
from steel line shafting. Almost all factories are inadequately lit. This
not only provides an unpleasant working environment but makes it impossible
to keep factories clean - an important factor in maintaining quality.
Vehicles
2.18      For many years hardly any foreign exchange was available to purchase
replacement vehicles - a national problem. The IDA financed Agricultural
Development Credit (595 CE) has provided some relief and the new Government
has recently liberalized imports. Nevertheless, the majority of personnel
transport, trucks and tractors in the project area are beyond their economic-
ally useful life. They are old, unreliable and expensive to maintain.
1II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Brief Description
3.01      Principal project objectives would be to increase the quantity,
quality and efficiency of tea production in a selected high potential area
with no economic alternatives. The project would improve living conditions
for about 150,000 members of estate labor families. It would be a first step
in implementing a comprehensive rehabilitation and rationalization program for
the tea industry which would be carried out in parallel with a diversification
program and which would help to integrate the hitherto isolated population of
the tea estates into the main stream of national life; an important Government
goal. Through a pilot component the project would also examine means to in-
clude smallholders in the tea industry development program.
3.02      The project would comprise the rehabilitation of tea estates and
tea factories in an 18,000 ha block of some of Sri Lanka's best tea in the
Maskeliya, and Upper and Lower Dickoya planting districts. Thirty SPC
estates and 29 JEDB estates would be involved as well as a limited number
of smallholders. Main components of the proposed five year project are:

(g)  updating tea area statistics.
B.  Detailed Features
Replanting
3.03      The project would assist JEDB to increase its project area replant-
ing program from 420 ha to 965 ha over the project period. (SPC would not
increase planned levels of replanting because of the labor constraint; its
incremental field development effort would be restricted to infilling, fuel-
wood planting, and conservation). Areas for replanting are selected by Estate
Superintendents in consultation with Visiting Agents and Regional Managers.
Areas chosen usually yield below 600 kg/ha 1/ and have a vacancy rate of at
least 50%.
1/   The yield level at which replanting is indicated varies, being dependent
on the yield potential of clonal tea in the particular area.



- 11 -
3.04      The replanting technique in use is good and would be continued.
Replanting, using only clonal material, is on the contour at the rate of
12,500 plants/ha, 80% above the old seedling tea density. An adequate range
of clones is recommended for the project area; most commonly used are from
the 2,020 series developed by TRI (2,025, 2,026, 2,023), but estate selections
such as K145, DN and N2 are also used. Most estates have adequate mother
bushes to supply cuttings, shortages would be made up from neighboring estates.
Nursery techniques are also good. Project costs include provision for nursery
expansion, based on the cost of planting material - Rs 0.30/plant.
3.05     Replanting operations and direct costs per hectare are shown below.
In addition, the project would provide additional equipment for the expanded
replanting and infilling programs (winches, sprayers, pumps and sprinklers -
details at Annex 1).

Net cost to grower                                21,325
Infilling
3.06      Infilling would be carried out in fields not earmarked for replant-
ing in which vacancies average about 25%. The infilling programs of JEDB and
SPC would be 3,000 ha and 3,500 ha respectively. Infilling would be carried
out in the year of pruning - to minimize competition for the new plants - in
units of 15 plants or more, and at a spacing of 120 cm x 60 cm on the contour
giving 80% greater density than seedling tea. The infilled blocks would
therefore not conform to the planting geometry of the surrounding seedling
tea. However, plucking and other husbandry related disadvantages would be
outweighed by more rapid development of cover and greater yield.  Infilled
areas must be managed the same way as the rest of the block which surrounds
them.  For this reason TRI recommends infilling with clones which can be
treated like seedling tea, amongst these are DN, CY9 and N2.

Net cost to grower                                 16,535
3.08      Smaillholder Assistance.  Reliable data on smallholder yields, pro-
duction costs; and returns are not available, and the proposal to assist the
approximately 180 small growers in the project area would be largely of a
pilot nature. Experience gained would be used in the subsequent preparation
of wider ranging programs to assist smallholders. As the illustrative small-
holder budget at Annex 4 shows, on a smallholding achieving only average
yields replanting depresses income for several years even when credit and
subsidy are available. The regional officer of the Tea Smallholdings Develop-
ment Authority (para 5.21) would therefore encourage only the better small-
holders to undertake modest replanting and infilling programs. It is esti-
mated about 25% of the smallholders would participate, replanting and infilling
15 ha and 40 ha respectively.
3.09      To minimize administrative costs, financial assistance for replant-
ing would be restricted to units of not less than 0.25 ha. To minimize the
temporary negative effect on income, farmers should not replant more than
25% of their tea area; replanting would therefore be confined to smallholders
growing over 1 ha. Smallholders with less than 1 ha of tea would be advised
to infill and replace old bushes gradually as the family labor supply permits.
Arrangements would be made for smallholders to obtain planting material and
fertilizer from the estates to which they were supplying green leaf. When
the findings of the Tree Crop Incentive Study are being discussed with GOSL
(para 6.14) particular attention would be given to the replanting subsidy
with a view to making it better suited to smallholder needs.
Renovation of Soil Conservation Works
3.10      SoiL conservation works would be completely renovated in replanted
and infilled areas. They would also be repaired on 16,000 ha of seedling tea
scheduled for future infilling (JEDB 7,500 ha, SPC 8,500 ha). The estimated
cost is Rs 18.8 M (US$1.2 M).
Fuelwood Plant:ations
3.11      To remedy the fuelwood shortage JEDB and SPC would plant 340 ha
and 250 ha respectively of Eucalyptus spp. Most would replace uneconomic tea



- 13 -
on areas unsuitable for replanting, the balance would occupy wastelands such
as valley bottoms. There are estimated to be 1,195 ha suitable for fuelwood
plantations but only 590 ha would be developed under the project because of
labor constraints. Establishment is not expected to present technical diffi-
culties, and the Forestry Department would be available to advise on species
and site selection. Seedlings would be produced on estates or obtained from
Forestry Department nurseries. Where fuelwood was to replace degraded tea the
bushes would be killed by cutting them off near ground level and painting the
stump with arboricide. In contrast to the present practice of interplanting,
this would eliminate unmanaged tea as a disease source, and reduce competition
for the Eucalyptus seedlings. Estimated establishment costs per hectare are:

Net cost to grower                                  1,330
Factory Rehabilitation - Corporations
3.12      Factory rationalization, discussed at para 5.22, would reduce the
number of public sector factories manufacturing tea from 54 to 39; JEDB 17
and SPC 22. These would be expanded and rehabilitated to improve efficiency
and the quality of manufacture. The major change would be replacement of
tats by withering troughs at an estimated cost of Rs 14.3 M (US$0.9 M). This
would be the key to rationalization and expansion of throughput. To handle
the larger throughput worn out driers would be replaced and new ones added,
mostly fluid-bed driers (FBD), a highly efficient drier designed, patented
and, at present, only manufactured in Sri Lanka. FBD cannot handle big bulk
teas, 1/ with their poor flow characteristics, therefore some drying capacity
would be provided in the form of conventional endless chain pressure driers.
Estimated cost of driers is Rs 21 M (US$1.3 M).
3.13      In traditional orthodox manufacture leaf is processed through a
series of rollers to rupture leaf tissue and induce fermentation. Rollers
basically comprise a 36" to 48" horizontal round table over which the leaf
is rolled by an eccentrically rotating upper plate. Between rolls - four
is normal - the leaf is sifted to remove the portion (a dhool) which has been
sufficiently rolled. In project area factories some rollers would be replaced.
However outlays would be modest (Rs 1.7 M), partly because serviceable rollers
would be salvaged from factories to be closed and also because some rotorvanes
would be introduced in place of rollers.
1/   The course, stalky material remaining after rolling.



- 14 -
3.14      Rotorvanes comprise basically a 4' by 8" or 15" tube in which re-
volves a central shaft bearing angled vanes.  Operating like a screw the vanes
force leaf through the tube rupturing tissue in the process. Rotorvanes have
a higher output than rollers and can produce finer particles, particularly
from tougher leaf. Using rollers and rotorvanes in series, as proposed, would
increase factory capacities and would provide flexibility to alter grade per-
centages in response to market conditions. In particular, it would be possible
to significantly increase the proportion of BOPF and Dust grades which are
required for the increasingly important tea bag trade. Present and possible
future top grade outturns are as follows:
Grade      Present       Future
BOP           40            20
BOPF         27            45
Dust I         8            10
75           75
Estimated cost of rotorvanes is Rs 5.9 M (US$0.4 M).
3.15      In addition to these major investment items a further Rs 25 M
(UJS$1.6 M) wouLd be spent on a wide range of smaller items. Included would
be equipment to: expand and improve sorting and packing capacity (Rs 8.0 M,
U',$0.5 M); improve material handling (Rs 3.5 M); provide standby power
(Rs 5.0 M); and improve lighting (Rs 1.7 M). A small provision (Rs 2.2 M)
is made for structural alterations. These would include ducting to convey
hot air from drying rooms, which would be exhausted to atmosphere or used to
heat air flow to withering troughs; and installation of heating units, from
scrapped driers, as independent heat sources for withering troughs. The
lattter arrangement would be more efficient than the present practice of run-
nding driers solely to produce hot air for withering. Full details and costs
of factory equipment are at Annex 1.
Factory Rehabilitation - Private
3.16      The project would supply machinery and equipment to improve three
privately owned factories in the project area which manufacture their own leaf
plus leaf bought from smallholders. Development would be similar to that in
cc,rporation factories. Major requirements are: withering troughs, rotorvanes,
and sorting machinery. Total estimated cost is Rs 0.9 M (US$0.6 M).
Vehicles - Corporations
3.17      To improve plucking efficiency, and to ensure that green leaf arrives
at factories in top condition, 121 tractors and 363 trailers would be provided
for green leaf transport at an estimated cost of Rs 23 M (US$1.4 M). This
would provide one tractor (45 HP) and three trailers for approximately every
140 ha of tea. Provision of three trailers would allow tractors to be ope-
rated on a shuttle basis, and to be free for other jobs. Trailers would be



- 15 -
constructed to carry 1,800 kg, with wire bodies to permit maximum ventilation
of tea during loading and transport. To get the best use from trailers, and
to maximize plucking efficiency, each plucking gang would be accompanied by
a weighing clerk so that pluckers could weigh-in regularly without long waits.
The weighing station (trailer) would be kept as close to pluckers as possible
to reduce walking.
3.18      To improve management efficiency and reduce transportation costs,
most personnel transport in the project area would be replaced. Estate Super-
intendents would be given small saloon cars (57 of about 1,500 cc), and
Assistants would be given motorcycles (48 of about 150 cc). In addition
52 estates would get a pick-up or four-wheel drive vehicle for field travel,
staff transport and light haulage. Estimated cost of personnel transport is
Rs 14.9 M (US$0.9 M).
3.19      Larger estates operate small trucks to haul supplies - fertilizer,
building materials, etc.   The project would supply eleven 3 ton trucks as
replacements at an estimated cost of Rs 1.2 M. Ninety 1,200 1 bowsers would
be supplied, two per estate, for herbicide transport, to support the expansion
of chemical weed control. Estimated cost is Rs 0.4 M. Four 18,000 1 bowsers
would be supplied to transport fuel oil from railhead to estates. These would
cost Rs 1.3 M. They would operate under the direction of the two regional
offices.
Vehicles - Private Sector
3.20      The larger private producers who use trucks, tractors and trailers
to transport their supplies and green leaf, have been unable to buy replace-
ments for many years. The project would provide them one 3 ton truck, and
9 tractors and 27 trailers. Six herbicide bowsers would also be supplied.
Total costs for private sector estate transport would be about Rs 1.8 M.
3.21      About twenty-five 5 ton trucks would be supplied to the private
transport contractors, who transport made tea from project area estates to
Colombo, at an estimated cost of Rs 6.6 M (US$0.4 M). Transporters would be
eligible to receive one truck for each 650,000 kg of made tea transported in
1977.
Workshops
3.22      Taking advantage of the concentration of estate ownership, each
corporation would establish a regional workshop in the project area. They
would be located at two of the factories selected to cease manufacture and
would be equipped to undertake vehicle maintenance and some repairs; major
repairs would continue to be sent to dealers. Modest stocks of fast moving
spares would be maintained, a useful facility when private dealers have
difficulty supplying spares because of import controls. The workshops would
also be staffed and equipped to handle factory machinery maintenance and,
again, modest repairs. The workshops would operate as independent profit
centers charging for work at rates sufficient to recover all costs. The
cost of establishing the two workshops is estimated to be Rs 1.0 M.



- 16 -
Housing
3.23      Virtually the entire 25,000 units of labor housing on corporation
estates in the project area require improvement. In the course of improving
existing housing about 50% of families have to be rehoused because some old
units are combined and others are knocked down. Thus, for every unit of
rehabilitated housing a new unit must be built. To fully rehabilitate exist-
ing housing and build necessary replacements would take 10 years. Neither
building capacity nor funds would be sufficient for a faster pace. Over the
five years of the project, therefore, half the building program would be
completed - re'habilitation of 6,300 units and construction of 3,100 new twin
cottages. Once rehabilitation is begun it must be completed, to prevent dis-
crimination and ensure that adequate labor would be attracted to the industry
to replace the repatriated Tamils. An assurance was obtained that housing
rehabilitation in the project area would be completed by December 31, 1988.
3.24      Both JEDB and SPC began rehabilitation using slightly different
designs; those of SPC being simpler. New standardized designs have now been
adopted; the estimated costs of rehabilitation and new construction using
these designs are Rs 9,500 and Rs 21,000 respectively. The total cost of
tlhe corporations' housing programs is Rs 125 M (US$7.8 M).
3.25      The larger private growers who retain a permanent labor force face
the same housing problems as the corporations.  They also face a tight labor
supply situation and recognize that, if they are to compete for labor, they
aLso must upgrade their housing.  The project therefore provides for the
rehabilitation of 400 units and the construction of 200 new twin units, in
private estates. Estimated cost is Rs 8.0 M (US$0.5 M).
Water Supplies
3.26      The water supply systems to labor housing are old and need repair;
in particular much of the piping needs replacement. New housing units would
aLso require water supplies.  Repairs and new supplies would be provided under
the project at an estimated cost of Rs 1.1 M (US$0.07 M).
Health Services
3.27      In the project area the health of the population and the provision
of health serv:Lces are much below national standards. For example infant and
maternal mortality rates are twice the national average. A recently returned
economic mission (November 1977) found that the poor health status on estates
is perhaps the single most pressing 'basic needs' problem in Sri Lanka.
3.28      The provision of health services in estate areas is the joint
responsibility of the Ministry of Health and the estate operators. The
Ministry operates district and base hospitals and the estates provide simple
medical care from small dispensaries. In order to improve health services
at: the field level the Ministry recently launched a national polyclinic pro-
gram. Ten Mediical Officers (MO) were appointed, each responsible for twenty
estate dispensaries which they visit for one day each month. The MO expand



- 17 -
and improve dispensary operation by providing professional advice and assist-
ance, particularly in such needy areas as nutrition and pre and post natal
health care. Government intends to expand both the area coverage and visiting
intensity of the polyclinic program.
3.29      The project would improve the provision of medical services to the
project area by: constructing and equipping pre and post natal clinics at
the four district hospitals; meeting the cost of four MO to expand polyclinic
coverage; and by providing equipment to improve the operation of 45 estate dis-
pensaries. The estimated cost is Rs 5.4 M (US$0.3 M). This health component
would make little impact on the countrywide problem of inadequate health serv-
ices in estate areas.  The project would therefore also finance a study to
prepare an investment program for the improvement of estate health services
countrywide. This study would be coordinated with on-going work in the health
sector; the estimated cost is Rs 0.4 M (US$25,000). The consultants would be
employed with experience, and on terms and conditions, satisfactory to IDA.
Training
3.30      Provision for industry training is at present inadequate.  GOSL, re-
cognizing the problem, intends to establish a National Institute of Plantation
Management which would have responsibility for the training requirements of the
entire tree crop sector. The institute will cater to both public and private
estates and will also provide training for personnel in related marketing
activities. It will be headquartered in Colombo but will make use of the staffs
and facilities of the Coconut, Rubber and Tea Research Institutes and of the
Agricultural University, in the operation of training courses.
3.31      The project would assist the development of the Institute, and in
particular its capacity to train tea industry personnel, through construction
of hostel facilities for trainees at the TRI. The project would also finance
30 man-months of technical assistance. This would enable the recruitment of
a high calibre training specialist to serve as the Institute's Director during
its first formative year and additional specialists on short-term assignments
to advise on course development. The specialists would be employed with ex-
perience, and on terms and conditions, satisfactory to IDA. The project would
also provide for overseas training visits for senior staff from JEDB, SPC and
TRI. The estimated total cost of the training component is Rs 3.3 (US$0.2 M).
Tea Area Measurement
3.32      Tea area statistics are out of date and inaccurate.  Under the pro-
ject the Survey Department would re-measure the tea area. Priority would be
given to measurement based on an analysis of Landsat data.  The Department
has experience with Landsat data analysis and could begin work and provide
information at an early date. The extent to which it would be possible to
classify the tea areas from Landsat data analysis would only be known once
work had begun.  As necessary the Landsat analysis would be supplemented by
aerial photo interpretation. Most of the work would be carried out using the
Department's existing manpower and equipment. The project would provide
Rs 0.8 M (US$50,000) for the purchase of materials, supplementary computer

time and for temporary staff for photo interpretation. A major side benefit
of this component would be the broadening of the Department's experience with
Landsat data analysis and the opportunity which would be presented for further
exploration of the natural resource base.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
4.01      The estimated total cost of the five-year project, including contin-
gencies, is Rs 493 M (US$31 M equivalent), of which about US$9.7 M (30%) would
be foreign exchange. Taxes and duties would amount to approximately Rs 9.0 M,
1.8% of project cost. Details of project cost, summarized below, are in Annex 1.

4.02      Cost estimates are based on findings during appraisal and updated
to February 1978, including November 1977 budget changes. Physical contin-
gencies are 7.5% for civil works, 5% for factory equipment and field works and
2.5% for the support component. No physical contingencies have been included
for vehicles, and field, nursery, health and training equipment. Price contin-
gencies, accounting for 25% of total costs, have been compounded at the follow-
ing levels:

B. Financing
4.03       An IDA credit of US$21 M is proposed on standard terms to GOSL.
This would amount to 68% of total project costs (70% of costs net of duties
and taxes) and would cover 100% of foreign costs plus 54% of local costs.
The remaining local costs of US$9.8 M would be financed by SPC and JEDB and
the Bank of Ceylon with a small contribution from private operators and GOSL.
Proposed project financing is summarized below (in thousand US dollars):

/a   Should the financial position of the corporations allow financing of
more than 25% of their investment requirements, these amounts would
be reduced.
C. On-lending
4.04      Government, through the Central Bank, would on-lend up to US$17.2 M
of the IDA Credit to the Bank of Ceylon, which in turn would on-lend this,
plus US$1.9 M of its own resources, to the two corporations, private truck



- 20 -
operators, private factory owners and private growers. These sub-borrowers
would make a minimum 25% equity contribution to their investments. The balance
would be borrowed from the Bank of Ceylon on terms in line with current com-
mercial lending; these would be at rates of interest of 12% per annum for
factory equipment, vehicles and field development, and at 10% for housing.
Loan periods would be: factory machinery 10 years; vehicles 5 years; field
development 15 years with one year of grace; and housing 15 years with 5 years
of grace. The Central Bank would provide 90% refinance to the Bank of Ceylon
for project sub-loans at 6.5% and 8.5%, allowing the Bank of Ceylon an interest
margin of 3.5%; this would cover risk, administrative expenses and provide a
reasonable profit margin.
4.05       Smallholder tea growers have not previously had access to produc-
tion credit and are unfamiliar with credit procedures. Furthermore profit
from replanting and infilling would depend on above average smallholder yields
(para 6.22). Not more than about 25% of growers are therefore expected to be
eligible and to take production loans. Applications for credit would be en-
couraged, and applicants would be assisted by the local TSDA extension agent,
whose written support would be required on the loan application to the Bank
of Ceylon. Credit terms would be the same as for the corporations (para 4.04).
Under an agreement entered into between the grower, the Bank of Ceylon and the
bought leaf factory concerned, loan repayments would be deducted from green
leaf sales. The present practice whereby bought leaf factories provide short-
term production credit, would also be continued under the supervision of the
extension agent. For small areas of replanting and infilling, planting
material would also be provided through this source.
4.06       Some areas on which field development would be started during the
project would not come into production until 1988.  An assurance was there-
fore obtained that Government would continue to assist in making credit
available under terms and conditions similar to those under the project, so
as to bring these tea areas into production. A similar assurance was obtained
that credit would be available to enable all estate labor housing in the pro-
ject area to be upgraded by the end of 1988.
4.07       Details of proposed on-lending terms and conditions are given in
Schedule A. An assurance was obtained that these terms and conditions would
be adopted for project lending. An attachment to Schedule A contains the 1975
and 1976 financial statements for the Bank of Ceylon which are satisfactory.
The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to IDA, between GOSL
and the Bank of Ceylon would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
5.01      Land Reform, executed in two phases in 1974 and 1975, completely
changed the ownership and management structure of the tea industry. Some
changes were unsuccessful. For example the Upcountry Estate Development
Board and the Electorate Level Cooperatives so mis-managed their estates



- 21 -
that they were recently dissolved and their estates allocated between JEDB
and SPC. Now, after two years of post-reform operational experience, the
entire institutional structure needs review to determine suitability and GOSL,
assisted by CIDA, has begun a study to produce a Tea Master Plan. Pending
the outcome oC the study, major institutional changes are not proposed under
the project. Assurances were obtained that the findings of the study would
be discussed with IDA, and that institutional changes which, in the opinion
of IDA, would materially affect project execution, would not be made with-
out prior discussion with IDA.
Project Coordination
5.02      The Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI) is responsible for
public sector operations in the plantation sub-sector. MPI controls the
Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) and the State Plantations Corpora-
tion (SPC), which manage most GOSL owned tea estates, including all in
the project area.
5.03      A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) has been established to
assist MPI in project implementation; members are:
Secretary, MPI (Chairman)
Chairman (or General Manager), JEDB
Chairman (or General Manager), SPC
Director General, Tea Board
General Manager, TSDA
Representative, Department of External
Resources, Ministry of Finance and Planning
liatton Regional Manager, JEDB
Hatton Regional Manager, SPC
A Project Coordinator has been appointed as PCC executive officer. The PCC
would approve annual development plans and budgets for the project, would meet
regularly to review project progress and, on the basis of the recommendations
of the Project Coordinator, award all contracts for the supply of goods and
services.
5.04      The position of Project Coordinator (PC) has been established at
the level of Senior Assistant Secretary in MPI. The PC would have sound
administrative and financial experience and a good understanding of the tea
industry. He would have a small staff, consisting of an administrative
assistant, two clerical assistants and a secretary. A construction supervisor,
who would oversee the civil works component, would report directly to the PC.
An assurance was obtained that the position of PC would at all times be filled
by a person with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA.
5.05      The PC would have the following duties:
(i) serving as Executive Officer for the PCC;



- 22 -
(ii)  in conjunction with the two Hatton Regional Managers,
preparing annual development plans and budgets for the
project and submitting them through the corporations to
the PCC and IDA. These would be prepared at least six
months in advance of each financial year to enable
incorporation in corporation budgets;
(iii)  monitoring project progress and submitting half-yearly
reports to PCC and IDA; and
(iv)  in consultation with the Supply Managers of the Corpora-
tionis, and the Hatton Regional Managers, arranging
preparation of tender documents (clearing with IDA
where required), issuing tenders, opening and evaluating
bids and making recommendations for award.
The Corporations
5.06      SPC was established in 1958 and operated on a relatively modest
scale until it was given management of large areas under the two phases of
land reform. SPC now manages about 45,000 ha of tea estates. JEDB was
established in 1976 specially to manage land taken over during land reform.
lt manages about 60,000 ha of tea estates. The two corporations have similar
cirganizations. Their Boards and Board Chairmen are appointed by the Minister
cf Plantation Industries, who may terminate these appointments at will. Head
ciffices, in Colombo, are divided into functional units under managers -
estates, finance, marketing etc.  Though structurally similar the corporations
have different management styles. Twenty years old, operating until recently
on a modest scale, SPC is set in a rather bureaucratic mold. JEDB has adopted
a. more vigorous, commercial style.
5.07      Control of field operations is decentralized to seven regional
offices and the project area comprises virtually all of the liatton Region
of both corporations. The Hatton Regional Managers would have key roles in
project implementation, therefore an assurance was obtained that throughout
the project both JEDB and SPC posts would be filled by candidates with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA.
5.08      At the field level, estate identities have been retained virtually
intact since takeover. For this reason, and because estates were assigned
mostly on the basis of previous ownership e.g., Sterling or Rupee Company,
rather than geography, the pattern of estate operation does not reflect the
advantages of unified ownership (see map). Thus, the estates controlled by
the two corporations are scattered throughout the Region, complicating super-
vision. Furthermore, green leaf from one part of an estate may be taken for
processing past the door of a neighboring estate factory. Given unified
ownership rationalization of estate management is both desirable and feasible
(para 5.22).
5.09      Estates are managed by Superintendents assisted where necessary by
Assistant Superintendents, the rate of staffing being about one officer per



- 23 -
140 ha. Visiting Agents (VA), selected from senior Superintendents, are used
to intensify supervision exercised over estates by regional offices, each
covering up to 2,000 ha. The VA visit each estate three times per year and
write a comprehensive report for the Regional Manager. VA also contribute to
the development of estate budget estimates. The VA system is a sound carry
over from pre-reform times and an assurance was obtained that it would conti-
nue to operate in the project area for the project period.
5.10      Staffing of the corporations (at least in project related areas)
is generally good. Experienced staff did leave the industry as a result of
land reform but sufficient remained to form a core of experienced personnel.
After land reform deficient performance generally resulted less from lack of
ability, than from lack of incentive, because staff terms and conditions of
service were unsatisfactory (para 1.12). A GOSL Commission examined and made
recommendations on terms and conditions and, in March 1978, staff were offered
permanent employment on the new terms. Because of the Government imposed
ceiling of Rs 2,500 per month on public sector salaries the incentives for
middle and senior management in the new terms appear inadequate. Since early
changes in such recently introduced terms would not be feasible an assurance
was obtained that the adequacy of terms and conditions of service would be
reviewed with IDA before December 31, 1979.
5.11      The Financial Structures and Operations of the corporations are
unsatisfactory. Their capital structures are undecided because decisions
have not been made regarding transfer of ownership of nationalized estates
from the Land Reform Commission to them. This issue should be settled to
facilitate sound financial planning and management, and to enhance the
security rating of the corporations, a factor which would be important in
view of the large increase in bank borrowings envisaged.
5.12      An assurance was obtained that GOSL would transfer the estates to
SPC and JEDB, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, before December 31,
1978. Compensation terms for estates taken over from Sri Lankan companies
have not yet been agreed. Valuing all the project area estates at the price
agreed for foreign owned estates, Rs 660/ acre, the equity values would be
Rs 13.6 N and Rs 15.5 M for JEDB and SPO respectively. Payment by five equal,
annual installments, the basis agreed for the foreign owned estates, would
be within the capacity of both SPC and JEDB to pay (Annex 4 Tables 3 and 4).
5.13      In the absence of a market in large estates, and with estate man-
agement having been subject to considerable recent change, there is no imme-
diately available alternative basis for estate transfer other than the com-
pensation terms. Recognizing that transfer on this basis would give the
corporations quite arbitrary asset values, Government intends that the estates
would be revalued, by an agency acceptable to GOSL and IDA, before December 31,
1982. Revaluation procedures are to be agreed between GOSL and IDA before
December 31, 1981.
5.14      The corporations have only operated on their present scale for
about two years. During that time tea prices have been extremely high.
The corporations have therefore earned high profits, and have financed



- 24 -
operating and capital expenditures from cash flow, at the same time trans-
ferring substantial surpluses to GOSL's Consolidated Fund. When tea prices
fall, as expected, and the corporations are no longer able to finance capital
expenditures from cash flows, they would, as a logical extension of present
practice, turn for budgetary aid to meet shortfalls. In such circumstances
the corporations, instead of operating as commercial entities, would be oper-
ating as extensions of government, which is not equipped effectively to make
commercial capital and operating decisions. GOSL intends that government
owned corporations should operate according to commercial practice. To meet
this objective JEDB and SPC should, inter alia, prepare "rolling" five year
development programs - geared to expected earning capacity - and should retain
sufficient of their operating surpluses to provide a contribution of at least
25% to the financing of these programs. An assurance to this effect was ob-
tained. The remaining finance would be borrowed from the commercial banking
system. Operating in this manner would provide the forward financial plan-
ning essential to the slow gestation typical of tea industry development and
would bring the financial discipline of commercial borrowing to bear on the
corporations.
5.15      Th,e Finance Act (No. 38 of 1971) controls the financial operations
of public corporations. Compliance with certain Sections is cumbersome and
reduces operational efficiency; they are:
(i)  Section 8, sub-section 2 - which requires prior approval
of the (appropriate) Minister, and of the Minister of
Finiance and Planning, for commitments of capital expen-
dilture in excess of Rs 0.5 M, notwithstanding inclusion
in a corporation's approved budget; and
(ii)  Section 10, sub-sections 3 and 4 - which require similar
prior approvals for appropriations from net surpluses
for write-offs, and for transfers to and from reserves,
again notwithstanding that these might have been reflected
in an approved budget.
GOSL, while accepting this in principle, indicated that it would not wish to
exempt JEDB and SPC from these provisions as an exception, but would rather
develop a set of criteria, for efficient and profitable operation, which would
exempt all corporations meeting such criteria. An assurance was obtained
that GOSL would, by December 31, 1978, take measures satisfactory to IDA to
enable SPC and JEDB to be exempted from the above provisions of the Finance
Act. The execution of the Project Agreement on behalf of SPC and JEDB would
be a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.16      Day-to-day financial control is adequate.  Regional offices parti-
cipate in the preparation of annual budget estimates for each estate and
forward approved versions to the head offices. Estates submit monthly
progress reports.  This system is good but, to improve efficiency, a standard
and more concise reporting format should replace the diverse forms inherited
from pre-reform managements (para 5.38).



- 25 -
The Tea Board
5.17      The Board was established in 1975 with wide powers to promote the
development of the tea industry. The Board was conceived when the majority
of estates were privately owned, and there was need for a forum to discuss
industry development. Following land reform, the Board is not the pivotal
institution suggested by the Act, and its appropriate role will be among
the issues addressed by the Tea Master Plan. The Tea Board does control
two key industry agencies - the Tea Research Insitute, and the Tea Commis-
sioner's Department.
5.18      The Tea Research Institute (TRI) is near the project area, at
Talawakale in the high country. Established in 1925, it is responsible for
all aspects of tea research covering both growing and manufacture, and had
earned an international reputation. As in the rest of the industry, deter-
iorating employment conditions led to staff resignations, and replacement
has not been entirely successful. TRI thus lacks vitality, though recent
moves should bring improvement. The IDA assisted Agricultural Development
Credit (595 CE) will provide 20 cars; a recommended salary increase should
improve staff morale and recruitment prospects; and a UNDP project is pro-
viding much needed scientific equipment.
5.19      A major TRI deficiency has been lack of firm direction.  A standing
committee of the Tea Board is char.ged with guiding tea research, but is at
present inactive. Appropriate research, and research guidance, will also be
examined by the Tea Master Plan. The largest research gap is the complete
absence of economic work. However, UNDP funding has been made available to
finance one or two positions for economic researchers and one position was
filled in March 1978.
5.20      The Tea Commissioner's Department  administers subsidies and col-
lects statistics.  The Department's functions will be reviewed by the Tea
Master Plan, and subsidies are already being examined in the ongoing Tree
Crop Incentive Study. It is worth making two points: collection of statistics
has not kept pace with recent major changes in the industry, in particular the
official tea area of 241,000 ha is generally believed to exceed the producing
area, perhaps by as much as 20,000 ha; and the application of taxes, duties
and cesses, and offsetting subsidies, is unnecessarily complicated.
Tea Smallholdings Development Authority (TSDA)
5.21      The TSDA was recently created by MPI, and is intended to focus more
attention on tea smallholders in the hitherto estate dominated industry. The
TSDA will administer subsidies and provide extension advice to smallholders.
It will be staffed mainly by transferring personnel from the Tea Commissioner's
Department. The TSDA would locate a regional officer with a small support
staff in the project area to organize smallholder development activity.
Project costs include a vehicle, office equipment, and operating costs for
this unit.



- 26 -
B. Estate and Factory Rationalization
5.22      Proposals for rationalization are shown on the map.  Transfers
of estate lands between the corporations would accomplish two levels of
rationalization. Some transfers, usually of parts of estates, are necessary
to consolidate estates around the better factories, which would be rehabili-
tated and expanded, to obviate unnecessary green leaf transport. Additional
transfers should be made to consolidate the regions of the two corporations
to improve supervision efficiency. Through rationalization about 15 factories
could be shut down, and proposals for factory rehabilitation and expansion
assume these closures. Before implementation starts a more detailed ratio-
nalization plan and factory investment proposal must be prepared. Terms of
reference for a study to prepare these proposals have been agreed with GOSL
and a study team has been selected and data collection started. Completion
of a study satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of disbursement for the
factory component.
C. Implementation Schedule
5.23      An implementation schedule is at Chart 1.  Implementation would be
spread fairly evenly over the five year project period, the pace of field
development being determined by labor availability and weather. There would
be no difficult critical steps and, provided there are no abnormally wet
monsoons, there should be no difficulty in meeting targets.
5.24      The pace of factory rehabilitation would be governed by the limited
off-peak time available each year during which factory alterations could be
carried out. Equipment supply could also be a constraint if procurement were
not kept to schedule.  The critical steps in the factory rehabilitation
schedule would be first, completion of the factory rationalization plan, and
then completion of procurement procedures on schedule.
5.25      The pace of the housing program would be mainly determined by
building capacity. To achieve the planned schedule, it would be critically
:important to finalize tender documents on time, and thereafter to complete
procurement procedures on schedule.
5.26      The timing of procurement of vehicles and minor equipment is not
critical to other activity.
D. Procurement and Disbursements
Procurement 1/
5.27      Procurement for the corporations would be directed by the PC, a
procurement schedule is at Chart 2. With the exception of fluid bed driers,
1/   All value amounts stated under this heading exclude contingencies.



- 27 -
and fuel and herbicide bowsers and trailers, all factory equipment, tractors
and vehicles for the corporations (US$5.9 M) would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. Bids
from domestic manufacturers would receive a margin of preference--15% or the
prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower--in the evaluation of bids from
competing foreign suppliers. Fluid bed driers (US$0.2 M) are patented and
manufactured by only one firm which is located in Sri Lanka and would be pur-
chased direct. Prices for these driers are considered reasonable and the firm
is capable of meeting required orders. Fuel and herbicide bowsers and trailers-
for the corporations (US$0.6 M) would be procured on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally, following procedures acceptable to IDA, since pro-
curement would be in small lots not expected to attract international
bidding.
5.28      All equipment and vehicles for private tea producers, and trucks for
made-tea transport (US$0.6 M) would be purchased directly by private operators
on the basis of customer preference due to the fact that procurement is expected
to be made in small lots not suitable for ICB.
5.29      Civil works (housing) would consist of many small individual units
constructed over a five-year period and would not, therefore, be suitable for
1CB. Contracts for construction of new cottages (US$4.3 M) would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally, following procedures
acceptable to IDA. To encourage small contractors, tenders would be invited
for multiples of five cottages. The Project Coordinator's Office may undertake
bulk procurement of such items as cement, iron sheets and timber for small
contractors; in this instance procurement would be on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally, following procedures acceptable to IDA. The
rehabilitation of existing estate housing (US$4.0 M) would be undertaken by
estate labor on force account, with provision for outside contractors should
estate labor capacity be inadequate.
5.30      Field development works (US$4.8 M) would be undertaken by estate
labor on force account. Water pipe and tanks, and workshop, office, field,
dispensary and nursery equipment (US$0.8 M) consist of many very small indi-
vidual items which would not be suitable for ICB and which would be procured
on the basis of local shopping. Sufficient local manufacturers and agents
are available to ensure competitive prices.
5.31      Civil works for hospitals, and civil works and equipment for the
training institute (US$0.2 M) would be procured on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally following procedures acceptable to IDA. Vehicles
and equipment for hospitals and the polyclinic program would be purchased
direct from suppliers to ensure standardization with those already in use by
the Ministry of Health (US$0.14 M).
5.32      The balance of project costs (excluding contingencies) of US$0.2 M
would consist of incremental staff expenses and consultant costs.
5.33      For all tenders for vehicles and equipment worth over US$100,000,
technical specifications and draft tender documents would be submitted to IDA



- 28 -
before bidding documents were issued, and for individual contracts for goods
worth over US$100,000, bid evaluations would be submitted to IDA for approval
before awards were made. Specifications and draft tender documents for hous-
ing contracts would be submitted to IDA before the first bidding documents
were issued. After IDA approval of these initial documents, further IDA clear-
ance would onLy be required if significant changes were to be made in them.
For all individual housing contracts in excess of US$100,000 bid evaluations
would be submitted to IDA for approval before awards were made.
I)isbursements
5.34      An estimated schedule of disbursements is given below.  Disburse-
ments would be made for:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditure for directly imported vehicles
and equipment, or 100% of local expenditures (ex factory
cost) if manufactured locally or 75% of expenditures for
imported goods procured locally (US$8.5 M);
(b)  55% of the total cost of civil works done by contract
and civil works performed under force account by SPC
and JEDB estate labor (US$5.9 M);
(c)  50% of total estate field development expenditures on replant-
ing, infilling, soil conservation works and timber planting
(US$4.7 M) (this is equivalent to 70% of incremental
expenditures); and
(d)  100% of the cost of overseas training and technical
assistance (US$0.3 M).
5.35      Disbursement would be made against project expenditures and not
against sub-loans to borrowers under the project. The PC would be responsible
for project disbursement claims. Disbursements would not be made for civil
works undertaken by force account on privately owned estates, or for field
and nursery equipment. Disbursements for SPC and JEDB civil works and field
development carried out by force account would be made against statements of
expenditure, the documentation for which would be audited and retained by the
Project Coordinator for examination by IDA staff during supervision missions.
All other disbursements would be made against full documentation. Any amounts
not disbursed for the project would be cancelled.

E. Accounts, Audits and Monitoring
5.36      Assurances were obtained that SPC, JEDB, the Bank of Ceylon, TSDA
and MPI would maintain separate accounts for the project, which would be
audited annually, together with disbursement documents, by the Auditor General's
office or other independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Certified copies of
these accounts would be sent to IDA within six months of the close of the Sri
Lanka fiscal year. The audit report would include, inter alia, a statement
that funds disbursed against statements of expenditure had been used for the
purpose for which they were provided. Auditing of SPC accounts is overdue
because of SPC delays in the preparation of accounts. An assurance was ob-
tained that SPC accounts would be brought fully up to date by December 31,
1978 and would be fully audited by June 30, 1979.
5.37      The Project Coordinator would arrange the preparation of an annual
project budget and half yearly project monitoring reports for submission to
the Project Coordinating Committee. Assurances were obtained that the
committee would submit to IDA:
(a)  an annual project budget, showing details of planned
physical works and financial expenditure, not later
than two months prior to the commencement of the Sri
Lanka fiscal year; and
(b)  copies of half yearly project monitoring reports (in
a form satisfactory to IDA), within two months of the
close of each half year.

5.38      The estate monthly reporting formats used by the two corporations
are not standardized. An assurance was obtained that SPC and JEDB would, by
])ecember 31, :1978, introduce and maintain a standard format for their estates'
aonthly reports satisfactory to IDA.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
Tea Production
6.01      Old seedling tea accounts for about 80% of tea land in the project
area.  Much of this has a high bush vacancy rate and is past its economically
productive life.  Without a sizeable infilling program and improved standards
of management, seedling tea yields will decline as country-wide data indicate
they have over the last decade. Without the project, and in the absence of
infilling, seedling yields are projected to decline by an average of 1% per
year.
6.02      As a result of replanting poor tea areas, infilling, and diversi-
fication into timber of the worst tea land, average yields in the project area
are estimated to increase from 1,210 kg per hectare in 1979 to about 1,720 kg
by 1998. Without the project a limited replanting program would result in a
1998 average yield of approximately 1,340 kg per hectare. The incremental
impact of the project after 20 years, therefore, would be to increase annual
tea yields in the project area by nearly 30%.
6.03      TotaL project area production is estimated to increase from about
20 M kg in 1979) to 27 M kg in 1998. On a 'with' and 'without' project basis,
inacremental production in 1998 is projected at 4.4 M kg or an increase of
nearly 20%. Detailed estimates of project yields and production are in
Annex 2.
6.04      The incremental impact of the project would be marginal in terms of
Sri Lanka's overall production, about 2%, but would be an important first step
in stemming the decline in the country's tea output. Production in 1976 was
196.6 M kg, dowm from a peak of 228.2 M kg in 1965. Sri Lanka's tea production
in 1995 (when replanting investments reach maturity) including the proposed
project, would be an estimated 227 M kg; slightly below the peak 1965 level
oi 228.2 M kg. This output projection takes account of probable replanting
pe!rformance. Details and key assumptions are contained in Annex 2.
6.05      GOSL is pursuing a program of diversification of marginal areas out
of tea. As part of this program, IDA assistance has been requested for a
project to diversify approximately 4,800 hectares of tea in the Kandy area.
This area typifies large areas of tea, mostly in the mid-country, which are
degraded, rapidly declining in yield and unsuitable for replanting to tea.
The Kandy project area now produces about 2.5 M kg of tea, however production
would soon become uneconomic and be abandoned. Rehabilitation and increased
output from high potential areas is essential to replace such lost output.



- 31 -
Fuelwood Production
6.06      Locally significant amounts of fuelwood would be produced under the
project. Yields are estimated at 120 m per hectare on a 10 year rotation
basis. During the five year period of the IDA project, 590 hectares of
timber w3uld be planted, giving a total output of fuelwood per rotation of
70,800 m
Marketing
6.07      The majority of Sri Lanka tea output is sold at the Colombo auc-
tions, the world's largest. Of the total 1976 crop of 197 M kg, 182 M kg
were sold in Colombo, with almost all the remainder (mainly better quality,
high grade teas) being shipped to the London auctions.
6.08      The auction system in Sri Lanka, which is largely operated by six
Colombo brokerage houses, has operated successfully for many years and all
the world's major buyers are represented. Recently, there have been some
complaints from these buyers of a general deterioration in tea quality and
poor standards of tea packaging. The project would improve quality through
improvements to green leaf transport and handling, and through factory rehab-
ilitation.
6.09      About 90% of tea sold at the Colombo auctions is subsequently
exported; the major markets being Pakistan, USA, the Middle East and UK, in
that order. In the period 1961-63, exports from Sri Lanka accounted for
34.5% of total world exports. However, as the country's production declined
and that of other exporters (especially African countries) increased, this
market share declined to 27.5% in the period 1972-74. Sri Lanka's domestic
consumption has remained quite stable in recent years and in 1976 was approx-
imately 21 M kg, or about 1.5 kg per caput.
6.10      In the medium term, tea consumption in developing countries is
expected to grow somewhat faster than previously; at 4.4% per year from
1972/74 to 1985, compared with 3.9% per year between 1961/63 and 1972/74.
Total world consumption is, however, unlikely to be greatly affected. It
is projected to grow by only 3.4% per annum between 1972/74 and 1985, slightly
faster than the 1961/63 to 1973/74 rate of 3.3%. This is because consumption
growth in developed and centrally planned economies is expected to decline.
In line with consumption, world tea production is expected to increase by
about 3.4% per annum from 1972/74 to 1985, compared with 3.3% annually from
1961/63 to 1972/74.
6.11      Since 1975, world tea prices (average London auction all teas)
have increased sharply; from 60 pence per kg in 1975, to 85 pence in 1976
and a record high of 255 pence in April 1977. Since then prices have fallen
steadily, and at the end of November stood at just over 100 pence per kg. The
average price for the 11 months January through November 1977 was 160 pence
per kg.



- 32 -
6.12      The major factor behind these tea price increases has been the
'pull' of sharply increased coffee prices. The FAO Secretariat has predicted
that unless future coffee prices, in real terms, greatly exceed recent levels
(about 60% above the 1972/74 levels) tea consumption will not increase much
as a result. Barring further frosts in Brazil, the real price of coffee is
expected to decline to pre 1975 average levels by 1981. Tea prices are,
therefore, expected to fall from their present high levels of US200 per kg
to 175 cents in 1980 and 170 cents in 1985 (IBRD projections, constant 1977
terms). Negotiations, on the establishment of an international commodity
agreement to support the price of tea, are continuing under the auspices of
IJNCTAD. Such an agreement could strengthen long-term tea prices, however,
lhe negotiations are not likely to be finalized for 12 to 18 months and their
outcome cannol: be predicted at this stage.
6.13      Pro2ject financial price assumptions (Annex 3) are based on IBRD
projections for London auctions, with allowance for freight and other selling
expenses, Sri Lanka sales tax and export duty, and expected quality differ-
entials. Projject incremental output, amounting to less than two tenths of
one per cent of world tea output, would not significantly affect world tea
prices.
6.14      After appraisal GOSL, in its November 1977 budget, devalued the rupee
and, as a complementary measure, introduced a flat rate tea export duty of
Rs 15.5/kg.  Ihis rate does not allow a sufficient return on capital invested
in rehabilitation projects, which include housing, even for well managed
estates (para 6.20). Furthermore tea prices are expected to fall. GOSL has
stated that it intends to modify the rate of tea export duty so as to maintain
reasonable profitability as prices fluctuate. Pending the findings of the
Tree Crops Incentive Study definitive recommendations on an appropriate
overall prices and incentives structure cannot be made. Assurances were
tlherefore obtained that GOSL would adjust the prices and incentives structure
as necessary to maintain tea industry profitability at the level established
by the November 1977 budget, and would discuss the findings of the study with
IDA before December 31, 1978.
6.15      Without the project, both tea quality and the percentage of top
grades would siteadily decline as a result of continuing deterioration in
factory equipment. The project would upgrade this and add greater flexi-
bility to the maanufacturing process. It is expected that after 10 years,
'with' project prices would average 5% more than prices on a 'without'
project basis. Projected prices are:
(Rs per kg)

With Project      13.0       10.9       10.0      10.1      10.2

- 33 -
6.16 3    Timber prices are difficult to predict; the current price of Rs 32
per m has been used for projection purposes. Given the increasing scarcity
of fuelwood, this may prove conservative.
Production Costs
6.17      A detailed study of 22 estates in the project area indicates that
current production costs per kg are inversely correlated to yield. Based on
an examination of the proportions of fixed and variable costs, production
costs can be predicted for yield levels higher than those now obtained. On
a 'without project' basis cost of production would be affected by three
factors. The most important, increasing yield, would lower costs. Partially
offsetting this, factory machinery and vehicle maintenance costs (presently
Rs 0.20 per kg) would increase by an estimated 2.5% a year, and decreasing
drier efficiency would increase fuel costs (presently Rs 0.25 per kg) also
by an estimated 2.5% per year.
6.18      With the project, increasing yields would again have the greatest
impact on costs. While costs of operating and maintaining green leaf tractors
and trailers, and of factory electricity, would increase, costs for plucking,
factory labor, and withering fuel would decrease (costs for maintenance of
labor housing would also increase, but these have been treated separately
from production costs in the cost table).
6.19      The net impact of differing yields, and the other changes mentioned,
is that after 10 years 'with project' production costs are 16% lower than
'without project' costs, while after 20 years the margin increases to 22%.
Financial Results
6.20      Without the project, the lack of adequate housing would have made
it impossible to replace the departing Tamil labor and productivity would
have declined as a result of labor shortage. This decline in productivity
is difficult to quantify. As a proxy, the situation has been accounted
for in the financial analysis by prorating housing costs on the basis of
the proportion of the project area benefiting from the housing component,
and from which incremental benefits flow. Of a total tea area of 18,000 ha,
7,000 ha (40%) would be replanted and infilled under the project. As incre-
mental project benefits will flow only from this area, 40% of housing costs
have been included in the financial analyses. Incremental financial rates
of return for the corporations (Annex 4, Tables 1 and 2) are 14.5% for SPC
and 12.5% for JEDB. Without prorating, the financial rates of return to
SPC and JEDB would be 8.5% and 8.0% respectively. It is, therefore, evident
that the corporations bear a financial burden in undertaking Government's
housing program. This is illustrated in the sources and application of funds
projections (Annex 4, Tables 3 and 4) which indicate that though borrowings
can be serviced, annual net cash surpluses decline as the program continues.
Government recognizes this problem and has directed that the Tree Crop
Incentive Study should pay particular attention to the financial burden
imposed on the industry by the labor housing improvement program, and that



- 34 -
a minimum financial rate of return of 12% on investment in rehabilitation
projects would be the objective required to establish sufficient incentive
for investment.  Forecast project cash flows for the Bank of' Ceylon and
Government are in Annex 4.  Mainly through the generation of additional tax-
able production the project would increase GOSL's revenues by an estimated
Rs 50 M (US$3 M) annually at full development.
6.21      Preliminary 1977 profit and loss statements for SPC and JEDB (Annex
4) indicate large surpluses, mainly as a result of high tea prices during the
year. Substantial surpluses are also budgeted for 1978; an operating profit
of Rs 365 M for SPC, and for JEDB, a surplus of Rs 85 M. However, as neither
c:orporation has yet had to purchase, or pay rental for, the estates it operates,
these surpluses are misleading.
6.22      An illustrative budget for a one hectare holding based on average
smallholder yields of 600 kg/ha and 1,050 kg/ha for seedling and clonal tea
respectively, is at Annex 4. It indicates that the financial rate of return
f'or a smallholder undertaking modest investments in replanting and infilling,
would be about 13.5%. This is not an attractive return to a smallholder.
M[ore importantly the replanting program has an adverse effect on cash flow
for about 5 years. It is therefore assumed that only 25% of above average
smallholders would participate in the project. The TSDA has been created to
assist smallholders increase their production and a major means of so doing
is replanting. The possibility of making the replanting subsidy better suited
to smallholder needs would be addressed during the GOSL/IDA discussion of the
findings of the Tree Crop Incentive Study (para 6.14).
6.23      The financial rate of return to private owners who purchase and
operate trucks for made tea transport is estimated at 18% (Annex 4, Appendix 1).
This assumes that the benefits resulting from the lower costs of operating the
new trucks would flow entirely to the truck operators and not to producers in
the form of lower transport charges.
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Principal Benef-its
7.01      The project's major benefit would derive from higher revenue gen-
erated through improved efficiency of tea production, which would increase
yields and lower production costs by nearly 20% after 20 years, and through
imsproved quality due to replacement of obsolete machinery and equipment.
7.02      Another large, though unquantified, benefit would be the improved
living standards of the 60,000 strong labor force and their families because
of improved labor housing and estate medical facilities.
7.03      Project incremental production (4.4 M kg after 20 years) would be
a marginal 2% in terms of Sri Lanka's total tea output, but would help to
arrest the current declining production trend, and would still leave the
country's total production below the peak reached in 1965.



- 35 -
Other Benefits
7.04      Project field works would need an average additional 3,000 labor
units per year over the five year investment period. Most of this would be
supplied by present estate labor working after normal working hours, adding
approximately Rs 6 M a year to estate labor income.
7.05      The project would diversify marginal tea land into timber which
would provide locally significant quantities of fuelwood for estate labor
and for factory use. Soil conservation drains throughout the project area
would be rehabilitated. This, and diversification of marginal land, would
reduce soil erosion; particularly important since the project area comprises
a large proportion of the catchment of the country's most important source
of hydro-electricity generation.
7.06      Other project benefits would include:
(a) provision, for the first time, of extension services
and production credit to 180 smallholder growers;
(b) fewer delays in the movement of made tea from estates
to the coast;
(c) improved training for estate management;
(d) a substantial stimulus for local building contractors; and
(e) improved tea area statistics.
Economic Rate of Return
7.07      In the economic analysis (Annex 5) adjustments have been made for
taxes and subsidies (most importantly taxes on tea exports and the fertilizer
subsidy) and a shadow wage rate equal to 95% of the financial wage. Housing
costs have been prorated as in the financial analysis. Price assumptions are
based on IBRD projections; project incremental output at full development
(1998), would be less than two tenths of one per cent of expected world out-
put, and would have negligible affect on these assumptions. In the November
1977 budget the exchange rate was unified, and the rupee was devalued to Rs 16
to US$1. Given the continued existence of sizeable import duties and other
restraints on trade, the equilibrium rate is assumed to be Rs 18 to US$1 and
this rate has been used in the economic analysis.
7.08      On the above assumptions, the economic rate of return (ERR) of
the project is 25%. The project is relatively insensitive to changes in
costs and benefits. An increase/decrease of 10% in tea prices would change
the ERR by about one and a half points either way. The same level of increase/
decrease in costs would change the ERR by about two percentage points either
way.



- 36 -
7.09      Project benefits include prevention of production cost increases
and quality deterioration which would occur without the project. If produc-
tion costs and quality could be maintained at present levels without the
project, and prevention of this loss were not included as a benefit, the ERR
would be 20.5% rather than 25%.
Project Risks
7.10      Apart from the temporary and unpredictable impact of adverse weather,
the technical risks of the project are no greater than would normally be
expected with operations of this nature. The major risks are organizational/
managerial in nature. As a consequence of land reform, the tea industry in
Sri Lanka has been subject to tremendous change in recent years. Two large
government corporations are now handling the work that previously was the
responsibility of a large number of tea agency houses, and they have had some
problems. However, the performance of the corporations is improving with
experience. Furthermore, the ongoing Tea Master Plan is examining the insti-
tutional structure of the industry in detail and is to make recommendations.
In the meantime the organizational/managerial structure is adequate for
project implementation in view of the limited areas of operation, recent
improvements noted and changes under the project, notably establishment of a
Project Coordinating Committee, appointment of a Project Coordinator, and
increased delegation at regional level.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations the following major assurances were obtained
t:hat:
(i) GOSI. would continue to assist in making credit available,
under terms and conditions similar to those under the
pro,ject, so that areas uprooted during the project could
be brought to full production and so that housing programs
could be completed (para 4.06);
(ii) the on-lending terms outlined in Schedule A would apply
to all project lending (para 4.07);
(iii) the findings of the Master Plan study would be discussed
with IDA (para 5.01);
(iv) institutional changes which, in the opinion of IDA,
would materially affect project execution, would not
be made without prior discussion with IDA (para 5.01);
(v) tea estates in the project area would be transferred to
the corporations before December 31, 1978 in accordance
with methods of transfer and payment satisfactory to
IDA (para 5.13);



- 37 -
(vi)  the corporations would be allowed to retain sufficient of
their operating surpluses in investment reserves to finance
contributions of at least 25% to their investment programs
(para 5.14);
(vii)  GOSL would, by December 31, 1978, take measures satisfactory
to IDA to enable SPC and SEDB to be exempted from the pro-
visions of Sections 8 and 10 of the Finance Act (para 5.15);
(viii)  GOSL would discuss the findings of the Tree Crop Incentive
Study with IDA before December 31, 1978, and would adjust
the prices and incentives structure as necessary to maintain
overall operating profitability of the industry at about
November 1977 levels (para 6.14).
8.02      The following would be conditions of credit effectiveness:
(i) the execution of a subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to
IDA, between GOSL and the Bank of Ceylon (para 4.07); and
(ii)  the execution of the Project Agreement on behalf of SPC and
JEDB (para 5.15).
8.03      It would be a condition of disbursement for the factory component
that a rationalization study satisfactory to IDA had been completed (para
5.22).
8.04      With these conditions and assurances, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA Credit of US$21 M to GOSL.

TREE CROP REHABILITATION (TEA) PROJECT
Production Projections
Project Production
1.        Project production estimates are detailed in Table 1.  During the
20 year period 1979 through 1998, project area output is estimated to rise
from 20 M kg to 27 M kg. Since, without the project it is projected to rise
to 22.6 M kg, 4.4 M kg would be incremental.
Nat:ional Product:ion Projections
2.        Tea production in Sri Lanka rose from 100 M kg in 1933 to an average
peak level of 223 M kg in the four-year period 1965-1968 (Table 2). Since
1969 production has never exceeded 218 M kg and, in the last three years,
(l0974-76) it has averaged 205 M kg. This deterioration in output is partly
attributable to dry weather; other factors have been inadequate replanting,
fertilization and weeding, and other poor management practices. Fertilizer
use, for example, declined steadily from 43,000 tons of nutrients in 1965
to 24,000 tons in 1973, and then recovered slightly to 30,000 tons in 1975.
The fall was due to pre-nationalization uncertainties, rising fertilizer
costs, the transfer of fertilizers from tea to other crops, and persistent
drought. Fertilizer availability to the tree crop sector may now improve
after nationalization, but neglect of replanting, particularly in the mid
1970s, will continue to have a severe adverse impact on production at least
over the next decade. Thus, for example, even on an optimistic calculation,
70% of the tea bushes in Sri Lanka in 1985 will be over 50 years old, and as
much as 50% will be over 70 years old.
3.        National production has been estimated assuming a replanting rate
of 3,025 ha per annum from 1983, which is GOSL's target.  This would include
project replanting.  Actual replanting in 1975 and 1976 was 1,765 ha and 890
ha respectively.  A second alternative estimate, assuming replanting at 75%
of ithe GOSL target rate, shows that in the short-term production would be
slightly higher than if the full replanting target were achieved, because of
less production foregone. However, within 15 years this position would be
reversed and a lower replanting rate significantly depresses yield projections.

4.        Assumptions used in the projections are:

JEDB & SPC              78,540            31,690           110,230

211,110           31,690           242,800
Tea Yields
a.   Clonal Tea:
Year 1    Uproot seedling tea    Year 8              1,800 kg/ha
Year 2    Fallow                   Year 9 (Prune)    900 kg/ha
Year 3    Plant clonal tea         Year 10           1,600 kg/ha
Year 4    Maintain                 Year 11          2,000 kg/ha
Year 5    Maintain                 Year 12          2,300 kg/ha
Year 6    900 kg/ha                year 13+          1,900 kg/ha
Year 7    1,400 kg/ha
b.   JEDB and SPC Seedling Tea:
Average yield in 1977 was expected to be about 1,130
kg per hectare. It is assumed that infilling, more
attentive management, regular applications of fertil-
izer, and removal of poorer, lower yielding seedling
tea areas for replanting would raise the average
yield of the remaining (declining) seedling tea
area.
c.   Other Seedling Tea:
The average yield in 1976 of the other seedling tea
areas was 630 kg per hectare. It is assumed that as
a consequence of lower levels of management in these
areas, inadequate fertilizer application, little or
no infilling and advancing age, the yield of this
category of tea will fall by an average of 3% per year.
Replanting Rates
a.   Land uprooted in 1975 and 1976, for replanting, is
estimated to be only 800 and 1,200 hectares respectively,
because of the uncertainties surrounding nationalization.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
b.   Because of high tea prices land uprooted in 1977 and
1978 is expected to be only 1,200 and 1,450 hectares,
respectively.
c.   Annual uprooting rates are assumed to rise from 1979
onward to the GOSL target of 3,025 hectares.
d.   All land uprooted would be replanted with clonal tea.
In the past less land has been replanted than was
uprooted, though reliable data are not available on
the difference. The projections therefore are likely
to overstate the amount of land under tea.
e.   All uprooting and replanting will occur on areas con-
trolled by SPC and JEDB. Owners of the other seedling
tea areas will not have the management capability, the
resources, or the inclination to undertake a replanting
program.
f.   The two corporations would uproot and replant only
their lower yielding seedling tea. The projections
therefore assume that the seedling tea uprooted would
be yielding 560 kg per hectare (not the 1,120 kg per
hectare average of all their seedling tea). Calcula-
tions indicate that 560 kg is the yield at which re-
planting is economically justified.
5.        Detailed national production projections are given in Table 3 and
are summarized below:

Quality Factor
1.        Historically, Sri Lanka high grown teas have been of superior
quality and enjoyed a higher price than the average of all teas sold in
London. In recent years this margin has been as follows:
London Auctions (pence/kg)
Sri Lanka High            Average All Tea Sold       Margin
Grown                          London                 %

1968                 46.5                            43.5                6.9
1969                 47.3                            40.5               16.8
1970                 48.1                            45.7                5.2
1971                 46.4                            43.3                7.2
1972                 46.3                            42.2                9.7
1973                 46.8                            43.4                7.8
1974                 61.1                            59.9                2.0
1975                 63.7                            62.4                2.1
1976                 89.4                            84.1                6.3
2.        The margin narrowed in recent years.  For purposes of projection,
the average of the last 5 years would be a reasonable assessment of the
expected margin for project teas. A quality margin of 6% for Sri Lanka high
grown teas is, therefore, assumed.
3.        Only the higher grades of Sri Lanka teas are sold through the London
auctions. Probably 25% of all Sri Lanka high grown teas are of a lower qual-
ity than the average of high growns sent to London. Overall, these lower
quality (though high-grown) teas realize approximately 75% of the price
for better quality teas. Prices for all high growns are, therefore, assumed
to be 6.25% less than the London high grown price.
4.        Taking both these factors into account, the 'All Sri Lanka High
Grown' London price would be discounted 0.65% below the 'Average All Tea
London' price.

fixed at Rs 15.5/kg; equivalent to about 42% of London price. GOSL
has indicated this would be reduced, as necessary, to maintain producer
margins. The rate of Rs 11.25 used here is 42% of the 1985 London price

Financial Price Projections With and Without Project
1.        Without the project there would be a decline in both quality and
the proportion of top grades. The quality decline is difficult to quantify
but may be conservatively estimated as follows:
Year             Top Grade %      Year      Top Grade %
1979 (year 1)       75            1984           70
1980                74            1985           69
1981                73            1986           68
1982                72            1987           67
1983                71            1988           66
1989+          65
Because of thie quality decline tea prices would be discounted as follows:
1979  -  0.00%              1984   -  1.25%
1980  -  0.25%              1985   -  1.50%
1981  -  0.50%              1986   -  1.75%
1982  -  0.75%              1987   -  2.00%
1983  -  1.00%              1988   -  2.25%
1989+  -  2.50%
2.        The project would replace obsolete factory equipment and provide
new rotorvane machines to give greater flexibility to the manufacturing
process. Improvements in quality are also expected. While these benefits
are also diffi,cult to quantify, they would result in price premiums of the
same order of magnitude as the price discounts estimated for the 'without
project' situation, and this has been assumed in project price projections.

TREE CROP REHABILITATION (TEA) PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Costs
Foreign Exchange:
1.        In the November 1977 budget the exchange rate was unified, and the
rupee was devalued to Rs 16 to US$1. Given the continued existence of size-
able import duties and export subsidies, the accounting price of foreign ex-
change has been valued at a rate of Rs 18 to US$1. With operating costs
having a foreign exchange component of about 20%, this would increase COP by
2.5%.
Unskilled Labor Wages
2.        Data from the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, suggest
that 20% of the working age population in Sri Lanka is unemployed. The
comparable figure for the project area is 15%. A large percentage of these
unemployed, by virtue of their educational level and affinity to urban life,
are unwilling to work as laborers in the agricultural sector. The poor
accommodation and limited social amenities available on estates exacerbate
this problem.
3.        An analysis of records of 15 estates in the project area, indicates
that over the last two years laborers have been offered an average of 24 days
work per calendar month. The full employment level is accepted as being 25
days per month. There is some seasonality to the demand for estate labor as
indicated in Table 1. Though wages of regular estate workers do not vary
throughout the year, casual wage rates are closely correlated to seasonal
demand. On the basis of this observed underutilization, the economic price of
labor has been estimated at 5% less than the financial price. This results in
the economic cost of production (COP) being 18.50 cents per kg less than the
financial. Investment costs would also be reduced as indicated in Table 2.
Fertilizer Subsidy
4.         Government subsidizes the price of fertilizer by about 75%; the
economic cost of fertilizer is therefore four times greater than the financial
cost and the effect on COP is an increase of 345 cents per kg.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Fuel Subsidies
5.         Government subsidizes fuel by approximately 20%.  About 80% of
project area tea is dried and withered using fuel oil. Elimination of this
subsidy would increase fuel costs by 7 cents per kg; and tea transport costs
by 5 cents; giving an overall increase in COP of 12 cents per kg.
Wood Fuel
6.         Approximately 20% of project area tea is withered aid dried usins
wood fuel. T:he present cash cost of this wood is Rs 32 per m , with one m
being equivalent in heat value to 40 liters of sil. At an economic oil price
of Rs 1.40 per liter, the opportunity cost of m of wood fuel would there-
fore be Rs 56. This would increase COP by 7.5 cents per kg.
Green Leaf Transport
7.        Tractors are not subject to import duty and the unskilled labor
component in transportation is negligible. Adjustment for the fuel subsidy
of 20% results in an economic price of 2.2 cents per kg green leaf; equivalent
to 9.5 cents per kg made tea (cf financial cost of 8.5 cents).
Vehicles
8.         Cars, motorcycles, four wheel drives and trucks are subject to
import duties of varying levels. The net impact on investment costs of
deducting these duties is shown in Table 2.
Factory Equipment
9.         Sri Lanka is a major supplier of tea factory equipment.  Despite
the provision for procurement by ICB it is therefore assumed that all factory
equipment would be locally purchased, hence not dutiable.
Made Tea Transport (Truck Operators)
10.       Adjustment for the 20% fuel subsidy raises annual truck operating
costs to Rs 58 per ton transported (cf financial cost of Rs 55).
Timber Operating Costs
11.       Adjiustment for a shadow wage rate reduces annual maintenance costs
to Rs 60 per hectare, while harvest year costs would be Rs 1,310.
Summary Impact on Costs
12.       The impact on project investment costs of adjusting for shadow
foreign exchange and wage rates and import duties on vehicles, is indicated
in Table 2 (for purposes of project cost estimation, fertilizer has already
been costed at the unsubsidized rate).



ANNEX 5
Page 3
13.       At a yield of 1,100 kg per ha, the present economic cost of
production is estimated at Rs 12.05 per kg; an increase of 40% over the
financial price. Apart from the adjustments for green leaf transport noted
in para 8, it is assumed that the relationship between 'with' and 'without'
project economic COP will be as outlined for financial costs and that the
impact of yield changes will also be the same.
Returns
14.       The heavy incidence of export taxes means that the economic price
of tea is much higher than the financial price. Details are given in
Table 3.
15.  3    In para 7, the economic value of fuelwood was estimated at Rs 56
per m . On this basis, gross returns per rotation (every 10 years) are
Rs 6,720 per hectare.
16.       As noted previously, the benefits of investment in made tea trans-
port are assumed to accrue to truck owners rather than to tea producers.
With a present economic cost of Rs 105 per ton transported and a predicted
cost of Rs 58 (see para 10), net economic benefits 1/ for this component
are estimated at Rs 47 per ton.  The 25 trucks purchased under the project
would carry an estimated 36,000 tons of freight per year, giving an overall
net benefit of Rs 1.7 M.
17.       On the basis of these assumptions, reflected in the economic cash
flow outlined in Table 4, the estimated economic rate of return is 25%.
18.       In view of the low world price elasticity of demand for tea, increas-
ing exports would reduce prices, other things being equal. While the prices
used in this analysis are based on IBRD projections, which take anticipated
production increases into consideration, it could be argued that without the
project the prices received for Sri Lanka's tea exports would have been greater.
The implication of this is that an item should be included in the cost side of
the economic analysis, equal to the amount of revenue lost to Sri Lanka from
the lower prices received by non-project production. This loss can be theo-
retically measured by calculating the marginal export revenue price for Sri
Lanka tea for each year of the project. The marginal export revenue price is
that price at which an extra unit of tea could be exported; as such it is a
function of the increase in world exports and the price elasticity of demand
and is equal to:

19.       The price elasticity of demand has been estimated at 0.3. 1/  The
impact on the average price (FOB price with allowance for shadow exchange rate)
for Sri Lanka's non-project production and the total resultant lost revenue,
for each year of the project, are detailed in Table 4. Given the relatively
small level of incremental production involved and the uncertainties inherent
in long-term commodity price forecasts, the results should be treated with
circumspection. The inclusion of these costs into the economic analysis
would reduce the economic rate of return to 18%, which is still acceptable.
