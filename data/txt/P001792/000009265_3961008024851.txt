MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
FOR A HEALTH SECTOR RECOVERY PROGRAM
I.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mozambique for SDR 66.3 million, the equivalent of US$ 98.7
million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Health Sector Recovery
Program. The government and the beneficiaries will provide US$ 116.5 million and other donors will
provide US$ 140.4 million.
2.    Country Background. With a population of about 17 million, mostly rural and poor, subject
to periodic drought and just emerging from nearly two decades of internal warfare, Mozambique is
generally regarded as one of the world's greatest development challenges. Yet Mozambique has the
potential to change from its present situation. There are substantial prospects for economic
development in the country if investment is allowed to flow towards economic opportunity. The
potential returns to increased investment in human capital in Mozambique are enormous in terms of
improvements in social welfare and as stimuli to economic growth. The absolutely low starting point
of Mozambique, in terms of basic social indicators and access to and quality of social services,
indicates that the marginal dollar, wisely spent, can yield high returns. Peacetime has made it possible
for the government to reestablish effective communication with the population in areas formerly cut off
by the war and to collaborate with communities in the planning and implementation of programs
intended to help them to improve their lives.
3.    Sector Context. Mozambique has a typical pre-transitional epidemiological pattern. Infant
mortality rate stands at about 162 per thousand and child mortality rate at 283. Total fertility rate is 6.5
with no indications of change. As in most sub-saharan countries, the main health problems in
Mozambique are infectious and parasitic diseases, particularly diarrhea, acute respiratory infection,
measles, tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia and child malnutrition. Among adults a principal cause of
morbidity and mortality (as indicated by hospital data) is tuberculosis. Recently available facility-based
data indicate that the spread of HIV infection is still limited but rapidly on the increase (as the incidence of
tuberculosis would suggest).
4.    One of the most impressive achievements of the Mozambican government during the years
following Independence was the expansion of health services delivery, particularly at the basic levels.
Between 1975 and 1988, the number of operating health posts increased nearly three-fold, from 326 to
933, while the number of health centers more than doubled from 100 to 210. The bulk of these facilities
were constructed in rural areas. However, civil war destroyed or closed nearly half of the first level health
care network. Adverse security conditions also discouraged staff from staying in rural areas. In 1982,
more than 90 percent of districts had a Tecnico de Medicina (a mid-level health worker able to manage
district health finances, diagnose and treat most health problems, and even perform limited surgery), and
42 percent had a doctor. Population to health worker ratios rose substantially over the course of the
decade. In 1979, on average there were 38,000 inhabitants per doctor in the country, as compared to
45,000 in 1988. In Zambezia, one of the most war-ridden areas, this ratio increased from 183,000
inhabitants per doctor in 1979 to more than 500,000 per doctor in 1988. After nearly two decades of civil
war, a peace agreement was signed in October 1992. The strategy of the government continues to



- 2 -
emphasize expansion of basic health care delivery, particularly to the rural areas, while also focusing on
improvements in quality at all levels.
5.     Through a series of policy adjustments which began in 1991, the following principles have been
affirmed as the basis for the Mozambican National Health Policy and Strategy: (a) maximizing the benefits
from the use of available resources; (b) fairness in distributing resources and equity in the access to health
care across regions and social groups; (c) freedom of users to choose their health care providers; (d) co-
existence of public and private sector; and (e) building on achievements and on lessons it has learned in
the National Health Service's areas such as primary health care and essential drugs.
6.     Program Objectives. Within the above framework, the objectives set for the health sector are:
(a)    to reduce mortality, morbidity and suffering, especially among high risk groups such as
women, children and all those displaced due to the war and natural disasters;
(b)    to keep primary health care as the basis for the provision of good quality and sustainable
health care and make it accessible to the majority of the population;
(c)    to develop the technical and managerial capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) for
planning, implementing and evaluating health care and support services.
7.     Health sector objectives are to be achieved through an increase in health coverage of the
population from the present 40 percent level to 60 percent by the turn of the century, with better quality of
services provided.
8.     Program Description. Through the coordination of all major donors and the government, the
Program, which encompasses all activities of the MOH, will finance a five-year time slice of the National
Health Strategy. In accordance with the sector's strategy, teams from the MOH have defined objectives
and identified and prepared the various components, under the overall coordination of the MOH's
Planning Directorate. The Program will address the following areas:
(a) resumption of and improvement in the quality of health services provided to yield a higher
level of services as the sector recovers, by: (i) rehabilitating and expanding the network of
first level health facilities; (ii) rehabilitating and expanding the network of rural hospitals and
rehabilitating the network of provincial and central hospitals; (iii) strengthening laboratory
facilities in hospitals and health centers; (iv) assuring stability in the provision of medical
supplies, pharmaceuticals and laboratory reagents; (v) supporting a national maintenance
strategy in the sector; (vi) supporting an institutional nutrition program for severely
malnourished children and for in-patients; and (vii) supporting general provincial operations
for health.
(b) improvement of sector institutions, support services and sub-national health management
systems by: (i) establishing policies and procedures and expanding storage capacity aimed at
improving the supply system for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals; (ii) strengthening the
provincial health management system, in coordination with decentralization of functions to the
provinces; (iii) improving the sector's information system; and (iv) enabling national
implementation of the Program, including the development of sector policy and systematic
evaluations of the Program based on comprehensive consultations with ultimate clients.



- 3 -
(c) development of human resources capacity, by: (i) implementing a time-slice of the Health
Manpower Development Plan; (ii) developing the national capacity for health personnel
training; (iii) promoting continuing education of health workers; and (iv) enhancing university
medical and health science training.
9.     The IDA credit will concentrate on financing the following activities: (a) in health services
delivery: (i) (re)construction of health centers and posts through a Rural Health Development Fund, (ii)
reconstruction of rural hospitals including staff housing, (iii) rehabilitation of laboratories, and (iv)
pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and incremental operating costs; (b) in institutional support: (i)
warehouses for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, (ii) TA for development of information systems,
and (iii) TA for strengthening capacity to implement investment activities at the provincial level; and (c) in
human resources development: (i) implementation of health training courses, (ii) rehabilitation of training
institutes, and (iii) support of rural internships through the Faculty of Medicine of the Eduardo Mondlane
University.
10.    Program Financing. The Program is designed to finance a five year time-slice of the National
Health Strategy. Financing for the first three years of the program is based on firmer commitments,
whereas the last two years have only partial funding to-date. Alternative scenarios of government
commitment to the health sector have been developed. Under the base case scenario, the government will
contribute approximately US$ 116 million, of which some US$ 98 million is recurrent expenditures. An
increasing share of the local contribution will come from cost recovery, particularly in pharmaceuticals.
All major donors operating in the sector, in association, have committed to finance, on a parallel basis, an
estimated sum of about US$ 239 million (IDA included). The amount of IDA financing, US$ 98.7
million, is based on the financing commitments of government given the level of anticipated non-IDA
donors' financing. If the Program is implemented at an accelerated rate, donor support including IDA
would be reassessed with the objective of maintaining commensurate support. If, on the other hand, the
Program experiences implementation delays or if co-funding or counterpart funding is not forthcoming,
the Program could be scaled down at the mid-term review.
I1.    Rationale for an Integrated Sector Program. The Health Sector Recovery Program initially
was prepared as a regular investment project with narrow objectives and scope. During project
preparation, the MOH, IDA and other donors concluded that the implementation of yet another individual
project (adding to a list of over 120 current health projects) would impose a heavy burden on the capacity
of the ministry. Moreover, the project would have perpetuated the provincial fragmentation of external
assistance to the country. Also, because the IDA credit would have to be justifiable on its own, the
project would inevitably focus on the types of sector activities which IDA finds most appealing but which
are not necessarily the highest priorities for the sector given existing commitments by other donors. The
result would have been an unbalanced program, full of financial gaps in important activities which are
usually neglected or avoided by donors. Even if we had produced a successful insular project, our impact
would have been small, as is the case with some other such projects in the sector. Even the impact of the
resulting sector program, the sum of all these insular projects, might well have been small, despite a
sound sector strategy which has been developed over a period of over five years in a continuous and
active dialogue with all major donors. For these reasons, the government expressed enthusiastic support
for the integrated sector approach and the MOH took charge in the development of the integrated sector
Program.
12.    Program Implementation and Monitoring. The Program will be implemented, at the central
level, by the section of the Planning Directorate responsible for the implementation of all projects in the
health sector (GACOPI) and at the provincial level by strengthened Provincial Departments of Planning
and Finance. No new agencies will be created. The emphasis is on shifting project management to lower



- 4 -
tiers of government and toward greater accountability for implementation processes. Community
participation in the design (through systematic client consultation methodologies) and execution of health
facilities' construction and other health services should yield greater efficiency and accountability in
service delivery.
13.    As the implementation of the "integrated" Health Sector Recovery Program gradually shifts from
a project basis to an approach centered along activity lines, supervision processes will also be increasingly
undertaken along activity groupings. Supervision missions and supervision instruments (e.g., financial
audits) as well as procurement and disbursement practices and other common procedures will be
organized so as to minimize their demand on scarce implementation capacity in the MOH. Program
supervision and monitoring will benefit from the largely untapped potential for delegating supervision of
particular activities to relevant donors. This should move toward linking supervision by donors to
government's own internal review processes, reduce the number of donor missions and help change the
focus of assistance and government planning towards sector strategies rather than segmented projects.
14.    Monitoring procedures will focus on progress and impact of the MOH's Program, measured
against specific targets and actions set in the five year rolling Program. This program of expenditures has
been built to reflect government commitments to the health sector in the national investment program and
recurrent budget. Detailed implementation plans will be reviewed and revised each year throughout the
Program life. Program reports will be designed to meet MOH information needs for decision-making, to
fulfill the reporting requirements of donors and to ensure coherence with overall MOH strategy. Progress
will be measured against key indicators for inputs (e.g., share of health in the public budget, level of IDA
disbursements, number of facilities built), outputs (e.g., vaccination coverage, drugs availability) and
outcomes (e.g., infant, child and maternal mortality, fertility rate and patient satisfaction). Areas of
special focus, in keeping with the MOH's strategy, will include (i) progress in assuring equitable access
by the population to a basic package of health services (with adequate quality), (ii) coverage indicators,
and (iii) compliance of staffing with national norms.
15.    Fiscal Stability. To succeed, an integrated sector operation such as the Health Sector Recovery
Program must be implemented in a fiscally sustainable environment. What this means is not only that the
Program should be affordable by the government budget, but that the resulting budget should be consistent
with the restoration of macroeconomic stability, albeit in the context of long-term economic growth.
While significant progress has been achieved in reducing the fiscal deficit after grants, this has to date
been done mainly by increasing the mobilization of grants. To promote future fiscal sustainability and
reduce aid dependency, it is important to reduce the fiscal deficit before grants through increased revenues
and rationalization of investments. A key component of the government's program to raise revenues is
the reform of customs announced at the March 1995 Consultative Group Meeting; another important
factor is the introduction of a value-added tax over the medium-term. Rationalization of the investment
program is being achieved through the development of integrated sectoral investment programs that are
consistent with sectoral priorities and available future recurrent funding. Besides increased efficiency in
the use of external resources, the development of such programs should generate savings in technical
assistance. Fiscal space for budget rationalization is also being generated by significant reductions in
military expenditures. In total, the fiscal deficit before grants would fall from about 30 percent of GDP in



- 5 -
1994 to less than 15 percent by 1999. This level would be consistent with the expected reduction in
Mozambique's aid dependency over the medium to long-term and sustained economic growth.'
16.    Program Sustainability. The MOH explicitly designed the National Health Sector Strategy and
Program to deliver a cost-effective package of basic health services. The eventual sustainability of
services is enhanced by emphasis on basic rural facilities, with rural hospitals for referral services,
appropriate training and use of mid-level health personnel, redeployment of existing resources, provision
of generic essential medicines, community participation and cost recovery, and strengthened management
support and supervision. Efficiency will also be enhanced by greater budget flexibility introduced by the
integrated sector approach. However, in spite of the government's concurrent commitment to increasing
levels of funding for the sector, foreseeable economic growth in Mozambique indicates that external
support will be necessary to sustain health and other services for some years beyond the time slice
financed by the IDA credit.
17.    Despite the significant expansion in services expected to be achieved through the Health Sector
Recovery Program, recurrent costs induced by investment in health facilities are expected to rise by less
than 2 percent per year. This modest increase reflects the heavy weight given to rehabilitation and
upgrading of existing structures which are already staffed. The overall number of health personnel is
expected to remain effectively at the present level, i.e., growing less than 5 percent during the Program
life. Moreover, a significant share of civil works (e.g., construction of warehouses) is likely to yield net
savings of recurrent resources. The financing of incremental recurrent costs directly linked to
infrastructure expansion/upgrading will be covered by increases in the sector budget, while costs linked to
improvements in the quality of services will be mostly built into the overall cost of the Program and
largely financed by donors on a declining basis over time (e.g., maintenance, supervision activities,
transportation, etc.). An increasing share of cost recovery will help ensure long term stability of local
resources.
18.    IDA financing of incremental recurrent costs amounts to about US$ 8.5 million (excluding
pharmaceuticals) and represent less than 5 percent of the Programs's total recurrent expenditures
(excluding pharmaceuticals). If we include pharmaceuticals, the share of IDA's recurrent expenditures
financing is still only about 10 percent of the total. The share of IDA in recurrent expenditures declines
over the life of the Program as the government takes on an increasing share of financing of the Program.
IDA financing of recurrent expenditures concentrates on medical supplies, fuel, maintenance inputs and
laboratory reagents (as well as pharmaceuticals). IDA funds are not being allocated for salaries of MOH
staff.
19.    The government made a significant upfront commitment to raise health expenditures ( by about 40
percent in 1995) signaling increased priority to the sector. During the next five years, the share of health
in the budget will grow but only slightly as overall resources remain very constrained. The annual
increase in the sector's recurrent expenditures to be financed by the government is estirnated at 4 percent
IAlthough economic growth will increasingly come from private sector activity, at present nearly fifty percent of GDP comes from
government investment and consumption. Therefore, it is crucial that public expenditures be transparent and reflect the priorities
laid out by the government. The Triennial Public Investment Program (PTIP) is the instrument used by government to account for
and rationalize medium-term investment decisions. Since its inception in 1992, the PTIP has been continuously improved to better
plan and control all investment activity outside the private sector (i.e., including donor support) and to identify recurrent
expenditures which are often built into investment projects. In parallel, off-budget recurrent expenditures have gradually been
integrated (or at least accounted for) in the budget. Financing of the 1994-96 PTIP comes largely from donors, who contribute
about 80 percent of the total.



- 6 -
between 1996 and 2000, compounded on the sharp initial 1995 increase. This figure translates into an
increase in recurrent public spending from about US$ 0.80 per capita in 1995 to about US$1. 10 per capita
by the year 2000. Despite an estimated modest growth in overall public recurrent expenditures between
now and the end of the century (averaging less than 2 percent p.a.), the share of health in the overall
recurrent budget will increase slightly from about 6.2 percent in 1995 to 6.9 percent in 2000. The health
sector investment budget is also anticipated to grow at 4 percent p.a. during the life of the Program,
compared to 3 percent p.a. for the overall investment budget.
20.    Lessons of Experience. Design of the proposed Program has benefited greatly from the
application of lessons learned in the Health and Nutrition Project (Health I). At the time of Health I's
effectiveness, most of its components were at early stages of preparation, few terms of reference for
consultants and few procurement documents had been prepared, and much of the costing was still
tentative. This led to an extended period of document preparation during implementation and delayed
activities supported by Health I. In contrast, the preparation of the Health Sector Recovery Program has
involved extensive planning and completion of tender documents preparation. Recognition of the
importance of reliable and direct communication with the Bank led to the establishment of All-in-1
communications with the MOH, which are now being upgraded and expanded. Flexibility to reallocate
funds during annual reviews according to implementation performance will also help to improve
implementation and permit greater responsiveness to borrower needs and to the changing national
situation.
21.    Rationale for IDA Support. IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which is being
presented jointly with this operation, stresses the need for investment in human resources as a key
instrument in the country's development strategy. The objective of the CAS is to support the
government's program for poverty reduction through sustainable economic growth. In doing so,
the CAS focuses particularly on the medium term development efforts directed toward human
resources development and economic growth. Economic growth is fundamental to poverty reduction in
Mozambique, because the country is too poor to rely only on redistributive policies for sustained
poverty reduction. How growth is achieved will also affect poverty. In Mozambique, a poverty
reducing growth pattern will involve a shift of resources and opportunities toward human resources
and the rural areas where the poorest populations live. Recent government policy will facilitate this
as the marked decrease in military expenditures releases resources for increases in the recurrent
budgets for health and education services. Moreover, IDA has already provided assistance in the
development of the government's strategy for health and is in a position to provide technical advice which
is not readily available in the country. Finally, it is also important to note that this Program is being used
as an umbrella for the integration of nearly all donor activity in the sector.
22.   Implementation Strategy with Agreed Actions. As condition for board presentation, the
government submitted to IDA a Letter of Sector Development Policy and a draft of the Program
Implementation Manual with a detailed Program Implementation Plan. Disbursement of IDA funds will
be conditioned for Civil Works under the Rural Health Development Fund on (a) establishment and
staffing of a maintenance and construction monitoring unit in each of at least two provincial directorates of
health, which will be the first provinces to directly administer the Fund; and (b) on development of a
client consultation strategy. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the govermnent will: (a)
develop a strategy and plan of operation for reproductive health and carry out a fertility and contraceptive
prevalence survey by June 30, 1997 and furnish the results to IDA for review; (b) develop a strategy and
plan of operation for AIDS control by June 30, 1997; (c) develop guidelines and plan of operation for
medical waste disposal by January 31, 1997; (d) develop guidelines and plan of operation for a
maintenance strategy for equipment and infrastructures of health and training facilities by January 31,
1997; (e) conduct with IDA and other donors comprehensive annual Program Implementation Reviews



- 7 -
aimed at: (i) documenting progress toward objectives; (ii) identifying and removing obstacles to Program
implementation; (iii) re-costing disbursement categories to ensure adequate financing levels; and (iv) re-
progranmming to ensure responsiveness to changes in government priorities, within the objectives of the
Program, submitting to IDA and other donors a progress report containing, inter alia, an annual work
program and supporting budget estimates four weeks prior to these reviews; (f) carry out procurement
using standard bidding and contract documents for all activities financed by IDA and according to
procurement arrangements set out in the Staff Appraisal Report; (g) adopt Program reporting, auditing
and monitoring procedures acceptable to IDA, and the timely preparation and submission of annual
financial reports, and of external audits within nine months from the end of each fiscal year; and (h) allow
the Ministry of Health-designated officials to sign all contracts with a value of US$ 250,000 or lower.
23.    Environmental Aspects. The Program has been determined to be Category C. The MOH will
develop medical waste disposal guidelines to be adopted in every health unit constructed by the Program;
financing for an evaluation of the status of hospital waste disposal is provided in the Policy Development
component. Moreover, proper sanitary conditions will be introduced in every health unit and solar energy
technology in every rural health center/post financed by the Rural Health Development Fund. Since most
health units built by the Program consist of small structures, and since most civil works in large structures
involve rehabilitation rather than expansion, negative environrnental outputs due to construction are
expected to be negligible. No environmental analysis has been prepared for this Program.
24.    Program Objective/Poverty Categories. This operation is included in the Program of Targeted
Interventions. Human resources development is at the core of the poverty reduction strategy for
Mozambique. The health sector strategy proposed for funding under this Program focuses on rural
services provision and preventive and basic health care, which typically serve the poorest segment of the
population. The Program is largely aimed at the reconstruction of the rural health system, particularly in
districts heavily affected by the war. Through the (re)construction of health centers and health posts, the
Health Development Fund of the Program aims to bring health services to the least serviced areas of the
country, which are also the poorest. The emphasis on basic and preventive care, which underscores the
National Health Strategy, ensures that components aimed at improving pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies and health staff training will concentrate on services which are primarily geared to the needs of
the poor.
25.    Participatory Approach. Program preparation was carried out by staff of the MOH with
intensive consultation with donors and NGOs. The value of this consultative process was recognized by all
parties and is presently an integral part of the modus operandi of the MOH. Sub-projects financed under
the Rural Health Development Fund will require the involvement of local communities in the design,
construction and maintenance of infrastructures. Moreover, a strategy for systematic client consultation is
being developed for the whole sector and is a condition for disbursement of IDA funds.
26.    Benefits. The main benefits of the Program will be increased coverage and quality of health
services and increased equity in access to services with a shift of resources toward rural areas and a basic
package of health care. The main beneficiaries of improved basic facilities will be women and children as
the primary users of first level health care through MCH-related programs. MOH staff morale and
performance are expected to benefit from improved training, working conditions and incentives to which
the Program would contribute. Efficiency of the health services system is also expected to improve with
increased skills and the shift of human resources toward rural areas, the base levels of the system, and the
relatively under-served Northern provinces. The Program will generate important external benefits by
assisting the MOH in the coordination and implementation of projects undertaken by all donors. The
Program is designed to achieve high gains in health status with the available resources. Because the
Program contains a diverse set of components to provide improved management, logistical efficiency, and



- 8 -
rehabilitation of facilities, as well as components directly increasing health status, it is not possible to
obtain precise estimates of the economic benefits. The sector strategy, on which the management, logistics
and rehabilitation components are focused, however, is the delivery of an appropriate basic package of
services. An economic analysis of the contents of the basic package demonstrated that they are
appropriate to the burden of disease in Mozambique; for example the package focuses inter alia on the
treatment of children with acute respiratory diseases, malaria and diarrhea diseases which cost only from
US$ 0.15 to US$ 0.75 per life year saved and emphasizes primary and secondary levels of care in rural
areas. The Program is cost effective in reducing the nation's burden of disease.
27.    Risks. The main risk of the Program is the MOH's potential difficulty to implement fully parts of
the sector's extensive program, leading to bottlenecks and inefficient service provision. To address this
risk, the Program has been designed to support the improvement of management capacity in the MOH and
aims to coordinate donors' activities so that implementation constraints are alleviated. Moreover, the
Program's concentration of financing in non-civil works is an attempt to reduce pressure in the area of
infrastructure implementation, which has proved to be one of the main obstacles to the early
implementation of the Health and Nutrition Project. As for human resources development, the MOH has
limited capacity to manage training resources. To mitigate this problem, training activities and capacity
improvements will continue to be carefully timed and outputs modestly estimated based on recent past
experience. Finally, experience from the Health and Nutrition Project has also shown tender document
preparation to be one of the most stringent constraints to the successful implementation of a health project
in Mozambique. In order to assure Program implementation success, from the start, the MOH has
undertaken an unprecedented effort to prepare tender documents for all major procurement packages prior
to Program appraisal.
28.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Notes: /a A comple list of nterventions and their cost effectiveness is provided in page 2 of this schedule.
Detailed tables setting out the assumptions and calculations for effects and costs are summarized in the SAR.
/b Taking into account difficulty of access to a health unit
In addition to the focus on cost effective interventions, the Program is expected to yield substantial
reductions in cost per life year saved. For example, the combined impact of increased coverage and
improved quality of services (including better sector management) is estimated to reduce the cost per
life year saved for treatment of children with respiratory diseases, malaria and diarrhea diseases by
about 55%.
Overall risk: Small. Even if the rate of implementation of the infrastructure expansion program is
50% slower than predicted, the cost per life year saved is still reduced by nearly 20%.
Beneficiaries: Primarily women and children living in the rural areas. The Program will extend
health services coverage to over 1.5 million additional women and one million additional children.
The quality of health services available will be improved for an average of about nine million people
covered by the health system.
Nature of Benefits: The main benefits of the Program will be increased coverage and quality of
health services and increased equity in access to services with a shift of resources toward rural areas
and a basic package of health care.
Key Performance Indicators: Indicators used to monitor Program performance include: (i)
recurrent expenditures in the health sector; (ii) share of health posts adequately staffed; (iii) share of
first level health units adequately stocked with essential drugs; (iv) vaccination coverage for DPT; (v)
equity in services provision among provinces; (vi) infant mortality; (vii) maternal mortality; and (viii)
client satisfaction with health services (page 3 of this schedule provides details on performance
indicators).

Methodology: The years of life lost from premature death were calculated using age specific mortality rates by disease and a life table giving life
expectancy by age cohort. The age specific mortality pattern for SSA used in the WB Global Burden of Disease cxercise was adapted to Mozambique. Key
inputs were tailored to Mozambique were the mortality from HIV seroprevalence. maternity, malaria. nutritional deficiencies, and injuries, in addition to
fertility, and the population age structure. Intervention costa were estimated from project information as well as adaptation of previous studies. Costa were
estimated from separate line items for overhead, wages, equipment, drugs and supplies. Detailed tables setting out the assumptions and calculations for
effecrs and costs are available in the project files and are summarized in the SAR.
This is the [cost perl life year saved for those teated (i.e. not taking into account difficulty of access to a health unit).

*The equity index calculates the ratio of availability and accessibility of basic services in the best and least served populations within each
province. The value 8 represents a national average of the provincial values. The indicator allows the program to focus on the provinces with the
highest inequity. The national target for the year 2000 is still being discussed within the MOH.

Disbursement Performance
The Bank's portfolio in Mozambique is fairly large and includes 24 ongoing operations.
While some improvement in project implementation has been recorded, the Government's
limited capacity to implement projects remains a major issue. One of the issues observed in
project implementation is slow disbursement, i.e., slower than originally anticipated in the SARs.
The overall disbursements (as of September 30, 1995) were about 32% of the approved credits.
The major generic problems in disbursements are (a) procedures at the Bank of Mozambique
and at the Ministry of Finance; and (b) lack of trained procurement and disbursement staff at
implementing agencies. Disbursements are also slowed by deficiencies in project design
including overoptimistic assumptions about implementation capacity. To remedy these
problems, a number of procurement and disbursement workshops have been carried out and
Bank disbursement and procurement officers have visited Mozambique periodically to help
improve processes at implementing agencies and at the Bank of Mozambique and the Ministry of
Finance. The only IDA credit to the health sector (Health and Nutrition Project) was restructured
in 1994 and is now performing well, having disbursed about 60% of the credit.
