MAURITIUS
MAURITIUS TEA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROJECT
SUt4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the development of tea
production in MAuritius. Under the project about 5,600 arpents (5,840 acres)
of state-owned Crown Land would be planted to tea and leased to some 3,730
smallholders. The project would be the Bank Group's first operation for
agriculture in TIlauritius. Project production, by 1983, would amount to
about 38% of Mauritius' total tea production assuming no further new plant-
ings. Most project tea would be exported, largely to South Africa, but
exports would constitute only about 0.5% of world trade.
ii.       Mauritius has a high rate of unemployment and a single crop
economy. Sugar accounts for approximately 95% of the island's cultivated
area as well as of exports. lea has become the second crop and affords one
of the few opportunities for diversifying agriculture, for increasing ex-
port earnings, and for creating more permanent employment opportunities.
iii.      The project would be the second phase of Mauritius' smallholder
tea development program which Government started in 1962. The proposed
credit of US$5.2 million would be disbursed over a six-year period commenc-
ing in 1971. Under the project a Mauritius Tea Development Authority (M4TDA)
would be created, responsible for clearing, planting and leasing smallholdings
and for extension, processing, and export marketing services. The project
would include th* construction of two tea factories. Project plantings
would reach maturity by 1983.
iv.       Project costs are estimated at US$7.0 million, of which about
US$1.6 million would be for creating, staffing and equipping MIJDA, about USQ4
million for tea planting and about US$1.4 million for two tea factories.
Direct investments in MTDA offices, stores, equipment, tea plantings, and
tea factories account for nearly 90% of project costs. IDA would finance
US$5.2 million (74% of total project costs) representing the estimated
foreign exchange component of US$2.4 million and US$2.8 million local costs;
Government would provide the remaining US$1.8 million. Procurement would
be by international bidding where orders and contracts are of a sufficient
size to justify it, and goods and services procured in this way are estimated
to have a value of US$2.1 million.
v.        MTDA would manage the project, under the authority of the Minister
of Agriculture. MTDA would extend its services to existing smallholders
established under the first phase of Government's tea development program
(1962-1970) as well as to project tenants. Existing tenants production
would be processed mainly by an established Government-controlled tea
factory. The new project factories would be owned by MTDA, but initially
operated by managing agents appointed by MITDA. Project funds would be
passed on to MTDA as an interest-free loan repayable over 20 years after a
6-1/2 year grace period.

IAURITIUS
IMAURITIUS TEA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The ilauritius Government has requested IDA help to finance
further development of its tea industry.  The Bank's Permanent Mission to
Eastern Africa (PMEA) and Agricultural Development Service (ADS) nelped
Government to prepare the proposed Tea Development Authority Project, which
would be the Bank Group's first operation in agriculture in Mauritius.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
composed of lessrs. i.H.S. Haasjes and C.H. Chung (IDA), and P. Gacoka and
iD. Taylor (Consultants) which visited ilauritius in May/June 1970.  Mlessrs.
A.R. Whyte and u. Elz (IDA) spent about a week with the mission and Mr. h.
Lloyd (ADS) was in the field during appraisal.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      >Iauritius has an area of 720 sq mi, and lies 20° south of the
Equator, about 500 miles east of Madagascar (Map 1). Annual rainfall ranges
from about 900 mm in the Southwest to as much as 5,000 mm in parts of the
interior. Cyclones are conmon in the period December/March; fortunately,
these rarely cause major destruction (see Annex 1).
2.02      In 1968, GDP amounted to US$150 million (Rs 827 million), equi-
valent to US$190 per capita, of which agriculture contributed 31%. Tile
predominant crop is sugarcane, and in 1969 exports of sugar and molasses,
valued at Rs 336 million (US$61 million), accounted for 92% of exports of
goods (see Annex 2, Table 1).
2.03      'tauritius has two serious problems:  population pressure, and
a single crop economy. Population in 1969 was about 800,000 and is estimated
to be growing at 2.3% annually; 43% of the population is under 15 years of
age. Overall population density is 1,100 per sq mi, making Mauritius one
of the most densely populated countries in the world.  About 71%o of the
population is of Asian, and 29% of duropean, African, and mixed descent.
The unemployment rate is about 22%, and Government has introduced relief
work to provide jobs for three days a week. Sugar provides the bulk of agri-
cultural work and, through processing, 45% of total industrial employment.
Additional employment opportunities can be created in manufacturing but
possibilities are limited to export industries because of the small domestic
market.



-2-
B. Aricultura1 Sector
2.04      Of the cultivated area of about 257,000 A, 94%' or 242,000 A 1/ is
planted with sugarcane; about 10,000 A (4X) are planted witlh tea and some
j,000 A (2;o) with crops for domestic consumption (Annex 2, fable 2).  Govern-
ment omns about U,000 A of tea on Crown Land; 21 sugar estates about 111,00u
A; 6 tea estates about 1,700 A; and private farmers about 140,000 A.
2.05      'lauritius exports its sugar under the International Sugar Agree-
ment. In recent years, sugar production las been around uOU,uuU tons
annually. Sugar is profitable and is unlikely to be replaced, but the
dependence on sugar is dangerous.  Tea, already the second crop, affords
scope for diversification since it can be grown on soils unsuitable for
sugarcane or other crops, is labor-intensive and provides a good return.
The scope for other agricultural development is limited to irrigation projects.
iowever, investment requirements for creating employment opportunities in
irrigation are substantially higher than for tea: is 31,500 per job is
estimated for the proposed Northern Irrigation Scheme 2/ and Rs 17,7UJ for
the Western Irrigation Scheme 2/, compared with about Rs 8,000 for tea and
about Rs 10,000 for manufacturing.
C. The Tea Industry
2.06      Mauritius has grown tea since the late 19th century.  lea exports
started in 1954, increased to 2.4 million lb in 1965 and reached b million
lb in 1969 with a value of Rs 14.6 million (USU2.6 million, 4,O of export
earnings in 1969). 8,600 A are planted to tea: private estates own about
1,700 A, private farmers about 1,300 A, and Government about j,60 A of tea
on Crown Land.  Of this, 2,200 A are leased to 12 large tea growers, 1,30U A
to 432 smallholders, and a further 2,100 A are being cultivated by Govertn-
ment prior to distribution.
2.07      Government aims to have 30,000 A under tea by 1980.  Taking into
account the proposed project, some 15,000 A will have been planted by 1973.
Consequently, to reach its target, Government thereafter would tiave to plant
about 2,000 A each year. This program appears over-ambitious, and a total
tea acreage of about 25,000 A would be more in line with projected export
possibilities.
1/   1 arpent (A) is 1.343 acres.
2/   i'he ULsDP Land and Water Resources Survev (Report WS 95974, December 4,
1969) estimated the economic rate of return for the siortlierni Sc'-ieme at
5-6;o and for the Western Scheme at 9.5%.



Tea Land Developent and Cultivation Practices
2.08      Most Crown Land suitable for tea is under pine forest up to 20 years
old. Before clearing, all usable timber is removed by private contractors.
The land is then cleared mechanically (see Annex 3). Land clearing and tea
planting programs have fallen behind schedule in recent years due to the
inefficiency of the Sugar Planters' Mechanical Pool which provides the equip-
ment for this work.
2.09      The management of Government nurseries is only fair, and the out-
put of plantable seedlings (stumps) is low, due mainly to inadequate shade,
poor location and planting of non-pregerminated seed. However, through
improved methods, stump output should double. Seed production is inadequate
to meet the present demand for tea seed, and Mauritius must import tea seed
from Kenya and Tanzania.
Yields
2.10      Despite poor stands and indifferent maintenance, yields are
surprisingly good and reflect excellent tea growing conditions. Plucking
standards are reasonably good. Five commercial estates in and around the
project area lhave averaged annual yields of more than 1,400 lb of made tea/A
over the last four years (see Annex 4, Table 1). At the Bois Cheri estate,
tenants cultivating a total of 700 A in one A plots under close supervision
averaged over 2,000 lb made tea/A (about 2,080 lb/acre) in 1969. These
yields compare favorably with current national averages of about 1,100 lb
made tea/acre in Kenya and Hlalawi, and 1,350 lb in Uganda (see Annex 4,
Table 2).
2.11      Ihe average pattern of yield development between years three
(start of production) and ten (maturity) is given in Annex 4, Table 3.  Yields
of tea planted at stake (i.e. seeds sown directly in the field) are estimated
to average 1,350 lb of made tea/A at maturity, and those of tea planted from
nurseries, 1,500 lb.  Yield distribution is given in Annex 4, Table 4.
Iactories
2.12      l4auritius has eight tea factories (six owned by private companies)
with a total annual capacity of 9 million lb made tea (see Annex 4, Table
5). One (Chartreuse) is owned and operated by a cooperative and one
(Dubreuil) is operated by Government but was financed by the Sugar Millers
Association through the Tea Manufacture (Sugar Millers) Ltd., who receive
bt interest on the capital they have invested.
Institutions
2.13      The Tea Division of the Ministry of Agriculture hias five sections
responsible for land clearing and preparation; nurseries and planting; tea
maintenance; extension and other support services; and research. The
Division has 24 technical and professional staff, including 13 senior agri-
cultural staff, and a permanent labor force of about 2,000. In addition,



it uses relief workers paid by the Ministry of Labor: 1,850 year-round and
1,300 in the peak plucking season. however, this arrangement is not satis-
factory since large numbers of indifferent and undisciplined labor tend to
be counterproductive (see para 6.05).
2.14      Tea Research is poor.  Insufficient attention hAs been paid to
the selection of high yielding and good quality clones (see PAnex *).  Foliar
analysis techniques for determining optimum fertilizer use i4ve been
introduced only recently. A recent reorganization of the Wooton 'lea
Research Station should result in better directed research.
2.15      The Tea Control Board (TCB), established in 1959, exercises
general control of the industry. The Director of Agriculture (CiLairman)
and the Deputy Financial Secretary are ex-officio Board members, and six
are tea planters and manufacturers appointed by tihe Alinister of Agriculture.
TCB is financed by annual grants from Government.
2.16      W4hile TCB has wide powers, including imposing cesses on production
and licensing domestic and foreign sales of tea (see Annex b), its main
function is to set producer prices for green leaf.  'ICB could, and should,
act to resolve a number of issues, including quality control; better
allocation of domestic and export sales quotas aipong factories; and chaanging
tea workers' official holiday which is now in the peak plucking period
(December/January).
2.17      Cooperatives.   lauritius has 4JQ4t 306 primary cooperatives
with a membership of more tnian  A)fPx (e§ Atw   7).  The coopelatives,
which are generally well run and receive assistance fromp officers of the
Ministry of Cooperatives, engage in crop financing, savings, retailing,
transport and marketing. Ten cooper4tives 4re concerned with tea of which
five are active (see Annex 4, Table 6c).  To cover operating costs, the
cooperatives deduct, on average, 2% of tlie value of the leaf they 4rade.
Credit
2.18      Smallholders' seasonal credit is provided by the >Zauritius Coop-
erative Central Bank (MCCB, see Annex 8), which channels its funds through
farmers' cooperatives. Maximum seasonal credit to smallholders is is 400/A
of which Rs 200 is for fertilizer, Rs 50 for land rent, and Rs 150 in cash
to cover living expenses in the period following pruning whien farmers lhave
little or no income from their tea. Coopgratives borrow at 7-1/2,A. interest
from 'CCB (1/2% higher than the rate at which .ICCB borrows from the Gentra
Bank) and on-lend at between 8 and 10%. Repayments and interest are deducted
mandatorily from sales proceeds.
Marketing
2.19      Smallholders carry green leaf in plucking baskets to cooperative
collecting stations. Leaf is then bggged and transported in individually
identifiable containers by hlired trucks to the factories wlhere quantity and
quality are recorded.  'rhe grower is debited with transport costs.  Tue



factory makes monthly payments to MCCB, and the net proceeds are credited to
the cooperatives, who make payments to growers.
2.20      Presently about 20% of Mauritius' tea production is sold on the
domestic market at a premium price (about Rs 2.60/lb made tea ex-factory
compared with an average of Rs 2.20/lb ex-factory for export tea). TCB
assigns quotas to individual factories on the basis of volume processed
and the period over which the factory has been in operation. however, some
factories sell low quality tea to merchants who blend this with higher
quality tea bought under the quota system and sell the blend on the domes-
tic market. To eliminate this, Government plans centralized tea blending,
but factory operators are opposed since, at a high cost in advertising,
they have created a distinct domestic market for some 26 different brands
of tea.
0.  Mauritius Tea Development AuthoritV  MTDA)
2.21      Present institutional arrangements are inadequate for Government's
smallholder program, and Government has created the Mauritius Tea Development
Authority (MTDA), to which it is transferring all Tea Division activities
concerned with smallholders on Crown Land. MTDA will be responsible for
planting Crown Land with tea, leasing developed tea land to smallholders and
subsequently providing supervision and support services as well as processing
facilities. Further details of MTDA are given in Chapter VI and Annex 9.
The Ministry of Agriculture would continue to provide extension services to
other tea growers and to carry out research with MTDA.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A.  Location and Pulation
3.01      The project would be carried out on 18 blocks of Crown Land on
the central plateau close to the towns of Curepipe, Vacoas, and Quatre
Bornes (see Map 2). Lying between 1,000 and 2,000 ft above sea level, the
topography is undulating with many stretches of flat land occasionally
broken by steep slopes.
3.02      The project area's rural population is mainly of Asian origin and
made up of small farmers and farm laborers. Unemployment among the rural
Asian population is substantially lower than among the Creole members of the
area's urban population. The number of unemployed men in the project area
far exceeds the number that could be employed under the proposed project.



B. Climate and Soils
3.03      Annual rainfall varies from 2,500 to 5,000 mm, and is well dis-
tributed with an average of 220 to 300 wet days annually. Rainfall at the
lWooton Tea Research Station hias averaged 3,650 mm annually over the last 17
years. Temperatures average 23°C maximum and 16C minimum; relative
humidity is high, averaging 85;..  In summer (December-M.arch), cyclones occur,
but while these cause loss of tea foliage, setbacks to production are onlly
temporary.
3.04      Soils are of volcanic origin, acidic, and ihave a silty clay loam
topsoil; the combination of soils and climate is very uell suited to tea pro-
duction.  'lost of the project area is now under pine forest and uses otLier
thlan for tea are restricted. Livestock grazing is a possibility, out dis-
ease problems limit suclh development at present.
C. Communications
3.05      The area is well served by black top roads interlinked by a
dense network of earth roads and tracks. Distances from existing tea fields
to factories average no more than five miles. fi'e peak season for Lea
transport (December to April) complements the sugarcane peak season (June-
November). Tihere is no shortage of transport. Tile distance from tea fac--
tories to port averages 20 miles. Bus service in the area is excellent.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project would be the second Phase of Niauritius' smallholder
tea development program, and would add 5,600 A of smallholder tea to 3,800
A planted during the first phase, 1952-1970 (Annex 4, Table 7).  Proect
development would require a six-year period (1971/72-1976/77), and its
principal components would be:
(a) creating, staffing, and equipping a "lauritius Tea Llevelopment
Authority. This would include construction of offices, stores,
and leaf collecting stations; and procurement of the vehicles,
earthmoving equipment, tractors and trailers needed for land
preparation and tea planting as well as velhicles and motorcy-
cles required by management and field development staff,
(b) implementing the following .ITDA program:
-    planting tea on 1,100 A of Crown Land cleared and pre-
pared by Government prior to the itart of the project,



-7-
-    clearing, preparing and planting with tea a further
4,500 A of Crown Land;
-    maintaining the 5,600 A of project plantings for about
42 months after planting;
-    leasing the 5,600 A, through some 15 cooperatives estab-
lished for the purpose, to about 3,730 smallholders in
1.5 A lots per smallholder at the end of the maintenance
period;
(c) constructing two tea factories in the project area, thereby in-
creasing the area's annual processing capacity from 3 million lb
of made tea to 9 million lb; and
(d) installing laboratory facilities for the chemical leaf analyses
essential for efficient fertilizer use.
4.02      M',TDA would manage the project, and purchase, own and operate the
facilities and equipment required for planting and maintaining the 5,600 A
of tea. Consultants would design the two project tea factories and managing
agents would supervise construction and subsequently operate them, and
market all tea from MTDA smallholdings. IACCB would provide seasonal agri-
cultural credit to smallholders leasing tea established by HTDA under the
project. Organizational arrangements are described in Chapter VI.
B. Detailed Features
4.03      ProjLt Administration.  TIDA neadquarters, comprising an office
and store, would be constructed at Wooton, and six stores would be built in
the field -- one for each 1,000 A block of tea.  About 22 leaf collecting
stations would be set up -- one for every 250 A. A total of 15 vehicles,
24 motorcycles and 2 tractors with trailers, inclusive of replacements
during the development period, would be purchased for the use of TTDA staff
engaged on the project (Annex 10, Table 1); such staff would increase from
161 in 1971, to 232 in 1972, thereafter declining due principally to transfers
to XiTDA's extension section, or to MTDA post-project tea development pro-
grams. Details of staff requirements are given in Chapter VI and Annex 9,
Table 1.
4.04      ClearingR d Plantin.  Under the project 1,100 A of tea would be
planted in 1971/72, 2,000 A in 1972/73, and 2,500 A in 1973/74. Allowing
15/o of the area for field roads, paths and uncultivable areas, about b,500
A would have to be cleared for planting 5,600 A. The 1,300 A needed for
1971/72 plantings has been cleared. IITDA would clear 2,300 A in 1971 for
1972/73 planting, and 2,850 A in 1972 for the 1973/74 season. Land
preparation would include the construction of field roads which would link
with the earth and black top roads of the project area.  Details of land
clearing and preparation imiethods, and of tea planting techniques are given
in Annex 3.



- 8 -
4.05      The 1971/72 planting target of 1,100 A is determined by the num-
ber of stumps that would be available from the 162 A of existing Tea jivi-
sion nurseries. New nurseries -- 178 A in 1971 and 175 A in 1972 -- would
be established to provide stumps for the 1972/73 and 1973/74 programs.
Good technical supervision and improved siting of nurseries would result
in a higher proportion of plantable seedlings, and thus a reduction in
the ratio of nursery to planted area. Presently the outturn of nursery
seedlings is only 40%, but this is anticipated to rise to 50% in 1972,
and to 60% in 1973.
4.06      Iodern tea planting practice is to use selected clones, but
Mauritius has no fully proven clones (see para 2.14), and even were the
testing to start in 1971, results would not allow their use until 1975.
Fortunately, however, yields of seedling tea in ,fauritius are in linie with,
or even higher than, those of clonal tea in other countries (para 2.1UJ).
Mauritius has about 70 A of tea seed gardens and these are capable of
producing 50-60,000 lb of seed annually 1/ as against thie about 105,000 lb
needed for the project (see Annex 3, para 8). Consequently, about 5U,000 lb
of seed annually would be imported from Kenya or Tanzania in 1971 and 1972.
There are no restrictions on the export of tea seed from these two countries.
4.07      Tea Factories.  Green leaf from existing smallholdings in the
project area will continue to be processed at the Dubreuil Factory where
capacity is currently being doubled to 3 million lb of made tea (15 million
lb green leaf equivalent, see Annex 11, Table 1). However, increases in
production will necessitate construction of a new factory with a capacity
of 1.5 million lb by 1973/74. This would be the first of the two factories
to be constructed under the project. When project plantings come into
production in 1974/75, the capacity of this factory would be increased to
3 million lb. By 1975/76, I4ITDA would need to construct a second project
factory; this would operate at a capacity of 1.5 million lb up to 1976/77,
when capacity would be expanded to 3 million lb. locations of both factories
are determined by the planting prograws and shown on Map 2. Annex 11 shows
that the two project factories would providp adequate processing capacity
until 1978; thereafter, assuming no further plantings, ;4TDA would need to
construct two more factories -- one in 1978 (3 million lb capacity), and
the other in 1981 (1.5 million lb capacity). Assurances have been obtained
that the capacity of the Dubreuil factory will be increased to 3 million lb
by June 1972.
4.08      MTDA would employ consultants to design the factories, and during
negotiations assurances have been obtained that both the consultants and
their terms of reference would be approved by IDA. Factory construction
would be supervised by the agents appointed by MlTDA to manage project
factories for at least the duration of the project development period.
1/   Itn Mauritius tea seeds are collected from February tlIrouglh April.  It
ti ANilUmed that ')0. of pote*ntial seed prodluctiotn would be lost due to
ovcl. lloX di"PInPre



a
4.09      Laboratory E6guipmeat.  Leaf analysis equipment procured under tile
project would be UTDA property, but installed at the Sugar Industry Re-
search Institute (SIRI) at Reduit which has been carrying out analyses for
the Tea Division. SIRI has staff competent to operate the equipment, and
would provide analytical services at no cost to MTDA.
4.10      Leases.  The Mlinistry of Cooperatives would assist MITDA in form-
ing cooperatives of the some 250 tenants selected for each block of 350 to
400 A. Cooperatives would be formed after tenants are selected (para 6.05).
Cooperatives would lease blocks from MTDA, and sublease individual lots
to their members. As now, tenants would lease these holdings initially
for ten years; such leases would be renewable for a similar period. Rents
increasing from Rs 1 per arpent in the first year of lease to Rs 50 in year
six (see Annex 12) would be paid by MCCB to MTDA and debited against the
individual tenant's credit account (see para 2.18). A condition of
effectiveness is that the forms of lease and sublease setting out fully the
rights and obligations of MTDA, cooperatives, and tenants shall have been
agreed with IDA.
4.11      Credit.  Tenants would need credit to cover the cost of fertili-
zers, land rent and, in some cases pruning expenses. The arrangements
described in paragraph 2.18 would continue, and during negotiations, assur-
ances have been obtained that the necessary credit would be provided by
MCCB.
4.12      Fertilizer and Equipment.  As now, MCCB would bulk orders for
fertilizer. Project cooperatives would collect and distribute it. Most
existing cooperatives have small stores, and new cooperatives would use
the seven M4TDA stores to be constructed under the project. Farmers would
pay cash for farm tools and equipment, estimated to average Rs 20 annually
(see Annex 13).
4.13      Tenant liousing and Social Infrastructure.  The project does not
provide for tenant housing, as most tenants are expected to come from near-
by towns and as condition of tenancy would be that the potential tenant
lives within a four-mild radius of his plot. However, most of the unemployed
in the project area are Creoles, who are less drawn to agricultural work
than Asians, and it may be necessary to attract Asians from other areas.
Government has undertaken a program of resettling part of the unemployed
rural population from the North to the South, and has stated that it will
take any necessary steps including construction of tea villages, to
attract project smallholders.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
5.01      Project cost estimates and their foreign exchange component are
shown in the following table, and elaborated further in Annex 10. Contin-
gencies of 10% have been allowed for buildings, equipment, vehicles, and



- 10 -
the operating costs of heavy equipment, and of 15,yo for asset replacements.
Costs of heavy equipment and factory machinery exclude import duties, from
which Government would exempt the project. Project costs include tUe full
development costs of tea plantings until taken over by tenants. and, in
addition, 1975 and 1976 pruning costs for 1971 and 1972 plantings, respectively.
Project costs include HTDA salaries and other administration costs during
the development period.

B. Project Financing
5.02      It is proposed that IDA make a credit of US$5.2 million (75% of
total costs) to meet project foreign exchange costs (US$2.38 million, 34%
of total project costs) and 60% of local costs (US$2.8 million). Remaining
project costs (US$1.8 million) would be met by Government. The financing
plan assumes that IDA would finance 100% of expatriate salaries costs; 83%
of farm development costs; and the foreign exchange element of remaining
project cost:s. The plan is summarized in the following table:

5.03      The proposed IDA credit would be made on standard terms to the
Government of Mauritius. Proceeds of the credit together with Government's
contribution would be passed on to MTDA as an interest-free loan repayable
in 20 equal annual installments commencing January 1, 1978, the end of
the development per^iod. The total amount of retroactive financing would be
up to US$130,000, comprising US$20,000 for expatriate salaries, US$25,000
for polythene sleeves for seedlings, US$10,000 for buildings, and US$75,000
for heavy equipment. These amounts are included in the proposed credit.
The land clearing equipment to be financed is being procured in line with
the Bank's "Guidelines on Procurement".

C. Procurement and Disbursement
*.04      Procurement of fertilizers, tea factories, land clearing equip-
ment, tractors, trailers, vehicles, and laboratory equipment (totalling
about US$2.1 million) would be by international competitive bidding. Con-
struction of 'rTDA office, stores, and leaf collecting stations, valued at
about US$22,200, and goods (such as office furniture and equipment, and
motorcycles) valued at about US$ol,60J would be procured locally. ille
value of any one contract would not exceed uS$lU,00U and thiis size does
lot justify international bidding.  G'overnment would follow the staiidard IDA
procedures for local procurement.
5.05      disbursemeLits of the proposed credit would be agaLnst.
(a)  100', of the cif costs of Lea factory equipment, vehiicles,
tractors, trailers, laboratory equipment, land clearing
equipment, and of the costs of expatriate staff salaries,
about uS*l.5 million;
(b)  83Z of field development costs, about US$d3.3 million, and
(c) 41^ of the cost of buildings (including factory buildings),
office equipment, -iDA operating costs and minor factory
equipment, about US~U.25 mi.llion.
A^bout US$202,000 would be unallocated. Disbursement of thie credit would
be made against import documents and tippropriate records certified by
.!TJA and Government. A detailed disbutsetuent schedule is at AUnex 14.
5.06      It is recommended that any sutplus funds remaining in the IOA
credit account by the project's completioff date should 'oe cancelled.
D. Accounts and Audit
5.07      !ITDA would handle all project funds, which Government would
provide quarterly in advance, and keep separate accounts for the project.
Assutances have been obtained duting negotiAtions that, during the develop-
ment period, MTDA will employ a firm of chatteted accountants acceptable to
IDA to set up its accounts, train accounts staff and check accounting
procedures at least twice a year. Assutances have also been obtained that
annual reports audited by a fitm of auditors satisfactory to IDA would ue
submitted to IDA not later than six months after the close of iTDA's
financial year.



% I
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Hauritius Tea Development Authority
6.01      MTIA legislation satisfactory to IDA has been enacted.  MTDA is
a statutory body; its Board is appointed by the Minister of Agriculture and
comprises representatives of Government, cooperatives and the Chamber of Ag-
riculture. The composition of the Board and an outline of 114TDA's powers,
duties, and obligations are at Annex 9.
6.02      Government has transferred the Crown Land required for the project
on a 99-year lease to MTDA, and MTDA would lease developed land to coopera-
tives. A condition of effectiveness is that Government rights under existing
leases to cooperatives shall have been vested in MTDA and assurances were
received during negotiations that no changes would be made in the arrangements
withiout IDA's approval.
B. Staffing and Training
6.03      Annex 9 gives 1TDA headquarters and field staff requirements by
posts and years. During project development, field staff would build up
to a maximum of 37 professional and 22 administrative personnel, and 176
other staff, mainly foremen and drivers. After the development period
numbers would be adjusted in line with post-project development. MTDA
should have no difficulty in recruiting and training personnel; most of
the agricultural officers needed would be transferred from the Tea Division
to MITDA, and MTDA would recruit young secondary school leavers as field as-
sistants. During the planting and maintenance period field assistants would
receive on-the-job training, and by its end would be qualified for extension
duties. 'lle final extension ratio would be one field assistant to about
200 to 250 farmers growing some 300 to 400 A of tea. This coverage should
allow each smallholder to be visited at least once a month.
6.04      Due to the shortage of experienced Mauritians expatriates would
fill the key MTDA posts. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations
that during the development period appointments to the TfDA posts of General
Ianager, Field Hanager, and .'ursery Manager would be made after prior
consultation with IDA. The General Manager has been provided by ADS, and no
difficulties are expected in filling the other positions.
C. Smallholder Selection and Discipline
6.05      The criteria for smallholder selection given in Annex 15 were
agreed during negotiations; an essential qualification would be that



- 14 -
tenants would either live within four miles of their allotment or provide
evidence that they can do so.  MTDA would select tenants from its labor
force. During the first three years of their lease tenants would be
employed by MTDA when not attending to their holdings (para 7.14).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that MTDA would not be
subject to Government direction in employing relief or oth-er workers.
6.06      Tenants failing to abide by HTDA rules and the conditions of
their leases could be evicted by their cooperatives. Eviction procedures
are set out under existing Cooperative Societies legislation. The form
of tenant's lease contains provisions for the direct dismissal by MTDA of
unsatisfactory tenants not suitably dealt with by their cooperatives.
D. Marketing and Processing
6.07      Leaf Collection.  Present procedures for leaf collection and
delivery (para 2.19) would continue. however, cooperative leaf officers are
not presently authorized to reject substandard leaf at collecting stations,
although they may notify the factory leaf inspector that certain parcels
should be returned to the farmer for resorting.  This procedure is cumber-
some and lowers tea quality, and during negotiations assurances have oeen
obtained from Government that MTDA officers at collecting stations would
be authorized to reject smallholder leaf, or request its resorting.
6.08      Processing.  The agents appointed to manage the project factories
(para 4.08) would provide an experienced tea maker as manager of the first
MTDA factory; he would train a Mauritian assistant manager, who would
subsequently assume responsibility for managing the second MTDA factory
which would be constructed toward the end of the project development
period; all other factory personnel would be employed by MTDA. During
negotiations assurances have been obtained that the managing agents and,
during the project development period, factory managers would be appointed
with IDA's concurrence, and that the terms of reference of the agents,
and in particular the arrangements for inspection visits, would be agreed
with IDA.
6.09      The Dubreuil factory, which would process part of the small-
holders' leaf, is owned and operated by Tea Manufacture (Sugar Millers)
Ltd., but Government meets the factory's current operating deficits (the
accumulated deficit at June 1970 was about Rs 1 million). A condition of
effectiveness of the credit would be signature of a new agreement between
Government, the Sugar Millers and MTDA, under which UITDA would assume
Government's responsibility for leaf deliveries, extension services and
other functions now carried out by the Tea Divisiom, and would handle all
sales of smalllholder tea. Assurances have been obtained during iuegotiations
I hat 'ov-ernnwevt wotuld cont itnie to meet an"t operatinig deficits.



-- 15 -
6.10      'Harketing.  TCB would appoint MIDA as agents to handle the
marketing of MITDA smallholder tea.
VII.  YIELDS. PRODUCTTON, MARKETS   PRICES AYD FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
7.01      Yields.  Tea yields in Hlauritius are good (para 2.10), and as
shown in.Annex 4, Table 1, existing reasonably well managed plantings yield
about 1,40() lb of made tea/A at maturity. For report calculations it is
estimated that project plantings would yield 1,500 lb/A at maturity (see
Annex 4, Table 3).
7.02      Production.  Production of existing smallholdings under MITDA
would amount to an estimated 2.7 million lb of made tea in year one of the
project and to 5.2 million lb at maturity (1980), while project plantings
would start production in 1974 (275,000 lb), increasing to 8.4 million lb
per annum by 1983, making a total MTDA annual production of 13.6 million lb
of made tea by 1983.
B. Markets and Prices
7.03      Prospective markets and prices for Mauritius tea are discussed
in Annex 16; they depend on: (a) local consumption; (b) relative exports
to South Africa and the United Kingdom; and (c) whether an International
Tea Agreement is concluded.
7.04      Uomestic consumption is forecast at 2.3 million lb in 1980 and
the price is expected to remain at the current level of Rs 2.60/lb ex-
factory.  ±xports are estimated at about 20 million lb in 1980, assuming
no further expansion in acreage and total production of about 22 million
lb.  fhe FAO Study Group on 'Tea, coordinating tea marketing action
internationally, has been informed of thie project, and has raised no objec-
tions.
7.05      The main market for Mtauritius tea since 1966 has been South
Africa, which in 1968/69 took 60% of Mauritius tea exports and 75%
(4.1 million lb) in 1969/70. It is estimated that the South African
market can absorb between 12 and 15 million lb of Mauritius tea. That
market presently provides two advantages for 1lauritius tea compared with
the United Kingdom -- lower transportation and marketing costs and nigher
selling prices.  However, since it is uncertain how long the price advantage
will last, only the transport cost premium -- about Rs 0.22/lb -- has been
taken into account in project forecasts.
7.06      Conclusion of an International Tea Agreement is not expected to
affect the quantity of MIauritius tea exports, but, assuming Mauritius tea
prices follow world market trends, it would mean an increase of about

Rs 0.16 to 0.19/lb in export prices.  Thus, ex factory prices for sa,les to
London would be Rs 1.96/lb rather than Rs 1.80/lb and for sales to South
Africa Rs 2.19 instead of Rs 2.00/lb.
7.07      Based on the above forecasts and the probability of their occur-
rence, if Mauritius sells 12 million lb in 1980 to South Africa  the
weighted ex-factory price in 1980 is estimated to average Rs 2.05/lb. This
is the main price assumed in project forecasts. Alternatively, if South
Africa increases its share of Mauritius tea exports to 15 million lb
with the rest going to the London market, the weighted average price would
be Rs 2.08/lb. The lowest price, based on all exports being sent to
London and failure to negotiate a Tea Agreement, would be Rs 1.80/lb.
C.   TDPA's Financial Position
7.08      Statements of MTDA's estimated income and expenditure and sources
and application of funds for the years ending June 30, 1972 2000, and
forecast balance sheets for 1972 to 1977, are shown in Annex 9. these
separate the results of project and non project activities.
7.09      Assuming an ex-factory price of Rs 2.05/lb, MTDA would show an
operating surplus from the project in each year except 1973/74 and a cumula-
tive surplus throughout the period. By 1984/85, the net annual project sur-
plus, would reach about Rs 3.2 million. The non project surplus would
increase from about Rs 104,000 in 1971/72 to Rs 1.4 million in 1980/81.
7.10      The statement of sources and applications of funds shows that MTDA
would be able to meet repayments on the Government loan out of project
surplus and retain adequate cash for depreciation and reserves. By drawing
on reserves it would also be able to finance the further factory expansion
required after the project period. The surplus from non--project operations
would cover depreciation and reserves and the payments to Government noted in
para 7.13 below.
7.11      No value will be placed on existing smallholder schemes trans-
ferred to MTDA, but buildings, vehicles and other Tea Division assets will
be transferred at a value to be agreed between Government and MTDA. This
valuation will be completed by July 1, 1971 and in the meantime the estimat-
ed balance sheets show only MITDA's assets and liabilities arising out of
the project plus the results of operations on existing schemes. By June
30, 1977 total assets are estimated at about Rs 42 million and accumulated
surplus at about Rs 3 million.
7.12      To ensure that MTDA is able to meet all operating costs, provide
for adequate reserves and repay the Government loan for the project it
will have to maintain a margin between the ex factory price for made- tea
and the green leaf price paid by producers, Assurances were obtained



- 17 -
during negotiations that a minimum margin would be maintained for all
smallholder tea which would be sufficient to cover:
(a) operating costs including straight line depreciation
based on lives of 30 years on buildings, 15 years on
factory machinery, 6 years on cars, lorries, tractors
and 4-wheel drive vehicles; 10 years on trailers, 20
years on implements, and 4 years on motorcycles;
(b) an allocation to a reserve fund of li/lb green leaf
purchased, to cover restitution for cyclone damage and
other contingencies; and
(c) an annual surplus equivalent to not less than 2#/lb of
green leaf purchased through December 31, 1974 and 54/lb
thereafter.
7.13      Annex 9 shows that  assuming an ex factory price of Rs 2.05/lb for
made tea and a producer price of Rs 0.23/lb for green leaf, these surpluses
would be obtained in each year except 1973 and 1977. In the latter years
slightly lower surpluses are shown, but it is probable that ex-factory
prices forecast in this report for these early years are conservative and
that the required margin would be achieved. From 1978 onwards, the
forecast surplus would exceed the required minimum and could be used for
additional payments to smallholders, retained by MTDA to finance further
expansion, or for additional payments to Government. In forecasting the
effect on Government's budgetary position (para 7.12), loan repayments
only have been assumed from project operations. Payments from non-project
operations are assumed to be equivalent through 1976/77 to the cash
surplus after setting aside depreciation and reserves, and thereafter to
50/lb green leaf.
D. Farmers' Benefits
7.14      A typical farm budget for a 1-1/2 A holding is given in Annex 13.
Assuming a producer price of Rs 0.23/lb of green leaf (the maximum MTDA
would be able to pay based on an ex-factory price of Rs 2.05/lb and the re-
quired margin to cover operating costs and surplus), a tenant's annual cash
income would increase from about Rs 1,340 in the first year of his lease to
more than Rs 2,000 at maturity. Supplementary income from employment with
MTIDA during the first three years of lease is included (see para 6.05).
7.15      The projected producer price is lower than the minimum set by TCB
for 1970/71 at Rs 0.26/lb. Assurances would be obtained during negotiations
that IDA would be informed of TCB's proposals for producer prices in advance
and given the opportunity to comment on them.



- 18 -
7.16      Projected tenants' incomes are lower in the early years of lease
than a laborer's present annual income of Rs 1,500, but farmers would have
adequate incentive to participate, since:
-- in the early years of the project, prices are unlikely
to fall from the present level of Rs 2.20 to Rs 2.05/lb
forecast for 1980, but assumed as a constant price for
project calculations (see para 8.07). Annex 13 illus-
trates that if the price were Rs 2.15 in the first
year of the lease and were to decline to Rs 2.05 in
the sixth year, the farm income would be below Rs 1,500
in the first year only; and
-- with the high rate of unemployment, few laborers are
assured of obtaining a constant annual income of
Rs 1,500.
E. Impact on Government Bu4git
7.17      The only revenues which would accrue directly to Government from
the project would be loan repayments by MTDA. While the discounted
return to Government on its capital contribution (including that financed
by IDA) from the assumed level of AUTDA payments is barely positive, the
Government cash flow at Annex 17 sAlows that Government would recover its
contribution, after meeting IDA service charges, by1984. Including cash
accruing from non-project activities, Government would show a cumulative
surplus from 1980 on its smallholder tea activities.
7.18      Expressed as an annual return on total capital contributions, the
assumed NTDA payment to Government from the project would be equivalent to
about 5% from 1978. The annual return on Government's own contribution
from 1TDA payments less IDA repayment and service charges would be about
17% from 1977/78 through 1980/81, 14% through 1987/88 and 9/ thereafter.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project's principal benefits would be increased output and
foreign exchange earnings produced at a cost which would yield a satisfac-
tory return to the economy; creation of employment at relatively low
capital cost; and the consequent reduction of Government support for
unemployed workers.
8.02      Annual foreign exchange earnings from the project would amount
to about Rs 17.2 million (US$3 million equivalent) at maturity, and because
of low imported input requirements and debt service, most of this would
represent a net improvement in the balance of payments.



- 19 -
8.03      Annex 18 shows the calculation of the economic rate of return
and details the assumptions used. The return is particularly sensitive to
labor costs and to variations in yields and prices. These factors are
discussed below.
8.04      Labor Costs.  Because of high unemployment, transfer of labor to
the project would reduce -- directly or indirectly -- the island's pool
of unemployed or relief workers. Furthermore, due to the absence of a
subsistence agriculture sector, no loss of subsistence production would
ensue. Thus, the opportunity cost of labor to the Mauritius economy is
considerably less than the going wage rate. The calculation of the economic
rate of return uses actual cash wages to be paid to MTDA laborers, but
family labor, which receives no wages, is costed at zero. If instead, a
shadow wage rate of Rs 2.55 per day were used to value all labor employed
throughout the life of the project (see Annex 18, para 7), the rate of
return would be approximately the same. If, on the other hand, the full
wage rate were used to value family labor, the rate of return would be only
2.5%.
8.05      Yields.  The assumed yields are based on sound historical data
and should be obtained. However, the return has been tested for a 15%
drop in yields to allow for contingencies.
8.06      Prices.  A constant price of Rs 2.05/lb has been assumed, this
is conservative as prices are likely to be higher in the early years of
the project. The return has been tested for sensitivity at the two prices
of Rs 1.80/lb and Rs 2.19/lb discussed in paragraph 7.07.
8.07      The following table summarizes the results of the economic rate
of return calculations:
Price/lb                  Rs 1.80      Rs 2.05      Rs 2.19
With assumed yields              12.7%        15.0%        16.1%
With 15% yield reduction          9.6%        12.1%        13.3%
8.08      Employment.  The project would create permanent employment for
some 4,000 persons, including MTDA staff at a capital cost of about
US$7 million, or US$1,700 per person. This cost is low in relation to
other projects in Mauritius (para 2.05). Creation of these jobs would not
only be a social benefit but would reduce relief payments by Government
at Rs 4.00 per day for a three-day week the savings could amount to some
Rs 2.0 million annually.
IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations the following main assurances have been
obtained:



- 20 -
(a) the capacity of the Dubreuil factory would be increased
to 3 million lb of made tea by June 1972 (para 4.07).
(b) the design of the project tea factories would be prepared
by consultants agreeable to and under terms of reference
approved by IDA, and factory construction would be super-
vised by the managing agents who, for at least the duration
of the project development period, would manage the fac-
tories (para 4.08);
(c) existing leases between Government and cooperatives in
the project area would be amended in favor of jiTJA;
land rents would be payable to MTDA, and changes in these
arrangements would be made only with IDA approval (para
6.02);
(d) a firm of chartered accountants acceptable to IDA would
set up ATDA accounts, train an liTDA bookkeeper and check
the accounting procedures at least twice a year during
the development period (para 5.07):
(e) iMTDA would pay a producer price which would allow a
margin adequate to cover operating costs including de-
preciation, and allocations to a reserve fund (l4/lb of
green leaf), and leave an annual surplus (at least 4/lb
of green leaf for 1971 through 1974 and ji/lb thereafter)
(paras 7.12 and 7.13):
(f)  appointments to the MMDA posts of General manager, Field
,lanager and Nursery Manager would be made after prior
consultation with IDA (para b.04);
(g) during the project development period, managing agents
for the operation of cthe factories and factory
managers, would be appointed with IDA's concurrence under
terms of reference agreeable to IDA (para 6.08);
(it) Government would meet on MThA's behalf any operating
deficits which the Jubreuil factory (Tea 'lanufacture
(Sugar Iillers) Ltd.) might incur (para o.09); and
(i) IDA would be informed of the anticipated producer prices
everv six months and be given tne opportunity to comment
on tnem (para 7.15).
9.J2      Condition of effectiveness are:



- 21 -
(a) approval by IDA of the forms of lease and sublease setting
out the rights and obligations of MTDA, cooperatives and
tenants (para 4.10);
(b)  the vesting in  ¶TDA of Government rights under existing
leases to cooperatives (para 6.02); and
(c) conclusion of a new agreement between Government. MTDA
and the Tea Manufacture (Sugar Millers) Ltd. regulating
the financial and operating arrangements for the Dubreuil
factory (para 6.09).
9.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5.2 million on
standard terms. The credit includes retroactive financing of up to
US$130,000 (para 5.03).

CYCLONE DANGER TO TEA PRODUCTION
FreqXuenc~y of cyclones
1.        Cyclone records in Mauritius date back to 1875.  An examination
of these records carried out in 1960 by the Director of ileteorological
Services in 4auritius 1/ showed that cyclones occur randomly. In other
words, there is no evidence that the recent historical pattern of cyclones
is of any use in predicting cyclones in the immediate future. The proba-
bility of a cyclone with a given speed occurring in a specific month is,
therefore, approximated by the frequency distribution of occurrences over
the past 94 years as set out in the following table:

Cyclone iana_e:   eaSeed Availability
2.        Most of the seed fall in Mauritius is from January to April, when
cyclones are most likely to occur. Although seed fall records are not ex-
tensive, it is nevertheless, possible to make a rough calculation based on
the experience of the past four years as summarized in the following table:

3.        The calculation of probable seed loss is then made, assuming:
(a) maximum hourly wind speed less than 25 mph -- no seed l8s;    Icyclones
less than 35 mph -- loss of one-third; (c) cyclones less than 45 mph --
loss of two-thirds; (d) cyclones greater than 45mph -- totai loss of seed
crop.  Using the relative frequencies frop the table in paragraph 1, prob-
able seed loss was calculated at ro,ughly 50Z 1/, for which a con' ngency
allowance has been inclutded in the cost estimates.
<cy~loaeLDamage: Tea Yields
4.        Cyclones can cause two sorts of damage.  First, there is a short-
term loss of production due to wind scorching and s Whding.  taur  bushes
will recover quickly from all but the most severe cyclones and, as with
hail damage, plucking losses are estimated at three to four pluckjn$ rounds.
jiowever, since cyclones tend to occur in the p1eak plucking months, loss of
production can be significant.  On average, slightly mSe than 4:d  6f' an-
nual production is plucked in January to flarch.  For purpose of c-lculation
the following proportionate losses liave been assumed:
'iaximum hourly         Proportion of peak season          Proportion of annual
wind speed                  Production lost              _production lost

broadlv consistent with the only available estimate for production losses
during the 196U cyclones 1/.
O.        ihe second kind of cyclone damage which is loag-term through up-
rooting, or 'ring-barking', is impossible to estimate with present informa-
tion, though with mature bushes it is not thought to be significant.  Flood
damage due to the hiigh rainfall which accompanies cyclones may also cause
plant losses, tlhough the drainage planned under the proposed project should
largely avoid this. Reports from observers of the 1960 cyclones are con-
tradictory, but appareitly there was a considerable loss of new plantings.
However, since the method of planting then used ("seed at stake") will not
be followed under the nroject, this danger should not be as great as in
the future. Fiurthermore, it is proposed that most planting under the proj-
ect take place during April to June, i.e. after the season of peak cyclone
danger. In order to give some weight to these long-term losses an allow-
ance of 0.72' has arbitrarily been made, bringing the total annual average
loss of production to 4.0%.

MAURITIUS
MAURITIUS TEA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROJECT
TEA PLANTING AND CULTIVATION METHODS
1.        The principal technical aspects of tea cultivation which would be
practiced under the project are described below:
A. Nursery
2.        Site Selection.  Nursery sites would be well sheltered to minimize
cyclone damage, and would be easily drained. The pH of the soil would be
around 5.6 and would not exceed 6.0.
3.        Planting Seeds.  Polythene sleeves 3" in diameter and not less than
10" in length would be used. Beds would be 4 ft in width.
4.        Temporary Windbreaks would be planted immediately after bed prep  -
aration. Since Flemingia Congesta has been used with success, its use would
be continued, although other species would be tried.
5.        Seed Supplies.  Mauritius has about 70 acres of seed gardens
which produce good quality seed. However, it is assumed that due to cy-
clone hazards, these gardens would supply only 50% of the project's seed
requirement in any year and that the remaining 50% would be imported,
mainly from Tanzania.
6.        Seed Preparation and Germination.  Only seeds of 1/2 in diameter
or larger would be used. They would be tested for quality by immersion in
water, seeds still floating after 72 hours being rejected. Records would
be kept of the proportion of rejected seeds so that claims could be made
for replacement. Germination would be effected in greenhouses and seeds
collected daily for immediate planting.
7.        Nursery Management.  Cracked seed would be planted about 1 in
in depth, care being taken to plant the eye horizontal. When the seedlings
are 6 in high, a 25:5:5 NPK compound fertilizer would be applied every two
months until the plants are ready for removal to the field.

B.  Seed and Nursery Area Requirements
8.        The quantity of seed required depends on the planting program,
the viability of seed used, and the efficiency of stump production. Witih
the improved nursery techniques envisaged under the project, nursery stump
outturn is expected to increase progressively usp to oUb by the  itird year
of the project, compared to between 30 and 40X from present lea vivision
nurseries; consequently, seed and nursery area requirements would be as
follows:

C. Land Preparation
9.        Land Clearing.  After removal of :erchantable timber, the land
would be cleared of all trees and debris by bulldozer. Following plowing,
all roots and boulders would be removed by cross-rtnning and raking with
crawler tractor-drawn equipment. Gross-ripping and raking are essential
because rotting roots can cause tea root disease, w lich is fatal to the
plants. Compactness of the subsoil makes mechanical stump and root removal
a necessity.  Roots and other plant debris would be bulldozed onto road
sites, or land unsuitable for tea planting, and burned. Burning on tea
land causes patches of soil with high pti levels on which tea establishment
is difficult.
D. Planting
lU.       Lemoval from  _iurse y.  Sleeved plants are ready for transplantiuig
when the roots have reac,hed nearly to the bottom of the sleeve and kiave at
least 8" of top growth.  Flants must be liandled carefully to avoid damagiag
the cylinder of soil, and so perhaps the roots.  They siiould be stac~tud
carefully and tigiltlv on any vehicle taKing tLhem Lo the field.

11.       holinp and Stump Plantin .  Planting sites would be pegged out,
on the contours where necessary, at a spacing of 4 ft x 2-1/2 ft, giving
4,500 plants/A, and holes of about o in x 6 in x 12 in would be
dug by hand. Planting would follow immediately. Each nole would receive
2 oz single sunerphosphate equivalent, prior to planting. Sleeves woula
be removed by slitting prior to planting.
E.  Forming the Frame of the Tea Bush
12.       Past pruning methods have been varied and unsatisfactory.  The
following table compares the pruning and tipping system to be used under
the project with the pre-project method:

13.       'faie 12 in prune now used is too high to allow the development of
a low frame, and tipping-in after thie 12 in prune, followed by plucking,
places too great a strain on the young bushes.
14.       Prunin (,ycle Method.  Frame formation should be fairly complete
after the 20 in prune, and thereafter a three-year pruning cycle would be
used.  'fie cycle may, however, be changed as needed.  About one-third (1/2
A) of each tenant's holding would be pruned each year. Pruning would be
carried out along the contours, in one run, and no "lung" oranch would be
left.
15.       lime of Pruning.  The best time to prune would be determined by
experience, but as a general rule, bushes slhould be pruned when they have
sufficient starch reserves to recover quickly.  Th'e best time is thus at
the end of the rains when less water is lost through transpiration; hay
seems to be the best month as it is at the beginning of the dry season:

5u, of the crop is in, and adequate starch reserves should have accumulated
in April which is warm and wet.
n. General itield Operations
16.       Weedinpg.  Weeding would be carried out until the bushes are dense
enough to shade out weed competitLion. 6nemical weed control, particularly
with paraquat, has been used successfully on young tea in ,tauritius, and
this technique would be contirnued in addition to land weeding whienever ntec-
essary.
17.       In-fillin,.  Some of eaclh year's planting would die and
vacancies would have to be in-filled as soon as possible. Because of the
incidence of cyclones, an allowance of 11l has been made for tle atecessary
infilling.
18.       Fertilizer Use.  As in many other tea growing countries., straight
nitrogenous fertilizers, particularly sulphate of ammonia, are used in
1lauritius.  Recently, following the trend in Last Africa, and because
potash deficiencv has been found, compound .iPK fertilizers ilave been intro-
duced. uurrently up to oUO lb/A of 25:5:5 is applied, but this application
is not based on experimental data, and trials need to be carried out to ae-
termine optimum fertilizer usage. cnder the project the followift ferti-
lizer rates would be used until the results of trials are Known:

7 and subsequent years                          iOU
Present Practice is to fertilize in three or more anplications. Although
experiments in many other tea growing countries heve shlown no advantage in
split application, two anplications would be used under the oroject, one in
February and the other in October.
19.       Pests and Aseases.  zo serious tea pests have been reported in
'auritius other than seasonal mites and aphids, and the use of pesticides
for their control has not vet been necessary.  koct rot disease  Armillaria



A&'i\Lj 3

mellea, is present, but should be minimal with good land clearing and stump
and root removal (para 9).
20.       P1U_kiny,.  Good plucking is critical for maximum crop and good
quality. Fine nlucking -- two leaves and a bud -- would be standard for
the Project and would be clearly defined to growers to ensure that leaf
deliveries are satisfactory. lEast crop losses are due to failure to prac-
tice proper plucking rounds and to poor maintenance of the plucking table.
;iaintenance would be imnroved through the use of a plucking stick. In ad-
dition, quality would be improved by using leaf baskets instead of sacks
as at present: sacks prevent air circulation and cause premature fermenta-
tion.
21.       Windbreaks.  In areas exposed to strong winds, windbreaks are
essential for both young and mature tea.  lakea Sali na, which has proved
successful as a windbreak in Last Africa, has failed to withstand the winds
in 'lauritius because of shallow rooting caused by the compact subsoil.
There is a pressing need to try other windbreaks, and appropriate trials
would be made under the project.

ANNEX 5
MAURITIUS
MAURITIUS TEA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROJECT
PROPOSED SUBJECTS FOR TEA RESEARCH
General
1.        M4ost tea research results are applicable only to the area in which
they are obtained. Mauritius has little data to build on, because the
Wooton Tea Research Station lias no well planned research program, and be-
cause the results of whatever experiments have been made have been poorly
recorded. Wooton, however, has the professional staff (an agronomist and an
agricultural officer, both experienced) and facilities needed to conduct the
type of applied research which can produce relatively quick results immedi-
ately applicable by the industry. Wooton has 67 A of standing tea and new
fields can be established. Also, large-scale trials under practical cultiva-
tion conditions could be made on Crown Land plantings.
Pr_posed Research
2.        The following subjects need immediate investigation and should
form the basis of Wooton's applied research program over the next few years:
(i) bringpij tea into bearing: determination of formative
pruning sytems, pegging 1/, tipping heights, etc.;
(ii)  Prunin:  establishment of optimum timing and frequency
of pruning;
(iii) Fertilizers: establishment of trials on both young and
bearing tea to determine optimum nutrient application and
time of application -- including effectiveness of split
applications;
(iv) Clones 2/: selection of high yielding and high quality clones;
1/   Pegging is an improved technique of training tea bushes into the
ontimum shape for plucking leaf.
2/   Vegetative propagation involves taking cuttings from tea bushes of
proven yield and quality characteristics and rooting these in
simply constructed propagators. The group of plants originating
from one parent by vegetative propagation is terme4 a clone; all
members of the clone have an identical genetic makt-up and conse-
quently identical yield and quality potentials.



Page 2
Wooton has planted a small area to one local clone, *il. Its
growth,is fairly good, but at least 10 to 15 more clones
should be tested for leaf production and tea quality wader
Mauritius conditions.  Clonal selection should begin in
the MTDA nurseries, but clones should 41so be impqrted
from Last Africa;
(v)  Vegetatiye__roaoat,ion (VP):  improvement of VP.techniqques;
rooting media now used are unsatiifac  ory, and trials
with different rooting media are essential. A4tentioi
needs So be paid to wa"tring,tgcbn4quas, , shAde methods,
and the best containers in.which to grQw -plants in the
nursery;
(vi)  Windbreaks:  establishment of trials to find tree specie-s
suited to 'lauritius conditions; and
(vii)  Other research items:  these should irclude observations
on the effects of pre-planting cover crops; weed contrQl
using pre-.and post-emergence iierb.icides: treatment of
cyclonle damaged tea; use of fertilizers in the planting
hole; pre-planting cropping; inter-cropptng in thte early
years after planting; and mulching.
Collaboration with the Tea Kesearch Institute of iast Africa
3.        Aauritius has applied for association with ,hbe Tea iekagrch
Institute of East Africa at JKericho in i\enya. Acceptance of t4e ,*ApPlica-
tion would be of great advantage to Mtauritius since advisory visit-s from
the Institute's officers and the training of i4auritian officers *it tne
Institute would be enabled.  Government sihould be encouraged to pras
forward with its application.

TEA INDUSTRY LEGISLATION
1.        }rincipal tea legislation is contained in Ordinance 29 (Tea
Industry Control) of 1959, as amended, and Governmenit *Notice 30 of 1961, as
amended. The main provisions of these statutes are summarized below.
i'he Tea Industrv Control Ordinance
2.        i'ea Control Ordinance 29 vests control of thie tea industry in
the 'Lea Control Board (TCB), which has the power to regulate the following:
(i) tea quality, blending, packing, handling and disposal;
(ii)  purchase. sorting, packing, delivery to factory, and
rejection of green leaf;
(iii)  producer price:
(iv)  production of, or trade in, tea seeds:
(v) issue, renewal or cancellation of licences or certificates
for productioni of green leaf and made tea, processing and
marketing, tea imports and exports;
(vi)  books and accounts to be provided by planters and manufac-
turers, when TCB deems such information necessary;
(vii)  arbitration between grower and maaufacturer.
In addition, I'CB has authority to purchase and sell made tea, establish a
tea fund, and levy a cessz these powers have not been exercised.

3.        Lnder Government i4otice 36, as amended on August 31, 196d, 1CB
was afforded the following:
(i) Licensing of tea properties. Ao tea property may be estab-
lished, exploited or worked, unless a Tea Property Licence
has been obtained from TCB;
(ii)  Licensing  fee.  Fees shall be paid to [CB for the issue of
licences; viz. 2s 1/A of planted tea and RS 5O0/factory, and

objective of sunporting cooperatives and of promoting their development.
In 1959, the oepartment of Cooperatives was made responsible to the ,inister
of Local Covernment and Cooperative development, and in 1968 to the Minis-
ter of Agriculture and Jatural R>esources.  It is now the Ministry of Coop-
eratives, and has three main functions:
(1)  Legal -- registration of cooperatives and their by-laws-
inspection of their operations; settlement of disputes,
and liquidation of cooperatives;
(ii)  Audit -- actual conduct of audit or approval of auditors;
and
(iii)  Training --- training of cooperatives' personnel and pro-
viding information on cooperative procedures and manage-
ment.
2.        *.ooperatives are generally well run.  A summary of the situation
regarding primary and secondary cooperatives in Mauritius is given below.
Primary Cooperatives
3.        Mauritius has about 300 cooperatives of all sorts including crop
financina, savings, retailing, transport, and marketing. In all there are:
(i)  181 primary  financial" cooperatives of which 156 provide
cultivation loans on crop security mainly to sugarcane
and tobacco growers. The remaining 25 are savings cooper-
atives;
(ii)  59 cooperative stores retailing consumer goods to members:
and
(iii)  i6 otner primary cooperatives, including 11 for transport
of sugarcane, 17 for marketing onions or potatoes, 11
for marketing fish, and 10 for marketing green tea leaf.

Page  2
Of these latter 10, four have contracts with tea factories
for the delivery of green leaf and one operates a
factory to process the leaves of its members (Char-
treuse).
4.        Cooperatives have, on average, i00 to 200 members each, out in
some fields membership is smaller:  o( to 120, for instance, in the case
of tea marketing cooperatives.
Secondary Cooperatives
5.         l'here are four secondarv cooperatives, each serving a iiumber of
primary cooperatives active in a certain field, or renderlng, specific serv-
ices required by all cooperatives:
(1)  Tne Mauritius Cooperative Central bank (MCCB), establishied
in 1948 provides seasonal loans and sLiort-term credit to
credit cooperatives, medium-term loans for the redemption
of mortgages, and long-term loans to housing cooperatives.
It has 226 member cooperatives.  Details are given in Alnnex
8;
(ii)  The Mauritius Agricultural Federation, registered in L95u
safeguards the agricultural interests of 167 sugar planters'
cooperatives and is represented oI1 Government boards, cotn-
mittees, and other statutory agricultural bodies,
(iii)  The ;4auritius Coonerative un,ion, registered in 1950, is
responsible for auditing the accounts of its 213 member coop-
eratives.  It is financed by audit fees charged to thiem (Ps 10
per annum each) and by Government grants.  T'ie Registrar of
Cooperative Societies is the ex-officio President of tthe
Union; and
(iv)  The JMauritius 'Tea uredit and 'farketinro Cooperative
Federation _Ltd., registered in 1967, embraces three tea
credit and marketing cooperatives ('fidlands, Oubreuil and
Vuillemin).  I:he Federation was formed to safeguard the
interests of members leasing tea plots from the Govern-
ment and to act as their agent for the sale of tea to the
Dubreuil tea factory.  ilowever, the Federation did not get
off the ground, and in effect, each member cooperative
deals directly with the factory.

their leaf to the vubreuil factory.  Of the remaining six cooperatives, only
the Cliartreuse Tea Credit and 4arketing Cooperative Society operates its
own factorv; this was taken over from the Government in 1967. It has 13
members cultivating some 1,900 A of Crown Land. The other five cooperatives
are inoperative both in lending and marlceting, and their members sell their
leaf directly and individually to processors.
7.        Finance.  To cover operating costs, tea cooperatives, which usual-
ly employ only a salaried secretary, deduct on average 2/. of the value of
leaf delivered by its members, charging such members for the cost of leaf
transport to the factory on a per pound basis. Cooperatives derive a small
surplus from the interest spread on loans made to members with borrowings
from WUCCk.
8.       ,>tarketing and Credit.  Tea marketing is governed by the lea In-
dustry Control Ordinance of 1959.  Leaf is produced only on licensed tea
properties and is required to be sold under annual contracts to licensed
manufacturers. Payments to growers are made monthly by tiheir cooperatives,
wqhich obtain monthly payments from M1CCB, which receives payments directly
from the factories for leaf delivered. This mechanism and the credit made
available by A4CCB to members of tea cooperatives are described in Annex d.

1EX MTAURITIUS COOPERATIVE CENTRAL BANiK
(General
1.         Mauritius' financial institutions consist of thie Bank of `,iauri-
tius (tlhe central banlc). five commercial banks, ttie Post Office Savings
Bank, the Development bank of 4tauritius and tlhe Mauritius Cooperative Cen-
tral Bank (riCCB) 1J/.  T'he bank of Ntauritius, established in i96b, manages
the country's foreign exchange reserves and monetary policy  it also main-
tains an orderly market for Government securities and provides seasonal
liquidity requirements to the sugar industry. T'hiere are five commercial
banks, four foreign (Barclays, tercantile, Bank of Baroda, and tLahib Bank),
and one local (klauritius Commercial Bank, which has ties with Lloyds).
These banks finance foreign trade and industries.  Two subsidiaries of the
commercial banks provide medium-term loans (up to five years) to the sugar
industry, but the major Dart of agricultural credit operations is the res-
ponsibility of the Development Bank of lauritius (medium- and long-term
credit) and >ICCB (short-term credit).
i he ,Iauritius Cooperative Central Bank Ltd.
LBack ground
2.        £ihe iauritius Cooperative Central Bank (NICCB) started operations
in 194b. TiLese developed from making only shlort-term crop loans to farm-
ers, to providing full-scale banking services. In 1963, iACCB started
medium-term lending to assist borrowers in redeeming onerous mortgages and
planters in buying land, and long-term lending to housing cooperatives; in
1968, "iCCB began medium-term lending for land improvement (bulldozing).
Since its beginning, RtCCB hlas held deposits both from member cooperatives
and the public at large. tICCB took over the current accounts of its member
cooperatives in 1965, and since 1969 it has operated individual current
accounts for members of cooperatives. A4CCB also renders purchasing serv-
ices to its members. Otn February 28, 1969 (the close of the financial year
1968/1969), the 6ank provided services for 22) member cooperatives, includ-
ing one cooperative tea factory and four credit and tea marketing coopera-
tives, 157 credit cooperatives, 24 transport cooperatives, 19 agricultural
marketing cooperatives, 11 stores cooperatives, 4 credit and produce coop-
eratives, 3 housing cooperatives and 2 credit unions.
1/   Mauritius' financial infrastructure is described in IMF report, The
dconozy of Mauritius, Feb. 4, 1970.

Organization
3.        AICCB was registered under Ordinance No. 51 of 1945, on october
18, 1948, and has the status of a limited liability.  T'o enable ''ICCB to
open current accounts, the banking ordinance was amended by Act .o. 25 of
1969. NMCCB operates in close collaboration with the :tinistry of Coop-
eratives.  'the Board of Directors consists of 10 members, most of whom
are secretaries of cooperatives. iLhe Registrar of Cooperative Societies
is an ex-officio member of the board of directors 1/. Tne board of
'Ianagement has 20 members, wnio are presidents, secretaries or nmembers
of cooperatives.
Source of Funds
4.         Condensed balance sheets covering the years 1966/67 to 1968/69
are given in Table 1.  ACCB's initial capital (1948) amounted to is 19,792
(US$3,600) and had increased to nearly Ks 1.2 million (USU217,460) in 1969
with a reserve fund of about Rs 2.2 million (US$0.4 million).  other sources
are deposits and current accounts from cooperatives and their inidividual
members, and the public; suchi deposits and accounts increased from INs 13,340
(US$2,425) in 1949 to -.'s 7.5 million (US$1.36 million) in 1969 (see i'able
2). The Bank has rediscount facilities with the banlk of NIauritius, and in
1968 a standby facility arrangement was signed witLh lBarclays bank .).C.O. to
cushion out any sudden claim by deoositors in the event of a monetary
crisis.
Uses of  Funds
5.         Comparative data on lending activities and loan portfolios are
given in 'rables 3 and 4. In 1969, seasonal loans to agriculture accounted
for about 58,o of loans issued and 69/O of loans outstanding. medium-term
loans for 24i'o and 132, respectively, and long-term loans (housing) for ib8
of both issued and outstanding loans.  Nearly 50Z of medium-term loans are
for amounts below Rs J,6UU (USUj45).
Qperatin_results
o.         Condensed profit and loss accounts are giveu in 'Table J.  over
the last two years net profit amounted to about Rs 0.2 million per annum.
As loans are secured by crops, :ICCB nas no defaults in agricultural loans,
apart from a few cases in vnich tenants nave given up their smallholdings.
1/   hiie Registrar of Cooperative Societies is also ex-officio president of
the 'Iauritius Cooperative union Ltd., which is responsible for auditing
accounts of cooneratLives (see Annex 7).

Lending Procedures -- Tea Credit and Marketing Cooperatives
7.        TiCCB grants seasonal loans to members of cooperatives for on-farm
costs in the amount of 1' 4uU/A anaually, comprising ks 200 for fertilizer
in kind, Rs 5( for land rent which iCCB pays directly to Government otl be-
half of thle farmers, and is 150 in cash at the time of tea pruning when the
farmers ihave little revenue and may need to employ iLired labor (see para
2.18). MCCB, which receives all payments from factories for leaf delivered
by cooperatives, deducts repayments due by members before payments are made
to cooperatives. Under the project, existing procedures would be main-
tained because MICCB has adequate administrative facilities and has full con-
trol over the credit activities of its member cooperatives. However, MCCB
would pay the land rent to MITDA.

PROPOSED N1TDA TEA FACTORIES
1.        Tea Production and Pnasing of Factories.  Table 1 shows estimated
ATDA smallholder leaf production to be processed in the  )ubreuil factory and
the four new MTIA factories, whicli would be needed to handle project produc-
tion of green leaf. T'he phasing of the two factories to be constructed
under the project would be as follows:
Installation    Operation
Operation at         Additional      at 3 m lb
Factory      Construction    1.5 m lb Caacity          (apacity       ;apacity_

Estimates of factory operating costs are given in Annex 18, Table 2.
2.       1.anufacturing Process.  The manufacturing process would be of the
Rotorvane 1/ - UTC 2/ type, which produces a fine even standard of bright
liquoring tea. because of temperature fluctuations in the factory, and of
deliveries of wet leaf caused by the hiigh rainfall, withering and fermenta-
tion must be carefully controlled.
3.        Lstimated proportions of the various grades that would oe produced
are as follows:
13P  I                        18%                     Top grades
PF                            50%                     for export
PD                             9%                         77%
BP                             6%                     Second line grades

4.        Factory Buildings and Equipment.  To prevent cyclone damage,
factories and ancillary buildings would be as compact as possible, *nd
constructed of reinforced concrete. Because the factories would be close
to the sea, causing the rapid corrosion of iron work, copper pipes would
be used in steam radiators.
5.        Construction Costs.  Factory construction costs are base4 on the
assumption that the factories would have to process 3/4% of the anpnual crop
in any day, i.e. 22,500 lb of made tea. As the factories are clo*# to
towns and villages, on-site housing would be provided only for the Pnager,
an artisan and a watchman. Cost estimates are given in Annex 10, Table 3,
and details of the factory equipment in Table 2 of this Annex.
6.        Site Selection.  The site proposed for Factory I is a 10-acre
lot in the Belle Rive block; Factory II would be in the Good Fnd area,
about 3-1/2 miles from Curepipe (see Map 2). The sites have been oelected
fot the following reasons:
(i) they are reasonably level, require a minimum of heavy earph
works and allow good drainage;
(ii)  leaf transport facilities are good. Green leaf for Factory I
would have to travel up to LO wiles because of scattere4
plantings, but when all the factories have been coustrwcR4d,
distances would not exceed 5 miles.  Both factories wouL be
near main roads linking with the port of Port Louis;
(iii) the main power line is only 114 mile away from Factory I,
and 1 mile from Factory II. Piped water supply is avaiLable
at both sites; and
(iv) labor houses would not be needed as both factories would ,k.e
within 2 miles of villages.
7.        Staffing and Training.  Managing Agents would be respons*b,e for
operating and staffing the MTDA factories,, and training Mauritian gkof.
Factory staff would consist of:

Total:                          Rs  165,120
The Assistant Mianager would be trained in Factory I and become Manager of
Factory II. diuring the first phase (1.5 million lb of made tea), a factory
would employ 50 laborers increasing to 80 in the second phase (3 million
lb of made tea) at an average rate of Rs 1,440 per man per annum.

MAURIT TUS 'TEA DEVELOPMENT AUJTtHORITY PROJECT
SELECTION OF TENANTS
1.        'f tie project's success would depend heavily on the calibre of its
tenants. Presently no formal selection takes place as a criterion for
future selection of smallholders, the following point system is proposed:
Proppsed Point System

4.  Previous Interest in Tenancy (Application)        2          2
/1   Since in M4auritius the stability of the tenant -- wiho does not own the
land -- is important for the success of the project, there is a bias
towards the middle-aged group.
ITI)A would select tenants mainly from its labor force where they gain ex-
perience -- first in tea planting and subsequently in maintenance works --
but would also allow non-,zTDA tea workers to qualify for tenancies.
2.        Selected tenants would be required to be MIauritian citizens;
physically and mentally fit and married; to have no serious criminal record;
and to live wqithin four miles of their allotment, or to provide evidence
that they have thie resources to obtain accommodation within such a distance.






ANNEX 16
MAURITIUS
MAURITIUS TEA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROJECT
MARKET PROSPECTS -
1.        At present Mauritius has about 8,600 A of tea under cultivation-
ef this, 50% is less than 11 years old and more than 23% yet to come into
production. Another 5,600 A would be planted under the project bringing
the area to about 15,000 A which would be capable of producing about 22
million lb of tea by 1980 (Table 1), of which about 8.4 million lb would
be from project plantings. While a large part of this 22 million lb would
be exported, this would account for less than one-half percent of estimated
world tea exports by 1980.
2.        In addition to the above, if the hopes of the Mauritius Govern-
ment are fulfilled, the area under tea would increase in the 1970's by
another 15,000 A to about 30,000 A. This latter target appears optimistic,
however, considering the scarcity of additional good tea land, and invest-
ment funds. A more realistic estimate is that tea plantings could expand
to about 25,000 A during the 1970's, and that the 25,000 A would be in full
production by 1985.  Total Mauritius production should then amount to
around 37.5 million lb (Table 1).
3.        The conclusion of an international tea agreement is not expected
to affect Mauritius tea exports. In negotiations now underway for an
agreement, it is recognized by both consumers and producers that due weight
must be given to protecting the interests of the smaller tea producing
countries, in particular those such as Mauritius in which opportunities
for other cash crops are limited, and in which tea is important in crop
diversification programs. These smaller producers are likely to be
excluded from quota restrictions, and consequently it is not expected that
tea produced under the proposed project would be subject to quotas.
4.        More significant for Mauritius is the question of future tea
sales to the South African market. Until 1966 most of Mauritius' exports
went to the United Kingdom. After 1966, when the South African government
decided to diversify its tea imports, the South African market gained pro-
minence and accounted 75% 60% in 1969/70 (Table 2).
5.        Imports into South Africa increased by 4.2% yearly during the
1960's and reached 43.3 million lb in 1969. Because of increasing South

African domestic production, the rate of growth is expected to slow down
and imports are estimated to reach 46.0 mllion lb in 1980 and 50.0 million
lb in 1985.  Imports from Iauritius could reach 12 and 15 million lb if
leaf of satisfactory quality is offered.
6.        While the volume of exports to South Africa is based on the
political decision of the South African government to diversify imports.
it does not seem likely that this decision will be rescinded. Furthermore,
even if this does happen South African tea blenders will by then have
become accustomed to incorporating 'Iauritius tea in their blends and will
be reluctant to change to another source both because blenders dislike
changing the mixture of their packages, and because M4auritius tea is priced
competitively.
7.        As stated in Table 1, Mauritius will export 19.7 to 25.2
million lb in 1980, depending on production assumptions also listed in the
Table. Since exports to the South African market are projected to vary
between 12 million and 15 million lb, exports to the London market would
vary between 4.7 million lb and 13.2 million lb in 1980. The lower U.K.
export figure assumes a low production projection and 15 million lb exports
to South Africa, while the high U.K. export figure assumes a high production
projection and 12 million lb exports to South Africa. The effect of these
assumptions on the weighted average price is indicated in Table 3.
8.         Hlauritius teas find a ready market in London since they are
suited for blending.  Judged by their price performance  however  they
are of lower quality than the average quality of tea sold at the London
auction (Table 2). Part of the decline in Mauritius tea prices relative
to the average price of all teas sold in London was because increased
exports to South Africa and other countries at more favorable prices caused
lower qualities of tea to be shipped to London. With the predicted expan-
sion in exports to London, both quality and prices should improve and
M'auritius teas should sell at about 90% of the price for the average of all
teas sold in London, the relationship which prevailed in the early 1960's.
9.         Finance and insurance arrangements vary depending upon the
destination of the tea. For export to South Africa, once the buyer has
accepted a sample of the tea shipment. the tea is transported and payment
is made within 14 days of shipment. In some cases, payment has been made
in as little as four days. Insurance is paid by the South African purchaser.
Exports to Britain are handled differently. On the security of a letter
from the British broker stating that a sample of the intended tea shipment
is acceptable, the factory in Mauritius obtains an advance from a commercial
bank for 75% of the shipment. Final payment is not made until the tea is
actually delivered and sold. This can be as muclh as a year after the teat
is initially shipped.  Tnsurance Costs on exports to BIritaiini are- iit by
t:he factory.



ANNEX 16

10.       Sales on the local market command a premium price (app-nrximately
Ps 2.60/lb of made tea, ex-factory). Quotas are therefore assignui to
individual factories for sales in this market, and are determined by the
Tea Control Board on the basis of a number of considerations, particularly
volume processed and the number of years which the factory has been oper-
ating. Some factories appear to be violationg this quota arrangement
through clandestine sales, and elimination of this practice is one of the
motives behind Government's proposal to centralize the blending of all
local teas.
11.       Local tea sales are expected to reach 2.5 million lb yearly by
1985 (Table 1) because of population increase. Per capita consumption,
which presently amounts to nearly two pounds, is not assumed to increase.
The price is projected to remain at the current level of Rs 2.60/lb
ex-factory.
12.       Future export prices depend on the outcome of negotiations of an
international tea agreement. Without an agreement, the London average
price for all teas could decline to about 40-42 pence/lb (Rs 2.25/lb),
forcing less competitive producers out of the market. This process would
take a few years. Afterwards prices probably would increase and reach a
minimum of about 44 pence/lb at the end of the 1970's: this would be when
production from the proposed project reaches the market. The foregoing
implies that the London average market price for Mauritius tea (taking into
account the discount) would amount to a least 39.6 pence/lb corresponding
to an ex-factory price of 32.7 pence/lb (Rs 1.80/lb). With an international
tea agreement, the average London auction price for all teas could reach a
minimum of 47.2 pence/lb and the corresponding Mauritius tea price in London
42.5 pence/lb. The latter corresponds to an ex factory price of 35.5
pence/lb (Rs 1.96/lb).
13.       Mauritius has two price advantages in supplying the South African
market compared with London. One is lower transportation and marketing
costs, and amounts to about 4.0 pence/lb (Rs 0.22/lb). This premium
should be maintained in future years. The other advantage arose because
of the South African government's decision to increase tea imports from
Tlauritius when in doing so it forced importers to buy a predetermined quan-
tity on what was a sellers' market because of limited supplies. The premium
now amounts to about 6 penc-e/lb (Rs 0.33/lb). While arrangements have
been negotiated between iTauritius exporters and South African importers
which provide for 'Mauritiua tea producers to negotiate mutually satisfactory
prices with the South African Tea Association (presumably at a higher level
than the corresponding prevailing London price), there is no assurance at
this stage that this scheme will succeed. Consequently, for project
purposes it is assumed that the special premium will disappear and that
only the transport and marketing premium will be maintained. Apart from
this. the Mauritius tea price in South Africa will follow world market
trends as indicated by the London auction price. Consequently the ex-factory
price for Mfauritius tea sold in South Africa should be about 36.4 pence/lb
(Rs 2.00lb) without an international tea agreement, or 39.8 pence/lb (Rs 2.19/lb)
with an agreement.



ANNEX 16
Page   4
14.        In Table 3 the export market and price alternatives are indicated
and a weighted ex-factory price for each option is stated. Probabilities
of the occurrence of these alternatives are applied, and a single price
based on this probability analysis has been derived. The price is calculated
to amount to Rs 2.05/lb for 1980 and subsequent years if only 12 million lb
are shipped to South Africa. If 15 million lb are shipped. this price is
estimated to rise to Rs 2.08/lb.
15.       The above projected prices apply to all Mauritius teas, whether
exported or consumed domestically. Thus they refer to the average quality
of all teas. It is possible that the 8.4 million lb) of tea from thie proposed
project would all have to be exported in order to reserve thc higher priced
domestic market for traditional suppliers. In this case two price extremes,
depending on where the tea is sold, have to be considered. If the total
8.4 million lb is shipped to the London auction the lowest price (without
an agreement) would he Rs 1.80/lb. This would be the case if the quality
of the tea would not meet South African standards.  On the other lhand  if
high quality tea were produced, the entire output could possibly go to
South Africa. Here the higlhest price that could be obtained would be about
Rs 2.19/lb (with an agreement). Within these two extremes numerous variations
are possible (see Annex 18, para 10).

ANNEX 18
MAURITIUS
MAURITIUS TEA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY PROJECT
ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
1.        The benefits and costs used in the rate of return calculations
are those attributable only to the project, i.e., they include neither the
costs incurred for development and extension nor the benefits derived from
pre-project plantings. Costs for housing project smallholders are not
included because the need is not certain, and low cost housing in the
rural areas is already part of Government's ongoing housing program.
Farm Development Costs
2.        These costs, including those of nurseries, land clearing and
preparation, planting and field maintenance until takeover by tenants, are
derived from Annex 10, Table 2. 1970 land clearing and preparation and
nursery costs for the first 1,100 A of project plantings are included.
The wage rate used for MTDA labor is Rs 6.05 per effective working day
computed on the basis of 313 official working days per annum at Rs 5.00 per
day and 54 leave days and public holidays.
Processing Costs
3.        These include capital and overhead costs (fixed costs) as well
as variable costs incurred by the MTDA factories. Since the first MTDA
factory would process both existing and project smallholder tea the
processing costs annually attributable to the project are a percentage
(project's share of total factory throughput) of the amount which the first
MTDA factory would require to cover annual operating costs as well as
amortization (see Table 2).
Prolect Administration
4.   (a)  Salaries and provident fund are derived from Annex 9, Table 1.
Since headquarters staff are not responsible for the project
exclusively, staff salaries are pro-rated according to time
spent on project duties as follows:
1971    1972    1973    1974    1975    1976 onwards
85%     85%      75%     50%      25%         10%
Project extension staff salaries are included in full in the
economic rate of return calculations.  Provident fund is con-
tributed for local staff at 12--1/2%.



ANNEX 18
Page   2
(b) MTDA operating costs represent only project staff's vehicle
operating costs, the cost of office materials, sundries and
building maintenance.
(c) Fixed Assets and Replacements. The heavy equipment used for
farm development would not have exhausted its useful life
after having cleared about 5,200 A, and a residual value of
50% is attributed. The schedule of vehicle purchases and
replacements, all totally attributable to the project is
given in Annex 10, Table 1.
Contingencies
5.        A 10% contingency allowance has been made for cost of all assets,
the factories, and heavy equipment operating costs. 15% contingency has
been allowed on asset replacement.
Forest Revenues Foregone
6.        About 70% of project area to be cleared is under 1-- to 20 year-
old pine forest, with a potential income at the age of 25 years. Table 3
shows the assumption and detailed calculations of the forest revenue fore-
gone by clearing the project area.
Smallholder Production Costs
7.        Total smallholder production costs are derived from the typical
smallholder budget in Annex 13. Labor has been costed fully during the
development period when cash wages would be paid to the labor force, and
thereafter familv labor has been costed at zero as employment in the project
would cause no loss of production elsewhere. The rate of return is approxi-
mately the same using a shadow rate of Rs 2.55 a day, representing a labor
cost of Rs 6.05 less the net cost of relief payments of Rs 3.50 (relief
payments of Rs 4.00 less the estimated value of relief work of Rs 0.50).
Forest Revenue: Initial Clearing
8.        Timber revenue from land clearing is derived from the following
assumptions of gross revenue at various ages: Rs 560/A from pine 10 to
13 years old; Rs 760/A from 14 to 18 years old and Ps 900/A from pine older
than 18 years.
Production
9.        Production accruing from the project is outlined in Annex 11
Table 1.



ANNEX 18
page   3
Tea Prices
10.       Tea price projections used are those prepared by the Economics
Department and are based on a probability analysis of quantities sold in
the local market and exported to South Africa and London. Details are
given in Annex 16 and paragraph 7.07 of the main text of this report. The
following alternatives are used:
(a) Rs 2.05/lb of made tea. This price represents the weighted
1980 average ex-factory price for all project tea assuming that
12 million lb of Mauritius tea would be exported to South
Africa.
(b) Rs 2.19/lb of made tea. This price assumes that all project
tea would be sold to South Africa.
(c) Rs 1.80/lb of made tea. This price assumes that all project
tea would be sold to the United Kingdom.
The Economic Rate of Return
11.       A summary table of the economic rate of return using alternative
prices and yields is shown below:
Price/lb (made teal        Rs 1.80          Rs 2.05      Rs 2.19
With assumed yields          12.7%           15.0%        16.1%
With 15% yield re-
duction/l                   9.6%           18.2%        13.3%
/1   Includes 5% for probable cyclone damage and 10% for other exogenous
factors and contingencies.
