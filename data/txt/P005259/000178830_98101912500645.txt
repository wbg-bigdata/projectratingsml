This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to Jordan in
September, 1979 consisting of Messrs. D. Graham (mission leader), M. Ahmed, B.
Assimakopoulos, C. Godavitarne, M. Mould, A. Pellegrini, M. Rathnam (IBRD) and
D. Gilmore (consultant). A follow-up mission comprising Messrs. Graham and
Assimakopoulos visited Jordan in April, 1980 to complete the appraisal.



JORDAN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN JORDAN
Urbanization Trends
1.01      Jordan is a highly urbanized country with about two-thirds of its
population living in urban areas.  Most of the population is concentrated in
the Amman urban region, 1/ which in 1979 contained an estimated 1.3 million
(60%) of the total East Bank population of 2.2 million.2/ Within this
region, Amman city itself accounted for about 650,000 and Zerqa for about
215,000. The only city of significant size outside the Amman region is
Irbid, with an estimated population of 115,000. No other town has a popula-
tion in excess of 50,000.
1.02      Population growth has been extremely high (Jordan has one of the
highest birth rates in the world), swollen by two waves of migrants--from
Palestine in 1948 and from the West Bank in 1967--only partly offset by the
migration of about half a million Jordanians, mainly to Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf Area, olver the past few years. Most of the growth has taken place within
the Amman urban region (average annual growth rate since 1961, 6.0%), in Amman
city itself and Zerqa and in the smaller towns within the region such as
Ruseifa, Wadi Seir and Suweilih. Provincial towns, other than Irbid which has
also experienced rapid growth, have mostly grown at rates close to the national
average of 3.0% per annum since 1970.
The Urban Economy
1.03      Growth in GDP has averaged 6.6% annually in real terms between 1972
and 1976. This rapid economic growth, the demand for labor from neighboring
energy surplus states and active immigration into Amman have resulted in a
dynamic urban economy and a changing pattern of sectoral employment. In
1975, only a fifth of the labor force of about 380,000 was engaged in agri-
culture and over 60% in the services sector, compared with 35% and 44%
respectively for 1966. Open unemployment rates are low with only 1.6% of the
1975 labor force estimated as unemployed. Labor shortages exist fDr many
categories of skilled labor. A good national and international c:ommunications
network has contributed to the growing importance of Amman as a center for
finance and commerce in the area, especially following the disburbances in
Lebanon since 1973.
1.04      However, not all urban residents have benefitted equally from this
growth.  There are serious problems of low productivity and underemploy-
ment, particularly amongst the unskilled workers living in the squatter
1/   Defined as the area within a 30 km radius of Amman city ceniter.
2/   All population estimates exclude the population of the official UNWRA
administered Palestinian refugee camps.



- 2 -
areas. Many squatter area residents work in small establishments or in
irregular jobs in the informal sector, which accounted for 40% of all employ-
ment in the Amman region in 1975. Growth has been hampered by inadequate
access to credit and training facilities. In addition, the low level of
female participation in the labor force (4%) aggravates the problem of
low household incomes.
1.05      Adequate income data are not available, but household surveys have
been carried out periodically.  The median urban household income is esti-
mated at JD 133/per month (US$450) in December 1979, and the corresponding
figure for the squatter settlements in Amman at JD 72 (US$245). A sixth of
all urban households had incomes below the Bank-defined absolute urban poverty
threshhold, estimated at JD 69 (US$235) per household per month in December
1979 prices.
Administration
1.06      Responsibility for providing municipal services to the population
of Amman city rests with the Municipality of Amman which enjoys considerable
autonomy and whose Mayor reports directly to the Prime Minister's office.
For other urban areas, including those in the suburbs outside Amman city, this
responsibility is met by local municipalities who report to the Ministry of
Municipal and Rural Affairs. This ministry also provides general guidance and
advice to all municipalities outside Amman. Municipal boundaries have not
been extended to keep pace with spatial urban growth and a number of urban
areas, particularly recently developed areas around Amman, lie outside the
boundaries of any municipality and are officially classified as "rural". The
Government is currently examining the question of municipal boundary exten-
sions to rationalize this situation. Other than central Government grants,
municipalities defray their expenses by charging a general property tax and
also levy specific charges for road construction and certain other capital
expenditure. Water supply and sewerage is a municipal responsibility except
in Amman City where a semi-autonomous organization, the Amman Water and
Sewerage Authority (AWSA), is responsible. AWSA works in close collaboration
with the technical staff of Amman Municipality, whose Mayor is also the
ex-officio chairman of the agency. Outside Amman the Water Supply Corporation
supplies water in bulk to municipalities and also provides technical and
managerial assistance when these capabilities are lacking in municipalities.
1.07      The National Housing Corporation, a public sector agency, is
responsible for the provision of housing to middle and low income groups
throughout the country. Its board of directors includes representatives of
the major public agencies and Ministries concerned with the sector and its
budget and programs are directly set by the Government.
Urban Conditions and Policies
1.08      Shelter.  Jordan is facing a substantial and growing shortage of
housing and infrastructure amenities, particularly for the lower income



- 3 -
groups in the Amman region. It has been estimated that approximaltely one-
quarter of the population of the Amman urban region live in areas of
uncontrolled housing and squatter settlements, where insecurity of tenure,
overcrowding in poor housing conditions and limited access to infrastructure
and public services are the main features. Surveys carried out during project
preparation indicated average household sizes of 9 persons, with 4 persons per
room and rents ranging from 25 to 35% of household incomes. Densities are
high--1,000 persons per hectare on some sites.
1.09      High urban land prices coupled with large minimum legal plot sizes,
restrictive planning and building regulations, and inadequate access to
established financial markets have combined to deny the low-income population
access to reasonable housing at prices they can afford. A comprehensive
urban development strategy has been lacking and the main feature of Government
policy towards the shelter needs of the poorer urban dwellers has, until
recently, been the tacit acceptance of illegal occupancy and the infringement
of building a,nd planning regulations which have not responded to changing
urban needs.  The minimum legal residential plot size in the Amman municipal
areas was until recently 300 m , although at least a quarter of the city's
residential buildi2gs are illegally constructed on smaller plots. A "popular"
plot size of 150 m was legalized in some areas in 1979. As a consequence of
their irregular status, approximately half of the residents of these areas
have been denied access to public services including water and sewerage. The
remainder of these people live in older and more established settlements where
the existing level of infrastructure and services requires less urgent atten-
tion. Improvements in living conditions in these latter areas could be
achieved through the legalization of tenure and a change in building and
planning regulations making them eligible for infrastructure and public
services.
1.10      The existing public sector housing program has proved inadequate
to cope with the growth in demand and its principal beneficiaries have been
middle-income groups, particularly civil servants, who have been provided
with subsidized accommodation by the National Housing Corporation (NHC).
Between 1965 and the end of 1978, the NHC had constructed about 9,000 housing
units. The NHC's current program, about 1,500 units every year, is based
largely on the construction of walk-up apartment blocks using industrialized
building systems. The NHC's beneficiaries are subsidized by a lc,w interest
rate (4.5%), an exemption from property taxes until the repayment period of
20 years is completed, free land when Government owned and no allocation of
administrative and operating costs by the NHC.
1.11      The main source of housing finance for the private sector is the
Housing Bank, formed in 1974, which finances most private and cooperative 1/
housing in the country and provides substantial support to NHC projects.
By the end of 1978, the Housing Bank had advanced a total of JD 82 million
1/   Cooperatives for housing finance may be formed by any group of individuals.
In practice, they are mostly formed by employees of the civil service,
Government agencies, the armed forces and the larger private corporations.



- 4 -
(US$278 million) for the construction of some 20,000 units of commercial and
residential property, including JD 8.6 million (US$29 million) on-lent to the
NHC for its programs.
1.12      The NHC and the Housing Bank account for the bulk of all insti-
tutionally financed housing in Jordan. Although reliable data on overall
housing construction are not available, there are no other major sources of
credit for private housing investment and nearly all public,sector housing
investment is channelled through the NHC.  The combined programs of the NHC
and Housing Bank have in recent years provided less than half of the 10,000
or so units required annually in the Amman urban region to satisfy the
housing demands from additional households alone. The balance has been made
up by informal sector housing construction, mainly through the expansion of
uncontrolled housing areas, and extension and densification of squatter
settlements.
1.13      Based on the current five year (1976-80) plan the demand for housing
units is expected to be around 380,000 units by end of 1980. However, only
336,000 units are expected to be available implying a shortage of 44,000
units. The annual demand for new housing is estimated at 10,000 units. The
currently planned programs for NHC and the Housing Bank will still leave a
deficiency of some 20,000 units during the project period, almost entirely for
the lower income groups. With Bank participation in the sector the housing
gap will be reduced by 5,000 units during the project period; but a significant
portion will remain to be provided by the informal sector. Given the rela-
tively high standards of much of the housing built by the informal sector, the
urgent need is to regularize its status through modifications to planning and
building regulations so that residents may acquire security of tenure and be
given access to infrastructure and urban services.
1.14      Infrastructure Services.  The development of urban infrastructure
services has been mixed and the quality of service varies both across cities
and amongst different parts of a city itself. The shortage of water is the
most serious problem. Average national consumption was estimated at 28 lpcd
in 1975 and is expected to rise to only 38 lpcd by 1985. In the squatter
areas consumption is about 10-15 lpcd. The supply of water is infrequent--once
a week in most areas--but upper income houses have substantial storage facilities
and are less 3affected than poorer areas where most dwellings are only equipped
with a 1.0 m tank. There is no public standpipe system. Households without
connections, which in squatter areas amount to more than half of households,
purchase water from their neighbors or fetch water from AWSA water trucks, Sr
purchase water from private vendors who charge them as much as JD 1.0 per m .
Sometimes as much as 10% of household income is spent on the purchase of water.
Although long-term schemes are being developed to increase supply, the cost
is expected ts be high.  The long-run marginal cost has been estimated at
JD 0.33 per m (US$1.12) for supplies from the King Talal dam and io likely to
be higher for supplies from currently envisaged sources (Azraq oasis and the
proposed Maqarin 3dam). The present average tariff for small domestic consumers
of JD 0.08 per m (US$0.27) will therefore probably be increased substantially
in real terms in future years.



1.15      Water sources currently in use in the bigger cities (tube wells)
are in danger of being contaminated due to the widespread use of pit latrines,
siltage discharge and poor solid waste management. Only Amman, Salt and Aqaba
have waterborne sewerage systems and the coverage is limited within each city.
Pit latrines and cesspits are widely used in the low-income areas and although
they seem to function efficiently, are a major concern to the auth,orities
whose policy is to replace them wherever possible with waterborne sewerage
systems. At the same time, the lack of adequate quantities of water has posed
problems for the efficient operation of waterborne sewerage systems. The
inadequacy of water supply has created a situation where the Amman sewage
treatment plant has insufficient water throughput and is overloaded biologi-
cally. As a temporary expedient to overcome this problem, some effluents are
transported by tankers to refuse dumps where no sanitary landfill takes place.
The Government is now making a major effort to expand and improve the water
supply and sewerage services in Amman. In this context, the IDA-assisted
Second Amman Water and Sewerage project currently under implementaLtion will
provide piped water supply to approximately 92,000 persons and extend the
sewerage system to more than 121,000 residents. Plans are also being final-
ized to resolve the overall water shortage problem by introducing a new supply
to Amman from the Azraq oasis and, in the long term, from the proposed Maqarin
dam.
1.16      Solid waste management in Amman, for which the Municipality is
responsible, is relatively satisfactory with house-to-house collec:tion of
solid waste and free distribution of polythene bags to households.. However,
dwellings in inaccessible areas with no vehicular access receive little of
this service and substantial quantities of refuse go uncollected, especially
in the low income areas generally located in "wadis" (river beds) where the
water extraction points are located. Besides contributing to the pollution of
water sources, uncollected refuse represents a health hazard due to the
attraction of vermin and flies. The city of Zerqa has a more organized col-
lection system where in settlements like Jena'a the residents carry the refuse
to vehicular roads on appointed days.
1.17      Power generation throughout Jordan is the responsibility of the
Jordan Electricity Authority. The distribution and sale of power, in the
larger cities, is carried out by private companies. One such company, the
Jordan Electric Power Company (JEPCO) operates in the Amman region. It is
estimated that 98% of the population of Amman and Zerqa have individual
connections which include most dwellings in the poorer areas; however, the
provision of street lighting in these areas is inadequate.
1.18      Jordan is served by a good network of roads.  In Amman City, where
responsibility for new road construction lies with the Municipality, standards
are high, although the maintenance of the older roads is inadequate and access
roads to low-income areas are often only tortuous dirt tracks. The munici-
pality does, however, construct and maintain roads in new subdivisions where
construction charges for the roads are levied.
1.19      Education and Health Services.  The provision of education and
health services is good in the urban areas. There are nine grades of com-
pulsory education. School attendance is high even in the low-income areas.



Schools are often overcrowded, work on a two-shift system and are frequently
sited in unsuitable rented premises. Health centers are less widespread but
coverage is growing, and, in the Amman area, 5 of the 7 existing health
centers serve the poorer eastern part of the city. Studies of health condi-
tions in the Amman slums carried out during project preparation indicated that
gastro-intestinal diseases were the highest cause of morbidity in the slum
communities and that health conditions could be improved by increasing the
quantity of safe water available, improving excreta disposal, reducing room
occupancy rates and extending public health education.
1.20      Employment and Vocational Training:  As mentioned earlier, the major
employment problems relate to underemployment, low productivity and the low
level of female participation in the labor force. Access to credit by
small-scale enterprises is restricted by the cautious approach of commercial
banks to lending to this sector, although good progress has been made by the
Industrial Development Bank's successful establishment, with Bank Group
assistance, of a Small-Scale Industry and Handicraft Loan Program. Vocational
training facilities and female access to marketable training are limited.
There is considerable scope for, and interest in, developing more jobs for
women and increasing their low (4%) level of participation in the labor
force. Improved female access to relevant training facilities is a pre-
requisite of this increased participation.
New Responses to Urban Needs
1.21      The 1970s have seen a steady evolution of Government policy in the
urban sector and a growing concern to find solutions to the problems of urban
poverty. Progress in developing a coherent policy to address these problems
has been gradual, due to preoccupation with the overriding needs of other
sectors, the magnitude of the problem in relation to limited resources and
the political sensitivity of some of the issues such as land ownership, water
supply and refugees. An important step in initiating a new response was the
establishment in 1976 of the Amman Urban Region Planning Group (AURPG) which
has been formulating an overall development plan for the Amman Region with
USAID assistance. The work of the AURPG has generated considerable interest
among the authorities and a series of seminars to discuss planning issues,
including housing, was held in 1979 under the chairmanship of the Prime
Minister. The recommendations of the AURPG were presented to Government at
the end of 1979 and are currently being reviewed for inclusion in the next
five vear plan, 1981-85. These recommendations include changes in the insti-
tutional and legal framework to improve planning and resource allocation in
the region and to improve delivery of basic urban services through such
actions as extension of municipal boundaries and legalization of tenure.
1.22      In terms of spatial planning, Government policy is to promote
growth outside the Amman urban region through the implementation of large-
scale development projects, such as the Potash Project in the Dead Sea area,
the Jordan Valley Irrigation Project (Stage II), the phosphatic fertilizer
complex in Wadi II near the Port of Aqaba and the expansion of the port
itself. The improvement of services and employment opportunities in the



- 7 -
smaller towns and villages Is also a key component of Government plans to slow
migration to the major cities, one aspect of which is the recent establish-
ment, with Bank assistance, of the Cities and Villages Development Bank as an
instrument to promote investment in infrastructure and small-scale industry
outside the Amman region. But these policies will take time to haLve an
appreciable impact on the growth of the Amman region and population of the
region is expected to reach 1.9 million in 1985 (or 65% of the total East
Bank population of 3.0 million forecast for that year).
1.23      A number of studies of urban infrastructure services have recently
been commissioned. In Amman, a study of the system of garbage collection
and distribution has been completed and, in Zerqa, USAID are examlLning the
possibilities for improving the sewerage network.  Amman Water ancl Sewerage
Authority (AWSA) and its consultants are studying alternative potential water
sources and a national water resorces master plan is being prepared with Bank
assistance. The transportation needs of the Amman urban region are also being
studied by consultants hired by the Government and their interim proposals for
improvements are expected in mid-1980. An organisation study of Amman munici-
pality, completed in 1979, has made recommendations for improving municipal
services.
1.24      The latest step towards formulating a policy for the urban poor
was taken in 1979 when Government commissioned the preparation study for the
project under consideration. The development of low cost replicable solutions
for the provision of infrastructure and shelter services was specifically
dealt with in the study. The issues involved in dealing with the problem were
extensively debated during project preparation by the Steering Committee set
up to supervise the study, which included representatives of all the public
agencies concerned with urban development. The adoption by Government of the
study's recommendations and their embodiment in the proposed project marks
continued progress towards the development of an overall strategy for the
resolution of pressing urban needs, which the project will assist in develop-
ing further through practical demonstration of the effectiveness of low cost
sites and services and upgrading schemes and through the studies to be carried
out under the project on planning and building regulations, land tenure
arrangements, collection of social statistics and advice to Government on
shelter serviices policy.
II. THE PROJECT
A.   ObJectives
2.01      The primary objective of the project is to provide shelter and
related infrastructure and community facilities to the lower income groups
at prices wh:Lch they can afford with a minimum of subsidies to ensure
replicability.  The project would also provide for improvements in produc-
tivity among the urban poor through the provision of loans to viable small



- 8 -
enterprises and vocational and commercial training to their employees. It
aims at increasing the low level of female participation in the labor force
through the provision of specialized and locally sited female training facili-
ties. This project is seen by the Government and the Bank as the beginning of
a longer term program to provide for shelter- and employment-related needs of
the poorer urban dwellers. Through studies of planning and building regula-
tions it seeks to regularise land tenure arrangements in areas of uncontrolled
housing so that residents of these areas may gain access to basic urban ser-
vices.  Through the provision of consultant and advisory services to the
public agencies responsible for the development of low cost housing and
infrastructure services, the project aims to strengthen their institutional
and organizational framework and assist Government in developing policies to
meet these needs.

2.03      The Project would demonstrate the feasibility of providing shelter,
related infrastructure and community facilities to the lowest income groups by
means other than conventional housing programs. It would create conditions
whereby these groups could help themselves at the pace and cost that they can
afford without subsidies. It proposes a realistic approach to development con-
trol regulations, especially with regard to plot sizes and towards regularizing
over 25% of dwellings in the project cities, presently classified as "illegal".
As a pilot project it would demonstrate that this provision of new sites and
services and slum improvements is a more cost-effective alternative to the
current public sector housing policies. The project would assist Government
in developing a longer term program to meet the needs of the urban poor
through a shift in the official urban planning approach and public investment
policies. Unit costs average a total of JD 1,870 (US$6,300) per household in
sites and services areas and JD 1,400 (US$4,750) per household in the upgrading
areas, including the cost of community facilities and off-site infrastructure.
Directly chargeable costs, which would be directly recovered through plot
sales (see paras 4.01-4.07), average JD 1,600 (US$5,420) and JD 545 (US$1,850)
respectively. About 90% of the sites and services plots and 100% of the upgrad-
ing plots would be affordable to households below the 40th percentile of the
urban income distribution (see paras 4.08-4.12).
2.04      The project would also substantially alleviate the existing housing
shortage. The 1,500 low-cost units that would be constructed annually under
the sites and services component of the project would double the number of
units provided under existing public programs and would broaden the spectrum
of beneficiaries of these programs to include the lowest income households
whose participation to date in this program has been limited. The new housing
units constructed under the project would meet about 25% of the unsatisfied
annual demand for new housing generated by new household formation in the
region, which the current formal sector programs are unable to meet. The
upgrading component of the project would improve living conditions for about a
quarter of the estimated 60,000 people living in squatter settlements in the
Amman urban region.
C.   Detailed Description
Sites and Services
2.05      Sites and services will be provided at the North Ruseifa site,
southwest of Zerqa (covering 30.2 ha, with a design population of 14,000
persons) at the Marka site northeast of Amman (covering 22.1 ha with a
design population of 10,000 persons) and the Quweismeh site in east Amman
(covering 35.4 ha with a design population of 17,000 persons). Location of
the project sites is shown in Map I. The sites were selected for low-income
beneficiaries on the basis of affordable land prices, proximity to employment
opportunities and reasonable costs for site preparation and off-site infra-
structure. Each new development site would require two new schools for the
nine grades of compulsory education as there is no available spare capacity in
existing schools nearby.



- 11 -
2.06      The North Ruseifa Site, which is about 2 km southwest of the
built-up area of Zerqa, lies north of the Zerqa-Sweileh road in i:he Muni-
cipality of Yajuz. The site comprises the remaining uncommitted section,
amounting to about 30 ha of a large area of Government land on which National
Housing Corporation apartments and a new hospital are to be built. The site
is on a ridge with 15% slopes on the north and south to dry "wadis" or valley
bottoms. Access will be obtained from the Sweileh road by a perimeter road
proposed for the NHC site. Secondary access from Zerqa would be achieved by
a road to the east (not included in the project). A high voltages transmission
line crosses the site and water will be supplied from a new well and 1500 m
of 0 200 mm rising main to an underground storage reservoir plus tower tank
shared with the NHC site. Six communal septic tanks and 2000 m long seepage
ditches will be located at the lower northern and eastern boundaries of the
site where they could later be replaced by gravity feed to a future Zerqa
sewerage system. In addition to workshop and commercial plots to be provided
on the site, employment opportunities available nearby will comprise shops
and workshops in Awaijan el Gharbi and on the main Zerqa-Amman road and in
the proposed hospital adjacent.
2.07      The Marka Site is adjacent to a large NHC apartment project under
construction, located just beyond the extreme eastern boundary of the Amman
Municipality. It is close to the interchange between the new Amman-Zerqa
highway and the eastern ring road, which would form its eastern boundary and
provide its access. It is bounded on the north by the Polytechnic and on
the south by the restricted area adjacent to the airport flightpath. Part
of the land is in Government ownership. The area generally slopes to the
northeast at a reasonable gradient to the Wadi Marka and there is a shallow
valley in the middle of the site. Water will be brought to the site from an
extension to the major pumping station and battery of wells near the site.
The project includes the cost of one new well plus pumping equipment and
500 m of 0 200 mm rising main. Waste water from the development will be
disposed of by means of 8 communal septic tanks and a 2,600 m long seepage
ditch outside the site. High voltage transmission lines run close to the site
and a substation is already constructed about 500 meters from the project.
Employment opportunities would be available on the site and alon,g the Amman-
Zerqa corridor about 3 km away and in the airport complex. Extensive
industrial dLevelopment is planned beside the ring road to the south.
2.08      The Quweismeh Site is located astride the eastern municipal boundary,
in the relatively under-developed area beyond the Hijaz railroad about 5 km
from the central business district. The northwestern half of the site, which
is within the municipality, consists of a broad valley bottom of deep alluvial
deposits, bounded by steep sides with rocky outcrops. The other half of the
site, beyond the municipal boundary, consists of southwesterly slopes averaging
about 15%. Access to the site for pedestrians, cars and smaller trucks will
be via an existing 3 m wide tunnel under the railroad about half a kilometer
to the northwest of the site, beside the inner ring road. Access for construc-
tion vehicles and eventually major traffic from the inner ring road will be



- 12 -
half a kilometer longer, passing through a high railroad viaduct and disused
quarries. Much of the latter route is proposed as a major link between the
inner and outer ring roads by the Amman Urban Region Planning Group. Water
will be supplied from tlhe water main along the Yarmouk Road about 3/4 of a
kilometer to the northwest of the site and 60% of the development will be
drained by gravity into the Amman-Wadi Umm er Rimam interceptor west of the
Hijaz railroad. The remainder will be served by 3 communal septic tanks and
1,000 m long seepage ditches. Electricity will be provided to all residential
plots and other users by means of three 500 KVA substations located on the
project site. Two 1750 m long underground cables will link the project area
with the power supply lines along Yarmouk Road. Employment opportunities
would be provided by the commercial and workshop plots on site and those
nearest to the site would be related to the freight and trucking activities,
along the inner ring road, and stonecutting in some of the quarries.
2.09      Land Acquisition.  Land for the project site at Quweisimeh and most
of the site at Marka is in private ownership and will have to be acquired
either by negotiated purchase or expropriation. The remaining land at Marka
and the site at Ruseifa are owned by the Government. The Cabinet has author-
ized the Municipality of Amman to acquire the land needed for development of
the project sites. During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that
the Municipality will acquire each of the project sites prior to the date
when work is scheduled to commence on each site, as indicated in the project
implementation schedule (Annex -II). To do this the Municipality will
commence negotiations with the existing owners immediately upon signature
of the Loan Agreement. If negotiations for land acquisition have not been
successfully concluded four months prior to the date specified for acquisi-
tion, the Municipality will issue an expropriation order to ensure timely
acquisition of each site. With these assurances, site development should be
able to proceed as scheduled.
2.10      Site Layout and Land Use.  Layouts for each site have been designed
to ensure the most effective use of land and infrastructure. Most residential
plots would be provided with pedestrian access only. Vehicular access would
be limited to primary roads and culs-de-sac with turning areas, providing ser-
vice to within 40 m of every plot. Residential areas are distributed in sucq
a way as to provide primary road frontage to all the larger plots (150-300 m )
which would bear a greater part of the total infrastructure cost. Some of
these could develop into commercial outlets. The balance of primary road or
cul-de-sac frontage would be given over to 100 m plots developed with a
2-room core house. Land would be differentially priced according to its
location and accessibility. Land use is shown in Table II-1. and in Map II.
2.11      Plot Size and Plot Development.  Some 1,606 residential plots would
be developed at North RuseTfa, 1,208 plots at Marka and 2,049 at Quweismeh. A
uniform plot size of 100 m would be provided for ldw-income beneficiaries

(4,135 plots) and large plots of 150 m2 (679 plots) and 300 m2 (49 plots)
would be offiered for sale at market prices. All plots would have individual
water supply and sewerage connections. Sewage disposal would be to communal
septic tanks and seepage ditches at North Ruseifa, Marka and the southern
corner of Quweismeh but the Amman sewerage system would serve the larger
section of Quweismeh. A low-tension electricity network would bring
electricity to the boundary of every plot, while street lighting would be
provided on all vehicular roads, culs-de-sac and footpaths. Solid waste would
be collected from refuse bins located on-street within 40 m of every plot.
Bins and garbage collection vehicles are provided under the project for this
purpose.
2.12      In addition to the above basic infrastructure, all 100 m2 plots
would be provided with a sanitary core consisting of a concrete block en-
closure, located at the front of the plot. It would contain a water storage
tank on the roof,2a pour-flush toilet and water taps both inside and outside.
Some 20% of 100 m  plots would have no further superstructure, apart from ;ront
fence walls and the benefit of the adjoining party walls of the single 9 m
rooms, that would be constructed on altern~te plots. Additional single room
core houses, on a further 45% of the 100 m  plots would be developed in pair
to form duplexes. Two-room duplexes would be located on the remaining 100 m
plots. All structural components would be built to support a second storey
and building loans would be made available to plot allottees to enable them
to enlarge their houses in stages (see sketch II). The house designs respect
local custom for privacy by including front walls and opening alL windows onto
a private court at the rear--thereby making an economical 2 m wide footpath
access to the plot acceptable. The various plot options are shown in Table
IV-i which also indicates chargeable costs and affordability. The average
unit cost per plot (and per household) for land (including the value of
government land), on-site infrastructure, core housing and building loans,
including physical contingencies, design and supervision and project manage-
ment, would amount to JD 1,600 (US$5,420). The minimum plot option, including
a building loan, would be priced at JD 1,300 (US$4,400), which is affordable
to 90% of the urban population. Workshop and commercial plots are described
in para. 2.22.
2.13      Education, Health and Community Facilities.  The project would
provide for the construction of one boys' school and one girls' school at
each of the three sites. The schools would combine primary and preparatory
levels to cater for the 9 grades of compulsory education in Jordan. The
schools would work double shifts but additional area has been set aside to
allow for future expansion in the event of the introduction of single shift
working in Jordanian schools. This area will be used as public open space
until that time and following the introduction of single-shift working, the
less prolonged use made of the enlarged school playing fields would facilitate
their dual use as public recreation areas. A similar approach would be
followed for the health centers to be built on each of the three sites.
Initial provision would be for a basic primary health care center with
maternal and health care facilities. An open space beside would allow for
expansion at: a later stage to a comprehensive health center.

Upgrading
2.14      Location and Size of Sites.  The four areas selected for upgrading
were chosen as representing the worst urban housing conditions in Jordan with
a high proportion, about 50%, of families with incomes below the absolute
poverty level. These areas were settled illegally, mainly after the 1948 and
1967 wars, although one site, East Wahdat, has only been settled in the past
few years. Squatting took place wherever privately owned land stood vacant
due to steep terrain or other constraints. Two of the project sites are
adjacent to Palestinian refugee camps. The East Wahdat site covers 8 ha
adjacent to Wahdat Refugee Camp at the southeast edge of Amman's built-up
area. On the northern fringes of the city, at roughly opposite ends of the
extensive Jebel Hussein Refugee Camp, the Wadi Haddadah and Nuzha sites
together account for about 5 ha. The Wadi Umm er Rimam site, comprising
5 ha, is located near the eastern edge of Amman, where the built-up area is
generally constrained by the Hijaz railroad and the inner ring road. Within
half a kilometer to the south of the central business district, the Jofeh site
occupies a hilltop of about 3 ha (see Map I).
2.15      Physical Characteristics.  Most of the sites are on the steeply
sloping ground which characterizes the edges of the hills or "Jebels" over
which Amman spreads. Jofeh is on high ground, but the remainder of the sites
are located in valley bottoms which can be insanitary and subject to flooding
in wet weather. Some of the slopes are so steep that the ground floors of
upper-level houses, hewn out of the rock, are on the same level and almost
touching the roofs of the houses below.  The condition of the houses and the
availability of infrastructure is directly affected by the security of tenure
which varies across settlements. Corrugated metal and timber frame huts at
East Wahdat contrast with the mud and cement block walls and metal roofs
common elsewhere (see photographs). Apart from East Wahdat, which has no in-
frastructure at all, about 75% of the houses elsewhere are connected to elec-
tricity, about 50% to water and less than 5% to sewers. Whilst no community
facilities are to be found within the settlements for upgrading, the adjacent
areas provide convenient access to schools and additional schools are not
proposed under the project. However, the availability of medical facilities
is inadequate and small health clinics would be constructed on each site.
2.16      Problems to be Remedied.  Roads are rare in the squatt,er areas and
vehicular penetration of any form can be up to 100 m distant from dwellings,
making reasonable access for essential services virtually impossible.
Footpaths vary widely from steep rock in parts of Jofeh or dirt lpassageways
in East Wahd[at, to well-formed concrete footpaths with steps where needed in
parts of Nu2ha. The Municipality endeavours to maintain a reasonable solid
waste collection service to all areas using one-way plastic bags. However,
there is no street cleaning service and large amounts of garbage tend to
accumulate in the streets, in vacant land and especially in the dry wadis.
The main problem in most areas is a lack of adequate sanitation. Although
main sewers pass through or adjacent to most of the squatter areas, only a
small minority of the inhabitants, who have succeeded in purchasing their
plots, have been able to obtain connections. The absence of any drainage or



- 18 -
sewerage system has resulted in widespread use of cesspools or simple pit
latrines. Sullage is emptied outside houses and flows down the footpaths,
steps or wadis where it is sometimes joined by sewage from cesspools. The
widespread use of cesspools is considered to be one of the main causes of
pollution to the acquifer. Connection to water, as already noted, is somewhat
more usual but many households have to buy water from neighbors or small
tankers. Electrical connections are usually more widespread, except in East
Wahdat, but footpath lighting is rare and the many steps can present a
serious hazard. Seasonal flooding of the wadis, which are frequently used
for access or recreation, is a serious problem, especially at Wadi Haddadah
where it causes occasional loss of life.
2.17      Proposed Improvements.  The minimum cost improvements proposed for
the four sites have been designed to meet the expressed priorities of the
inhabitants and at the same time to be affordable to residents without
subsidies. After security of tenure, improved sanitation was the first
priority and the extension of the waterborne sewerage system within these
areas was evaluated as the least cost method of achieving the desired result
while at the same time using existing off-site facilities which are under-
utilized. The proposed improvements (see Maps III and IV for layouts of East
Wahdat and Wadi Haddadah) would include the transfer of freehold title to
existing residents and would generally comprise the following:
(a) Surfaced roads (5.5 m) with turning areas brought to within
40 m of about 75% of houses.
(b) Surfaced footpaths (2 m wide) with steps where necessary,
to link all houses to roads and small landscaped play areas.
(c) Communal containers for solid waste collection to be located on
roads for easy vehicular access and to be serviced by garbage
collection vehicles provided under the project.
(d) Sanitary sewers connected to the town system, following foot-
paths and roads, providing the possibility for all households to be
connected to the system over time. Sullage traps where necessary
at the edge of the area.
(e) Water supply and rationalization of the distribution network with
connections to houses and fire hydrants.
(f) Rationalization of the electricity distribution network and
household connections plus street and footpath security lighting.
(g) Limited improvement to existing wadis, providing
realignment where necessary, crossing, or culverting
where a wadi is a major flood hazard.
(h) Provision of loans for home improvements. Loans
averaging JD 150 per household would be made available.

(i)  Introduction of community facilities comprising at each
site a new clinic, a community center and a small
training and employment center for women.
(j)  Development of larger serviced plots with commercial
potential, at suitable locations at the edges of the
settlement, to be sold at market prices generating
a surplus for the program.
2.18      The chargeable costs and affordability of these improvements are
shown in Table IV.2. The average price per plot for land, on-site infrastruc-
ture and building loans, including physical contingencies and design and super-
vision, would amount to JD 545 (US$1,850).
2.19      In East Wahdat, where temporary Tetal structures prevail on
relatively large plots (average size 150 m ), reblocking and use of vacant
land will enable about 83 infill plots to be provided. The majority of
these plots (72) would be similar to those in the sites and service areas
(100 m ) with provision of sanitary cores (6 plots), sanitary core plus
one room (33 plots) or sanitjry core plus 2 rooms (33 plots). The remaining
plots would be larger (190 m ) and would be sold by auction. All existing
plots in East Wahdat (394 plots) would be provided with a sanitary core.
There would also be provision on the site of 40 workshops and 20 shops. A
smaller number of infill plots would be provided on two other sites: Wadi Umm
er Rimam, 37 plots, and Jofeh, 30 plots.
2.20      Land Acquisition.  Land in the upgrading areas is in private
ownership and would be acquired either by negotiations or under the existing
expropriation procedures of the Municipality of Amman. Unofficial transac-
tions of small plots on some of the upgrading sites may have taken place and
will require close attention for their expeditious resolution. To minimize
this problem the project agency will carry out occupancy and ownership
registration surveys of each of the upgrading sites immediately. A detailed
program for the acquisition of land at these sites, was agreed during negotia-
tions. Assurances were obtained that acquisition of each site would be
completed prior to the date when works are scheduled to commence (see Annex-IT).
The Municipality undertook to acquire all rights in respect of land required
for carrying out of works as follows: East Wahdat by February 28, 1981; Wadi
Um er Rimam by May 31, 1981; Wadi Haddadah/Nuzha by June 30, 1981 and Jofeh by
July 31, 1981. To do this the Municipality will commence negotiations with
the existing owners immediately upon signature of the Loan Agreement. If
negotiations for land acquisition have not been successfully concluded four
months prior to the date specified for acquisition, the Municipality will
issue an expropriation order to ensure timely acquisition of each site. With
these assurances, site development should be able to proceed as scheduled.
Small Business Assistance and Manpower Training Program
2.21      The project includes (i) serviced sites for shops and workshops,
some with preconstructed core units, (ii) loans to small businesses for
workshop construction, equipment and working capital, (iii) vocational training
for males and females, and (iv) extension services for small businesses.



- 21 -
2.22      Some 257 workshop sites and 170 retail shop sites of various sizes
would be developed for sale in the new development areas and the East Wahdat
upgrading area. Of these, 52 workshops and 150 retail shops would have
completed core units to help define the commercial areas and attract initial
business activity. Loans totalling JD 125,000 (US$424,000) would be provided
under the project through the Housing Bank to finance private construction of
shops and workshops on about half of the remaining plots.
2.23      A line of credit of JD 250,000 (US$850,000) would be established
through the Industrial Development Bank's Small Scale Industry and Handicraft
Loan Fund, which has received previous IDA assistance (Cr 646-JOR). This
will be used to provide loans to small businesses for expansion and for new
projects. The maximum loan size would be JD 4,000 (US$13,560) per enterprise,
but the average individual loan would be about JD 1,200 (US$4,070). These
demand estimates are based on surveys carried out in the project areas,
typical wor'kshop and shop designs and experience of similar schemes. These
loans would bear an effective interest rate of 9% and would have a maximum
repayment period of 5 years.
2.24      The Vocational Training Corporation (VTC) which is responsible for
non-institutional vocational and technical training in Jordan, would administer
a program of vocational training on the project sites. In Quweismeh, where no
vocational facility exists, a low-cost vocational training center with an
annual output of 90-120 students would be constructed under the project. The
center will offer pre-employment and apprenticeship training to youths, and
upgrading courses for unskilled workers in the fields of automotive repair
and maintenance, carpentry and building trades in which shortages now exist.
2.25      Increased female participation in the labor force requires their
being trained in marketable skills. Recent studies have shown that social
customs necessitate a specially tailored program for female training which
involves facilities being set up close to beneficiaries- homes. Therefore,
it is proposed to set up female training facilities in one of the demon-
stration houses to be built on each new development site and in small centers
on three upgrading sites. Initially, the training program would concentrate
on dressmaking and child. care, for which a demand exists, with training in
other fields of specialization, including handicrafts, retail trade and
component assembly, to be developed during project execution. I'his program
would be seen as experimental and maximum flexibility would be retained in
length of cDurses and types of training. The VTC would administer the program
and provide the four instructors required to staff it; 250-300 students would
be trained every year.
2.26      An Economic Development Extension Service Unit would be set up
within the project implementing agency during the first year of project
execution to provide technical assistance to small business, promote the
vocational training and small loans programs, liaise with relevant agencies
in project implementation and monitor and evaluate program progress. It
would comprise of four professional staff including a management expert who
would head the unit, a technical officer for small industry assistance, a



- 22 -
male training officer and a female employment/training officer who would
coordinate the vocational training programs. These staff could be seconded
from the IDB and VTC for a fixed duration.
Consultant and Advisory Services
2.27      Consultant and advisory services would be provided for final design
and supervision of the project (21 man-months of foreign consulting services
and 350 man-months of local consulting services) and for the following purposes
(terms of reference acceptable to the Government and the Bank have been
prepared for all services):
(a) Support to the project executing agency. Provision has been
made for consultants' advisory services to the project agency
in the field of urban planning, community development, monitor-
ing and evaluation, financial management, estate management and
site maintenance services, amounting to 110 man-months in all.
(b) A total of 33 man-months of advisory services in social
planning and statistics is provided to improve the information
base for Government decisions on urban policy issues and assist
in the development of an overall housing strategy for Jordan,
including a study of interest rates in the housing sector.
(c) To provide assistance in improving planning and building
regulations and land tenure arrangements (8 man-months). The study
would review existing regulations, rules and procedures governing
plot sizes, building standards and registration of land ownership
and recommend appropriate changes to bring actual standards and
legal requirements closer to one another.
(d) Preparation of follow-up project (40 man-months).
(e) Training of Municipal staff in urban management practices
(26 man-months).
III. PROJECT COSTS, EXECUTION AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
3.01     The total project cost including contingencies and Waxes 1/ is estima-
ted at JD 17.0 million (US$57.6 million) with a foreign exchange component of
JD 4.7 million (US$16.0 million) or nearly 28% of project costs. Summary cost
estimates are given in Table II-1 and detailed cost estimates in Annex 1. The
base cost estimates are in December, 1979 prices. Cost estimates are based on:
(a) preliminary designs for sites and services and upgrading;
1/   Import duties and taxes are estimated at JD 0.7 million (US$2.3 million)



- 23 -
(b) unit costs of similar works recently under execution
in Jordan;
(c)  prices obtained from the Department of Lands and Surveys in
Amnman of recent land transactions in the project areas; and
(d)  prices obtained from the Municipality of Amman for municipal
services equipment.
3.02      Consultant services provided under the project amount to (a) US$1.4
million for assistance to the project unit (110 man-months of expatriate
consultants), (b) US$1.8 million for design and supervision (21 man-months
of expatriate consultants and 350 man-months of local consultants), which
amounts to 5.7% of civil engineering and construction costs included under
the project, and (c) US$1.2 million for technical assistance for preparation
of a second project, a study of planning and building regulations, improving
the information base for Government decisions on shelter services policy and
training of local staff (107 man-months of expatriate consultants). The
average man-month cost of expatriate consultants, including salary, costs,
fees, intern,ational travel and subsistence, is expected to be about US$12,300,
while the average man-month cost for local consultants is expected to be
US$4,300.
3.03     Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% of infrastructure
base costs for sites and services and 15% of infrastructure costs for upgrad-
ing. No physical contingencies have been included for building material
loans, small business credit, technical assistance and project management.
Price contingencies take into account the projected implementation schedule
and likely increase in construction costs, material and equipment during the
execution of the project. For both internationally and domestically procured
equipment and civil works a price increase of 10.5% has been estimated for
1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% per annum thereafter.
B. Execution
3.04      The timing and scope of work for consultants to prepare final design
and tender documents was agreed during negotiations. Construction drawings
and tender documents for the first site (sites and services at Quweismeh) are
to be ready for review by the Government and the Bank by the end of December
1980. Tenders will be invited by March 1, 1981 and, allowing 60 days for bid
preparation and a further 30 days for evaluation, it is envisaged that the
first contriact would be awarded in May 1981, allowing site works to commence
by July 1, 1981. The project would be implemented in about four years, with
an additional 6 months for completion of payments and withdrawal of the loan
proceeds. The expected completion date is June 30, 1985 and the closing date
December 31, 1985. An implementation schedule is shown in Annex II-.
3.05     The Urban Development Department (UDD) within the Municipality of
Amman will be the primary executing agency with overall project responsibili-
ties (see paragraphs 5.12-5.18). Table III-I lists all agencies involved in
the implementation, maintenance and operation of the project components.

C. Financing
3.06     The proposed IBRD loan of US$21.0 million (JD 6.2 million) will be
used to finance about 36% of total project costs or 38% of project costs net
of taxes. The loan will cover 100% of estimated foreign exchange costs
(US$16.0 million) and about US$5.0 million equivalent of local costs.  As the
proportion of foreign exchange costs is low (28%), iocal cost financing is
recommended to enable the Bank to make a reasonably significant contribution
to this first project aimed directly at improving the living conditions and
productivity of the urban poor. This will greatly assist the Government's
new initiatives in a sector that has long been neglected and suffered from
inadequate budget allocations. The Government will provide US$11.9 million
(JD 3.5 million), and the Housing Bank of Jordan, US$24.7 million (JD 7.3
million). The project financing plan is summarized in Table III-2 below.

3.07     The Government of Jordan will make the proceeds of the IBRD loan and
its own contribution, except for the small business credit (JD 0.25) to be
administered by IDB, available to the Housing Bank, which will add its own
contribution and administer all project finances, (see Chart III-2, Flow of
Funds). Project finances received by the Housing Bank as loans will amount to
JD 4.1 million (US$13.9 million) which, together with its own contribution of
JD 7.3 milliLon (US$24.7 million) will be used for land acquisition (excluding
land for Cornmunity Centers and Training Centers), on-site infrastructure,
housing core units and building material loans, all of which will be recovered
from the beneficiaries through plot sales and material loans.  In all, 67% of
project cost's will be directly recovered from beneficiaries. The remaining
funds flowing through the Housing Bank, JD 5.35 million (US$18.1 million) for
community facilities (including land), off-site infrastructure, municipal
services equipment, technical assistance and training will not be directly
recovered from beneficiaries and the cost of the completed assets will be
credited as budgetary grant allocations to the responsible Government agencies.
3.08     In addition to a project agreement between the Bank on the one part
and the Municipality of Amman, the Housing Bank and the IDB on the other part,
subsidiary 'Loan agreements would be entered into between the Government and
the Housing Bank and IDB. Signature of the subsidiary loan agreements, which
will be satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition of Loan effectiveness. The
terms and conditions for loan repayments by the Housing Bank to the Government
would be 8.25% over 20 years with a 4 year grace period.   The terms and
conditions of the JD 0.25 million (US$0.85 million) to be on-lent by the
Government to the IDB would be 6.5% over 10 years, including a 3 year grace
period.

and sanitary sewer systems, and community facilities would be procured through
International Competitive Bidding in accordance with Bank guidel:Lnes. Municipal
services equipment and furniture and equipment for community facilities worth
JD 0.9 million (US$3.1 million) would also be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. For bid evaluation
purposes, a 15% margin of preference or an amount equal to customs duties,
whichever is lower, would be applied to the equipment component of domestic
bids offering locally manufactured goods.
3.11     Contracts for civil works for upgrading areas totalling JD 1.4
million (US$4.8 million) would be individually small and dispersed. Because
of the need to synchronize the construction of all infrastructur,e with on-going
community activities in those areas, contractors would be permitted to group
lots, when practicable, and bid on the package. Such contracts are likely to
attract only, small local contractors and would be procured on the basis of
locally advertised competitive bidding and in accordance with procedures
satisfactory, to the Bank.
3.12     Building material loans with an estimated total worth of JD 1.15
million (US$3.9 million) would be awarded to project beneficiaries through
the Housing Bank. Small business loans amounting to JD 0.25 million (US$0.85
million) would be provided to project beneficiaries by the IDB. Consultant
services amounting to JD 1.3 million (US$4.4 million) would be procured
individually by the agencies responsible for the implementation of various
project components on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
3.13     Disbursement from the Bank loan proceeds would be made on the
following terms:
(a) 38% of total expenditures for civil work contracts;
(b) 5()% of payments made by HB and IDB under loans to beneficiaries
for building materials and to small-scale businesses for shops
and workshops construction and for raw materials and equipment;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported furniture and
equipment; or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured furniture and equipment to be used for municipal
services and community facilities; and
(d)  100% of expenditures for consultants' services.
3.14     Under the small business credit scheme the Bank would reimburse 50%
of the loans made by IDB each quarter up to the agreed total.  Disbursements
against bui:Lding material loans will be made on the basis of statements of
expenditureis certified by the Project Director. All supporting documentation
for building material loans will be retained by the Housing Bank and will be
available for inspection by the Bank during the course of project supervision.
The same procedures will apply for small business loans provided by IDB.



- 28 -
3.15     The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Table III-3.  Any
undisbursed balance at the end of the project implementation period would,
with prior approval of the Bank, be disbursed through the Housing Bank and
IDB to provide further building material loans and small business loans, if
the demand warrants. Otherwise, any surplus arising at the completion of the
project would be cancelled.

E. Accounts and Audits
3.16     During negotiations it was agreed that the executing agencies will
maintain separate project accounts and that the project agency will prepare
quarterly progress reports and project financial statements for submission to
the Bank not later than six weeks after the end of each quarter. The project
agency will prepare an annual report including financial statements for the
project, audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank, for submission to the



- 29 -
Bank not later than six months after the close of each financial year. The
auditor's opinion would also cover reimbursement claims by the HB and IDB
against statements of expenditures. Assurances were also received that not
later than s:Lx months after the close of each financial year, suitable finan-
cial information including cash flow statements and balance sheets as of the
year end, accompanied by a report on the accounts and statements by an auditor
acceptable to the Bank, will be submitted to the Bank by the Housing Bank and
the IDB for the whole of their activities as well as for the project. This is
in accordance with the existing practice of these two institutions.
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.17      In view of the innovative nature of some of the project components,
the impact of the project upon beneficiaries will be monitored to test the
response to the various options available under the sites and services and
upgrading schemes. Monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of
the UDD, which will be appropriately staffed to carry out this task (see para.
5.15) and which will include in its quarterly progress reports key indicators
of the extent to which the project is meeting its objectives. Detailed
monitoring of the impact of the project on certain beneficiary characteristics
(e.g. health, employment and income) will be undertaken at selected sites in
conjunction with the Population Council, which is already carrying out similar
research in low incomes areas in Jordan.
IV. COST RECOVERY

4.01     Cost recovery sources for project components are as follows:

(4)  Off-site infrastructure
(a) Water supply                    User charges
(b) Sewerage                        User charges
(c) Roads                           Partly through municipal property

1/ Except where applicable to non-recoverable items, e.g., schools.



- 31 -
4.02     Costs recovered from beneficiaries through plot charges will include
the cost of land to be purchased under the project and the value of Government
land to be provided, but not included in project costs, as well as costs of
site preparation, on-site infrastructure, on-plot development, design and
supervision and project management. Land, site preparation and infrastructure
costs relating to schools, health and community centers, vocational training
facilities and areas reserved for mosques would be charged to budgets of the
institution providing these services and would not be directly recovered from
beneficiaries. Basic plot charges in the sites and services areas would be
differentiated to take into account plot accessibility, road frontage and
commercial potential.  Basic charges in the upgrading areas would depend only
on plot size, except for the new infill plots which are differentiated to
reflect their location.
4.03     The larger residential plots (i.e. those over 100 m 2) are to be sold
for cash at imarket prices. For all other residential plots in the sites and
services and upgrading sites a 5% minimum down payment would be required (see
table IV-1). The balance would be paid through equal monthly installments at
an interest rate of at least 8.5% over not more than 20 years.  This financial
charge of 8.5% includes a 0.75% life insurance premium for the beneficiary to
provide funds for loan repayment in the case of the beneficiary's death. The
detailed procedures for recovery of payments from beneficiaries, particularly
late payments, were agreed at negotiations. Freehold titles would be granted
to plotholders in the sites and services schemes on occupancy and would be
transferable from the outset, although the Housing Bank would have first
option to repurchase these plots at prevailing prices within the first five
years of occupancy.  In the slum upgrading areas, the arrangements would be
the same. Building material loans to project beneficiaries wouldl be recovered
at 8.5% over 20 years.
4.04     The interest charge of 8.5% is the market rate of interest for
long-term housing loans in Jordan and is positive in real terms wqhen related
to the projected rate of inflation of 8% per annum in 1981 and 1982 (inflation
was 7% in 1978, 12% in 1979 and is projected at 10% for 1980). It represents
a substantial increase over the 4.5% interest rate now charged by the National
Housing Corporation (which does not provide life insurance coverage for bene-
ficiaries). The Housing Bank charges market-related rates to its beneficiaries
and its current lending rate for individual middle-income borrowers is also
8.5%.  The government recognizes the current disparity of interest rates in
the housing sector and intends to carry out a review of interest rates during
the project period. During loan negotiation agreement was reached that
government would undertake the interest rate study as part of the study of
overall housing strategy to be financed under the project. The study would be
completed by mid-1982 and made available to the Bank for review and comments.
4.05      Since the cost of on-site water and sewerage infrastructure (includ-
ing connections) will be recovered from beneficiaries through plot charges,
AWSA and WSC will waive their normal connection fees. The fees to be waived
are the charge of 25% of the value of the property in the year of installation
and the charge of 4% per annum for 20 years of the value of the property. How-
ever, the beneficiary will be required to pay the meter installation charge.



- 32 -
4.06     For commercial plots and preconstructed shop and workshop units,
costs would be recovered at the Housing Bank's normal lending rate to commer-
cial enterprises, that is, 10% interest over 10 years with an initial down
payment of 20%. This is considered to be the market rate of interest for
commercial loans. Loans for additional workshop and shop construction would
be recovered on the same basis. During negotiations it was agreed that, to
help ensure that commercial plots are put to the use intended and that the
benefits accrue to eligible project beneficiaries, the Municipality of Amman
would have the first option to purchase these plots. Should it exercise this
option, it would make the plots available to the beneficiaries on the same
terms described above through a rental purchase agreement whereby the benefi-
ciary would acquire ownership at the end of the 10 year repayment period.
Loans to small businesses for equipment and working capital under the Indus-
trial Development Bank's Small Scale Industry and Handicraft Program (SSIHP)
would be recovered at 8% interest over a maximum of five years. This rate
charged by the SSIHP is below the rate charged to larger enterprises, but an
additional service charge of JD 15 (US$50) per year increases the effective
financial charge to 9% for the average loan of JD 1,200 (US$4,070).
4.07     Assurances were obtained during negotiations that terms and condi-
tions for cost recovery from beneficiaries would be as above. Seventy-seven
percent of project costs of the upgrading schemes and 68% of the cost of the
sites and services schemes are recovered directly through plot charges and
through the sale of commercial, industrial and larger residential plots. The
balance represents (a) costs for non-recoverable items such as schools, health
clinics, vocational training centers (which serve a larger population than
that resident in the project sites) and technical assistance, amounting to
20% for the upgrading and 30% for the sites and services areas, and (b) costs
of off-site infrastructure improvements not chargeable to plots but partly
recovered through user charges and property taxes (about 2% for both sites
and services and upgrading).
B. Affordability and Income Distribution
4.08     Table IV-1 indicates plot options, monthly charges and percentiles
reached in the sites and service schemes. It has been assumed that beneficiary
families would devote a relatively high proportion of income (25%) to housing.
This reflects (a) the high value attached to land ownership in Jordan and the
recognition that land is a rapidly appreciating asset and (b) the inclusion of
utility payments and property tax in total housing expenditure. The cheapest
plot option inclusive of building material loan repayments, would be affordable
to 90% of the urban population of Amman. Beneficiary selection criteria would
include the income of beneficiaries to correspond to the percentage ranges
indicated in Table IV-1. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the selection criteria adopted will be satisfactory to the Bank.
4.09     In the slum upgrading area, monthly payments would average 9% of
household income for existing plots and would not exceed 20% for new families
occupying infill plots. If utility charges are included, payments as a pro-
portion of income would increase by about 3%. Table IV-2 indicates plot
options, charges, monthly repayments and percentiles reached.
4.10     Chart IV-1 provides a comparison between the estimated household
income distribution in the project areas and the overall urban income



- 33 -
distribution.. This graph shows that about 45% of sites and services bene-
ficiaries ancl about 55% of upgrading beneficiaries are below the absolute
urban poverty level (estimated at JD 69 per household per month in December
1979 prices).

4.11     These facts mitigate to some extent the relatively high level of
unit costs for project development. For the sites and services component
costs average JD 6.8 per m  (US$23) for land (including the value of Govern-
ment land), site preparation and on-site infrastructure, including physical
contingencies, design and supervision and project management. On plot
development costs range from JD 275 (US$930) for a sanitary core only to JD
1,100 (US$3,730) for a sanitary core and two rooms. Plot prices have been
differentiated to reflect location, type of access and size of plot, enabling
the smallest plots with footpath access and sanitary cores only to be sold at
a price of JD 875 (US$2,970), excluding a building loan and contingencies for
default. For the upgrading areas, the corresponding figure for costs of land,
site preparation and on-site infrastructure, including design and supervisipn,
physical contingencies and project management, av rages about JD 11.6 per m
(US$39.3), which has been reduced to JD 4.1 per m (US$13.9) to enable plots
to be affordable to beneficiaries by deducting the surplus from the 2sale of
commercial and large residential plots. A medium size plot of 90 m would
sell for2JD 370 (US$1,250), while the average of the smallest range of plots
(30-49 m ) would be priced at JD 165 (US$560) which, together with a building
loan of JD 125 (US$425), would be affordable to 96% of the urban population.
4.12      The two main reasons for higM unit costs are the much higher cost of
land in Jordan, JD 4.2 (US$14.2) per m of marketable area in the sites and
servi es areas (including the value of Government land) and JD 8.1 (US$27.5)
per m in the upgrading areas, as compared with many other countries which the
Bank has assisted in urban projects, and, secondly, a relatively large average
plot size and high level of on-plot development. High unit costs are,
therefore, a factor which deserves special mention, but are considered
acceptable in view of the high level of cost recovery (77% for upgrading and
68% for sites and services) and the project's affordability to the majority of
the urban poor. Furthermore, experience with similar projects in Amman
indicates that beneficiaries are likely to develop their plots intensively,
adding rooms for rental purposes. This will further reduce unit costs per
household and improve affordability although no account is taken of this in
the above analysis which is conservatively based on single family occupancy
for all new plots.
V. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND FINANCE
5.01      The organization of the proposed project can be summarized as follows.
(Chart V-1 shows the responsibilities of the various agencies).  The main part
of project funds (98%) would be channelled through the Housing Bank which
would act as disbursement agency for the project and would also recover plot
charges and building loans from beneficiaries.  The overall executing agency
will be the Urban Development Department (UDD) of the Municipality of Amman.

The UDD would be directly responsible for physical implementation of all
project components and for coordination with other agencies of design, opera-
tion, maintenance and policy measures associated with the project. The
overall monitoring of policy and development of strategies and future projects
would be undertaken by the Ministerial Development Committee, on which are
represented all the agencies involved in project execution. AWSA will be
responsible for supply of water and operation and maintenance of sewerage
services to the upgrading sites and the new sites in Quweismeh and Marka,
while WSC and the Municipality of Ruseifa will supply the same services to
the new site at Ruseifa. Other municipal services and maintenance will be
provided by the Municipalities of Amman (all sites except Ruseifa) and Ruseifa.
The Jordan Electric Power Company (JEPCO) will supply electricity to all
sites. AWSA, WSC and JEPCO will each appoint a liaison officer from their
staff to work with the UDD during project design and implementation to
ensure agreement on standards of design and completed works. The Industrial
Development Bank would administer the loans to small-scale enterprises and
the Vocational Training Corporation would undertake the operation of the
vocational training center. The schools and health centers provided under the
project would be staffed and maintained by the Ministries of Education and
Health respectively. Community centers would be maintained by the Ministry of
Social Development and areas reserved for mosques on the new development sites
would be charged to the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
A.   The Housing Bank
5.02      The Housing Bank of Jordan, established in April 1974 by the provi-
sion of "Housing Bank Law No. 4", has become, within a period of 4 years, a
fully operational institution with a paid-up capital of JD 12 million (US$40
million), total assets of JD 87 million (US$295 million), loan commitments of
JD 61 million (US$207 million), deposits of JD 62 million (US$210 million) and
21 branches. The Housing Bank is the main savings institution in the country.
Its rapid growth is summarized in the table below.

5.03      The primary objective of the Housing Bank is to mobilize savings
from the public to finance the construction of housing for individuals in all
income categories, with the emphasis on the low- to middle-income group. The
Housing Bank may also lend to housing cooperatives, housing funds, and other
housing entities and take equity participation in construction-related indus-
tries and real estate development projects.
5.04      The institution has been given a number of substantial fiscal and
other privileges, including Government guarantee of all deposits and tax
exemption for interest on deposits, which have assisted its rapid growth.
5.05      The Housing Bank is a mixed public-private sector institution
operated on a commercial basis. Current ownership is 54% private and 46%
public. Presently around 50% of the institution is owned by foreigners (8.3%
each by the governments Qatar, Oman and Iran (public) and 25% by the Kuwait
Real Estate Investment Corporation (private)).
5.06      The financial performance of the Housing Bank has been impressive.
The institution has shown profits since it commenced operations. In 1978 it
showed a net profit of 11% on net worth and a dividend of 9% was paid. (A
minimum dividend of 6% is guaranteed by the Government.) The debt equity
ratio is currently 6:1.
5.07      The Housing Bank's deposits as a percentage of total banking system
deposits have risen from 2.4% in 1974 to 15.3% in December 1978. Around 90%
of the deposits are short-term. Rates paid on deposits average 5.5-6% per
annum. The Housing Bank has JD 8.6 million (US$29 million) in loans from the
Central Bank, carrying interest at the rate of 4% per annum. These funds are
on-lent to the Housing Corporation at 4-1/2% per annum, repayment being
guaranteed by the Government.
5.08      Lending rates to the private sector range from 7.5% for cooperatives
and farmers, through 8.5% for individual borrowers to 10% for loans to
commercial enterprises, averaging 9% which provides the Housing Bank with a
gross spread of 3-3.5% between its cost of borrowing and lending. The
quality of the portfolio is good. Levels of default on loan payments have
been consistently low (less than 0.03%). Currently, the Housing Bank grants
loans up to a maximum period of 15 years. However, under the Housing Bank's
constitution, provision does exist for a lending period of up to 20 years.
5.09      Under the project, the Housing Bank would act as the main agency
responsible for final approval of all disbursements, except for the small
business credits, which will be administered by the Industrial Development
Bank (IDB) (see paras 5.28 to 5.35). To do this, the Housing Bank would
second one quantity surveyor and one accountant to the UDD, who, under the
general direction of the Director of UDD, would review relevant accounts
as required to verify payments for expenditures incurred in connection with
the project. They would ensure that detailed accounts are maintained in
respect of each contract for construction and procurement of goods and
services and that all requests for payment comply with regulations of the
Housing Bank. To avoid duplication and to ensure prompt action with regard



- 41 -
to payments on expenditures, they will be authorized to sign or counter-
sign all withdrawal applications submitted to the Housing Bank by the UDD.
The Housing Bank will also be responsible for making and recovering loans from
the beneficiaries in both sites and services and upgrading areas for land,
services, housing, and building materials. Branch offices already established
near the project site would service beneficiaries' accounts. The Housing Bank
will, by June 30, 1982, exchange views with the Bank on the)establishment of a
revolving fund, to which would be credited the net proceeds of receipts from
beneficiaries, in excess of the amounts required to repay the loan from
Government and defray the Housing Bank's operating expenses, for use in
similar projects in future.
5.10      The Housing Bank will apply its normal selection criteria, which are
acceptable to the Bank, to prospective project beneficiaries after initial
screening of applications by the UDD. Should any existing residents of the
upgrading areas fail to meet these criteria, the Housing Bank will receive a
Government guarantee tc Lhe extent of the indebtedness of these particular
beneficiaries. For all other beneficiaries, there will not be any Government
guarantee. Modifications to the Housing Bank's current lending practice will
be required for project beneficiaries. These modifications, which have been
agreed with the Housing Bank and would be incorporated in the subsidiary loan
agreement, are:
(a)  the loan would include an amount for land (which has not
normally been financed by the Housing Bank in the past), for
which the beneficiary's title would be held by the Housing Bank
as security for the loan;
(b)  the maximum loan amount would be increased from the Housing
Bank's normal limit of 80% of the superstructure cost to 95% of
the cost of plot and superstructure.
B. The Municipality of Amman
5.11      The Municipality of Amman is responsible for the provision of a
range of urban services to a population of some 650,000 within the city of
Amman. Many of the activities delegated to the Municipality of Amman by law
in 1955 have since been transferred to other organizations, e.g. education,
housing, hospitals, electricity and water and sewerage services. These last
two services are now performed on behalf of the municipality by the semi-
autonomous Amman Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA) which is currently
implementing the IDA-financed third Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project.
The principal services remaining under the city's control--town planning and
building control, solid wastes, roads and traffic engineering--are organized
into 9 geographical and operational divisions, each under administrative
control of a technical assistant. These divisions are political:Ly under the
jurisdiction of three or four council members elected to represent each
division, who jointly form the City Council under the Lord Mayor. The latter
is a Government nominee whose period of service is not regulated, unlike the



- 42 -
elected members who serve for four years minimum. The most senior official is
the Under-Secretary. The Lord Mayor and the Under-Secretary are advised by
Technical Advisors, a Planning Officer and a City Engineer who are supported
by Administrative Officers. The senior officers are intended to be responsible
for the activities of the divisional technical assistants. However, the
organizational structure and managerial responsibility levels are ill-defined
with resulting uneven standards of service throughout the city and generally
low-quality administration.   The Finance Manager operates at the level of an
Administrative Officer and has inadequate authority and status to play a mea-
ningful part in the management of the Municipality. As a result insufficient
prominence has been given to budgeting, financial control accounting and audit-
ing. To resolve these issues, the Council has sought advice from expatriate
management consultants in 1978 and 1979 on possible methods of improving the
organization and management of the Municipality and the consultants' recom-
mendations are currently under review by the Council and municipal officials.
The Municipality has indicated its intention to discuss the outcome of its
review with the Bank and the steps to be taken to implement improvements in
management and organization, including the strengthening of financial manage-
ment and procedures.
5.12      Amman Municipality will have prime responsibility for all aspects
of the project, which will be implemented by the recently established Urban
Development Department (UDD). UDD's Director is directly responsible to the
Lord Mayor. UDD will maintain separate records and have financial account-
ability. In addition to the Project Director, a core staff consisting of a
senior engineer, an architect/ planner, a community development officer, and
an accountant will be needed to commence project design and implementation.
This core staff will be supplemented by two senior engineers seconded from
NHC, an accountant and a quantity surveyor from HB and the liaison staff from
AWSA, WSC and JEPCO. Appointment of the Director, the core staff, staff to be
seconded and the liaison staff is a condition of loan effectiveness. While
subsequent staffing requirements of UDD can be met from the Municipality's
existing manpower resources, which will be supplemented by staff from NHC for
the sites and services schemes, there will be a need to recruit local profes-
sional, trainees and consultants. About 29 local professional, assistants
and secretaries are envisaged, supported by 28 trainees and assisted by 7
consultants for periods varying from 1 to 3 years. UDD will be fully staffed
by December 1981. Final design of project components will be undertaken by
local consultants, while on-site supervision will be carried out mainly by
Municipality and NHC staff supported by local consultants. UDD will, either
directly or through arrangements with other agencies, be involved in the
following tasks:
(a) land acquisition (by expropriation if necessary) and disposal
to beneficiaries;
(b) executing contracts for the development of sites and services
and upgrading schemes;
(c) selection of beneficiaries (with the Housing Bank);
(d) sale and leasing of property;

(e) liaison, technical assistance and cooperation with the
beneficiaries to improve and extend their dwellings;
(f) assistance in community development and self-help projects;
(g) stimulating development of small industry, vocational
training and cooperatives;
(h) securing timely implementation, proper maintenance and
delivery of public services through liaison with statutory
agencies for water, sewerage and power, and with special
service agencies for health, education, training and economic
development; and
(i) ensuring accountability and cost recovery.
5.13      The UDD will have four main sections under the Director:
(a)   Technical Services
(b)   Community Development
(c)   Financial Control (including Administration)
(d)   Estate Management.
5.14      The Technical Services section will be responsible for planning,
engineering, design and general supervision of the construction program,
providing technical advice and direction and liaison with service agencies
and ministries.
5.15      The Community Development section will be involved in social plan-
ning of community development, monitoring and evaluation, the economic develop-
ment extension service and, with the Housing Bank, beneficiary selection.
5.16      The tasks of the Financial Control section will include financial
management and control of expenditures, funds flow management, establishing
proper accounting procedures, monitoring and evaluating financial performance,
producing revised financial terms and advising on the economic stimulation
aspects of the program as well as controlling UDD's internal budgeting and
expenditure.
5.17      The Estate Management section will deal with the acquisition and
disposal of property. It will be concerned with establishing legal procedures
for the planning of the areas, their subdivision, survey, acquisition,
valuation, sales and leases. Close liaison with the Department of Lands and
Surveys will be required over these legal aspects and with the Housing Bank
over disposal arrangements. With the latter, it will prepare purchase and
rental documents. The section will make arrangements for the granting of
title to the beneficiaries, and be responsible for the plannting, marketing
and disposal of commercial and industrial property. It will also ensure that
maintenance of the sites will be adequately provided for.
5.18      The proposed organizational structure of the UDD is presented in
Chart V-4. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that UDD will be
staffed as described above.

C.   The National Housing Corporation
5.19      The National Housing Corporation (NHC) was set up in 1965, under
the Provisional Law No. 47 of the same year. Its functions were consolidated
under the Housing Corporation Law No. 27 of 1968. The main objectives of the
NHC are:
(a) to acquire land and design and construct housing for civil
servants and limited income groups;
(b) to make recommendations to Government on Housing Policy; and
(c) to grant loans for housing construction to cooperatives,
nominal and individual bodies.
5.20      During the period 1965 to 1972, the NHC invested JD 2.6 million
(US$8.8 million) for the construction of 1,284 units. Of this JD 1.1 million
(US$3.7 million) was for individual loans to civil servants for housing
construction; JD 0.3 million (US$1 million) to Government Employees Co-
Operative Societies and JD 1.2 million (US$4 million) for five housing
projects constructed by the NHC comprising 660 units.
5.21      Under the three-year plan, 1973-75, 2,904 units were constructed by
the NHC at a total cost of JD 6.6 million (US$22 million) covering 34 projects.
The operational objectives of the NHC under the three-year plan was to con-
struct 5450 units. They achieved 53% of this target.
5.22      A target for the construction of 7,500 units was set for the NHC
under the five-year plan, 1976-80, at a total cost of JD 25 million (US$85
million). The target was subsequently increased to 7,708 units of which it is
estimated that about three-quarters will be achieved.  Of the revised target,
45%, or 3,440 units, was proposed for Greater Amman and Zerqa.
5.23      At present, the NHC has 7 projects at various stages of construction,
representing some 1,473 units.  These projects fall under four separate
Governorates:
(a)   Amman Governorate               1296 units
(b)   Karak Governorate                 36 units
(c)   Irbid Governorate                126 units
(d)   Maan Governorate                  15 units



- 46 -
5.24      A further program currently in the detailed design stage is the
Abu Nuseir New Town Project on the northwestern outskirts of Amman. On 230
hectares of Government acquired land, some 6,100 units are proposed, the
cheapest of which would reach households with monthly incomes of JD 100
(US$339). The NRC will act as the developer of the New Town in conjunction
with other relevant ministries.
5.25      The NHC has progressively moved towards the construqtion of walk-up
apartment blocks using industrialized building systems. The principal bene-
ficiaries of the NHC projects are people displaced by public works projects,
public servants and other middle-income groups.
5.26      Projects undertaken by the NHC so far have been substantially
subsidized due to the fact that the NHC obtains most of its funds from the
Central Bank at 4.5% interest rate and on lends to its clients at an effective
rate of 4.5% over 20 years. Also Government-owned land is provided free of
charge, the costs of land being recovered only if it has to be purchased. No
property taxes are charged against beneficiaries until they have completed
their repayments. Finally, annual house insurance premiums and the NHC's
operating expenses, mainly salaries, are met by Government grants.
5.27      The NHC's experience in the development of new housing schemes
will be made available to the UDD through the secondment of professional
staff, who will supervise the design and implementation of the sites and
services components of the project. The secondment of two senior engineers is
a condition of effectiveness.
D.   The Industrial Development Bank
5.28      The main source of official credit available for the small scale
enterprise sector is through the Small Scale Industry and Handicraft Program
(SSIHP) of the Industrial Development Bank. Established during 1975, the
SSIHP has, up to the end of June 1979, approved loans amounting to JD 820,500
(US$2.78 million) for 1964 establishments.
5.29      The Industrial Development Bank was granted a US$4 million IDA
credit in 1976 (Cr. 646-JOR), the proceeds of which were earmarked partly for
medium scale industrial and tourism lending (US$3,675,000) and partly for the
IDB's small scale industry and handicraft program (US$300,000). About 90% of
the IDA funds for the SSIHP had been committed by end September 1979. Other
sources of funding for the program are the Kreditanstaldt fur Weideraufbau
(KFW) JD 50,000, Kuwaiti Fund, JD 65,000, European Investment Bank grant JD
10,000 and Central Bank loan of JD 100,000.
5.30      Any establishment employing five people or less and utilizing simple
machinery or hand tools is eligible for credit under the SSIHP. Such enter-
prises include carpenters, blacksmiths, car repairmen, tile manufacturers,
stonecutters, shoemakers and tourist handicraft industries.



- 47 -
5.31      The maximum amount that can be advanced to an individual establish-
ment under the program is currently JD 4,000 (US$13,560) or up tC) 80% of the
cost of the machinery, whichever is less, provided the total cost of the
project for which a loan is required does not exceed JD 10,000 (US$33,900).
In addition to the current interest rate of 8%, a fee of JD 15 (US$50) per
loan per annum is levied on all new loans effective fiscal year 1979. This
increases the effective rate of interest to 10% per annum for the average
loan of JD 1,200 (US$4,050). A maximum repayment period of 5 years is
allowed. Loans are repaid quarterly with interest on equal installment
basis. Grace periods for repayments of 6 months are granted if t:he advance
is used for the purchase of local machinery, but this period can be increased
to 9 months if the machinery is imported. No credit is available for purchase
of land and/or superstructure at present through the program.
5.32      The program is administered through a division of the Bank comprising
seven members. Its structure is shown in Chart V-4.

5.33      Staffing appears adequate for the present operations but it is con-
sidered advisable that two more staff members would be needed if the activities
of the SSIHP were to be doubled in terms of number of loans disbursed.
5.34      Administration expenses are initially borne by the IDB but these are
reimbursed annually from the SSIHP by payment of a management fee. As a result
of high administrative expenses, the SSIHP has been operating at a loss, but is
expected to break even in 1980.
5.35      Th,e SSIHP will be responsible for administering the small business
line of credit included in the project.  The Government would onlend JD 250,000
(US$850,000) to the SSIHP at 6.5% over 10 years as confirmed at negotiations.

E. The Vocational Training Corporation
5.36      The responsibility for the provision of vocational training in
Jordan is shared by the Ministry of Education and the Vocational Training
Corporation (VTC). Prior to the establishment of the VTC in 1977, the
Ministry of Education had sole responsibility and the bulk of vocational
training provided was of an institutional and formal nature. Since 1977, the
Ministry of Education has continued to provide this type of training and VTC
has concentrated on in-plant training courses varying in length from short
skill-upgrading courses for existing employees to three-year apprenticeship
courses for young entrants to the labor market.
5.37      To date, the VTC's skill upgrading courses have benefitted 360
workers and there are currently 600 trainees enrolled in the apprenticeship
program. The demand for both types of courses provided by the VTC exceeds the
number that it can provide through its existing facilities which are already
operating at full capacity on up to three shifts a day. The implementation of
proposals made in the VTC's Five-Year Plan, which include a vocational training
center near Ruseifa to be partly financed by USAID, will assist in partially
satisfying this demand but the VTC requires additional funding if all these
proposals are to be implemented on schedule. The proposed center at Quweismeh,
to be financed under this project, would provide facilities for training in
field of automotive, carpentry and building trade. It is envisaged that the
center will train young persons who are not employed in basic skills in the
form of pre-employment training either related to subsequent apprenticeship
courses or designed to improve the trainees capability to receive informal
on-the-job training, labor upgrading courses for employed unskilled workers,
and apprenticeship training.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      The proposed project would represent a modest but significant first
step in the development of a revised urban strategy designed to take explicit
account of the shelter, service and employment-related needs of poor urban
families. Through its emphasis on affordability and cost recovery and the
introduction of appropriate design and planning standards, this project would
have important demonstration effects and would help lay the basis for a
longer term program which, in subsequent phases, could be undertaken on a
much wider scale. Particularly noteworthy in this context are: (a) the
introduction of low-cost housing schemes in the form of sites and services
benefitting some 41,000 people and with unit costs which average 50% of the
cost of existing low cost conventional public housing in Jordan; (b) the
legalization of tenure for squatter families benefitting some 15,000 people
with improved health environment, including access to the city-s water supply
and sewerage networks; (c) the incorporation of productivity enhancing schemes,
aimed at specific target groups, into a shelter and upgrading program; and (d)
the strengthening of local, organizational and institutional capability in the
sector, to implement and extend this program over the medium-term.



- 51 -
6.02      The economic rate of return for the upgrading and sites and services
components, representing about 72% of project cost, is estimated at 20%.
Rates of return were not computed for the other project components due to
difficulties in the measurement and quantifications of benefits. However,
alternative indicators of their economic merit are discussed in para 6.06
below.
Sites and Services and Upgrading
6.03      Benefit valuation in the sites and services areas is based upon the
imputed rental values for housing and market sale prices for the commercial
and larger residential plots. In the upgrading areas, estimates of the
increase in property values brought about by the improvements were used for
existing plots and imputed rental values were used for new housing units
constructed under the project. Information regarding land and rental values
in areas wit]n similar location characteristics was obtained through direct
surveys carried out during project preparation. The following values were
arrived at:
Item                          Before Project       After Project
Rent per room per month in sites              not applicable            12
and services areas (JD)
Land value per m  in upgrading areas (JD)           8.0                 20.0
6.04      The following project costs were included in the analysis:  (a) site
development costs including land acquisition site preparation and on-site
infrastructure costs, the share of community facilities and off-site infra-
structure costs allocable to the project site, administrative expenses, design
and supervision and physical contingencies; (b) on-plot development costs
including costs of self-help building materials and related labor, financed
through building loans and household savings, preconstructed core units and
rooms and front walls; and (c) annual operation and maintenance costs esti-
mated at 3% of total development costs.
6.05      The sites and services and upgrading components would together yield
an estimated economic rate of return of 20%. Separately, the sites and services
schemes would have a return of 20% and the upgrading schemes of 19%. A 10%
decrease in costs would increase the rate of return for sites and services and
upgrading to 24% each, while a 10% increase in benefits would increase the
rate of return for each of these components to 23%. A ten percent increase in
costs or decrease in benefits reduces the rates of return to 18% and 16%
respectively.



- 52 -
6.06      A total of about 1,025 jobs are expected to be supported in the
project areas through the small business component which includes provision of
serviced plots, preconstructed commercial units, credit and extension services.
The average incremental cost per job, excluding cost of land, is estimated at
JD 900 (US$3050) in 1980 prices. The breakdown of the average cost per job is
as follows: (a) 32% for commercial and industrial plots and preconstructed
units; (b) 60% for loans and equity contribution for additidnal shop and
workshop construction, equipment and working capital; and (c) 8% for extension
services. These estimates exclude the additional employment that will be
created through the construction of these units.
6.07      Under the project's vocational training program the total output of
trained workers, assuming single shift operation, is expected to be between
350 and 400 per annum. Two-thirds of these trainees will be women and an
additional benefit is the expected increase in the low level of female partici-
pation in the labor force in the project areas with consequent increases in
household incomes.
Project Risks
6.08      As the project represents a significant departure from conventional
public housing programs in Amman and seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a
new approach to urban development, it necessarily faces a number of risks.
First, the emphasis on cost recovery, including higher interest rate charges
under this project compared with conventional public housing is both a politi-
cally and socially sensitive issue which will require continuing strong
Government commitment and support to the project. However, surveys indicate
that beneficiaries are prepared to pay the amounts envisaged under the project
for the provision of secure tenure and essential services. The Government has
indicated that its support for enforcing cost recovery measures will be
forthcoming. Second, the institutional weakness in the sector, due largely to
a shortage of trained staff, may hamper timely project implementation. The
scope of the project has been determined with this constraint in mind, the
main emphasis being on sites and services schemes, which are relatively simple
to implement in physical terms, while the more complex slum upgrading schemes
have been kept to a limited size. This risk has also been minimized by
including under the project the provision of considerable technical assistance
to the implementing agencies to help both in the execution of project works
and in on-the-job the training of local staff.   The training aspect assumes
particular importance in view of the limited size of this project and the need
to replicate similar projects on a national basis in the future.
6.09      The other main areas of potential risk relate to land acquisition
and provision of essential services by public utilities and municipalities.
In both of these areas satisfactory assurances were provided by the Government
during negotiations and adequate safeguards are incorporated in the Loan
Documents.

7.03      With the assurances received and the agreements reached during
negotiations, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$21.0 million to
the Government of Jordan.
