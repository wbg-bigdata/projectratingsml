 1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a loan inthe
amount of US$12.94 million to the National Power Corporation (NPC) for the Bicol Power
Restoration Project (BPRP). This loanwill allow the Bicol region, which has the highest
incidence of typhoons inthe country, to regain the level of power supply it hadavailable before
the devastatingtyphoons of2006. The project consists of investmentsto repair severely damaged
sections of the transmission system. Given the emergencynature of the project, approximately
80 percent of the total loan amount (US$10.3 million) will be financed, retroactively for
replacement of towers and associatedmaterials inthe 230 kV transmission system, which
sustainedmost ofthe damage from the typhoons. Further,to accelerate construction work and
prepare for next typhoon season, the Bankreviewed andprovided its concurrencewith the
biddingdocumentsand bidevaluation reports for the three main supply and installation contracts
during January to April 2007, with construction works starting inMay 2007.

Partnership arrangements:Not applicable.


B.        EMERGENCY CHALLENGE: COUNTRY CONTEXT, RECOVERY STRATEGY,
         AND RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSEDBANK EMERGENCY PROJECT

         1.COUNTRYAND SECTORCONTEXT

2.       The Philippines, with apopulation of about 82 million, is highly proneto typhoons,
which have become more severe inrecent years. The Bicol region, with apopulation of over
5 million, i s one of 17regions inthe Philippines. The region is located inthe Southernpart of
LuzonIsland, the most economically important island of the country. Two super-typhoons,
defined as typhoons with wind speeds greater than 200 kmkr,hit the Bicol region inthe last
quarter of 2006. Typhoon Milenyo struck inSeptember 2006 followed inNovember by Typhoon
Reming, which hadunprecedentedwind gusts exceeding230 km/hr. The typhoons toppled or
otherwise damaged 118 transmissiontowers supporting 230 kV transmission lines inthe South
Luzontransmission system. The combined damage from bothtyphoons resulted inatwo-day
blackout inthe SouthLuzonarea' and an ongoing power deficit inthe Bicol region. Duringthe
first half of 2007, seven 500 kV towers, weakened during the typhoons of 2006, collapsedand
three additional 500 k V towers collapsed inJuly 2007.

3.       Although the blackout resulting from the typhoons was not large on a countrywide basisY2
it hada considerable adverse economic impact on the Bicol region. As Figure 2 shows, most of
the 230 kV transmission systemserving the Bicol regionwas out of commission inNovember
2006, with unsuppliedenergy during the blackout amounting to over 200 GWh. A deficit of
50 GWh, or about a quarter of the Bicol region's power consumption, remainedun-served due to
incomplete restoration of the region's power sub-transmissionand distribution capacity. The loss
of supply would havebeenworse hadthe NationalTransmission Corporation (TransCo) not
respondedwithin two days typhoons to restore the vital 230 kV transmission interconnections at

' Basedonthe  System Operator's estimationofunsuppliedenergy.
  The power systemof the Philippineshas a total installedcapacity MW 15,600 with annualelectricitygenerationof

Naga and Labo, usingtemporary Emergency RestorationSystems (ERS). The availability o f
these structures also made it possible to stabilize supply and provide power to the Northern part
o f Luzon Island, including the capital city of Manila.The economic cost of the blackout and
continued power deficit -excluding revenue losses to TransCo and the electricity cooperatives
-hasbeeninexcessofUS$250million,ormorethan10timesthecostofthesystem

4.      The transmission system remains vulnerable. The ERS currently inplace are only
temporary solutions and are not designed to withstandthe highwind speeds o f typhoons.
Furthermore, the company has a limited number o f these structures, some o f which it hadto
transfer to the Bicol region from other regions. Complete restoration o f service will require, in
addition to the restoration o f transmission towers, the repair o f damaged 69 kV sub-transmission
lines as well as medium-voltage distribution lines owned by various electricity cooperatives.
TransCo anticipates the completion o f repairs inboth the transmission and distribution systems
by early 2008.

5.      The project takes place inthe context o f a power sector with an evolving institutional
structure. Prior to 2001, the power sector inthe Philippines consisted o f one vertically- integrated
public power utility, the National Power Corporation. In2001, the Electric Power Industry
Reform Act (EPIRA) and related Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) resulted inthe
unbundlingo fNPC's operations into three separate business units: generation, transmission, and
distribution.

6.      At the sametime, EPIRA established the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities
Management (PSALM) Corporation to take ownership o f the assets and liabilities o f the National
Power Corporation (NPC) entities. Furthermore, TransCo (wholly owned by PSALM) was
created to assume the transmission function of NPC. Although TransCo currently operates as



                                               2

separate business, it has not yet taken ownership of the transmission assets, which is expectedto
take place inlate 2008. Consequently,NPC i s the borrower for the BPRP and TransCo the
implementing agency. PSALM will assume the loan inthe future, once the transfer of
transmission assets to TransCo has beencompleted.

         2. RECOVERY STRATEGY

7.       Firstly, the BPRP is integral part of a recovery strategy that focuses not only on repair of
the damageto the TransCo system butalso on criticalreinforcement oftransmission
infrastructure inthe Bicol region and other typhoon-prone areas inthe transmission system,
combined with emergency measures to reduce power outages inthe event of further damage
from the current or 2008 typhoon season. On February 7,2007, TransCo notifiedthe Philippines'
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) of its intention to apply the Force Majeure provisions in
the ERC's transmissionwheeling rules.3 These rules allow TransCoto obtain funds neededto
fully restore the capacity of its damaged transmission lines (see Figure 1). TransCo supportedits
application to ERC with certification from the Department of Science and Technology (January
9,2007) that unusually strongtyphoons had caused the damage. Subsequently,both the National
Economic Development Agency (NEDA) and the Environmental Management Bureau(EMB)
supportedTransCo's application inMarch2007, on an exceptional basis, so they could to seek
borrowing for the proposedproject.

8.       The secondpart of the strategy, reinforcement ofthe transmission system andenhanced
emergency preparedness, stems from a study by TransCo, completed inFebruary 2007, which
establishedthat the Southern Luzon-Visayas corridor has experiencedan increasedincidence of
super typhoons. Annex 14illustrates the cycle of highwind speeds inthe maintyphoon-prone
zones of interest to the project. TransCo has reviewed its design standards for the wind resistance
of its transmission towers and lines comparedto standards inJapan and other countries also
prone to super-typhoons. The study found that many transmission lines, built between 1960and
1980, hadmuchlower design standards, capable of withstanding wind speeds of only 165-1 80
km/hr,significantly below the wind speeds ofthe recent super-typhoons. Basedonthis review,
TransCo has adopted a standard of 270 km/hr inZone Ifor the Bicol-Visayas corridor and 240
km/hr for other typhoon-prone areas.

9.       As aresult of its study, TransCo recommendedan overall tower-strengtheningprogram,
particularly inthe country's critical high-windzones. The Government has agreedto the need for
a strengtheningprogram and improved capability to respondto emergencies inthe transmission
system. Annex 10 outlines the Terms o f Referencefor consulting services to provide TransCo
with a comprehensive investment planto ensure the company i s better preparedto deal with
typhoons infuture.

         3. RATIONALEFORBANKINVOLVEMENT

10.      The project meets the eligibility criteria for arapidresponseof the Bank to loan requests
for the financing of investmentsnecessary to repair actual or imminentdamage resulting from


 Under ERC Rule 20G, Section 3, a notice of Force Majeure 10.2 should be issued in accordance with Section 10.2
Article 10 to ensure expenditures are allowable under the Transmission Wheeling Rate Guidelines.


                                                    3

natural or man-madedisasters. Bank's dialogue during project preparation focused TransCo's
attention on the need to haveminimumpreparedness components as well, which will be financed
byNPC (borrower) andimplementedby TransCo (implementing agency). The Bank has a long
history of assistingthe Government inpower sector development.This assistance includes
support ofthe sector's restructuring andprivatization program and of efforts to promote
increased access to electricity for rural communities inisolated areas. Furthermore, the Bank i s
actively involved indialogue on power sector reform4includingthe preservation of the
transmission system's assets during the transition period prior to plannedoperation by a private
concession. Inthis period of institutional changes, TransCo i s constrainedinits ability to raise
funds for any new investments.

                             C.     BANK RESPONSE: THE PROJECT

         1.BRIEFDESCRIPTIONOFBANK'SSTRATEGYOFEMERGENCY                             SUPPORT

11.     The Bank's strategy for emergency support is to support financing of critical assets of
investmentsinthe power transmission system serving the Bicol region, thus assisting inthe
removal of infrastructure constraints to the region's economic development. The strategy also
includescontinued dialogue on defining the investmentsrequiredto strengthenthe transmission
and sub-transmissionsystems ofthe Bicol region and other typhoon-prone areas, and related
financing. Inthis context, the Bank initially offered its support for the project immediately after
the emergency to discuss key investmentsrequiredto restorefullpower transmission capacityto
the Bicolregion. InMay 2007, the Bank firmedupprocessingarrangements. Inparallel, the
Bank participated inthe procurement review processto facilitate the work program. Due to the
emergency nature of the project and consistent with OPBP 8.00, which provides for "increased
flexibility on the use of simplifiedprocurementmethods," the Bank agreedto the adoption of the
NationalCompetitive Bidding (NCB) procedures ofthe Philippines insteadof International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.The Government awardedthe contracts for the
restoration work on April 14, 2007. Followingon the Government's official approval
authorizing TransCo to apply for IBRDfunding, appraisal work took place on July 10-23, 2007.

         2. PROJECT     DEVELOPMENT      OBJECTIVES

12.      The project's developmentobjective is to support the stabilization of power supply inthe
Bicol region by replacing or repairing critical electricity transmission infrastructure damagedby
typhoons in2006.

        3. SUMMARY OFPROJECT COMPONENTS

13.      The Bank financed project is part of a US$21.6 millionprogram with two sub-project
components: (i)     restoration; and (ii) preparedness. Part Icontains four packages(Packages
                                        initial

14.     This first part, the Bank's financed project, consists o fthree packages (Packages A, By
and C) that cover the five sections o f the Bicol area's 230 kV transmission system severely
damaged immediately following the typhoons in2006. The fourth package, to be financed by the
Government (Package D), covers seven additional towers for the 500 kV systemto replace those
towers that collapsed several months after the typhoon due to the weakened structural integrity as
a result o f typhoon damage. Table 1 summarizes the project's components by package,
consisting o f transmission line towers and related materials, and by section o fthe transmission
system that components will helpto restore, shown on the map inFigure 1.

             Part11. Strengtheningof the TransCo SystemAgainstFutureTyphoons

15.     This part consists o f four packages, to be financed by the Government. Two packages
(Package E l and E2) cover the additional ERS requiredto rapidly restore power inthe event o f
future damageto transmission towers andthe developmentofan investmentplanfor reinforcing
the transmission systemagainst typhoondamage. Thetwo other packages, Package Fand G,
cover the costs o f ROW and resettlement, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the components in
these packages.

16.     Inadditionto the above components, TransCo requestedthat ICC/NEDA consider
allowing TransCo to include, inthe proposed project, a shunt reactor (180 MVar), at an
estimated cost o f US$7.2 million, inorder to stabilize power inthe Northern part o fthe Luzon
transmission line. Duringthe typhoons o f 2006, the System operator had to de-energize one
circuit o f the entire stretch o fthe 500 kV transmission line due to the voltage build-upinthe
Northern portion o fthe line resulting from damaged Southern portions. Had a shunt reactor been
inplace inthe Northernportion o fthe line, itwould havehelpedto compensate for the higher
voltage build-up,making it unnecessary to de-energize the line and thereby increasing the

        4. ELIGIBILITYFORPROCESSINGUNDERoP/BP8.00

17.     The project meets the principal criteria and guiding principles for emergency operations,
as specified inOP8.00 concerning:       ". ..the application of rapid response instrumentsto address
major adverse economic and/or social impacts resulting from an actual or imminentnatural or
manmade crisis of disaster." The Bank's Rapid Response Committee chaired by the Managing
Director was informed of the emergency nature of the project on August 9,2007.

        5. CONSISTENCYWITH COUNTRY STRATEGY

18.     The project supports the Bank's strategy for assistingcountries inrecovering from the
adverse economic and social impacts of natural or man-made disasters. It also will help to
remove infrastructure barriers to achieving the objectives of economic growth and social
inclusion outlined inthe current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Furthermore, by financing
investmentsthat will helpto preserve the assets ofthe transmission system, the project indirectly
will support one of the three mainplatforms for achieving the CAS objective, a strategy to
promote private sector investment.

        6. EXPECTED      OUTCOMES

19.     The mainproject outcome will be the restoredcapability of the transmission systemto
meetthe normal load inthe Bicol area. The project will retroactively finance ongoing
investmentsthat already have reducedthe supply gap as well as additional investmentsleading to
full restoration. Figure 2 provides anoverview oftheprogressiverestoration ofthe 230 kV
transmission system, moving from the complete shutdown of the system inNovember 2006 to
full capacityto meet the normal loadby March2008. The restoration ofthe additional 500 kV
towers will require more time but should be complete by April 2008, prior to the start of the
2008 typhoon season. Another expectedoutcome is the reducedvulnerability of the transmission

 The proposedupgradingprogram is unlikely to take placebefore2008, subject to ERC approval. By that time, the
governmentexpects the privateconcessionaireto be inplace.

systemto disruption from typhoons due to strengthenedinfrastructure combined with an
enhancedcapability for emergency response to damagedtransmission towers.

20.     Key Outputs.The key output leading to the above outcomes is the fast, successful
completion of the procurementprogram for 118 transmission towers to helprestorethe
transmission system serving the Bicol area to full operation by March2008.

21.     Monitoringand evaluation.Annex 2 provides a full description ofthe project's
monitoring and evaluation framework. The main indicators of project outcome are as follows:

e       Re-establishmentof the remaining 50 GWh of unsupplied energy inthe transmission
        system for the Bicol region by the end of March2008; and

e       Improvedpower system reliability inthe Bicol region, evidencedby a decrease in
        equivalent Power System Minutes lost inLuzonduring 2008.

                                                                            a
past projects andtheir incorporation inproject design; (ii)           an economic analysis of the financed
investments; (iii) an assessment of the institutional capability of TransCo to managethe project;
and (iv) an evaluation of environmental and social safeguards.

23.       Delays in procurement. The most recent Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for
Bank-financed power transmission projects during the 199Os,managedby NPC, have noted
protracted delays inprocurement. Given the emergency nature of the project andthe fact that the
procurementalready has taken place for many of the components, the risk of protracted delays in
procurementis low.

24.       Deficiencies in resettlement. ICRs for past power projects have rated resettlement as
highly unsatisfactory.Dueto past deficiencies inresettlement, the project's appraisal has given
considerable attention to evaluating related policies andprocedures inplace. To ensure the
project's compliance with Bank safeguardpolicies, the supervision team will conduct quarterly
monitoring activities and facilitate discussionsto resolve any potential issues adversely affecting
the project's Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan(LARP). Furthermore, TransCo's
Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Stewardship Program includes aregularly
updatedreforestation planto ensure the restoration and maintenance of any vegetation that
TransCo's projects may affect.

25.       NPCand Sector Finances. Inthe past, NPC has experiencedliquidity problems
attributable to its under-capitalization and inadequatetariff adjustments. The Government
recognizesthat heavy reliance on foreign debt financing is unsustainable inthe longrun.As a
compelling responseto contain NPC's deficit and minimizethe related fiscal costs, the EPIRA of
2001provides the framework for restructuring the overall power sector, recapitalization ofNPC,
unbundling andprivatization ofNPC generationand transmission operations. Inparticular, the
EPIRA introduced the following new sources of fimds: (i)                universal charge (UC) to cover
strandedcontract cost and strandedNPC debt,6respectively; (ii)                 privatization proceeds; and (iii)
assumptionby the Government of upto PHP 200 billion o fNPC's financial obligations.

26.       The past 12 months have seen a concertedeffort by the Government to restore and
sustainthe financial viability of ConsolidatedPSALM, including: (i)                  continued improvements in
operationalefficiency and inprioritizationofpre-privatization capital expendituresby NPC and
TransCo; (ii)   steps towards the engagementof aTrading Advisor and appointment of IPP
Administrators; (iii)     mitigationof risksperceivedby investors to achieve successfulprivatization
and use of the resulting privatization proceedsto reduceborrowings. The privatization of assets
has taken further momentum with the sale of the M W 600 Masinloc coal-fired power plant, and
government plans to complete privatization of 50 percent ofNPC's generation assets by early
2008; and (iv) movingtowards improved liability management, includingrefinancing debt on
more favorable terms andhedging of currency and fuel price exposure, as appropriate. Given the
emergency nature of the operation, its quick disbursementnature and ongoing sector reform
leading to stabilization of the sector's finances, no financial covenants-except those relatedto
proper financial management-have beenintroduced inthis project.



 According to EPIRA, (a) stranded contract cost is definedas the excess of the contracted cost o f electricity under
eligible IPP contracts o fNPC over the actual selling price of the contracted energy output o f such contracts inthe
market. Such contracts shall have beenapproved by the ERE3 as of December 3 1,2000; and (b) stranded debt refers
to any unpaid financial obligations ofNPC which have not been liquidated by the proceeds from the sales and
privatization ofNPC assets.

Economic Analysis

27.     The project's appraisal used a cost-benefit analysis (see Annex 9) for evaluating the
economic viability o fthe investmentsthat the project will finance and has estimated an internal
economic rate-of-return (IERR) amounting to 39 percent. Key assumptions inthe analysis, which
Annex 9 describes indetail, include: (i) a one percent probability, inany givenyear, over a 20-
year period, that a typhoon o f the same severity as the typhoons o f 2006 will strike the Bicol area
and cause similar damage; (ii)  economic benefits valued at the cost of unsuppliedenergy inthe
Bicol area (US$5 million equivalent per GWh); and (iii)    equipment designedto remain
structurally sound for 20 years. The economic costs included inthe analysis consist o f the capital
costs o f the equipment financed by the project plus the costs o f ROW and resettlement, along
with price contingencies inthe event oftyphoon damage duringthe project's implementation
period.

InstitutionalCapability

28.     Implementationo fthis project involves coordination among NPC, PSALM, and TransCo.
NPC will be borrower for the project. PSALM created as part o f EPIRA to take ownership o f all
NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and other disposable assets, will take
on NPC's borrower obligations once the transfer o f debt and assets i s completed as part o f the
ongoing privatization and reform process. TransCo, created under EPIRA to assume NPC's
transmission functions, will implementthe project.

29.     Whenthe transfer of debt and assets to PSALMis completed by the Government, then
the Loan Agreement betweenIBRDand NPC may be amended to change the borrower from
NPC to PSALM and corresponding amendments and consents will be obtained from the
Government and from TransCo. This was discussed andrecorded inthe minutesof negotiations.

30.     Currently, NPC's audited financial statements cover the operations o f TransCo, the
project's implementing agency becausethe transfer o f assets to TransCo has not yet taken place.
NPC currently receives all revenues that TransCo collects from transmission service and, inturn,
provides TransCo with the funds it needs for operations. The appraisal's financial management
review has found that TransCo financial management meets the minimumrequirements o f the
Bank, satisfying OP/BP10.02 (see Annex 4). Inaddition, TransCo has experience implementing
Bank-financed projects. The past project most relevant to BPRP took place in 1995, for which
the Bank-financedrestoration work onthe 500 kVNaga-Tayabas transmission line damagedby
civil unrest. TransCo's performance inmanaging this project was satisfactory.

Environmentaland Social Safeguards

31.     The Bank's appraisal reviewed environmental standards andthe Environmental Impact
and Management Plan(EIMP) for the project, as well as TransCo's capability to implement the
EIMP. TransCo's procedures for conducting an environmental impactassessment (EIA) and
securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC)/Certificate o fNon-Coverage (CNC)
meet the Bank's minimumrequirementsspecified under OP 4.01on Environmental Assessment.
The EIMP adequately providesfor the mitigation of significant impacts that the project may

generate.7 TransCo has an Environmental Management Department with a qualified staff o f
environmental and social development specialists inits central and field offices. The company
also has IS014001 certification and has adopted its own Corporate Social Responsibility and
Environmental Stewardship Program.

32.      Interms ofsocial impact, the project will result indirect and indirect benefits to millions
o f residents o f the Bicol region, it involves the involuntary resettlement o f a relatively small
numberofpeople. The benefits ofthe project include improved safety o ftransmission lines and
both greater reliability and efficiency o f power supply. The project may displace 82 structures,
including 47 households, inthe process of reconstructing the damaged parts o f the transmission
system. A review done during project preparation with the National Commission on Indigenous
People (NCIP), Albay Provincial Officer, provided an indicative list o fproject affected persons,
their properties andtheir locationtogether withthe type oflanddocuments covering these
properties. The review showed that none o f the Tiwi Barangays with ancestral domains (ADS)
(Joroam, Misibis, Taabong, and Maayong) are affected by the restoration project. A similar
review for BuhiBarangays with ADS(Sta Cruz, Ipil, Kaulam, and Iraya) also showed the same
results. It was agreed that incase any indigenous populationwere affected the Bank's IP policy
would be complied with, particularly inthe area o f consultation and compensation.

33.      The LandAcquisition and Resettlement Plan (LAW), which TransCo has prepared, is
consistent with Bank standards on compensation. Because of the project's emergency nature, it i s
exempt from the requirement to obtain the Free and Prior Informed Consent o fthe Indigenous
Peoples. However, following good practice, TransCo has applied, and was grantedon September
4,2007, for a certification from the NCIP confirming that the Free and Prior Informed Consent
(FPIC) i s not requiredfor this emergency project.


        E. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS, COST, AND FINANCING PLAN

InstitutionalArrangements

34.      Because the transfer of transmission assets to TransCo i s still inprogress, the Bank has
agreed with PSALMto make the loanto NPC with arrangements for NPC to make available all
the funds to TransCo under a separate subsidiary agreement, with the same terms and conditions.
The Bankwill also have a project agreement withTransCo. Annex 6 provides the summary
findings ofthe appraisal's assessmento fthe project management capability o f TransCo.

35.      NPC. The Borrower, NPC, is a government-owned and controlled corporation created
underRepublic Act No. 6395. NPC's auditedfinancial statements still include the operations of
TransCo. NPC deposits the funds it collects from TransCo into an account established for the
funding o f TransCo's operations. The President o f the Philippinesappoints the members o fthe
NPC's Boardwith the Secretary o f the Departmento f Energy as Chairman and the President o f

36.      TransCo. The ImplementingAgency for the project, TransCo, is a government- owned
and controlled corporation, created in2000, under Republic Act No. 9136, to acquire all the
transmission assets o fNPC. The transfer o f these assets will take place once all institutional
creditors o fNPC have giventheir consent to the transfer, a process inprogress. Although
TransCo's financial statements are still consolidated with those o fNPC, TransCo has its own
financial management system and organization. NPC will enter into a Memorandum o f
Agreement with TransCo, for the project's implementation. TransCo will be responsible for the
preparation and submission to the Bank o fthe (a) quarterly InterimFinancial Reports o fthe
project 45 days after the end o f each calendar quarter; and (b) annual audited project financial
statements no later than six months after the end o f each fiscal year. The Internal Audit Unit o f
TransCo shall conduct a review o f the project every calendar semester duringthe project

37.     Total project costs, including both Government and Bank financing, amount to about
US$21.61 million (see Table 3). These costs are based on actual contract prices, including taxes,
together with provision for contingencies that might arise ifa second typhoon hits the
constructionarea. The costs of restoration o f the transmission systemdue to typhoon damage
amount to US$15.38 million, or about 68 percent o ftotal project costs. The costs o f investments
insystem strengthening andimprovedemergency preparednessamount to about US$3.05
million. Inaddition to the estimated base cost o f about US$18.46 million, the total cost includes
contingencies, taxes, and duties o f about US$3.15 million.

ProjectFinancingPlan

38.     Table 4 summarizes the project's financing plan. The Bank will finance
US$12.94 million, or about 60 percent o fthe total project cost, and TransCo will finance the
remaining (US$8.67 million) on its own. Provisionhas been made for a 10 percent contingency
to ensure that there should be some funds available incase o f further emergencies or cost
overrun.

ProjectLoanDisbursements

39.     Disbursementschedule. As indicatedinTable 5 below, project disbursementsare
expected to be completed inabout a year from contract signature. Given the critical needs o f the
project to immediately mobilize loanproceeds for restoration activities currently underway, an
increase inthe retroactive financing limit from 40 percent, as per guidelinesunder emergency
operations, to 80 percent has beenapproved by senior management as per OP 8.00 to support
TransCo with its rapid response efforts. Based on the disbursement schedule and expected
effectiveness date, the Government confirmed this request during negotiations.

the supply and installation of replacementtowers underthree contract packageson January 29,
2007. At the same time, TransCo issuedthe documentsto nine international firms. A pre-
bidding conferencetook place on February 19,2007, and six bidders respondedby March8,
2007, closing date of the tenders. Kalpaturu Power Transmission Company of Indiasubmitted
the lowest responsiveevaluated bid, complying with all bidding requirements, and received the
contract award for all three packages.The signed contracts became effective inApril 2007.

41.     Duringconcurrentconsultations, the Bank, as noted earlier, agreedto approve the use of
Philippines' NCB procedures, as modifiedto includeprovisions for installationworks. The Bank
also agreedto the imposition ofthe Approved Budget for the Contract as a ceiling onbidprices
underthese tenders, after TransCo demonstratedits compliance with the conditions set by the
Bankfor acceptingthis measure. After receiving satisfactoryresponses to its questions about the
results of the bid evaluations andthe recommendationsof awards, the Bank issued its
concurrence with the award on May 25,2007. These three contracts are subject to retroactive
financing.

42.     Projectimplementationand Banksupervision. Overall, the implementation ofproject
componentsinPart Iwill take less than a year. The supervision and monitoring of the project's
implementation will begintwo weeks after loan signing. The Bank team visited the construction
site inJuly 2007, and reviewed construction progresswith TransCo staff in October, 2007.
Project supervision will requireabout 10 staff weeks and, to the extent possible, Bank staff based
inthe Manilaoffice will conduct the supervision, particularly for the fiduciary andsafeguard
aspects of the project.

43.     Closingdate.The project's tentative closing date is July 30,2008. The restoration of the
118 towers inthe 230 kV transmission system should be complete by early 2008.

Scope of the Assessment

1.      A Financial ManagementAssessment Review of the National Power Corporation (NPC),
andNational Transmission Corporation (TransCo), was undertakenwith the objective of
ensuringthat an adequate financial management system is inplace. The assessment covered
(i) 2004to2006auditedfinancialstatementsoftheBorrower;(ii) organizationalstructure
   the                                                                      the
ofthe Borrower andthe Implementing Agency, specifically the finance and internal audit;
(iii) accountingandproceduresmanual;and(iv)thediscussionofthefinancialmanagement
     the
and disbursementarrangements of the project. Overall, the assessment has found that the
financial management of the project meets the minimumrequirementsof the Bank.'

Profileof the Borrowerand ImplementingAgency

2.      The Borrower underthis loanis theNational Power Corporation (NPC), a government-
owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) created under Republic Act (RA) No. 6395. The
Implementing Agency for the project is TransCo, a GOCC createdin2000 under RA No. 9136
to acquire all the transmission assets ofNPC. To date, however, the transfer of such
transmission assets has not beenfinalized. Thus, and since TransCo does not have full ownership
of the assets currently used, its financial statements are still consolidatedwith NPC's. However,
TransCo has its own financial management systemand organization. NPC has entered into a
Memorandum of Agreement with TransCo, whereas TransCo shall implementthe project.
TransCo, as the implementing agency, enteredinto contracts with the contractors and has
obtainedthe proceeds from NPC to pay the contractors. The proposedBank loan to NPC, with
the consentofthe Bank, maybetransferredto Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management
(PSALM) Corporation, a GOCC createdunder RepublicAct No. 9136 to own the NPC's
generationassets, liabilities, real estate, and all other disposableassets. Transfer of all these
assets and liabilities to PSALM and TransCo is subject to the conditions precedent which to date
have not beenfully completed.

Experienceof TransCowith Bank-FinancedProjects

3.      The Bank has had considerable experienceinsupervising TransCo's implementation
programsunder a number of projects implementedduring the 1990s. The most recent relevant
project was implementedin 1995, inwhich the Bank financed restoration work on the 500 k V
Naga-Tayabastransmission line that hadbeendamageddue to civil unrest. The work was done
expeditiously and completed satisfactorily within a contractperiod of about 18 months.

4.      TransCo has a very experiencedproject managementteam established under a separate
Vice President.This arrangementhas inpart beensupportedby earlier Bank operations (Leyte
GeothermalProject), through which severalkey staff were providedtraining inProject
'Under  Bank' OPpBP10.02 and Guidelines on Financial Management Aspects of EmergencyOperationsProcessed
Under OPIBP8.00.

Management and achieved certified Project Manager status after a three-month course inthe
UnitedStates. Onthe financial management side, TransCo andNPC have a well-defined
organizational structure and accounting and procedures manual. TransCo has a complete set
manual o f policies and procedures covering all stages o f the transaction as well as recording and
reporting. It has already obtained an I S 0 9001:2000 certification. The key officers and staff o f
NPC and TransCo finance and internal audit have more than 15 years o f work experience and
either have a masters degree and/or are certified public accountants. TransCo's financial
management systemi s computerized and i s capable o f generating the project financial
statements.

InternalAuditingat TransCo

5.      TransCo has an internal audit department with 13 staff who are graduates inaccounting
(and also certified public accountants) and engineeringand with an average experience o f over
14 years in internal audit. The internal audit department reports directly to the Board of
TransCo. It was agreed that TransCo management will authorize the internal audit unit to
include the project inits scope o f work. The scope o f work o fthe internal audit unit will include
the review o fthe adequacy of supports ofselected payments to contractors, test inspectionofthe
delivered materials and equipmentpurchased under the project and the physical controls over
these assets, and also the physical inspectiono f the construction inprogress. There will be an
internal audit review for the project, every calendar semester duringthe project implementation,
with a copy of its report submitted to the Bank 30 days after the end of each calendar semester.

Report of the Commission on Audit (COA)

6.      The Commission on Audit (COA) rendereda qualified opinion on the 2006,2005, and
2004 financial statements o fNPC. The following issues were the subject o f the audit
qualification in2006: (a) accounts with abnormal balances and unidentified items amounting to
PHP 7.776 billion and PHP 3.00 billion, respectively; (b) cost o f completed projects were still
included inthe construction inprogress account amounting to PHP 6.108 billion; (c) deficiencies
inthe Asset TrustAccount ofPHP 1.910billiondue to errors or omissions ofdetails pertaining
to IndependentPower Producer plant accounts and residual assets o f PHP 1.42 billion remained
unadjusted inthe generation company accounts; and (d) Philippine Accounting StandardsNo. 16
on property, plant, and equipment was not fully adopted by NPC with expenses o f PHP 1.822
billion as o f December 31,2006, for terminated power plant projects recognized as asset instead
o f expense.

7.      NPC/TransCo, incoordination with COA, have beenaddressing these issues. As o f
August 31,2007, the percentage o fadjustments to the above mentionedissues reported by NPC
and TransCo as a result o f their efforts to resolve the COA issues mentioned above were as
follows: (a) accounts with abnormal balances and unidentified items (90 percent solved); (b) cost
o f completed projects still inCIP ( 38 percent and another 63 percent adjusted by early 2008);
(c) deficiencies inthe Asset Trust Account ( 93.4 percent solved); (d) residual assets o f power
producer plant accounts ( 59 percent solved); and (e) accounting treatment for expenses incurred
for the terminated power plant projects, 33 percent and the balance will be adjusted after the on-
going validation work i s completed. Most o fthe remaining unadjusted balances relate to
transactions prior to the reorganization o fNPC in2003. Inorder to complete any remaining


                                               20

internal control weaknesses, NPC management will work with TransCo through a task force
usingcurrent internal staff, which will be dedicated to work on the verification, reconciliation
andrecordingofthe adjustments. These issuesthough are not expected to be present inthe
processing, recording and reporting o fthe project transactions. The project will only be operating
inone locationandinvolved a few contracts only. Furthermore,all contracts are on supply and
install arrangement such that the risk o f losses to materials and monitoring o f the inventory
supplies while under constructionand implementation still rests with the contractors.

8.        Solution o f these outstanding balances will needto take place prior to the Bank appraisal
o f the next potential project with TransCo. Inthat context, and as stated before, the Bank is
planning to support such a concession with a Partial Risk Guarantee, which i s plannedto be
appraised sometimes around June 2008.

Overall Financial ManagementRiskAssessment

9.        The appraisal considers the financial management risk low (see Table 4.1).

Country Issues

10.       The only relevant country issue is the perceived highcorruption inthe country. This can
be controlled under this project becausethere are only a few contracts involved and the project is
confined to only one location. Furthermore, the internal audit (by TransCo) i s requiredto include
this Project inits scope ofwork.

                                    Furthermore, prior review of contracts by the Bank
                                    procurementspecialist was already conducted for the

FinancialManagementArrangementsfor the Project

11.     Budgeting.This is an emergency project, andtherefore was given exceptional approval
by all government agencies. Estimates ofthe cost o frestoration were done by qualified technical
staff inTransCo and were the basis for the procurement activities. The relevant government
agencies reacted quickly to TransCo request for early action to restore the damaged transmission
line structures. On February 7,2007, TransCo notified the Energy Regulatory Commission
(ERC) o f its intentionto apply the Force Majeure provisions inthe ERC rules that are supported
by documentation from the Departmento f Science and Technology as to the extent o fthe
damage. Both the EnvironmentManagement Bureau (March 15,2007) and the National
Economic Development Agency (March 19,2007) quickly approved the extent of the proposed
restoration project on an exceptional basis.

12.     Accounting. The processing, recording, and reporting ofproject transactions has been
mainstreamed. TransCo has adequate financial management manual from purchasing to asset
management, recording, and reporting. The officers and staff involved inthe accounting function
for the project are all experienced inproject accounting and have adequate qualifications. The
officers and staff are mostly accounting graduates and certified public accountants andor with a
masters degree infinance or businessmanagement. The general accounting system of TransCo is
computerized usingOracle. A job order number is created for eachproject order and all costs
incurred are recorded based on thejob order number.A project monitoring system i s inplace to
monitor the actual costs against budget and contracted amounts. The proposedproject also has its
ownjob order number-facilitating generation o f project financial reports.

13.     Internalcontroland auditing.TransCo's internal controls and procedures have been
adopted for this project and the internal audit unit covers the project inits scope o f work. It i s
expected that the internal audits will take place each calendar semester duringthe project
implementation, with a copy o f the reports submittedto the Bank 30 days after the end o f each
calendar semester. Based on the review o f the finance procedure manual and the process flow
charts, the system o f internal controls was found to be adequate. There is also adequate
segregation o f incompatible functions and independent management controls -such as the
preparation o f bank reconciliation statements, physical count of fixed assets and inventories and
reconciliation of the same with the accounting records, and reconciliation o f subsidiary ledgers
with the general ledgers, etc.

14.     TransCo has an internal audit department, which reports directly to the Board, with
14 staff who are graduates o f accounting (all are also certified public accountants) and a
mechanical engineer. The internal audit head i s a lawyer and has a master's degree inbusiness
administration. On average, the audit staff have 14 years o f internal audit experience.

Funds Flow and DisbursementArrangement

15.     The loan inthe amount o f US$12.94 million will finance civil works and goods at
100 percent o f the eligible expenditures. Direct payment method shall be applied under the
project, except for the retroactive financing which will be through reimbursement supported by

                              Annex 5: ProcurementArrangements
                          Philippines:BicolPowerRestorationProject

Overview
1.      The procurement for the proposed Project would be carried out inaccordance with the
World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" datedon May
2004, revisedon October 2006, and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World BankBorrowers" dated on May 2004, revised on October 2006; and the provisions
stipulated inthe Legal Agreement. The various itemsunder different expenditure categories are
described ingeneral below. Since the Project i s inresponse to an emergency situation,
OP/BP8.00 applies, which allows for flexible and simplifiedprocurement approaches.

Goods and Works
2.      The procurement o f goods, and incidentalworks and installation, procuredand financed
underthis project include three (3) contract packages for the supply, delivery, and installation of
transmission steel towers and line materials. These are:

0       Package A: Supply and Installationo f 56 transmission steel towers and line materials for
        typhoon damaged portions o f the double circuit Naga-Lab0 230 kV 795mm ACSR
        transmission line. Contract cost: US$5.7lmillion;

0       Package B: Supply and Installationo f 32 transmission steel towers and line materials for
        typhoon damaged portions o fthe double circuit Tiwi Plant C-Naga 230 kV 2-795mm
        ACSR transmission line. Contract cost: US$4.63million; and

0       Package C: Supply and Installationo f 30 transmission steel towers and line materials for
        typhoon damaged portions o fthe double circuit 230 kV ACSR transmission lines from:
        (i) PlantA-Daraga(1-795mm); (ii)
            Tiwi                                 Naga-Daraga (1-795mm); and (iii)    Bacman-
        Daraga (2-795mm). Contract cost: US$3.64million.

3.      Giventhe emergency nature o fthe project, the procurement for the contracts took place
through NCB procedures using the Philippine BiddingDocument (PBD) for procurement o f
goods, as harmonizedwith the Bank (see box below for details o fN C B provisions). Under
normal conditions, ICB procedures would have been followed due to the amounts o f the
contracts, but the Bank has agreed to raise the N C B threshold for goods to provide for increased
flexibility on the use of simplifiedprocurement methods (Op/BP 8.00). The Bank has also
agreed to the imposition o f the Approved Budget for the Contract as a ceiling on bidprices after
TransCo demonstrated its compliance with three o f the four conditions set by the Bank (i-e.,
Conditions 2 to 4 inthe box below) in2003. Dueto the technical impossibility o f uploading the
complete set o f bid documents, the Bank agreed to allow Condition 1on a highly exceptional
basis and without setting any precedent for future transactions.

RetroactiveFinancing
4.      The loan will finance, retroactively, up to US$10.35 million o f eligible expenditures for
project activities paid 12 months before loan signature, or 80 percent of the total loan amount.
The goods, including installation, to be eligible for retroactive financing shall be contracted
following the agreed procedures adopted for the project.

5.      The project will acquire landandpay for it inaccordance with the relevant Resettlement
Action Plan satisfactory to the Bank. Related expenditureswill be financed at 100percent by the
Government o f the Philippines (GOP).

ImplementationCapabilityof TransCo
6.      The overall implementation ofthe project, includingprocurement, is the responsibility of
theNational Transmission Corporation (TransCo). As statedbefore, the Bank has agreed with
PSALMto makethe loan to NPC with arrangements to transfer all the funds to TransCo under a
separate subsidiary agreement. The Bank has had considerable experience in supervising
TransCo's project implementationprograms under a number o f projects implemented during the
1990sthrough early 2000s. These include the Leyte-Cebu Geothermal Project, Leyte-Luzon
Geothermal Project, and the Transmission GridReinforcement Project. TransCo staff, which
usedto be with NPC and involved inthese projects, are still with TransCo to this present date.
TransCo has a qualified Project Management Team, which was supported inpart by earlier Bank
operations, wherein several key staff were provided training inproject management and achieved
certified Project Manager status inthe UnitedStates after a three-monthcourse by the Project
Management Institute.They also have proven international qualifications and experience in
Bank-financed procurement.

7.      The Procurement Specialist made an assessment, duringthe months o fApril to May
2007, o fthe capacity o f the implementing agency to undertakeprocurement activities for the
project, it also visited the project site inJuly 2007. The assessmentreviewed the organizational
structure for implementingthe project and the interaction among the project's staff responsible
for procurement. The assessment showed that TransCo has established units (fully staffed Bids
and Awards Committee, including a Technical Working Group) andprocedures to undertake
procurement, including systems and database to monitor and report on bidprices relative to the
approved budgetfor the contract and the engineer's estimate. The assessment also took into
consideration the findings o f the Bank's Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for
the Philippines.
8.      Appropriate training has beenprovided to TransCo inrelation to the new procurement
law (RA 9184), and its implementing rules and regulations, and inthe use o f Philippine Bidding
Documents for procurement following national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. Based on
the overall assessment ofTransCo's capability, the appraisal has ratedthe overall procurement
riskfor the project as low.

ProcurementPlan
9.      The Recipient, prior to appraisal, developed a procurement planfor project
implementation that providesthe basis for the procurementmethods. This planhas beenagreed

                           Philippines:BicolPowerRestorationProject

1.      Beingthe only power Transmission Company inthe country, TransCo's mandate is to
provide transmission o f reliable and affordable electricity andthereby help improve the
economic status and quality o f life of the people. The Emergency Loan Project will allow Bicol,
a poverty-strickenregion that has the highest incidence o f typhoons inthe country, to regain its
continuous supply o f electricity.

2.      Fieldvisits to the transmission towers andtheir surrounding areas inAlbay andthe
Camarines Sur have been conducted to determinethe extent o f damage caused by the super
typhoons "Reming" and "Milenyo." The typhoons not only toppled towers, but also devastated
agricultural landsand a significant number o f infrastructures. For several months now,
emergency response systems (ERS) were set up by TransCo to deliver a steady power supply to
the BicolRegion. Still, the regioncontinues to suffer regular power outages due to the greatly
reduced capacity o f the towers to transmit electricity. Giventheir transitory use, the ERS (made
up of simple steel towers) are not designedto withstandthe powerful winds and torrential rains
that inundate the region each typhoon season. The felled towers and cables have renderedsome
lands and passageways inaccessible to the residents. Nature has taken its time to re-establish
itself inthe immediate vicinity of the towers and the hangingcables. While the plans are to build
the newtowers following the same alignment, there is a needto restore the affected areasto their
natural state. It was also noted that sections o f the felled towers and cables have been ransacked
and pilfered. Security measures should also be put inplace to safeguard the existing materials
that could be re-used as well as ensure that the new towers and cables are not vandalized or torn
apart by unscrupulousindividuals.

EnvironmentalCapabilityofTransCo

3.      TransCo has an Environmental Management Departmentledby a highly qualified
Division Manager, with a staff complement o f environmental and social development specialists
inits central and field offices. Itis anI S 0 14001certifiedcompany andhas adopted in
January 5, 2004, its own Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Stewardship
Program and has an environmental management system inplace. Prescribed inits Project
Management Procedural manual effective December 18,2006, under the section on Project
development procedures, i s a detailed procedural flow chart on the conduct o f the Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) and securing the Environmental Compliance Certificate
(ECC)/Certificate o fNon-coverage (CNC). This process i s inaccordance with the national rules
and regulations prescribing the requirementsfor the conduct o f an EIA study and securing the
appropriate environmental certificate. This process meets the Bank's minimumrequirements
specified under OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment.

4.      For the Bicol and Quezon Power Restoration Project, an Environmental Impact and
Management Plan, which includesa reforestation plan, has beenprepared.An inventory o f the
vegetation to be affected i s being finalized as part o f the EMP. The management plan has
adequately provided for the mitigation o f the significant impacts that may be generated by the



                                              31

project. However, implementationof the mitigatingmeasures -such as the setting up and
maintaining of the buffer zones for the right of way -needs to be donejudiciously to ensure
that the residents are outsidethe electric and magnetic fields generatedby the transmission lines.
The bufferzones also needto be secured to deter trespassingandpilferage. Another measurethat
needs to be strengthenedi s the establishment of biodiversity offsets to replace the natural
environment (including the natural vegetation that serves as habitat for the endemic flora and
fauna) that is displacedor modifiedinthe areas traversed by the transmission lines as well as
diverting the flight paths of migrating birdsthat aboundinthe primary and secondary impact
areas.

5.      For the project, the Contractor's Contract and Terms of Referencealso includes the
responsibility to implementthe EMP and secure all the necessary permits required by the
regulatory agencies.

Social ImpactAssessment

6.      Expectedbenefits.The Bicol RestorationProject is expectedto provide direct and
indirectbenefits to millions of householdsnot only inthe Bicol regionbut also those served by
the LuzonGrid. When completed, the restoredtransmission system is expectedto improve
safety, reliability, and efficiency of the power system, resulting instable transmission of energy
to customers inBicol primarily, but also Luzonespecially during the occurrenceof super
typhoons already reported as probablethis year.

7.      Limited involuntaryresettlement.The proposedproject is assessedas having some
impactfrom involuntary resettlement. Eighty two structures (47 houses and 35 other structures)
andtheir 47 owners have beenidentified within the Right-of-way (ROW) ofthe felled towers
and will have to be completely or partially displacedduring reconstruction. The reconstruction of
the transmission systemmay cause some inconvenienceandmay requireminor cutting and/or
trimming of the trees, that are beyondthree-meter high, owned by local residents. Inthe
consultation done by the task team, the residents generally expressedsupport for the project.
Further, local residents sharedthat many ofthem havereceivedaone-time tower occupancy fee
during construction of the towers.

8.      The Bankhas reviewedthe BPRP LandAcquisitionandResettlementPlan (LAW) and it
has beenfound generally compliant to the objectives andprinciplesof OP 4.12. The TransCo
Social Engineering and Right-of-way Managementstaff are skilledand have experience in
implementing this sort of project, having done similar activities inprevious Bank and other
assisted projects. As an improvement, they now have an informalmechanismthat addresses the
issue of imperfect land documentation, mostly heldby poor farmers, which previously led to
noddelayed payment o f compensation. The cost of this activity is part of the Approved 2007
Budgets of the Social Engineering and Right-of-Way Management Divisions.

9.      A review done during project preparationwith the National Commission on Indigenous
People (NCIP), Albay Provincial Officer, provided an indicative list ofproject affectedpersons,
their properties andtheir location together with the type of landdocumentscovering these
properties. The review showed that none of the Tiwi Barangayswith ancestral domains (Joroam,



                                              32

Misibis, Taabong, and Maayong) are affected by the restorationproject. A similar review for
BuhiBarangayswith Ads (Sta Cmz, Ipil, Kaulam, andIraya) also showedthe same results. It
has beenagreedthat incase any indigenous population is affected the Bank's IPpolicy will be
complied with, particularly inthe area of consultation and compensation. Dueto the emergency
nature of the Project, the NCIP Officer inthe area revealedthat the Free and Prior Informed
ConsentKertificate Precondition(FPICKP) requirementis not applicable to the BPRP. For
good practice, TransCo applied, and was granted on September 4,2007, for a certification from
the National Commission on IndigenousPeople(NCIP) confirming that the Free and Prior
Informed Consent (FPIC) is not requiredfor this emergency project. Inthe course of project
implementation, public consultations shall still be done with project affected persons, especially
to get their agreementon the LAW and seek their cooperationon the security of the towers. On
compensation (ifneeded), it was also agreedthat the LARP guidelines will be applied.

10.      Special concerns of women. To better understandthe concerns of women regarding the
project, an all-woman consultation was held during project preparation inZone 1, Barangay
Sagurong inPili, Camarines Sur. Their houses are within the Right-of-way of the transmission
lines and are identified for resettlement. Though they are aware of the promise of resettlement
assistance and compensation, they appealthat they be allowed to continue occupancy intheir
present location under the transmission cables claiming that the danger of continued occupancy
i s distant and the needto rebuildtheir houses i s too difficult. It i s suggestedthat TransCo
implementsInformation, Education and Communication (IEC) on the dangers of living underthe
grid. It is further suggested that a Community BasedProgramfor the security of tower be
developed and implementedby TransCo.

                                   Annex 9: EconomicAnalysis
                          Philippines:BicolPowerRestorationProject
Background

1,      The Bicol region, one o f 17regions inthe Philippines, has a population o f about
5 million. In2005, the region accounted for about 3 percent (US$2 billion) o f the Philippines'
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The services sector accounts for the major share o f economic
activity inthe region, about 55 percent o f the total, with industry's contribution about 25 percent
o f GDP and that o f agriculture close to 20 percent. The normal load inthe Bicol system is about
164 MW.

Frequencyof Severe Typhoons

2.      The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration
(PAGASA) reports that inthe past 50 years about 11destructive typhoons have struck the Bicol
region. The Philippines averages around 20 typhoons a year. Therefore, a destructive typhoon
passingthrough the Bicol region is probable every five years. This probability of destruction
poses a serious risk not only to the to the transmission lines that supply the Bicol region in
Southern Luzon but also the Northern Luzon area, because damage to the Southern portion o f the
transmission system can disrupt the Northern portion due to the build up o f reactive power.
Furthermore, the electricity grid that suppliesthe Bicol region also forms a part o f the main
230 kV grid, feedingthe main load center inManila, and any interruption o f this supply could
seriously hinder the economy.

Basis for EconomicAnalysis

3.      The main reason for the urgency inrestoringpower transmission capacity i s to minimize
the economic cost ofunsuppliedenergy and replace temporary, emergency structures -
incapable o f withstanding highwind speeds-with permanent structures more resistant to
typhoon damage, inorder to prevent further loss o f supply that could result from future
typhoons. The total unsupplied energy duringthe two-day interruption inLuzon in2006
amounted to 200 GWh. Although some restoration o f the systemhas taken place, unsupplied
energy still amounts to about 50 GWh, or about a quarter o f electricity consumption inthe Bicol
region (see Figure 9.1 below).

4.      The economic analysis rests on four key assumptions. The first is the probability that a
severe typhoon will hit the Bicol region inthe future and result indestruction similar to what
took place in2006. The available data from PAGASA show a probability of 1percent that, in
any given year, a typhoon striking the Bicol region may cause similar damage to the transmission
system and result ina two-day blackout o f service at the level o f200 GWh, with a continued
deficit of 50 GWhassumed to last for a periodo ftwo days. The second assumptionis the
economic cost o f supply at about US$5 millionper GWh, which does not take into account any
lost revenues to TransCo. The third assumption i s that the transmissiontowers financed by the
project will remainstructurally sound for 20 years. The fourth assumption i s that total project
costs will amount to about US$25 million, including all project components, right-of-way and
relocation costs, and contingencies.



                                              34

5.      The assumptions for benefits are on the conservative side for two reasons. First, they only
reflect the observable loss o f economic benefits resultingfrom unsupplied energy and do not
account for the loss o f unobserved benefits such as the loss o f consumer surplus due to
suppressed demand. Second, the amount o f electricity unsuppliedmay be on the low side given
that major service interruptions could last more than a couple o f days.

Assessment of Economic Benefits

6.      Based on the above assumptions, the assessmentresults inan internal economic rate-of-
return(IERR)of 50 percent for the base case of a one percent annual probability, over a 20-year
period, that a destructive typhoon will hit the Bicol area again. Also, the assessment conducted a
sensitivity analysis considering higher and lower probabilities o f a destructive typhoon as well as
50 percent reduction inthe assumed economic cost o f supply per GWh. Alternative probabilities
o f 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent and consideration o f 50 percent lower economic cost o f supply
resulted inEIRRs o f between 12percent and 80 percent, respectively. Inall cases, the IERRsare
robust, and are substantially higher thanthe cost o f capital inthe Philippines, where the average
lendingrate is at 7 percent. Table 9.1 summarizes the calculations o fthe EIRRsby probability
scenarios for destructive typhoons.

The National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) is responsiblefor the operation of over
20,000 kmof the Philippines' national grid extending throughout the mainpopulated areas of the
Philippines archipelago.Inparticular the load centers of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao are
served by TransCo's 500/230/69 kV transmissionnetworks that runthrough rugged coastal and
mountainousterrain exposedto varying degrees of adverse weather systems. The Luzonand
Visayas system are interconnectedby anunderseaand overhead HVDC system.

Two "super-typhoons" -Milenyo and Reming -hit the Bicol area of South West Luzon in
September andNovember 2006 causingserious damage to the local community and its
infrastructure. The most recent typhoon ("Reming") hit the country with unprecedentedwind
gusts -exceeding230 km/hr-knocking out 118 transmission towers supporting five
transmission lines interconnecting critical 230kV substationsthe Naga, Labo, Tiwi, Daraga, and
Bacman.

A study by TransCo, completed inFebruary2007, has established that the SouthernLuzon-
Visayas typhoon corridor is apparently subjectedto an increasedincidence of super-typhoons
(e.g., wind speeds above 2OOMhr). Accordingly, TransCo is concernedabout the capacity of
the transmission systemto withstand the increasingnumber of future super-typhoonsas well as
its own capability to minimize the economic impact o f the significant amounts of un-served
energy that are a consequence ofthe system blackouts.

Many of TransCo's transmission lines were built inthe 1960sand are not capable ofhandling the
highwind speeds of the super typhoons that were experiencedrecently inBicol. Insome cases,
the strengthofthe towers has been compromisedby the theft ofvital parts leaving them
particularly vulnerable to damage. As a result, the TransCo i s considering undertaking a
comprehensivetower strengtheningprogram, particularly incountry's critical high wind zones."

TransCo has applied to the World Bank for financing to restore the damagedBicol lines, and
expectsthese to be restoredto service (under emergency contracting and financing procedures)
by March 2008. It is proposedthat the Bank loan will also finance the recruitmentof consultants
to assist TransCo's Systems and Reliability Group (S&RG) to perform a comprehensive risk
assessment of the exposure of the transmissionnetwork to extreme weather related events,




I ODuringthe 1990sTransCo reviewed its designstandards for transmission line wind speedresistanceto be
consistent with standards adopted in Taiwan and Japan. It adoptedwind speeds for Zone I(270 km/h)which would
apply to the Bicol-Visayascorridor and Zone I1for all other areas (240Mhr) where typhoons are not expectedto be
so severe. This compares with the designstandards from 1960-1980 of 165-180 kdhr and usedon the damaged
lines.

Scope of Services

The consultants will be requiredassist the R&SG unit inpreparing a planculminating ina report
and recommendation to management on how bestto proceed. The work will include but not
necessarily be limitedto the following components:

        Assess the frequency and magnitude o f recent typhoons, the damage done and the
        economic consequences o f power system disruptions to verify the seriousness o f the
        situation and whether it appears to be influencedby global climatic changes;

        Commence a survey o f transmission lines initially inall Zone 1 Areas to identifythe
        scope o f work that needs to be done to minimize the damage caused by the increasing
        incidence o f super typhoons;

        Identify methods of strengtheningexisting towers at lowest cost and recommendways in
        which towers can be tested in situ to ensure they meet minimumstandards;
