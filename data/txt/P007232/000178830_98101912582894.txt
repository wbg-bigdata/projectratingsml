TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for rehabilitation, improvement
and extension of the Tapakuma Irrigation Project, located on the Essequibo
coast in the northwestern part of the country. The project would increase
rice production in an area of 41,750 ac. through double cropping of the
entire area, better drainage to relieve flood damage, onfarm development
(land leveling) to achieve greater efficiency in water use, and the use
improved seed varieties. It would be the second Bank operation in the
agricultural sector. In 1970 an IDA credit of US$2.2 million wAs approved
for ranch development and livestock production and this project has encount-
ered some difficulties which are slowly being overcome.
ii.       Guyana is dependent on three products, namely, bauxite, sugar and
rice, for export earnings. While rice earns less than the other two, it
contributes 11% of the GDP and employs about 25% of the total labor force.
it also is the major staple food of the country. Up until 1965 annual pro-
cluction increased steadily and Guyana became the major producer and exporter
to the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) region. However, since
then the total acreage cropped and yields began to decline. Guyana's ex-
ports declined sharply, from about 95,000 metric tons in 1968 to about 60,000
metric tons in 1970. In 1969 the Government initiated a Rice Modernization
Program aimed at improving the situation. It was financed jointly by USAID
(G$ 25 million) and by the Government (G$ 10 million) and is nearing com-
pletion.
iii.      In its Second Development Plan for 1972-76, the Government gives
priority to the development of the agricultural sector. The improvement and
expansion of irrigation and drainage in the two major rice areas, namely,
Tapakuma and the Black Bush Polder, are important components of the plan.
In comparison with other areas, the Tapakuma area is depressed economically
with a low per capita income. The land presently under cultivation in the
project area, both with and without irrigation, consists of about 30,750 ac
with 23,750 ac under the existing Tapakuma irrigation scheme and 7,000 ac
in the contiguous Johanna Cecilia and Supenaam areas to the southeast. An
additional 5,000 ac would be developed for rice in the proposed Somerset-
Berks extension which, with 6,000 acres of idle or bush land throughout
the project area to be cleared and prepared for irrigation, would bring
the total for the proposed project to 41,750 ac. Total population in the
project area is about 30,000, comprising about 5,000 families who are al-
most wholly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Ownership of
the land is about evenly divided between freehold and Government land, the
latter nearly all held by farmers under long-term (20 to 25 years) leases.
The size of the farms generally ranges from 2 to 20 acres with a few pri-
vately owned farms of 500 acres or more. However, large farms are an ex-
ception, with 98% of all farms being less than 20 acres.



- ii -
iv.       The main constraints are lack of efficient drainage, poor roads,
lack of land leveling, inadequate extension service and management. The pro-
posed Tapakuma Irrigation Project has been planned to resolve these problems
and would be a major step in the Government's program to improve both produc-
tion and quality of rice, to gain an even larger share of the export market
arid to improve income to farmers.
V.        The estimated proje-t cost is US$18.50 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$12.9) million, which would be the amount of the
loan, including contingencies, and interest during construction, or 69% of
the total. The balance of the project costs, equivalent to US$5.60 million,
would be financed by Government. Out of the total project cost about US$7.03
million would be procured through international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with Bank guidelines. This would consist of project works (US$5.04 mil-
lion) and equipment (US$1.99 million). Consultant services (US$1.75 million)
would be procured through direct negotiation. The balance consists of onfarm
development (US$1.39 million) to be performed directly by Government with
equipment provided under the project, buildings (US$0.12 million) under local
contracts, administration and engineering (US$0.40 million), extension ser-
vices (US$0.24 million), contingencies (US$5.87 million), and interest dur-
ing construction (US$1.70 million). Guyana is a member of the Carribean
Common Market (CARICOM), and Guyana and regional members of this group would
be offered bidders preference in accordance with Bank procedures. The proj-
ect would be implemented during the period 1974-79.
vi.       The Ministry of National Development and Agriculture (MNDA) would
be responsible for implementing both the construction and agricultural devel-
opment phases of the project. The Ministry would appoint a Project Manager
who would have authority over all activities at the project level and be
responsible to the Ministry of National Development and Agriculture.
vii.      At full development in 1982 the net value of production at economic
prices would be about US$9.8 million per year, compared to the estimated value
of US$4.9 million per year without the project. Some 5,000 farmers would
benefit from the project. At full production, annual farm income would in-
crease by US$318, US$641, US$839 and US$951 for 5, 10, 20 andt30 AC farms
respectively (Annex 6). These increases over their estimated income with-
out the project in 1980, represent a 200% increase for subsistence farmers
(5 ac); 80% increase for family farmers (10 ac); 492 increase for medium
size farmers (20 ac) and 37% increase in income for large farm.rs (30 ac
inn  over).  An increase in the cropping intensity and production would sig-
nificantly reduce seasonal unemployment. About 6,000 ac of idle or bush
land would be prepared for irrigation and be available for new settlers or
to expand existing small farms. The project would also contribute to an in-
crease in foreign exchange earnings, since all the increase in rice produc-
tion would go to the export market. The economic rate of return over a 50-
vear period would be 20%.
viii.     With appropriate assurances obtained from Government, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12.90 million, with a repayment period



- iii -
of 30 years, including a 6-year grace period. The borrower would be the
Government, with the Ministry of National Development and Agriculture as
the executing agency.

TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Guyana has requested Bank assistance in financing
improvement and extension of the rapakuma Irrigation Project. This would be
the second Bank Group operation in Guyana in the agricultural sector, the
first being an IDA credit of US$2.2 million for ranch and livestock develop-
ment (221-GUA) signed in November 1970.
1.02      The proposed project would be part of a comprehensive plan being
carried out by Government to increase the production of rice and improve the
quality, particularly for export. The Tapakuma area is an important rice
producing area, contributing about 20% of total country production. Govern-
ment is presently completing a Rice Modernization Program, started in 1969
with financial assistance from USAID, which includes construction of six large
drying and silo storage installations in the country (two in the project area),
improved seed production facilities and establishment of a central research
station. The project would be the first phase of a plan to improve and extend
irrigation and drainage works throughout the coastal area of the country,
mainly for rice cultivation, which would include the Black Bush Polder area,
south and east of the Berbice river, as the next phase. The project area
would also benefit from protection provided by the Sea Defense Project which,
with Bank Group assistance, (559-GUA and 765-GUA), has been underway since 1968.
1.03      Feasibility studies for the proposed project were carried out by a
private consulting firm, Harza Engineering Co., Chicago, Ill., during 1971-73.
This study, which was financed by USAID, forms the basis for the appraisal
covered by this report.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission that
visited the area in May 1973. The mission included Messrs. W.A. Lucas,
J-J. Schul and H. Feuerstein (LCPAG) and J.E. Blom (consultant).
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      In Guyana agriculture and bauxite production represent about 40%
of the GDP and about 90% of foreign exchange earnings from merchandise
exports. The total agricultural sector, including fishing and forestry pro-
ducts, accounts for about 20% of GDP and 40% of export earnings as compared
to bauxite which accounts for about the same level of GDP (20%) and 50% of
export earnings. In the agricultural sector, the value of rice adcounts for
11% of the total value of production and 20% of export earnings, ranking
second to sugar which produces 50% of the value and about 65% of export
earnings. Although rice was not listed under the trade products in the



Carribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) Agreement, about 50% of annual
production is exported to CARIFTA countries, mainly Jamaica and Trinidad and
Tobago. The importance of the rice industry in the economy is exemplified by
the high proportion (30%) of the country's population and labor force which
is dependent on rice production for its livelihood. Rice is also the major
staple food of the country.
2.02      Prior to 1965 rice production and acreage cropped increased stead-
ily to a point where Guyana became the major producer and exporter in the
CARIFTA region. At this point, with a total annual production of 165,000
metric tons from about 250,000 ac, both production and acreage cropped began
to decline and the trend has continued up to 1972. This was due to several
factors, including low prices paid to the farmers, inadequate inputs and
technical assistance, low yields from continued use of traditional varieties
and lack of public investment to support and improve the industry. As a con-
sequence Guyana's exports declined from about 95,000 metric tons in 1968 to
60,000 metric tons in 1970.
2.03      The rice industry in Guyana was basically controlled by Government
through the Guyana Rice Marketing Board (GRMB), the purchasing and marketing
agency, and the Guyana Rice Corporation (GRC), which played a strong role on
the production side through provision oi better quality seed, production inputs,
agricultural credit and machinery services, and the milling and processing of
rice. These two agencies have recently been merged into the Guyana Rice Board
(GRB), a public corporation under the Ministry of National Development and
Agriculture.
2.04      In 1969 Government initiated a Rice Modernization Program, with
financial assistance from USAID. This included the construction of six large
drying and storage facilities, of which two are located in the project area;
the establishment of a central rice research and seed production station at
MARDS (Mahaica Abary Rice Development Station); and the modernization and
expansion of both Government and privately owned rice mills.  Large scale
imports of improved seed from the USA were also undertaken as a means to rapid
improvement of quality and production. The modernization program, together
with the exceptionally high world market and CARIFTA trade area prices, have
reversed the downward trend. However, productivity levels and quality are
relatively low by world standards, and continuing improvements are required
for the rice industry to reach its full potential.
2.05      Two major rice producing areas, i.e., the Tapakiuna area in the
northwestern part of the coastal area and the Black Bush Polder area in the
southeastern part, have been given priority for improvement and extension of
irrigation and drainage facilities in the Second Development PIan covering
the period 1972-76. This would represent the next step, following the Rice
Modernizatiop Program. in the overall program to increase production and
improve the quality of rice. The Development Plan envisaged an ultimate
goal of 350,000 ac double cropped to rice but a goal of 290,000 to 300,000
ac would seem more attainable. The Tapakuma project would be the first
phase in the land development part of the plan with the Black Bush project
expected to be ready for appraisal late in 1974 or early 1975.

III.  THE PROJECT AREA
Location and Area
3.01      The project area is located along the coastal plain in the north-
western part of Guyana, in an area known locally as the Essequibo coast.
(Map 10763). The proposed project would consist of four sub-areas as follows:
a)   The existing Tapakuma Irrigation Scheme, with a gross area
of 35,000 ac and a net area of 23,700 ac (Map 10765);
b)   The proposed extension from the Somerset Berks canal northwest
to the existing Crozier drainage canal, with the Pomeroon
river forming the western boundary covering 8,000 ac gross
and 5,400 ac net (Map 10764);
c)   The proposed Johanna Cecilia extension extending from Annandale
southeast to Maria's Lodge, comprising about 3,300 ac gross
and 2,640 ac net (Map 10767); and
d)   The proposed supenaam extension extending from Maria's Lodge
southeast to the supenaam river, comprising about 10,800 ac
gross and 5,950 ac net (Map 10766).
Climate and Soils
3.02      The climate is tropical, with uniform temperatures throughout the
year ranging between 79.5°F to 82°F. Rainfall normally occurs in every month
of the year with an annual average of 90 inches. However, the two periods of
heaviest rainfall are from May to August and from November through January
and this distribution limits the awount of double cropping under rain-fed
conditions. A large part of the ptoject area is below high tide level and
is protected by a sea defense wall. Topography throughout the area is excep-
tionally uniform, which makes the land suitable for irrigation and facilitates
land leveling. With the exception of the Somerset Berks extension, which is
overlain with organic peat (Pegasse), the irrigable soils are suitable for
rice cultivation and would present no serious problems (Annex 1).
pulation, Employment and Land Tenure
3.03      Population in the project area is estimated at 30,000.  About 80%
of the total population is directly dependent upon farming. There are about
five to eight persons per farm family and the average age of the farmers is
about 49 years. Almost 75% of the operators have had five or more years of
schooling.
3.04      Country-wide unemployment and underemployment also affect the
project area. It is generally believed that in recent years unemployment has
never been less than 15% of the labor force since 1945.  The rice industry
has changed from labor-intensive methods of cultivation to highly mechanized
techniques, which las made it possible to expand the industry in Guyana with-
out significantly creating unemployment.



-4-
3.05      The total net acreage of 41,750 ac in the proposed project would
contain an almost equal share of freehold land and land owned by the Gov-
ernment. Part of the freehold land is rented in small plots to tenants
whose security is protected by a Rice Farmers' (Security of Tenure) Ordin-
ance of 1956, as amended April 14, 1971. Government-owned land is leased
to small farmers in 5 to 10 ac trac:s on a 25 year basis, subject to renewal.
Approximately 11,000 ac of leased lInd in the project area is in land devel-
opment schemes administered by Government.
3.06      The average farm size is 7.7 ac, with about half the farmers owning
less than 5 ac plots. About 90% of the farms and 65% of the area is in farms
less than 10 ac. Under the mechanized cultivation system, only farms of 10 ac
or more are economically viable and, therefore, the additional farm land
brought into production would be subdivided in farms of between 10 and 50 ac,
contributing to increase the average farm size to about 9 ac. The issue of
mechanization is complex; world wide experience shows that once farmers have
been accustomed to mechanized farming, the&trend to further mechanization is
usually not reversible. Therefore, although the trend to larger farm sizes
and mechanization would be slowed down by higher production and intensified
land use, it is unlikely to be stopped. Further details of the existing and
future land tenure pattern are given in Annex 1, Table 6.
Agricultural Production
3.07      The existing Tapakuma Irrigation Scheme was completed in 1963, by
which time the area had been converted to rice production. Rice is grown
during two seasons each year at an average cropping intensity of about 145%;
30% in the auturm crop from May through October and 65% in the spring crop
from November through April. Yields in the area are slightly higher than in
the rest of the country, averaging 12.4 bags of 152 lb or 0.85 m ton per acre
for each crop during the period 1968-71. Total production from the Essequibo
coast in 1972 was estimated at 500,000 bags. Rice accounts for 90% of the
area cultivated and supplies about 20% of total production in Guyana and
provided an annual gross income of about G$ 3.2 million, which represented
more than 90% of the farmers' income. Other crops, mainly coconuts, citrus,
coffee, plantains, and ground provisions (vegetables and other food crops)
are also grown in the area.
Institutional Assistance
3.08      Within the Ministry of National Development and Agriculture, several
departments through their respective divisions are responsible for management
and production activities in the project area. The rice industry is largely
controlled by the Guyana Rice Board (GRB) established in 1973 (para 2.03).
GRB is responsible for rice research, seed production, machinery services
and farm credit. In 1973, about G$ 500,000 were budgeted for agricultural
supporting*services in the Tapakuma area. GRB is further responsible for
milling and the purchase and resale of milled rice, including that produced
by private millers (para 3.13).



3.09      The Drainage and Irtigation Board (D&I), which was transferred from
the Ministry of Works and Communications to the Ministry of National Devel-
opment and Agriculture in 1973, is the legal entity responsible for the plan-
ning, implementation and management of Declared Irrigation and Drainage Areas.
With D&I as the policy advisory board, the Hydraulics Division in the Minis-
try carries out the actual work of planning constructing and operating and
maintaining irrigation and drainage projects.
3.10      The Agricultural Department, the Land Development Department and the
Lands Department have responsibility, respectively, for extension, land devel-
opment schemes and land titles and rents.
3.11      The Ministry of Cooperative and Community Development provides
assistance to about 35 agricultural cooperatives in the project area. Their
main functions are to obtain credit from GRB or the National Cooperative Bank,
purchase inputs and market production.
3.12      The Rice Action Committee is an advisory association comprising both
Government officials and farmers which promotes the improvement of farming
practices, project facilities and supporting services. It also provides a
useful link between government and farmers in these programs.
Rice Processing
3.13      One GRB and 11 private mills operate in the area.  Their combined
milling capacity is about 1 million bags and parboiling capacity of about
500,000 bags. With the decrease in paddy production to about 500,000 bags
per year, milling costs per unit have increased. While Government-fixed
paddy and milled rice prices have increased in 1972 and 1973, the miller's
margin determined by the difference between these two prices has remained
unchanged since 1967. GRB losses (about G$ 41,000 or 2.5% of the miller's
margin in 1971/72 at the Anna Regina mill) are absorbed from profits on ex-
port sales. Many smaller private millers, however, have closed their fac-
tories and the larger ones may be forced to follow the same line if the
margin is not increased. Private millers have also taken only limited ad-
vantage of the credit opportunities for improvement or modernization of their
mills offered under the USAID financed Private Investment Fund, allegedly
because of the private millers' unsatisfactory financial situation. The
Government is aware of the situation and is studying ways and means to ensure
that private millers with multi-stage units would remain in operation until
1980, when the projected production levels would fill the current capacity.
Assurances were obtained from Government during negotiations that sufficient
drying, storage and milling facilities would be provided by private millers
and GRB to process the total annual production of paddy rice in the project
area.
Transportation
3.14      Access to the project area from Georgetown and the southeastern
part of the country is mainly by coastal freighters or ferry. Highway access



-6-
does not exist due to the 12 mile wide estuary of the Essequibo river which
lies between Georgetown and the most southeasterly point of the project area.
The main road network in the area is satisfactory, but the farm access roads
within the irrigation scheme are in poor conditions and would need to be
improved under the project.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The project would consist of rehabilitation, improvement and
construction of irrigation and drainage systems, and agricultural develop-
ment on 41,750 ac in four contiguous areas along the Essequibo coast. The
project would also include strengthening and expansion of supporting services,
as required to achieve higher productivity levels. About 5,000 farmers, most-
ly smallholders, would benefit from the project. The Ministry of National
Development and Agriculture would be responsible for implementing the project
over a 6-year period, for providing the supporting services, and operating
and maintaining the completed project (charts 8203(R) and 8204).
Project Works
4.02      On the existing Tapakuma Scheme the project works would consist of
rehabilitation and improvement of the irrigation and drainage systems, con-
struction of new interceptor drains, enlargement of the facade drain, con-
struction of three drainage pumping stations, two sea sluices, installation
of an additional pumping unit at Dawa dam, and all-weather surfacing of 40
miles of farm access roads. The Somerset Berks, Johanna Cecilia and Supenaam
extensions would require new irrigation and drainage systems, two pumping
stations for irrigation and one for drainage, enlargement of the existing
conservancy dam on the Unu river, a flood protection dike along the Pomeroon
river, construction of a facade drain, rehabilitation of sea sluices, and
construction of 20 miles of all-weather access roads. Final plans and
designs for all works would be prepared by the Hydraulics Division, assisted
by consultants, during the course of the project (para 4.07). Details on
project works are presented in Annex 1.
On Farm Development
4.03      On farm development would consist primarily of land leveling on
about 20,000 ac presently cropped to rice, and clearing and leveling on
7,000 ac of bush land suitable for rice production. Following construction
of the civil works and on farm development it is estimated that 6,000 ac of
land suitable for irrigated cropping would be available for new settlers. The
land leveling program would be tarried out during the six-month spring crop
season from November through April, the driest part of the year, when normally
about 50% of the land is under crop, making it possible to carry out leveling
operations without serious disruption of the cropping pattern.



-7-
Agricultural Extension, Applied Research and Seed Production
4.04      The extension, research and seed production activities on the
project would be strengthened in several ways. The Extension Division staff
would be increased from three to six agents, with suitable training by a
consultant to upgrade their competence in specific fields of agricultural
production. The Division would also be provided with adequate field equip-
ment to service the farmers, principally for soils testing to determine
fertilizer requirements, efficient water use and proper cultivation practices.
Rice research and seed product;ion in the area would be improved and additional
seed storage capacity and processing equipment would be provided. The field
operations of both the Extension Division and the GRB technical assistance
program (para 3.08) would be coordinated and a farmer training program would
be developed. Agreement was reached with Government during negotiations
that: (a) a Plan of Operations for strengthening extension senrices in the
project area and for implementing programs for training, fertilizer trials
and soil testing would be prepared with the assistance of consultants (para
4.07) and submitted for Bank approval within 18 months after the project is
declared effective; and (b) minimum acceptable standards for control of the
quality of rice seed would be introduced for both private and public seed
producers and this quality control system would be applied specifically to
the McNabb seed farm.
Administration and Supervision
4.05      The project would include establishment of an office for project
management (para 5.02) to supervise and coordinate all activities on the
project. A new project headquarters building at Anna Regina would replace and
consolidate existing facilities. This building would serve as an office for
project management and the staff of the various project divisions. The facili-
ties would also include a machinery repair and servicing shop for equipment
used on the project.
Operation and Mfaintenance
4.06      An Operation and tMaintenance unit would be established within the
Hydraulics Division, under the supervision of a Project Engineer, which would
have full responsibility for these activities on the project (para 5.03). This
division would be provided with adequate staff and equipment to improve both
water management and maintenance on the project (Annex 2).
Consultant Services
4.07      Consultant services would be provided to carry out engineering
design and construction of project works, and on farm development. The
Hydraulics Division, which would be administratively responsible for this
phase of the project, would provide local staff to work with the consultants.
Consultants would also be provided to assist the GRB and the Extension Division
with research, training programs, agricultural development and seed production.



-8-
A total of 26 man-years would be provided for all phases of the project
(Annex 3). It was agreed during negotiations that employment of a consultant
firm, acceptable to the Bank and unier terms and conditions approved by the
Bank, to provide the required professional services for surveys, design, super-
vision of construction for implementation of the project, and for agricultural
development would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Water Supply, Quality, Demand, and Rights
4.08      Water Supply and Quality.  The water supply for the existing
Tapakuma scheme and the proposed Somerset Berks extension would derive from
the Tapakuma conservancy, supplemen:ed by the existing pumping plant at Dawa
which pumps water from the river into the storage reservoir with a capacity
of 12,700 ac ft. With installation of the fourth pumping unit at Dawa the
supply from this system would be adequate for the project (Annex 1, Table 4).
In addition, with extension of the main canal, it is estimated that part of
the Johanna Cecilia area could also be supplied from this source. The water
supply for the Johanna Cecilia extension would be obtained from the small
conservancy wesz of the irrigable area by increasing the capacity of the exist-
ing reservoir. The Supenaam extension would be supplied by pumping from the
Supenaam and Ituribisi rivers. Available flow in these rivers during all
months of the year far exceeds the project demands and the capacity of the
proposed pumping plants would be sufficient to meet these demands. Water
would be of suitable quality as the conten1 of toxic elements is far below
levels that would affect crop production.
4.09      Water Demand.  The irrigation requirements of the project are
largely determined by the requirements of double-cropping rice on about
90% of the project area. These demands were estimated from calculations of
consumptive use based on the Blaney-Criddle method and an assumed field and
conveyance efficiency of 60%. The average annual demand for the project is
estimated at 4.7 ac ft/ac (Annex 1, Tables 2 and 5).
4.10      Water  Rights.  Under the Guyana Water Authority Act of 1972 the
Guyana Water Authority has the power to control and regulate the use of water.
The Authority may delegate these powers to Ministries, agencies or boards.
Ilowever, legislation does not exist in Guyana for the granting of water
rights in the traditional seni,e and the rights of farmers to use water for
irrigation has not been established by law. Under the Drainage and Irrigation
Ordinance of July 1953, as amended, D&I is charged with the control and man-
agement of drainage and irrigation works and empowered to declare Drainage
and Irrigation Areas in areas where public works of this nature are provided
by Government. Within Declared Drainage and Irrigation Areas the D&I Board,
through the Hydraulics Division, makes annual allocations to farmers on a
"time-run" basis which normally allocates a given number of hours of water
use in a seven to ten day rotation (Annex 1).   The current problems in opera-
ting the system is the result of inadequate supervision by Project personnel,
however, this would function more efficiently under the new organization pro-
posed under the project.



-9-
Engineering Design
4.11      Detailed surveys and final design would be required for all works
to be carried out under the project. The project would provide consultants
and local staff, with the necessary equipment and facilities, for this task.
Rehabilitation and improvement of the Tapakuma Scheme would not require
major design work other than the new interceptor drains and the new pumping
plants. Modifications to the present system would be minor and would
consist mainly of cleaning and enlarging existing drains and replacing old
irrigation structures. The scheme was originally designed and constructed
to a high standard and, with the exception of land leveling, enlarging the
drainage facilities and road surfacing, does not require major rehabilitation
or modification. Construction of new irrigation and drainage systems and
roads in the Somerset Berks and Johanna Cecilia-Supenaam extensions would
require extensive surveys and final designs over a period of 18 to 24 months
before construction could begin (Chart 8204). Surveys of individual farms
would be required for land leveling.
Cost Estimates
4.12      Cost estimates for project works in the project are based on es-
timates presented in the feasibility study for the proposed development pre-
pared by Harza Engineering Co, updated to January 1, 1974 by increasing these
costs 24% to reflect post energy crisis conditions. Costs for equipment,
administration and engineering, consultant and extension services and con-
tingencies were initially calculated by the Bank on the basis of 1973 prices.
Estimated equipment costs were subseqluently updated by 20% for 1974 conditions
and costs for services by 10%. The project works costs are based on performing
the construction by contract with both local or foreign contracts but most
likely as joint ventures. Cost of equipment to be imported were estimated
as CIF Guyana, free of duty and taxes as the purchaser would be a Government
ministry. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10% for civil works, in-
cluding on farm development. Price contingencies are calculated using the
following cumulative rates for both local and foreign exchange costs: project
works, 18% in 1974, 15% in 1975 and 12% thereafter; equipment, 14% in 1974,
11% in 1975 and 7.5% thereafter. A contingency increase of 10% cumulative
each year was used for consultant and locally provided administration, en-
gineering and extension services. Project cost estimates are given in detail
in Annex 4 and summarized below:

Financing
4.13      Total project costs of US$18.50 million would be financed by a Bank
loan of US$12.90 million and a Government contribution of US$5.60 million, to
be met by annual budgetary appropriations.  The Government would be the borrower
and carry the foreign exchange risk. The loan, which would be for a period of
30 years, including a 6 year grace period, would cover the estimated foreign
exchange expenditures, which would amount to 69% of total project costs, in-
cluding contingencies and interest during the 6-year implementation period.
Procurement
4.14      Project works would be constructed using both local and foreign con-
tractors. The Ministry considers that local contractors would not have the
capacity to undertake the full scope of work on the project and that foreign
contractors would be required. It is envisaged that the main project works
(US$5.04 million) would be performed under three contracts, namely, the Tapakuma
Scheme (US$1.80 million) the Somerset Berks extension (US$1.45 million), and the
Johanna Cecilia-Supenaam extension (US$1.79 million). Contracts for the main
works, together with imported equipment (US$1.99 million) would be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits". Within these general con-
tracts there would be a few cases of small project works such as buildings,



- 11 -
pump houses and sluices which could be performed by local contractors. Con-
tracts for these works, with a value less than US$250,000, would not attract
foreign bidders and could, therefore, be let on the basis of local procurement
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. On-farm development (US$1.39
million) would be performed by the Land Development Division of the Ministry,
with equipment provided under the project. Equipment to be imported (Annex 4)
would include equipment for administration and engineering, operation and main-
tenance, extension services, on-farm development, seed production and research
and also the pumps and machinery for the six pumping plants. Contracts for
equipment, materials and vehicles estimated to cost less than US$50,000 would
be let on the basis of local procurement procedures after obtaining at least
three price quotations. Consultant services amounting to US$1.75 million would
be procured through direct negotiations. Domestic manufacturers in Guyana would
be accorded preferential treatment in bid evaluations, limited to 15% of the CIF
price of imported goods or the actual tariff application, whichever is lower;
and regional preferences for other members of CARICOM would be limited to 15% of
the CIF price of non-regional goods or the difference in tariffs, whichever is
lower.
Disbursements
4.15      The Bank loan would be disbursed against 65% of the project works
and buildings cost, 66% of on-farm development costs, the CIF cost of im-
ported equipment, 100% of the foreign expenditure cost for consultant ser-
vices and 100% of the salary of local consultants employed in lieu of foreign
consultants (Annex 4). An amount of US$1.70 million is allocated to capita-
lize interest during the 6-year implementation period and an amount of US$3.30
million would be unallocated. Government disbursements would extend through-
out this period. Any surplus funds remaining in the Bank loan on completion
of the project should be cancelled. The estimated schedule of expenditures
on the project and a disbursement schedule are presented in Annex 5.
Accounts and Audit
4.16      The Ministry of National Development and Agriculture would maintain
separate accounts for operations financed under the project. These accounts
would be audited by the independent Director of Audits, a constitutional public
auditor directly responsible to a committee of parliament. The office of the
Director of Audits has sufficient capacity to audit the accounts and submit
a report within four months of the close of each fiscal year. Government
agreed during negotiations that: (a) INDA would maintain separate accounts
for the project with sub-accounts for each project component; and (b) the
audited accounts, together with the Director of Audits report, would be sub-
mitted to the Bank within four months of the close of each fiscal year.
Environmental Evaluation
4.17      It is expected that implementation of the proposed project would
have little, if any, significant adverse effect on fisheries, wildlife, or
other natural resources of the project area. In the selection and use of
agricultural pesticides, care would be taken to minimize food-chain contamina-
tion by persistent chemicals. Increases in salinity are not expected to become
a major problem as a result of the proposed project. There is no evidence of
water-borne diseases such as bilharzia in the area.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization
5.01      The Ministry of National Development and Agriculture includes the
Departments (Annex 2) which would have specific responsibility for all princi-
pal activities to be undertaken on the project (chart 8203). At present these
Departments operate directly through Divisions in the project area but lack
the means and coordination to be efficient. The Ministry has recently under-
gone a reorganization which gteatly expanded its responsibilities and some of
the new Departments and Divisions are not fully integrated into the new struc-
ture, e.g., the Drainage and Irrigation Board and the Hydraulics Division,
recently transferred from the Ministry of Works and Communications. Under
the proposed project organization plan, divisions at project level would be
strengthened and provided with the necessary facilities to perform their
work more satisfactorily. Supervision and coordination of all activities
would be improved by centralizing management authority in the office of a
Project Manager. The construction of a new project headquarters would
bring all the Divisions together in one location and help improve manage-
ment.  Details on staffing requirements, and administrative and operational
costs for project activities are presented in Annex 4.
5.02      Project Manager.  The Project Manager would be under the authority
of the Ministry of National Development and Agriculture with full authority
over all field activities on the project. The Project Manager's appointment
would have cabinet approval and would provide for administrative authority
over division operations at the project level. The Project Manager would
participate, as required, in meetings with the Minister and department heads
for discussion of major policy and operational matters. Decisions by depart-
ments on major policy and operational matters would be channeled through the
Project Manager to division chiefs for action (chart 8203). The consultant
team would assist in preparing the terms of reference and organizing the
office for project management. The office of the Project Manager would be
permanent and continue following implementation of the project. It was agreed
during negotiations that appointment of a Project Manager, in consultation
with the Bank, would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.03      Operation and Maintenance.  A Unit for Operation and Maintenance
would be established within the Hydraulics Division under the authority
of the Project Manager. A Project Engineer would be appointed to head this
division. This does not exist at present since this activity was under the
District Engineer for the whole Essequibo coast, who also is responsible for
highways, sea defense, urban water supply and communications. The division
would be provided with additional staff and equipment. (Annex 2). It was
agreed during negotiations that appointment of a Project Engineer, in con-
sultation with the Bank, would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.04      Agricultural Credit and Machinery Services.  The GRB would continue
to provide a major part of the agricultural credit and machinery services



- 13 -
presently available to the farmers. It is envisaged that the recently
organized Agricultural Development Bank would take responsibility for long-
term farm development loans, with GRB continuing to provide short-term pro-
duction credits. Assurance were obtained from Government during negotia-
tions that an appropriate level of production credits and machinery services
would be maintained in the project area, taking into account those available
from private sources.
5.05      Agriculture Development.  The Extension and Land Development Divisions,
in addition to GRB's Agricultural Credit and Machinery Service, would be involved
in the agricultural development of the project. Since coordination between
these divisions and services is essential to the success of the project, they
would be under the supervision of the Project Manager at the project level.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government that supporting
agricultural services would be fully integrated under the direction of the
Project Manager, with the full cooperation of divisions and departments in the
Ministry participating in the project.
Farmer Participation
5.06      The Project Manager and project staff would maintain close coopera-
tion with the Rice Action Committee (para 3.12), which would be the main
channel to promote more effective participation by farmers in the programs
to improve farming practices, and to achieve efficiency in project operations.
TIplementation of Project Works
5.07      The surveys and designs for civil works would be carried out by
the Hlydraulics Division, with the assistance of a team of consultants, and
construction of the works would be by contract. Government is of the opinion
that there are no local contractors capable of undertaking contracts of the
size envisaged but a strong possibility would be the forming of joint ven-
tures with foreign contractors or local contractors undertaking a portion
of the work as sub-contractors. The clearing and land leveling operation
would be carried out by the Land Development Division through direct adminis-
tration. Contracting this work would not be feasible due to the possibility
of working only six months each year because of climatic and cropping restric-
tions. There are no local contractors with experience or suitable equipment
to undertake this operation and the Land Development Division has been en-
gaged in this type of work for several years.
Project Charges
5.08      The Ministry of National Development and Agriculture through the
D&I Board is empowered to impose project charges sufficient to cover actual
operation and maintenance costs and up to the full amount of capital invest-
ments. Under present practice, charges levied in the Tapakuma Scheme cover
only 80% of the operating and maintenance costs since it is the policy of
Government to subsidize a part of those costs. It is planned to introduce
project charges progressively as project facilities and on-farm development



- 14. -
are completed, which would cover operation and maintenance cost, full re-
covery of investment costs and a substantial proportion of interest on in-
vestment. The level of these charges would be established on a differential
basis, taking into consideratton the estimated total net income for each
category of farm size. Underlthese conditions, project charges should not
exceed 30% of total net income for large farms (more than 50 ac). In the
case of small farms (less than 5 ac), they would only pay the existing opera-
tion and maintenance rate (G$15 per ac per annum). The proposed rates for
recovery of operation and maintenance and investment costs are presented in
the following table:

Total     41,750              853.3              1,740.5      2,593.8
5.09      On the basis of this proposal, project charges would fully cover
annual operating and maintenance costs and recover total project investments
over a 50-year period at an interest rate of 6% per annum. If project in-
vestments are discounted at 9% (the estimated opportunity cost of capital
in Guyana), these charges would recover, in addition to meeting annual costs
of operation and maintenance, about 70% of investment costs. If no interest
were charged, investment costs would be recovered in 15 years.
5.10      It was agreed during negotiations that Government, through MNDA,
wotuld establish and thereafter maintain and collect project charges on land
served by the project as project facilities are completed and lands come into
full production, at such levels as would be required to provide revenues suf-
fictent to cover the actual operation and maintenance costs and recover over
a period of 50 years the total capital expenditures of the Government on the
project at an interest rate of 6% per annum. It was further agreed that the
project charges would be reviewed in consultation with the Bank at intervals
of not less than once every two years to determine the adequacy of the charges,
and to make necessary adjustments, taking into account changes in the farmer's
i-ncome as this would affect his ability to pay such charges.

VI. PRODUCTION, PROCESSING, MARKET PROSPECTS,
PRICES AND FARM INCOMES
Production
6.01      Area Cultivated.  The project would increase the net irrigated
area cropped with rice from about 28,370 to 36,330 ac and would improve
drainage and roads on 5,420 ac, which would be used for tree crops, ground
provisions and pasture. With the project the cropping intensity would rise
from 145% to about 180% (Annex 6). Comparative data on the present, and
projected cropping pattern and production are as follows:

6.02      Yields.  Without the project, paddy yields in the project area
are expected to increase from about 12.8 bags 1/ (0.88 m ton) to 14.1 bags
(0.97 m ton) per ac in 1979, mainly because farmers are expected to intensify
their production methods following the 1972-73 increase in Government fixed
paddy prices. Under the project the overall yield increase would be 31%
up to 18.5 bags (1.3 m ton) per ac, about 8 years after project initiation,
mainly through yield increases in areas currently not fully irrigated. Es-
timated yields at present without the project and with the project, are sum-
marized below:

These yields are based on the assumption that farmers would achieve, on
average, less than two-thirds of the yields achieved on GRB's seed produc-
tion farms where the same inputs as those recormended to farmers are used.
In 1965, average yields on the Tapakuma Scheme were 15.8 bags (1.1 m ton)
per ac with less intensive production methods and thus the yields projected
under the project would represent an increase of only 17% over average yields
already achieved in the area in previous years. Several large farmers using
the recommended techniques have already obtained yields in excess of those
projections. Therefore, the estimated yield increases are considered to be
realistic.
6.03      Production.  It is estimated that paddy production would increase
without the project to a maximum of 715,000 bags (49,300 m ton) of paddy in
1981, while, as a result of the project, production would increase to 1,219,000
bags (84,000 m ton) in 1982, or an increase of 70% over the production levels
without the project.
Processing
6.04      About half of the paddy produced in the area would be processed at
the GRB mill at Anna Regina while the other half would be processed by private
mills which currently have sufficient capacity to handle this production
(para 3.13). At full development, about 90% of the production would come
fror improved varieties with satisfactory milling characterist:?Lcs for white
rice, and it can be reasonably assumed that less than half the paddy produc-
ed at that time would require parboiling. As a result of an increased pro-
portion of white rice, which has a higher economic value, the average cur-
rent recovery rate of marketable rice, 66.5% (59.8% for white rice and 69.2%
for parboiled rice) would progressively decrease to 65.1%, assuming that the
specific recovery rates for parboiled and white rice remain unchanged.
Market Prospects
6.05      Marketing.  Marketing arrangements, market prospects and prices
are discussed in Annex 7 and summarized below. Guyana is the only large
producer and only exporter of rice in the CARIFTA region, and the other
CARIFTA countries have agreed to import their needs from Guyana rather than
from third countries, provided it can supply the quantities and qualities
e-ncaned. The market prospects for Guyana rice within CARIFTA are, therefore,
good.
6.06      Exports.  Guyana is expected to remain a rice exporter and the
project's production increase of 34,700 metric tons per year by 1982 would
be entirely destined to exports. It would be part of the increase in total
rice exports from the country of between 105,000 and 139,000 metric tons
forecast for 1980 and thereafter. Annual exports of 77,000 metric tons by
1982 would go to CARIFTA countries with the remaining 28,000 to 62,000 metric
tons to be sold on the world market, where sales during the past five years
averaged about 10,000 metric tons.



- 17 -
Prices
6.07      Prices of Guyana rice exports are expected to follow world market
trends for equivalent Thai rice. According to the Bank's Economic Depart-
ment, prices for Thai white rice, 5% broken f.o.b. Bangkok in 1974 dollars,
are expected to decline from US$350 in 1974 to US$218 per ton in 1980 and
thereafter. Equivalent prices for parboiled rice, would remain at 85% of
these prices for white rice. It has also been assumed that as a result of
the use of improved varieties the proportion of white rice would increase
from 34% to 47%, the remainder being parboiled. Under these assumptions the
average Georgetown f.o.b. price per metric ton would decline from G$499
(US$249) in 1974 to G$405 (US$203) as of 1980. The prices farmers could be
paid have been calculated on the basis of these export prices, assuming that
profits earned from exports by GRE would largely be passed on to farmers on
the long run and that GRB operations, including extension and research would
be financially self-supporting. Under these assumptions, the farmers' price
would decrease until 1980 to G$16 per bag of paddy for improved varieties
and G$13.7 per bag for local varieties. This decrease would represent a
38% drop over 1974 prices which, at G$ 25.8 per bag, are an all-time high.
Assurances were obtained from Government that GRB would maintain a capital
reserve account from profits earned on export sales of rice, at a reasonable
level to (a) provide a fund to stabilize the prices paid to farmers against
chlanges in export prices and earnings, and (b) to cover the cost of tech-
nical assistance to the farmers and cover the cost of replacement and major
repairs of farm machinery and rice processing equipment, during years when
profits would not be sufficient for this purpose.
Farm Income
6.08      The impact of the project on its beneficiaries has been analyzed
on several farm types considered to be representative of the area. Small
farms are assumed to grow traditional varieties of rice mainly for subsistence.
On these farms, family labor would suffice for the non-mechanized operations;
medium and larger farms would employ hired labor in a growing proportion as
size increases. Farms of 30 ac, and over would employ hired labor only. A
detailed analysis of representative farm budgets is given in Annex 6 and
summarized below.

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The major benefit of the project for the country would be the
expansion of rice production and generation of substantial foreign exchange
from rice exports. In addition the project would lead to a higher farm in-
come and improve income distribution, mainly because project charges would
be pro-rated according to farm size (para 5.08).
7.02      Some 5,000 farmers would benefit from the project.  At full produc-
tion, annual farm income would increase by US$318, US$641, US$839 and US$951
for 5, 10, 20 and 30 ac farms respectively (Annex 6). These increases over
their estimated income without the project in 1980 represents a 200% increase
for subsistence farmers (5 ac); 80% increase for family farmers (10 ac); 49%
increase for medium size farmers (20 ac) and 37% increase in income for large
farmers (30 ac and over).
7.03      At full agricultural development, 9 years after commencement of
the project, the net value of production at 1974 prices would be about US$9.8
million per year, while the corresponding value without the project would be



- 19 -
about US$4.9 million. Since an increase in production would be mainly used
for exports, significant project benefits would accrue from foreign exchange
earnings. When costs and benefits are discounted over a 50-year period, the
economic rate of return would be about 20%. To judge the project's sensi-
tivity to deviation from the basic assumptions, several alternatives including
a combined increase in cost of 20% and decrease in benefits of 20%, were ex-
amined and in no case would t1te rate of return be lower than 10%, slightly
more than the estimated opporttunity cost of capital for similar activities
in Guyana. Annex 8 gives detailed information on project economic analysis.
7.04      With an increased cropping intensity from 145% to 180% seasonal
underemployment would decrease. In addition there would be newly developed
rice lands available for settlement which would accommodate an additional
500 to 600 families. The project would produce benefits in institution build-
ing with introduction of fully integrated management and operation of the
project, the strengthening of Government departments participating in the
project and improvement of supporting services to the farmers.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government on the
following main issues:
(a)  Government would insure that sufficient drying, storage
and milling facilities would be provided by private
millers and GRB to process the total annual production
of paddy rice in the project area (para 3.13);
(b) A Plan of Operation for strengthening the extension services
in the project area and for implementing a program for training,
fertilizer trials and soil testing would be prepared with the
assistance of consultants and submitted for Bank approval with-
in 18 months after the project is declared effective; and
minimum acceptable standards to control the quality of rice
seed would be introduced for both private and public seed pro-
ducers and this quality control system would be applied speci-
fically to the McNabb seed farm (para 4.04);
(c) MNDA would maintain separate accounts for the project
with sub-accounts for the various project activities; and
the audited accounts, together with the Director of Audits
report, would be submitted to the Bank within four months of
the close of each fiscal year (para 4.16);
(d) An appropriate level of production credits and machinery
services would be maintained in the project area to ensure
timely preparation of land and harvesting and the required
supply of production inputs (para 5.04);



- 20 -
(e) Supporting agricultural services would be fully integrated
under the direction of the Project Manager, with the full
cooperation of other divisions and departments of MNDA
participating in the project (para 5.05);
(f) IVDA would establish and maintain project charges progres-
sively, as project facilities are completed and lands come
into full production, to cover actual operation and main-
tenance costs and to recover the total capital investment
over a period of 50 years at an interest rate of 6% per
annum. It was agreed that the adequacy of these charges
would be reviewed in consultation with the Bank at in-
tervals of not less than once every two years and adjusted
as required in accordance with changes in farmers' income
(para 5.10);
(g) GRB would maintain a capital reserve account to provide
a stabilization fund so as to maintain more uniform prices
paid to farmers, with fluctuations in export sale prices and
earnings, and to cover the cost of technical assistance to
the farmers and replacement and repair costs of farm
machinery and rice processing equipment (para 6.07).
8.02      It was agreed that the loan would become effective upon fulfillment
of thie following conditions:
(a)  the employment of a consulting firm, acceptable to and under
terms and conditions approved by the Bank, to assist with
engineering surveys and design, supervision of construction,
and agricultural development (para 4.07);
(b) the appointment of a Project Manager in consultation with the
Bank (para 5.02);
(c) the appointment of a Project Engineer in consultation with the
Bank (para 5.03).
8.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12.9 million
ui th a repayment period of 30 years, including a 6 year grace period.  Govern-
ment would be the borrower and bear the exchange risk.

Demand, Quality and Rights
Project Works
1.        The proposed project would include rehabilitation, extension and
improvement of existing works; construction of new works within existing pro-
jects; and construction of new works in three extension areas not presently
irrigated. Due to the complexity and variations in the work to be performed
and the stage of engineering surveys and design in the four areas constituting
the project area, it is impractical to specifically list all the operations
to be carried out. This would be determined in detail during the final
design phase of the project and the proposed plans in the feasibility study
would form the basis for preparing the final plan for the project. Project
works would include the following:
Within the Tapakuma Scheme
(a) rehabilitation of existing irrigation canals and related
control structures which serve about 27,700 acres;
(b) rehabilitation of existing drainage structures and canals
which serve about 27,700 acres and installation of drainage
outlets for individual farms;
(c) construction of interceptor and facade drains and enlarge-
ment of existing facade drains;
(d) construction of additional irrigation canals and related
control structures as required by the rehabilitation re-
ferred to in paragraph (b) above;
(e)  construction of checks, drop structures and individual
farm inlets;
(f)  construction of three drainage pumping stations and two
sea sluices, the locations of which to be determined
during design studies, and inslaation of an additional
pumping unit at the pumping station at Dawa; and
(g) construction of all-weather surfacing of about 40 miles
of access roads and related structures.

roads and related structures;
(c)  construction of a flood protection dike along the Pomeroon
river;
(d) construction of a drainage pumping station to serve the
Somerset Berks Extension area;
(e) construction of regulators, tail-gates, checks, and irriga-
tion inlets and drainage outlets for individual farms.
Within the Johanna Cecilia Extension
(a) reinforcement and raising of the existing conservancy dam
and reservoir;
(b) rehabilitation of two reservoir relief sluices, a discharge
channel and the UNU creek sluice;
(c) rehabilitation, extension, and enlargement of the main canal,

together with related bridges, culverts, syphons and other
structures.
Within the Supenaam Extension
(a) construction of two irrigation pumping stations, one each
on the Supenaam River and the Ituribisi River;
(b) construction of a main canal, a control regulator, and a

(c) construction of a secondary drainage canal system and
rehabilitation and extension of the facade drain to
serve about 5,950 acres, and provide local flood protec-
tion works;
(d) construction of two sea sluices, one each at Hibernia and
Spring Garden, and repair of the existing sluice at Middle-
sex; and
(e) construction of about ten miles of all-weather access roads
and related structures.
Drainage
2.        At present, excess water in the project  area deriving from rainfall
and irrigation is discharged into the ocean by a system of main and secondary
drains, which have as their outlet the facade drain that lies parallel to
the sea defense wall. The facade drain, which is not continuous throughout
the project area, discharges through 13 manually operated sea sluices that
have to be closed during high tides for 2 to 4 hours during each 12 hour
tide cycle. The discharge capacity of the sluices is further reduced by
rapidly moving sling mud deposits along the coast and in the seaside sluice
channels. In the only existing drainage pumping station at Three Friends
sluice, two 100 cfs pumps have been installed, purportedly to force the sling
mud deposits out of the sluice channel by the impact of the pumped water.
However, the design of the pump layout does not seem to wholly be effective
for this purpose.
3.        The area most affected by flooding is the northern part of the
Tapakuma Scheme where about 8,000 ac in the lowlands adjacent to the sea
are severely flooded each year. The surface elevation of this area ranges
from 56.0 NGD 1/ along the main irrigation canal to 51.0 NGD along the coast.
With heavy rainfall, excess water is readily discharged by the secondary and
main drains to the sea sluices. However, the sluices cannot discharge the
drainage water at the same rate it arrives from the uplands, and flooding
occurs due to the presence of mud deposits, the limited flexibility in con-
veying drainage water to alternate sluices because the facade drain is not
complete and very little capacity in the system to store drainage water during
high tide for release during low tide. Investigations have revealed that
keeping an open channel through the mud bars by continuous dredging to increase
gravity discharge through the sluices is not an economical proposition.
4.        The plan adopted to solve the flooding situation in this critical
area represents a slight modification of the one proposed in the feasibility
study, and also takes into account a previous plan prepared by Government
which basically called for installation of more pumping stations. The Gov-
ernment has some reservations regarding construction of the interceptor
drains, mainly due to the difficulties that may be encountered in obtaining
New Georgetown Datum (0.0 is 50.53 ft below mean sea level, msl).



MNNEX 1
Page 4
rights-of-way and the uncertainties over changing elevations of the mud bar
from year to year. They feel an all pump plan would be more fail-safe
while recognizing that temporary flooding would occur, since it would take
more time for the pumps to evacuate excess flows. The matter will be studied
in more detail during final design to develop the most feasible plan. The
basic elements of the proposed modified plan are as follows:
(a) construction of interceptor drains to serve the higher lands with
outfall channel at a higher elevation to the Westbury, Hampton
Court and Windsor Castle sluices (Map 10765). This would in-
crease the discharge capacity of the sluices when mud partially
blocks the outfall channel;
(b) enlargement and completion of the facade drain to provide more
flexibility in transferring water from one sluice to another;
and
(c) installation of new drainage pumping stations at the Perth and
Andrews sluices, specifically to handle excess discharge from
the lower lands.
5.        This provision of separate systems for the lower and higher lands,
together with the increase in pumping capacity, would reduce flooding in this
critical area to a minimum. In the balance of the project area, the conven-
tional system of secondary drains, the facade drain and sea sluices would
provide ample drainage capacity, with the exception of Somerset Berks area
where a pumping plant would also be installed.
Soils and Land Classification
6.        Tapakuma and Somerset-Berks Areas.  The project area is a flat,
low lying coastal plain. The land generally lies below maximum high tide
and is protected from the intrusion of the ocean by a sea defense wall along
the shoreline. The soils have developed on sediments of fluviatile, marine
and brackish water origin. There are deposits of peat, locally known as
"Pegasse", ranging in depth from a few inches to about 15 feet. The marine
origin and, locally, the flooding by sea water account for soil salinity
encountered in the lands along the shore. The brackish water origin of more
inland soils largely accounts for their high acidity and often relate to the
high levels of available aluminum.
7.        Soil survey and land classification have been carried out by Harris
in 1961 for the Tapakuma area and by Harza in 1972 for the Somerset-Berks,
Johanna Cecilia and Supenaam areas. In both studies U.S. Bureau of Reclama-
tion standards have been used as a guideline. The classification has been
based mainly on limitations of topography, land clearing cost, internal drain-
age, soil salinity and soil acidity. The following land classes have been
identified:



ALNEX 
Page 5
a)   Class 1 Lands: These lands are highly suitable for irrigation
farming; they are not encountered in the project area;
b)   Class 2 Lands: The mineral clay soils in this category are
moderately suited for cultivation; they are less desirable than
Class 1 lands because of limitations of one or two of the fac-
tors; internal drainage, acidity or salinity;
c)   Class 3 Lands: Lands suitable for irrigation development, but
with severe restrictions as regards two or more of the following
factors; internal drainage, acidity, salinity, texture (peat) and
cost of land clearing;
d)   Class 4 Lands: These lands have limited or special use for agri-
cultural purposes. In the Somerset-Berks area this class com-
prises the deep Pegasse soils. In the Tapakuma area it comprises
saline coastal lands and acid peat over clay soils in the upland
area; and
e)   Class 6 Lands: These lands are considered non-arable.
8.        A summary of the area of land in the various land classes is pre-
sented below:
Tapakuma                       Somerset-Berks

==~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= = ===:: =s
9.        All of the Class 2 and 3 and part of the Class 4 lands in the
Tapakuma area are in rice and other crops and producing satisfactory yields.
Part of the Class 4 lands now in bush would be cleared and cultivated for
rice, tree crops, vegetables and cattle pasture.
10.       Of the gross area of 8,000 ac of the Somerset Berks area, only
2,320 ac are now under cultivation. Irrigation, drainage and on-farm
development would be based on the available soils information, and Table 1
shows the recommended use of lands in this area. Irrigation would be pro-
vided for 3,500 ac of land suitable for rice. Drainage and roads would
be provided for an additional area of 3,500 ac which could be developed



ANNEX 1
Page 6
for tree crops under rain-fed conditions; in fact, about 1,500 ac of this
area is presently growing coffee, citrus, bananas and some vegetables.
11.       The fertility status of the soils in these areas is not clear.  No
experiments have been carried out in the area on various soil types to de-
termine crop response to fertilizer and possible fixation processes in the
soil or to study negative effects o- salinity, acidity and high levels of
available aluminum. It is expected that with drainage and flood control
salinity will not be a serious problem. However, the problem of acidity and
toxic levels of aluminum should be studied to develop the proper counter-
active measures. The project includes a program of soil testing and field
trials to determine levels and types of fertilizer use and other treatment
that would be required.
12.       Johanma Cecilia Area.  A semi-detailed survey of this area revealed
two major soil classes as shown in the following table:
Land Class                Area (acres)               Soil Series
2                         960                  De Velde clays
3                       1,680                  Corentyne clays
6                         300                  Tiwiwid sands
Both the De Velde and Corentyne clays are marine sediments highly suited to
intensive rice cultivation under irrigation. These soils have low natural
levels of fertility but show good response to commercial fertilizers.  They
are also suitable for a wide range of other crops such as tree crops, vege-
tables, cotton, maize and sugarcane. However, with the present state of the
rice industry in the area, diversification to other crops would not be justi-
fied until such time as the demand for rice and the world market price de-
creased to a point which would force a change. The Tiwiwid sands are not
considered arable as they have almost no cation exchange or moisture holding
capacity. They also have a low organic content and natural fertility.
13.       Supenaam Area.  The predominant soil series in this area are the
De Velde clays and silt loams, which, except for small localized areas of
Tiwiwid sands, occupy almost the entire area to be developed under irriga-
tion. These soils which are rated Class 2, cover some 7,300 ac between the
coastline and the backlands, where sand and peat soils become more common.
The proposed project would cover some 5,950 ac of the mineral clay soils
(De Velde), which, as noted above, are highly suitable for rice cultivation.

Climate, Water Supply, Demand, Quality and Rights
Climate
14.       The project area is characterized by a rather uniform temperature
throughout the year ranging between 79.5 and 82.0°F (26.0 to 27.5°C). The
free watersurface evaporation varies between 6 and 7 inches per month. There
are two rainy seasons, with precipitation in excess of evaporation from May
until mid-August and from the middle of November until the end of January.
Average annual rainfall in the area is 100 inches. The autumn and spring
rice crops grown in the area are planned in such a way that pre-irrigation
for land preparation, requiring considerable amounts of water, is carried out
in the beginning of the rainy seasons, and the ripening and harvest stage, re-
quiring dry weather, coincide with the low rainfall periods (Table 2).
15.       The main rainy season (May until mid-August) generally provides
sufficient water to allow a rice crop to be grown, as is borne out in the part
of the project not now having an irrigation system. However, as rainfall,
even in the wet season, is irregular, with protracted drought periods causing
damage to the crop, irrigation is essential to increase production of the
autumn crop. The second rainy period does not provide enough water to sup-
port a rice crop, so that for a spring crop irrigation is necessary.
Water Supply
16.       Tapakuma-Somerset Berks.  The water supply for the Tapakuma-Somerset
Berks areas derives from the Tapakuma-Arapiaco river system and the Tapakuma
conservancy; an area of 47.6 sq mi, with Tapakuma lake serving as a storage
reservoir. At Dawa dam, located on the Tapakuma river downstream from the
lake, water is pumped from the river into the lake. The pumping station
consists of three 100 cfs pumps with provision for the installation of a
fourth pump. Also located at Dawa are gates that can be opened to release
water from the Tapakuma reservoir into the Tapakuma river. Using the pumps
and gates, the water level in the lake is maintained between elevation 57.8
and 59.8 NGD. The total usable volume of water stored between these levels
amounts to 12,700 ac ft. The Tapakuma main canal is connected to the reservoir
by an ungated supply canal. The flow from the main canal into the secondary
laterals is controlled by means of regulators or control gates.
17.       The hydrologic analyses have been based on a 12-year stream flow
record of the Arapiaco river. With linear transportation methods, taking
evapo-transpiration from the watershed into account, the discharge of the
conservancy and the Arapiaco-Tapakuma river system have been calculated for
an 80% dry year. Tables 3 and 4 provide data on the diversion requirements
and available discharge from the conservancy and pumping from the Tapakuma-
Arapiaco river system. The total diversion demand is estimated at 150,000
ac ft annually. It is customary to start pump operations when the lake level
falls to elevation 57.8 NGD and to keep the pumps in operation until the



ANNEX 1
Page 8
level rises to elevation 59.3 NGD. However, it would be more efficient to
keep the lake continuously at the level of 59.3 NGD to reduce the peak pumping
requirement in the months of February, September and November, and to provide
reserve storage at the beginning of the planting season in May in case of
pump breakdown or when tidal salinity could prevent pumping.
18.       Salt water intrusion with tidal fluctuations may happen during low
flow periods in April and May. In the past, salt water intrusion up to the
Tapakuma river was reported in 1912, 1926, 1942, 1959 and 1973. As it is
imperative that a sufficient water supply be made available in the month of
May, the reservoir should be maintained at its maximum allowable level, until
salinity requires that the pumps be shut off.
19.       Assuming that the reservoir would be operated at maximum level and
the pumps to be operated on a 20/24 hour basis, the required pumping capacity
would amount to 265 cfs. If one of the pump units would be out of operation
for a period in excess of one month, irrigation shortages would occur in a
80% dry year. An additional 100 cfs pump as a standby unit would, therefore,
be justified. As sufficient surface waters are presently available for irri-
gation, the development of ground water resources is not warranted.
20.       Johanna Cecelia.  Water supply for this area would derive from the
conservancy area to the west of the cultivated area. Rehabilitation and en-
largement of the existing impounding dam to provide 3,500 ac ft of storage
would be sufficient to meet irrigation demands during the critical low flow
period each year from February through May. There would be no need for hold-
over storage from year to year as average annual flows exceed demands and it
is only necessary to regulate these flows to provide a reserve for the 4-month
period of minimum flow, when the normal discharge is less than the demand.
Further, connecting the main canal to the Tapakuma main canal would make it
possible to draw on reserves in the Tapakuma system during periods of shortage.
An average of 12,000 ac ft would be required annually for this area.
21.       Supenaam.  Various alternatives for supplying irrigation water to
this area were examined and it was determined that pumping from the Supenaam
and Ituribisi rivers was more economical than constructing a dam and storage
reservoir in the conservancy area to the west of the project. In any case,
runoff from the conservancy into Ikuraka lake would not be sufficient to
supply the entire area and supplemental pumping from the rivers would be
required. The availability of an adequate supply is assured under the plan
proposed, which envisages a station on the Supenaam (90 cfs) to supply three-
fourths of the area south of the Ituribisi and a station on the Ituribisi
(35 cfs) to supply the northern part up to the boundary of Johanna Cecelia.
The average low period flow of both rivers exceeds many times the amount that
would be withdrawn by pumping and this would not increase sea water intru-
sion in an amount that would be critical for water use, either for domestic
purposes or irrigation. A low flow test at the proposed pump site on the
Supenaam showed 300 ppm, which is negligible since rice has a tolerance of



ANNEX 1
Page 9
3,000 ppm or more under favorable soil conditions. The following table pre-
sents data on water supply and demands, which confirms that the adequacy of
supply depends on the capacity of the pumps and canals.

This table indicates that the Ituribisi river alone could supply the project.
However, in some months the pumping rate would approach the total flow, which
would allow sea water intrusion to the pump site and force closing down the
pumps, with a corresponding interruption in the supply to the project during
a critical period.
Water Demand
22.       The irrigation water requirements for the project area were calcu-
lated by the Blaney-Criddle method, assuming a cropping pattern with 90%
rice and minor amounts of other crops and pasture. These calculations, which



ANNEX 1
Page 10
take into account effective rainfall, a field efficiency of 70% and a convey-
ance efficiency of 85%, are presented in Tables 1 and 5. The total annual
diversion demand, which also includes the pre-irrigation and ponding require-
ments, would be about 4.7 ac ft/ac.  Total estimated annual demands for the
separate areas of the project are: Tapakuma-Somerset Berks, 150,000 ac ft;
Johanna Cecelia, 12,000 ac ft; and Supenaam, 26,000 ac ft. It is estimated
that these demands, which are based on a low rainfall (80% of the long time
average) year would be met with a probability of 8 years out of 10, which
is acceptable.
Water Quality
23.       During low rainfall periods, water from the conservancies tends to
take on a dark color (brownish-black) and becomes more acid, with a pH ranging
between 4.0 and 5.0. This is probably due to rapid decomposition of the dense
vegetation in the conservancy areas and the presence of peat soils. It has
never been shown that this has a deleterious effect on rice or other crops.
Many farmers believe this type of water is beneficial and its use could coun-
teract any tendency to develop saline conditions in the marine clay soils
with poor drainage characteristics. Other than this, the water contains no
toxic or harmful elements and is considered satisfactory for irrigation.
Water Rights
24.       Water resources in Guyana are owned by the state and vested in the
Guyana Water Authority, which was created by law in 1972 to control and reg-
ulate all activities related to water development and use, including collec-
tion, production, treatment, storage, transmission, distribution, use of water;
research; construction and maintenaaice of waterworks; approval of plans and
proposals for water works; and to advise Government on all matters related
to use and development of water resources. The Authority may delegate its
powers to other agencies or Boards, and all new projects for development and
use of water resources must be reviewed and approved by the Authority. For
existing irrigation and drainage projects the Authority has delegated its
powers to the Drainage and Irrigation Board.
25.       Legislation for the granting of water rights to individual farmers
for irrigation does not exist in Guyana. Within Declared Drainage and Irri-
gation Areas, the D & I Board recognizes the right to use by establishing
"time run" schedules at the beginning of each irrigation season for all land
owners or lease holders within a area, which assigns a given number of hours
of use during each return period of 7 to 10 days. There is no measurement
or limit on quantity used and this unregulated use, together with unauthoriz-
ed use, as when farmers open the gates outside the period assigned, is a
serious problem on the Tapakuma Scheme. This leads to wastage and conflict
of interest whereby some farmers are left with an insufficient supply or do
not receive water at proper intervals to maintain satisfactory crop growth.
The Water Authority and the D & I Board recognize the problem but there appears



ANNEX 1
Page 11
to be no real effort to initiate action on legislation which would provide the
D & I Board with sufficient authority to control water use at the farm level
and penalize unauthorized use. Since it may be several years before the drain-
age and irrigation laws undergo a full scale revision to make them conform
with present conditions, the only means available at present to achieve better
control of water use is to improve management and supervision within the area
and to work with farmers' associations and cooperatives for better coopera-
tion and sharing of responsibility between the project staff and the farmers.
26.       The land tenure pattern in the area would continue to evolve
towards a consolidation of farms of more than 25 ac, the minimum economically
arable unit. (see Table 6).

TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Institutional Setup
Institutions
1.        The former Guyana Rice Corporation (GRC) was responsible for milling
and processing, rice research, seec production, machinery services and, as an
agent for the Guyana Rice Marketing Board (GRMB), managed agricultural credit
for both short-term production credits and long-term development loans. In
the project area GRC provided a major part of the fertilizers and chemicals
for pest and disease control, machinery for about 15% of land preparation
and 60% of harvesting, processes 60% of the paddy crop in the GRC mill at
Anna Regina, operated a seed production farm and processing plant, and pro-
vided technical assistance based on research data obtained for the Mon Repos
and MARDS research stations, which were also managed by GRC.
2.        The former Guyana Rice Marketing Board (GRMB) had a monopoly on the
purchase and resale of milled rice. Paddy was sold by the farmers to either
GRC or private millers but by law all milled rice, with the exception of that
portion retained by the farmers for personal use, was delivered to GRMB for
resale internally or for export. Profits earned by GRMB on export sales
were used to inprove the rice industry providing funds for research, credit,
technical assistance, machinery, improvement of seed production and milling
facilities and other activities. GRMB and GRC were merged into the Guyana
Rice Board (GRB) in 1973 which will continue the activities of its predecessors.
3.        The Drainage and Irrigation Board (D&I) and the Hydraulics Division,
formerly part of the Ministry of Works and Communications and now transferred
to the Ministry of National Development and Agriculture, are responsible for
the planning, implementation and operation and maintenance of irrigation and
drainage projects. The Hydraulics Division is the technical organization
responsible for planning and implementation of works and operation and main-
tenenace, under the policy, direction of D&I, which is the designated legal
entity under the Drainage and Irrigation Ordinance of 1953 for management
of drainage and irrigation development. Projects implemented by D&I, by
law automatically become Declared Drainage and Irrigation Areas, wherein
D&I has authority to operate and maintain the works, schedule and control
water deliveries and collect project charges. The Tapakuma Scheme is a
Declared Area at present. The Somerset-Berks, Johanna Cecilia and Supenaam
extensions whould become Declared Areas when construction of works under
the project is authorized by Government. In the project area the performance
of Hydraulics Division, particularly in controlling water deliveries, has
been rather weak. This is due to a lack of sufficient and competent staff
and the requirement to share equipment with other activities such as sea
defense, roads, water supply and communications.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        The Agricultural Department is responsible for assistance to farmers
for improvement of farm management and cultural practices. The Extension
Division in the project area at present consists of a Chief Agricultural
Officer and three extension agents. This group confines its activities to
crops other than rice, leaving this to the GRC specialists, which basically
consists of two Pest Control Specialists. As a consequence of this situation,
extension assistance is completely inadequate and rice farmers report that
they receive virtually no assistance or training. The ratio of extension
agents to farmers is currently about 1:2,000.
5.        The Land Development Department is responsible for planning, estab-
lishment and administering of land development schemes, which essentially
are settlement schemes on land leased to farmers by Government. The Land
Development Division is responsible for two schemes in the project area, com-
prising 11,000 acres. The Division assists in the selection and settlement
of farmers; performs on-farm development, mainly land clearing and leveling;
helps farmers to obtain credit and inputs and works with D&I on water manage-
ment and collection of project charges;
6.        The Lands Department administers registration of titles on freehold
land, the leasing of Government land and the collection of rents and land
taxes;
7.        The Rice Action Committee, an advisory association comprising both
Government officials and farmers, established under the guidance of Government,
promotes the improvement of farming practices, project facilities and support-
ing services. The Tapakuma district committee is represented on the boards
of GRMC, GRC and D&I and it actively monitors the operations of all Government
and private agencies concerned with the rice industry; and
8.        The Ministry of Cooperatives and Community Development also provides
assistance, through the Cooperative Division, to about 35 Cooperative Societies
in the project area. These are agricultural cooperatives for smallholders,
mainly for growing rice, however, several produce vegetables and fruits. The
main functions of the cooperatives are to obtain credit from GRC or the National
Cooperative Bank, and purchase inputs and market their production on a communal
basis.
Operation and Maintenance
9.        The Drainage and Irrigation Law, dated July 1, 1953, as amended,
provides for creation of the Drainage and Irrigation Board (D & I), with
authority to construct and manage drainage and irrigation works within areas
where such works were found to be required and feasible for productive use of
the land for agriculture. These areas, when provided with such works, would
become Declared Drainage and Irrigation Areas, wherein the D&I Board through
the Hydraulics Division, has responsibility to operate and maintain the
public works, schedule water deliveries for irrigation and collect project



ANNEX 2
Page 3
charges to cover operation and maintenance and recover capital investment
costs. The Tapakuma Irrigation Scheme is a Declared Area and Government
proposes to declare the Somerset Berks, Johanna Cecelia and Supenaam ex-
tensions as Declared Areas upon implementation of the proposed project.
10.       When the D&I Board and Hydraulics Division were under the Ministry
of Works and Communications, the District Engineer's office for the Essequibo
Coast had responsibility for operating and maintaining the Tapakuma Scheme,
together with other activities such as highways, village water supply, sea
defense and communications. With this shared responsibility the scheme had
available a minimum of staff and equipment, and the services for administra-
tive and technical management. The result of this haphazard management in
the past has been a deterioration of project facilities, particularly roads
and drainage canals, and lack of effective control over water deliveries,
with the consequent misuse and wastage of water. In addition the Hydraulics
Division did not provide any assistance to the Johanna Cecilia and Supenaam
areas, which are partially irrigated from privately constructed systems but
are not Declared Areas.
11.       The proposed project would provide an independent Operation and
Maintenance Unit under the direction of a full-time Project Engineer, who
would be responsible to the Project Manager. This Unit, which would have
sole responsibility to operate and maintain the project, would be adequately
equipped and staffed to properly carry out this responsibility on the Tapakuma
Scheme and the proposed extensions. This would make it possible to achieve
better control and efficiency in water use and to maintain the systems, parti-
cularly roads and drainage, in a usable condition which would be important in
obtaining higher production.
12.       The present policy of Government on project charges is to assess
the farmers at a rate sufficient to cover only operation and maintenance with
no recovery of capital investment. This rate averaged G$15.00/ac in 1972;
however, Government officially subsidized 20% of these charges, which reduced
the effective rate to G$12.00/ac. The actual situation during the past sev-
eral years has been that collections have averaged 10% and, consequently, the
Government's subsidy has been closer to 90% of actual cost. This is the rea-
son Government attempts to hold costs to a minimum, with the result that the
standards of operation and maintenance have been very low. With the proposed
project and improved management, Government, and especially the Hydraulics
Division, would be in a better position to improve services to farmers and
thereby to enforce collection of charges adequate to cover the full costs of
operation and maintenance. The expected increases in production value with
the project would also enable farmers to pay the assessed costs while still
maintaining a reasonable margin of net income.
13.       Annual operation and maintenance costs for the 41,750 ac project
at full development are estimated as shown below:

TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Consultant Services
1.        Consultant services would be provided for the following two main
purposes:
(a) for detailed surveys, final design and supervision of con-
struction of project works, including on-farm development;
and
(b) for the agricultural development phase, to assist on the
seed production and the applied research programs and to
help with the organization and training of the Extension
Services.
2.        The Drainage and Irrigation Board would assign full responsibility
to a consulting firm for surveys, design, contract administration and super-
vision of construction. Supporting staff to work with the consultants would
be provided by the D & I Board (Annex 4). The D & I Board would retain gen-
eral responsibility to approve plans and specifications, issue tender docu-
ments, select contractors, negotiate and sign contracts, approve estimates
and make payments for work accomplished and manage the financial aspects with
respect to both local currency and foreign exchange.
3.        The consulting firm for the engineering and construction phase
would be responsible for the following activities:
(a) Review the proposed plans for the project and perform
additional studies as required;
(b) Perform detailed surveys as required for design and
layout of the project, including topographic surveys for
land leveling;
(c) prepare final designs, specifications, and cost estimates;
td) prepare mass diagrams, quantity estimates and elevations
for land leveling;
(e) provide layout stakes for the contractor and make final
inspections for compliance with specifications;
(f) prepare tender documents and contracts and assist in evalua-
tion of bids and contract administration;



t,NNEX 3
Page 2
(g) supervise construction, perform final inspections, certify
payments to contractors and requests for withdrawals from
the loan;
(h)   prepare specifications and assist with inspection and
acceptance of equipment and materialg purchased directly
by Government for the project;
(i) prepare progress reports as required; and
(j)  provide in-service training to local staff employed on
the project.
4.        The consultants for the agricultural development phase would be
responsible for:
(a) assistance with the implementation of an applied research
program in the project area which would consist mainly of
field trials for variety selection and use of fertilizers
for rice. This work would be coordinated with the acti-
vities of the main research stations at Mon Repos and
MARDS and with the GRB Technical Assistance Program in
the project area;
(b) to assist in organizing a program for soil testing on indi-
vidual farms in order to determine fertilizer and water
requirements more effectively;
(c) assist in improving the operations of the seed produc-
tion farm and the processing of seed in order to improve
quality; and
(d) assistance in organizing an effective extension service,
training extension agents and initiating programs for
training farmers.
5.        Consultants for both engineering and agriculture would be employed
over the 6-year period (1974-79). It is expected that construction of the
project would be accomplished during the 5-year period (1975-79), however,
surveys and design would be initiated during the second half of 1974. On-
farm development, mainly land leveling, would continue throughout the con-
struction period. It is not considered, however, that consultant assistance
on this phase would be required during the entire period and it would only
be provided during the early stages of the project.
6.        An important function of the consultants would be to provide in-
service training to local staff, assigned or employed, on the project. This
training would be provided in a number of technical activities relating to



ANNEX 3
Page 3
engineering and construction, operation and maintenance of the project and
several specific aspects of agricultural development. One of the main objec-
tives would be to strengthen the Extension Division and the Technical Assis-
tance Division of GRB, so that the farmers can be provided with better ser-
v2.ces in specialized fields of agricultural production.  It is considered
that the extension assistance available on the existing project, while not
sufficient in number of staff, is also oriented to general advice and that
there is a need to provide more spe:ialized services.
7.        The estimated schedule for provision of consultant services during
the development period is presented in the following table:

TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Agricultural Production and Farm Budgets
A. Agricultural Production
Land Use, Cropping Pattern
1.        Table 1 gives the details of the existing and future cropping
patterns. In 1971/72 there were 33,020 ac cultivated or 58% of the gross
area of 57,120 ac. Rice covered 28,370 ac or 86% of the cultivated area,
the remaining 4,650 ac cultivated land was used for tree crops (5%), pasture,
(7%) and subsistence crops (2%). The tree crops are mainly coconuts in the
Tapakuma Scheme and Johanna Cecelia Extension and a mixture of plantain,
coffee and citrus, in which the latter dominates, in the Somerset-Berks
Extension area. Pasture carries mainly milk cattle for subsistence require-
ments. Thus, rice, with an annual cash income of about G$4 million at farm-
gate price, is by far the most important crop. Mainly because of the growing
population pressure, new land has been continuously brought under rice culti-
vation and the rise in Government fixed paddy prices since 1971 has acceler-
ated the process. The Land Development Department of the Ministry of National
Development and Agriculture for instance cleared about 3,000 ac in 1972. In
the Tapakuma Scheme, rice is being planted on these new lands, which are
served by the existing irrigation facilities. In the Somerset Berks area
existing farms have usually expanded under a crop rotation pattern, which
starts with corn and plantain and ends with perennial tree crops; on newly
settled farms, rice and ground provisions are included in this cropping pattern.
Since tree crops have a higher return per acre than rice even with double
cropping, it is unlikely that land previously planted with tree crops would
ever be converted to rice fields. Therefore, of the 4,000 ac irrigable lands
in this area, an estimated 500 ac is estimated to continue to carry tree crops
and only 3,500 ac would be planted with rice. At project full development,
the cropping pattern of the cultivated area of 41,750 ac would comprise 36,330
ac of rice (86% of the cultivable area), 2,590 ac of tree crops (7%), 2,030
ac of pasture (5%) and 800 ac of ground provisions (2%). In the Somerset
Berks area, about 1,500 ac (4% of the total area) of deep peat soils would
remain either under bush or be used for extensive cattle breeding (Table 1).
Cropping Intensity
2.        In 1970/71, the cropping intensity in the Tapakuma Scheme and the
Johanna Cecelia and Supenaam Extensions, where an estimated 27,000 ac was
cropped to rice that year, was about 145%; 78% during the autumn crop from



ANNEX 6
Page 2
May through early November and 65% during the spring crop from mid-Novembev
through April. Acres harvested, yields and rice production in the project
area for the past 11 years are presented in Table 2. The limiting factors on
double cropping in the Tapakuma Schemne are mainly flooding on about 20 to 25%
of the low lands and limited water resources for irrigation in the Johanna
Cecelia and Supenaam extensions. Other constraints are delays in critical
farm operations because of the inadequate mobility of farm machinery; as a
result of the poor condition of farm access roads; the absence of tractor
servicing facilities in the area, largely contributing to one-third of the
existing tractor fleet not being operational; poor scheduling water distri-
bution at sowing time; and the growing of traditional varieties on 30 to 40%
of the area, with a long vegetative cycle (140 days) as compared to the im-
proved varieties with shorter cycles (115-125 days). In the Somerset-Berks
Extension, the main limiting factors are the lack of an efficient water con-
trol system and flooding. As a result of the project, and assuming that 20%
of the farmers would continue to grow rustic traditional varieties, the an-
nual cropping intensity would increase at the end of the project investment
period to 180%; 95% for the autumn crop and 88% for the spring crop. The
intensity would remain lower during the spring crop because it would not be
economical to provide farm machinery to the limited number of farmers who
are expected to continue to be late with harvesting the autumn crop. A time
schedule of farm practices is shown in Table 3.
Mechanization
3.        Mainly as a result of the Mechanized Pilot Scheme started in 1942
as part of World War II production efforts in Guyana, rice production was
irrevocably transformed into a highly mechanized sector. Only seeding and
most of the weeding and rogueing are done by hand. The smaller farmers who
cannot afford their own machinery prepare and harvest their land through
custom hire work. There are 330 tractors and 50 combines registered in the
Tapakuma Scheme area, including 48 1/ tractors and 33 1/ combines owned by
GRB. No figures are currently available for the Johanna Cecilia and the
Supenaam Extension areas, but the situation is assumed to be similar to that
in the Tapakuma Scheme. Of the privately owned machinery, only about two-
thirds is in operation because of lack of servicing facilities in the area.
This equipment would be adequate to cultivate most of the project area if
farrm access roads were in better condition and adequate servicing facilities
were available within the area. Since roads would be improved under the
project and the major tractor supplier is expected to open a new service
station in the area, no substantial shortage of farm equipment is anticipated.
Tractor and combine owners, however, serve other farmers only after having
cultivated their own land, and many small farms rely on GRB for timely plowing
and harvesting.  It is CRB's policy continue to operate its machinery pool
as long as a need is felt for it and as long as it is not replaced by the
privately owned machines.
1/   These figures include recently purchased new equipment.

Land Preparation
4.        The project would provide land clearing and leveling on about
6,000 ac bush land, and land leveling alone on about 20,000 ac of existing
cultivated areas at the rate of about 5,000 ac per year. Land leveling is
expected to have a substantial impact on yields. Better water distribution
and weed control after land leveling on 40 ac of the GRTh seed production
farm at the McNabb (para 6) increased yields by about 30%. On average,
farmers have their land disc-plowed twice, harrowed once, and their land pre-
paration completed with one puddling. No additional operations would be
required under project conditions, but the quality of each operation is ex-
pected to improve as a result of the increase in time available for effective
land preparation due to better roads, better training for farmers and tractor
drivers, and an improved extension service.
Rice Varieties
5.        Because of their poor yield potential, their longer vegetation
cycle, and their unfavorable milling characteristics, the traditional varie-
ties are progressively being replaced by Starbonnet, a long-grained indica-
type variety imported directly from the USA. It is photo-insensitive and has
a growing cycle of 115 days. It also has a better tolerance to prolonged
submergence than traditional varieties, is thus less exacting as to water
management and less subject to weed infestation. Furthermore, it has excellent
processing characteristics and produces the higher priced white rice which
has a wider acceptance on the world market than parboiled rice. Distributed
for the first time in 1970, Starbonnet covered about 50% of the project area
in 1972 and is expected to further increase its coverage by 10% per year until
it is used on 70% of the area in 1975. The rapid increase of acreage planted
with Starbonnet in the past has stemmed mainly from the conversion to this
variety by larger farmers using better production techniques. Smaller farms
using less intensive production methods have obtained mixed results and some
are reverting to the more rustic traditional varieties. Starbonnet is more
sensitive to diseases under tropical conditions (para 7) and requires more
pesticide treatments. Its yield potential, however, as for most indica-type
rice is limited (26 bags 1/ or 1.8 m ton of paddy per ac per crop in seed
production farms). The SrB research program has produced a new variety called
"Hybrid S" from crossing local and IRRI varieties. This Japonica type, responds
better to nitrogen fertilization and has a higher yield potential (31 bags 1/
of paddy (2.1 ton)/ac per crop in GRB's seed production farms).  The current
drawback of this variety, currently preventing its widespread distribution to
farmers, is the presence of a "white center", which is an improper milling
characteristic that makes it suitable only for parboiling. Under the guidance
of a rice breeding specialist who returned in 1973 from the International Rice
Research Institute, GRPJ is working toward eliminating this unfavorable process-
ing characteristic. Plans are to have Hybrid "S" available for distribution
in 1977 and to have it planted on about 50% of the rice areas by 1979.

Seed Qualitl
6.        CTB produces rice seeds for both traditional and improved varieties
on three CR(B seed production farms (one is at McNabb in the project area) or
under contract with private seed producers. While foundation seed produced
at the MARDS research station is of good quality, the so-called pure-line
seed distributed to farmers is unacceptably poor. The manager of the seed
production farm at McNabb has no experience in seed production and does not
apply more inputs than those recommended for average farmers; rogueiug is
neglected and seed processing equipment and storage facilities are inadequate.
Part of the problem could be resolved with better supervision and a seed pro-
duction expert should be based in the project area to control seed growing
and handling. One important cultivation practice to be introduced at McNabb
is fallowing for three years in order to eliminate red rice, a major impurity
(para 9). Of the 1,000 ac at McNabb only 300 would be required to produce
seed for the Essequibo Coast. At present seed is also produced at McNabb
for other areas. If good quality is to be produced in the area, the three
years fallow system should be introduced and the McNabb farm restricted to
produce seed for the Essequibo Coast only. In addition, a new seed setector
and cleaner with a minimum capacity of 1,700 lb per hour and a 7,000 sq ft
store should be installed in Anna Regina. It would be impractical 1/ to send
seed produced at MARDS to the project area. At present seed prices correspond
to the best quality of commercial paddy and when the quality is improved,
prices should be increased to cover actual production costs. The quality
improvement would largely compensate the higher prices, since, with better
seed, farmers could grow three crops with the same seed, instead of having to
replace it every year, as is now the case. Requirements to improve seed
quality in the project area are presented in Table 4.
Pest Control and Disease
7.        Among the 48 rice pests idenditied in Guyana, only a few are of
economic importance. Fungal diseases are currently not a limiting factor
since fungicide treatment of seed is generalized. In addition to existing
diseases, Starbonnet has been shown in other tropical countries to be very
susceptible to a virus (hoja blanca), which can cause considerable damage.
Since the vectors of the disease exist in Guyana, it could become a major
threat as acreage with Starbonnet is expanded.  Although the Hybrid "S"
variety is also sensitive to other virus diseases which occur in Guyana, the
danger of generalized damages are less severe. Presently, farmers apply, on
1/   Not less costly, however, transportation from MARDS costs G$ 0.60 per bag.
The depreciation of the additional equipment and store in Anna Regina
over 25 years would cost G$ 0.40 per bag. Only part of the cost of the
expert should be allocated to the seed production since he would also
assist in other aspects of the development effort. His cost over 50
years is G$ 0.20 per bag. This gives also a total of about G$ 0.60/bag.

average, two insecticide treatments of various products recommended by r(mJ3's
Pest Control Service. This service publishes recommendations for treatment
of major pests and also maintains rental units of knapsacks and mistblowers.
MAinimum pest control, however, should average not less than three treatments
per crop of the four recommended by rlB. The local rpB Pest Control Service,
with two agents, is inadequately staffed to reach all farmers. To achieve
this objective the staff should be c1oubled and farmers should receive more
intensive technical assistance on this problem.
Fertilizers
8.        Although fertilizers are considered to be a requisite to higher
production levels, it is currently not possible to formulate definite recom-
mendations in view of the uncertainty concerning soil fertility and lack of
fertilizer research in the area. Urea as the source of nitrogen is being
recommended by CRP's technical services for two applications per crop total-
ling 125 lb/ac for Starbonnet and 33 lb/ac for traditional varieties on clay
soils, and slightly less on clay soils overlain with peat. These application
rates are low and they reflect the poor response of varieties presently used
to nitrogen (para 5).  When new hybrids from crossings with Japonica lineage
are introduced, however, higher dosage will be required. GRB also recommends
between 80 and 100 lb of triple superphosphate (TSP)/ac for Starbonnet and
about 40% of that amount for traditional varieties. In general, soils are
sufficiently rich in potassium and no potassium fertilizer would be required.
Response to lime applications have been variable but toxicity has resulted in
some cases and lime, therefore, cannot be generally recommended without fur-
ther research. Farmers are aware that GlFB's fertilizer recommendations are
not sufficiently adapted to their specific needs and fertilizer trials with
several repetitions on major soil types should be conducted under the supervi-
sion of a qualified agriculturalist, and in coordination with the research
programs at MARDS. If recommendations were more specifically adapted to the
farmers' needs, and were supported by a strengthened extension service, the
rate of fertilizer use should increase from the present 53% for Urea and 30%
for TSP to full application by 80% of the farmers.  The remaining 20% of the
farmers would continue using current rates of application for traditional
varieties.
W4eed Control
9.        Weeds are a major problem to rice growing in Guyana.  Red rice, in
particular, is abundant and downgrades the commercial value of the crop. It
can be effectively controlled in leveled fields by proper water management and
cultivation practices. Traditional varieties are more easily infested than
the improved varieties, which largely explains the lower sale price of tradi-
tional varieties. Other numerous broad leaf weeds are treated with chemicals
distributed by C1RB, Currently, only half of the farmers use weedicides for



ANNEX 6
Page 6
several reasons; they do not have sufficient control over water distribution,
land is poorly leveled, and weedicides have only a marginal effect. By cor-
recting these basic factors, the project would increase rice yields and also
improve quality.
Farm Labor
1n.       Although most operations are mechanized, labor is still required
for broadcasting, fertilizer application, pest control, weeding and harvesting.
The first three operations require about one man-day/ac, usually performed
by family labor on farms of less than 20 ac. Family labor is also employed
at harvest for bagging; rPB and private contractors require that the combine
driver and mechanic be assisted by two men supplied by the farmer. For weed-
ing on canal banks and rogueing, hired labor is used on farms of 10 ac and
more. Annual labor requirements, under improved conditions, would average
7.8 man-days/ac, or a 60% increase over the average 4.9 man-days currently
used. There is sufficient unused manpower available in the area to supply
the additional labor required.
Yields, Production
11.       Since the early 1960's, there has been a downtrend in yields in
the project area as well as in Guyana as a whole (Table 2). This decline to
an average of 12.8 bagsi/ per ac for each crop (0.88 m ton paddy/ac) from
1968 to 1971 in the project area is due mainly to the change from hand-
transplanting to direct seeding and the introduction of mechanical harvesting
without the necessary concomitant changes in cultural practices. The introduc-
tion of new varieties has had little impact because farmers have inadequate
technical know-how or assistance to take advantage of their higher yield
potential. Farmers' discontent over paddy prices before the recent increases
also contributed to their neglecting the crop. As a result of these price
increases and CRC's efforts in plant breeding, yields are assumed to increase
without the project by about 15% if higher prices are maintained and if GCII's
research program to improve the hybrid varieties (para 5) is successful. Un-
der the project, yields would increase progressively, mainly because of land
leveling and more intensive technical assistance. It has been assumed that
at project full development, 8 years after project initiation, 80% of the
farmers would adopt improved techniques. The same conditions would prevail
in the Somerset Berks Extension area, where yield projections were reduced by
10Z to account for the uncertainty over soils which are expected to be of
lower fertility than in the Tapakuma Scheme (Annex 1). Farmers growing
improved varieties on leveled fields would, on average, obtain two thirds of
the yields obtained on CRI1's seed farms less 6% for a 30% crop loss due to
flooding or inadequate water every 5 crops. Yields on leveled land would be
about 20% higher than on unleveled fields. On average, over the project area,
rice yields would increase by about 45% from 12.8 bags/ac (0.88 m ton) to
18.5 bags/ac (1.28 m ton). Yield and production levels are given in Tables 5
to 7.

Tree Crops
12.       In the Somerset Berks area the project would improve yields of the
existing citrus plantations by providing better drainage and eliminating
floods which would reduce water logging. Yields, now at about 4,000 lb per
ac have been estimated to increase by about 100%. Yields of other crops such
as coffee and vegetables would not be changed by the project.
B. Farm Budgets
Farm Types
13.       Development of different farm types taking into account size, loca-
tion and rice varieties grown, were examined at their present stage and at
project full development, when project improvements would be in operation and
seed from the higher producing varieties available. Basic farming conditions
were examined on a per acre basis and results are presented in Table 8; these
returns were then extrapolated to different farm sizes (Tables 9 through 12).
Since traditional varieties will continue to be grown mainly by subsistence
farmers with the least technical know-how, these farming conditions have been
applied to the smaller farms (less than 5 ac). The larger farms (more than
10 ac) have been assumed to grow improved varieties. It is not possible to
determine when each farm would reach the ultimate stage of development but
most farms could obtain the highest yields beginning in 1979.
Production Costs
14.       Costs for each farm type under present conditions are based on
average utilization rates. Prior to the project, one-fifth of the faraers
growing improved varieties are estimated to have received some kind of rudi-
mentary land clearing and leveling done at the on going rate of G$ 30 per ac,
repavable over 5 years without interest. Fertilizers and pesticides have been
assumed to be utilized as at present, and at project full development, at the
rates given in paragraphs 7 and 8. At project initiation, in 1975, the ongoing
subsidized prices have been assumed to still be valid; at project full develop-
ment, however, the inputs have been assumed to be costed at their actual price,
including a C^r, handling charge of 10% for fertilizers and 20% for other cbemi-
icals, in addition to a transportation cost of G$0.03/lb between Ceorgetown
and Anna Regina. The current subsidy of G$0.05 per bag paddy for transporta-
tion cost from the field to the mill would also be cancelled. Mechanized
operations have been costed at the ongoing rates for custom hire work. Since
the area is assumed to have an adequate supply of machinery, no new invest-
ments in farm machinery would be required, and only operation and replacement
cost, which are estimated to be covered by ongoing private rates, have been
considered. Labor has been costed at the minimum wage of G$ 4.70 per man-day.

Income
15.       Production has been calculated on the basis of cropping intensities
and yields as presented in paragraphs 2 and 11. The 1972/73 farm-gate prices
are the average prices actually paid out by GRB for the 1972 autumn and the
1973 spring crop. Farm-gate prices as from 1980 are based on the market pros-
pects for Guyana rice (Annex 7). Under these conditions, from 1980 onward
the average farm gate prices for a 152-lb bag of paddy at 14.5% humidity would
be G$ 16.0 1/ for improved varieties and G$ 13.7 for traditional varieties,
the latter being estimated by applying the present relative price difference.

3. Estimated Yields at Farms Improved by the Project
1) For improved varieties, less 5% to account for the
occurrence of floods or drought every 5 years.
a) With Land leveling
Starbonnet                          14.7            18.0          16.4

2) For Traditional Varieties
With land leveling 30% higher than    12.0             16.9           14.6
now
Without land leveling 15% less         10.4            14.7           12.7
In the extension area, yields would be 10% less than in the Tapakuma Scheme to
account for a greater risk due to unknown soil reactions.
lJ Assuming 50( hybrid and 30 Starbonnet among the improved varieties, the
remaining 20% being cropped with traditional varieties.

TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Marketing, Prices-/ and Export of Rice
1.        At full development, the project would increase the production of
paddy by 35,000 tons, 2/ which would be used for export. The bulk of the
rice exported from Guyana is sold to CARIFTA countries under annual government-
to-government contracts. Guyana is the only large producer and exporter of
rice in the region and the other CARIFTA countries have agreed to import their
needs from Guyana rather than from third countries, provided Guyana could
supply the quantities and qualities demanded. Exports to non-CARIFTA countries
have declined since 1968 mainly because of shortage of supplies rather than
lack of markets. Since 1969 there has been a worldwide rice shortage resulting
in abnormally high prices, and Guyana has had no difficulties in disposing of
its surplus.
2.        The former Guyana Rice Marketing Board (GRMB) had a monopoly on the
purchase and resale of milled rice to both internal and export markets, except
for that portion retained in the rural areas. About 50% of the paddy currently
produced in the project area is milled at the Guyana Rice Corporation (GRC)
mill at Anna Regina. The rest is handled by private millers. The GRMB and
the GRC are separate Government agencies under the Ministry of National
Development and Agriculture, but they have recently been merged into the
Guyana Rice Board (GRB).
3.        During the past five years, the marketed production of paddy has
ranged between 173,000 and 203,200 tons:
Year                               1967      1968     1969      1970     1971

ANNEX 7
Page 2
More than one half of the processed rice is exported as shown in Table 1. The
export projection shown in Table 1 for 1976 are based on 260,000 ac of cropped
land, with an average yield per acre of 0.89 ton of paddy instead of 0.74 ton
achieved in 1972. Using a conversion rate of 65% for processed rice from paddy,
the total rice production would be 150,000 tons in 1976, of which 20,000 tons
is for animal feed and seed (rice equivalent) and 54,000 tons for local con-
sumption, assuming an annual consumption rate of 68 kg per capita as estimated
by USDA. 1/ The projected exports to the CARIFTA countries are based on the
assumption that consumption in these countries will increase at about 2% per
year, the same growth rate experienced between 1959-61 and 1969-71, and that
the additional requirements would be imported from Guyana.
4.        Export prices from Guyana rice to CARIFTA countries have increased
since 1968, thus reflecting improvements in marketing and price increases under
negotiated government-to-government contracts within the region (Table 1).
CARIFTA rice prices were above world market prices when these were low, and
are now below the exceptionally high world market prices. According to the
Bank's Economic Department projections, the f.o.b. Bangkok prices of Thai white
rice, 5% broken in 1974 dollars are expected to decline from US$300 in 1974
to US$276 in 1976 and to US$220 in 1980 and thereafter.
5.        Local consumer prices in Guyana have been kept stable over the last
five years despite the price increase for exported rice. The consumer price
for parboiled rice 2/ in 1972 was about US$124 per ton as compared to US$165
for exported parboiled rice. In order to calculate the farm-gate price for
paddy, the estimates in this report are based on the assumption that the rice
industry would charge the local consumer a non-subsidized average price and
that increases in prices resulting from international transactions will be
passed on to farmers. If the local consumer price is subsidized, it can hardly
be quantified since the costs of handling rice for local consumption are lower
than those for export and it is assumed that Guyana uses a better quality for
export than for local consumption. About 75% of local consumption is dis-
tributed by the private mills which have lower distribution costs than GRB.
Deducting distribution costs, adjusted to account for the private millers share
of the market, the 1972 export price would give a local consumer price of US$154
per ton. This price is about 29% higher than the actual price; the difference
probably reflects the difference in the qualities used for export and for local
consumption.
6.        As shown in Tables 2 and 3 the rice processing unit costs will de-
crease in real terms in the time period from 1972 to 1982. Milling and market-
ing unit costs would decrease from G$128 in 1974 to G$110 in 1982, which would
enable the rice processing industry to pay the farmer a reasonable price, even
under the lower rice prices projected for the future.
December 1973
1/   According to FAQ projections, the per capita rice consumption will be
82.6 kg in the 1970s for Guyana, but this seems to be an over estimation.
2/  A very small quantity of white rice is used for local consumption in Guyana.

TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Benefits
1.        The project benefits for a 50 year period, taken into account in
calculating the economic rate of return, are the value of incremental rice
production from 90% of the area and the value of incremental production of
other crops, mainly coconuts, citrus, coffee and vegetables from the rest of
the areas. The estimated incremental project production of paddy rice is
shown in Annex 6, Table 7, which is based on yield asaumptions as given in
Annex 6, Table 5. Export prices for rice are based on projections by the
Bank's Economics Department. The projections are in constant 1974 prices
and refer to white rice. Parboiled rice has been priced at 85% of white.
It has been assumed, first, that the incremental rice production will be
totally exported; second, that world and CARIFTA prices would be similar
in the long run; and third that the amount of "surplus" rice exported to
the world market (i.e. outside CARIFTA) would not change world prices, as
total volume transacted would not be affected by the small Guyana supply.
GRB profits would be sufficient to maintain a research program and devrelop-
ment operations and to pass on to farmers the benefits derived from higher
prices for rice on the world market, providing, therefore, adequate incentives
for rice production.
Costs
2.        Costs charged in the rate of return calculation for physical works,
equipment, administration, supporting services, consultants and on-farm costs
are shown in Annex 4, Table 1 and Annex 6, Table 8. These last ones were
calculated on the basis of 80% of the area cultivated with improved varieties
and the remaining 20%, with traditional ones. Costs include physical con-
tingencies but exclude price contingencies and identifiable taxes. Except
for a small property tax, there are no taxes and since May 15, 1973, no import
duties on agricultural production inputs. The cost for extension services,
both by the Ministry and GRB as shown in Annex 4, Table 2, have been included
in the rate of return calculation.
Research Expenditures
3.        These expenditures  include the salaries and operating costs for
research incurred by GRB directly on the project. Since rice research in the
country is financed by GRB profits, part of these expenditures would be
financed by the incremental production on the project, but these costs are
not charged in the rate of return calculation.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
Labor Costs
4.        With full recognition of the high level of unemployment and under-
employment in Guyana and the absence of other employment opportunities,
especially in the project area, the economic costs of hired and farm family
labor requirements are charged at current wage rates in the rate of return
calculation (Annex 6, Table 8).
Project Life
5.        The life of the project is assumed to be 50 years, with the replace-
ment of the pumping equipment after 25 years. It is assumed that full produc-
tion would be reached in 1982, following completion of the project works by
the end of 1979 or early 1980.
Economic Rate of Return
6.        The overall economic rate of return for a 50 year period, including
labor costs, is 20%. The economic rate of return using two alternatives to
the basic assumptions for costs and benefits is presented-below:
(a)  If all costs increased by 20% while benefits remain the same,
the rate of return would be 15%.
(b) If all costs increased by 20% while benefits decreased by 20%,
the rate of return would be 10%.
7.        None of the above mentioned alternatives has resulted in an inter-
nal rate of return of less than 10%, which is about the opportunity cost of
capital for similar activities in Guyana.
