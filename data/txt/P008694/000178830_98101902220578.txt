REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE INVESTMENT BANK, ROMANIA, WITH
THE GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF
ROMANIA FOR THE OTELINOX SPECIAL STEEL PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Investment Bank, Romania, with guarantee of the Socialist Republic of
Romania, for the equivalent of US$70 million to help finance the foreign ex-
change cost of a special steel project. The loan would have a term of 15
years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
The Otelinox enterprise would be the beneficiary of the Bank loan, and the
cost of the loan to the enterprise would be 9 percent per annum including a
guarantee fee of 1-3/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMYf
2.        Romania joined the Bank on December 15, 1972.  The first economic
mission visited the country in March/April 1973 and its report, entitled "The
Economy of Romania" (R73-274), was issued to the Executive Directors on Novem-
ber 30, 1973. An updating mission just returned from Romania and will complete
its report later this year. The first basic mission is scheduled for 1976.
Social and economic country data are given in Annex I.
3.        Since the founding of the People's Republic of Romania in 1948,
which in 1965 was reconstituted as the Socialist Republic of Romania, eco-
nomic management has been organized along socialist principles which have
included state and cooperative ownership of almost all productive resources,
and the absence of private enterprise. Economic activity is directed by means
of administrative development planning, coordinated by the central authorities.
Productive enterprises operate within the framework of the development plan
which defines the scope of their activity, the outlines of their production
and investment goals and their targets for operating efficiency. The Plan is
elaborated within a five-year time frame, each year having a separate Annual
Plan. The country is presently in the fourth year of its Five-Year Plan for
the period 1971-1975.
4.        The technical and functional Ministries are the State's chief agents
for the administration of economic activity. They are assisted by subordinate
units known as Centrals, which coordinate and supervise activities within a
common branch or industry without being directly engaged in production. Sub-
ordinate to the Centrals are the productive enterprises whose principal task
is meeting production targets. Production enterprises generally are not au-
thorized to engage directly in foreign trade. For this purpose they use spe-
cial foreign trade enterprises.



-2-
5.        Economic development is of paramount concern to the Romanian Govern-
ment. Rapid industrialization is a major objective with priority being given
tc heavy industry including steel, machine tools and chemicals. To achieve
their growth objectives the Romanian authorities have made considerable efforts
to mobilize domestic resources for development and to maintain a high rate of
capital formation. In the present Five-Year Plan planned and actual investment
rates of around 30 percent of GNP have been the norm. As a consequence, con-
sumption has been restrained, and the development of the consumer goods indus-
try has been less strongly emphasized than that of heavy industry. In 1972,
heavy industry (led by machine tools, chemicals and ferrous metallurgy) ac-
counted for about 70 percent of industrial production.
6.        As a result of this strategy, a marked change has been achieved in
the structure of Romania's economy. Rapid industrial growth, which over the
last decade has averaged more than 13 percent per annum, has expanded the
share of the labor force employed in industry including power and construc-
tion to 35 percent in 1972, from about 14 percent in 1950. During the same
period, agricultural output almost tripled while the share of the labor force
engaged in agriculture declined from 74 percent to around 45 percent.
7.        Romania's population growth is around 1.0 percent per annum.  Thus,
the impact of rapid economic growth on per capita incomes has not been substan-
tially diluted by the population increase. In the last decade, GNP growth has
been 9.0 percent per annum on average, implying a growth of about 8.0 percent
per annum of per capita GNP. The latest World Bank Atlas estimates GNP per
capita for 1971 at $740.
8.        The organizatior. of production in both the urban sector and in agri-
culture is such that all labor is actively employed and there is no open un-
employment.  There is, however, some labor surplus. Income distribution is
also relatively equal. In 1972, average monthly wages were 1,498 lei (about
$75 equivalent). Almost 80 percent of all monthly wages were within the range
of 900-2000 lei and less than 6 percent were under 900 lei. Minimum wages are
guaranteed by the State; they were raised to 1,000 lei per month for full-time
workers in September 1972. Prices for essential consumer goods and services
such as basic foodstuffs, rents and urban transport are relatively low and
most social services, notably education and health care, are provided with-
out charge. Continuous efforts are made to increase the standard of living.
Romania also pursues a positive regional policy which has sought to bring a
balanced development of both human and natural resources to all parts of the
country.
9.        The official exchange rate of lei 4.97 per US$1.00 is used only
for accounting purposes. The rate used for invisible and capital transac-
tions is lei 14,38 per US$1. Under a newi system introduced in January, 1974,
the prices of all traded goods are converted at a uniform rate of lei 20 per
US$1.00, a rate which is considered by the Romanians as being representative
of the cost of convertible foreign exchange. For imported goods, the domes-
tic lei price is found by adding to the converted foreign price a tariff rate
which varies for different types of goods. The rate of lei 20 per US$1.00
has also been used to convert national income statistics from lei to dollars.



Consequently, this rate has been used as the base rate for calculations in
the appraisal.
Recent Developments
10.       Since the National Party Conference of 1967, which set the stage
for major qualitative advances in Romania's economic and social development,
there have been important new emphases in Romania's economic management.
Measures were taken to improve the institutional basis of planning (e.g. by
creating the Centrals to assist in plan administration), to increase the ef-
ficiency of economic management and to improve upon the quality of production
in industry. In agriculture efforts were made to raise productivity and sta-
bilize growth through irrigation, mechanization and the expanded use of chem-
ical fertilizers. To expand upon the growth of foreign trade and technical-
economic cooperation the Romanian Government has concluded trade and coopera-
tion agreements with a wide range of countries. In this context also, Romania
has made positive efforts to expand its multilateral external relations and to
pursue full cooperation with the international agencies, including UN, UNCTAD,
UNESCO, FAO, UNIDO and GATT.
11.       One result of these efforts is that foreign trade has expanded quite
rapidly in recent years both in volume and in regional diversity. There has
also been a tendency to move away from trade on a bilateral barter basis to-
wards trade involving multilateral payments. During the period 1965-72, total
foreign trade grew at about 12 percent per annum in current prices. In 1972,
imports and exports each totalled about $2.6 billion, about 45 percent of which
represented trade with non-socialist countries. Overall trade deficits have
generally remained small. During 1968-72 the total annual trade deficit aver-
aged about $75 million, i.e. less than 8 percent of average exports. However,
the results varied as between different trade regions. Imports from East
European Socialist countries were slightly lower than Romania's exports to
that region. In Romania's trade with Western industrialized countries, on
the other hand, exports were much less than imports. These deficits have
sometimes been increased by deficits on the invisibles account with Western
countries.
12.       The Romanian economy has not escaped the impact of recent world de-
velopments affecting the energy sector, even though the country depends only
marginally on imported fuels. At present Romania is a net importer of crude
oil and a net exporter of petroleum derivatives. In 1973 Romania imported
about 4.0 million tons of crude oil valued at around $80 million, out of a
total crude consumption of around 17 million tons. Valued at 1974 prices,
this volume of imports will cost over $200 million which represents a sig-
nificant increase in required foreign exchange. These imports, however, are
used mainly as chemical feedstock. Exports of derivatives in 1973 were aDoul
5.0 million tons valued at about $140 million. To the extent petroleum deriva-
tive prices rise in response to recent changes in crude oil prices, there will
be gains in export earnings to offset the rise in the oil import bill. The
extent to which this will occur, however, is still uncertain. In November
1973, the Romanians embarked on a stringent program of economy in the use of
fuels, which included rationing of gasoline and fuel oil, in order both to
minimize the import drain and maximize the supply available for export; ration-
ing ended in March 1974 following an increase in the selling prices of these
fuels.



-4-
External Assistance
13.       The expansion of Romania's trade with the non-socialist industrial
countries has led to an increased need to obtain convertible currencies to
pay for imports from those countries. Romania has met this need both by
borrowing abroad and by mounting a major effort to expand exports and tourism.
Gross inflows of convertible currency capital were US$542 million in 1973, hav-
ing grown from US$276 million in 1967. Romania's access to convertible finance,
however, has been almost exclusively confined to financial and suppliers' cred-
its with relatively short repayment periods. The net inflow of convertible
capital in 1973, therefore, was only US$238 million.
14.       As part of its effort to expand its foreign trade and cooperation
relationships, Romania has also taken active steps to attract long-term pri-
vate capital. A regulation passed in 1972 defines the conditions under which
foreign firms can establish joint ventures with domestic enterprises, prefer-
ably in foreign exchange earning/saving industries. Romania has also estab-
lished two joint banks, one in France and the other in the United Kingdom,
in an effort to expand the availability of credit from European countries.
Prospects
15.       The current Five-Year Plan (1971-75), whose original targets in most
sectors appear likely to be exceeded, reflects Romania's continued strategy of
rapid growth. The targets contained in the Annual Plan for 1974, for example,
include a 16.7 percent growth in industrial production, 14.6 percent growth
in national income, an investment rate equal to 35 percent of national income
and a 41 percent expansion of foreign trade. The Plan also lays stress on a
range of qualitative aspects of development including technical improvements
and diversification in industry and foreign trade, improvements in capacity
utilization, development of the nation's human resource potential and a con-
tinued emphasis on regional development.
16.       Romania has good potential for further economic growth.  Endowed
with important natural resources - fuels, some minerals, timber, rich soils
and a favorable climate both for agriculture and tourism - and located con-
veniently with respect to its major international markets in the East and
West, the country has built a broad industrial infrastructure (power, metal-
lurgy, chemicals) which will serve as a base for the expansion of secondary
manufacturing sectors such as machine building and consumer durables. Above
all, Romania has a hard-working and increasingly skilled population devoted
to the achievement of the country's development objectives.
17.       Economic growth and structural change call for the introduction of
new industrial technologies, improvements in the quality of products, more
economic use of materials and factor inputs, and reductions in production
costs. The increasing diversity and complexity of Romania's economic struc-
ture require continuing improvements in the efficiency of economic planning
and coordination and further refinements in industrial management. To keep
up with these changes and requirements large programs of education and man-
power training have been mounted, and efforts are being made to strengthen
technical cooperation with industrialized countries and international organ-
izations.

Creditworthiness
18.       At the end of 1973 Romania's total medium and long-term external
debt amounted to $1,519 million. Most of these debts ($1,404 million) were
denominated in convertible currencies, the major creditor countries being
Germany, France, UK and Italy. While the total debt does not appear exces-
sive in relation to the volume and growth of external trade, average maturi-
ties are relatively short and convertible debt service payments are estimated
to be in the order of $340 million a year during 1974-75. The convertible debt
service ratio was approximately 19 percent in 1973, reflecting the unfavorable
terms of foreign credits available to the country.
19.       The organization of economic activity in Romania and the pursuit of
a development strategy involving high investment/saving rates and rapid income
growth ensure the ava-lability of domestic resources sufficient to service
reasonable amounts of foreign debt. Moreover, the country's major efforts
to expand exports (particularly to convertible currency areas), to attract
private joint venture capital and to seek other forms of bilateral converti-
ble currency financing are increasing the foreign exchange available for debt
service. Convertible earnings rose from $585 million in 1967 to $1,902 mil-
lion in 1973. The preferential trade status accorded to Romania by the EEC
in June 1973 should facilitate the further expansion of such exports as could
the granting of most favored nation status by the U.S. Last year, the Govern-
ment also restricted the use of short-term credit facilities from western sup-
pliers in an effort to improve the structure of the country's external debt.
Assuming a continuation of present export and debt management policies it can
be expected that the debt service ratio will gradually decline during the sec-
ond half of the 1970's. The country's present outward-looking posture, the
success of both its domestic growth and foreign trade policies, and its po-
tential for continued development, all support the judgment that Romania is
creditworthy for substantial Bank lending.
20.       When Romania joined the Bank, most pre-war foreign debts of the
country had been settled. The only settlements which were still under dis-
cussion at that time concerned claims in the United Kingdom and in the United
States. The Romanian authorities have repeatedly assured the Bank of their
intention to settle these old claims, and have from time to time advised
the Bank staff of progress towards settlement. As far as the US claims are
concerned, there have been several meetings between both parties. The most
recent meetings between a Romanian delegation led by the Deputy Minister of
Finance and representatives of the US bondholders took place on June 10, 11
and 20 in Washington; the next meeting is planned for early July during
which both sides expect to agree on procedures for formal registration
and validation of outstanding bonds. The Romanian authorities have ex-
pressed confidence that final agreement on a compensation formula will be
completed no later than August 1974. The UK claims are larger and more
complicated. The most recent meetings were held in London on June 6 and
in Bucharest on June 18. Both sides aim to exchange specific proposals
during the next few weeks, and the Romanian authorities have expressed
confidence that final agreement will be reached by September.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ROMANIA
21.       Documents for the first loan to Romania, the Tecuci Fertilizer
Project, were distributed recently to the Executive Directors. In addi-
tion to the proposed project, documents are also now distributed for the
proposed Turceni Thermal Power Project.
22.       It will take time to build up detailed knowledge of the economy
which would allow a sharper focus on the outstanding development problems.
At present, foreign exchange, especially in convertible currencies, appears
to be a major constraint. During the early phase in the Bank's relations
with Romania, therefore, one of the major objectives of Bank lending will
be to help alleviate the country's shortage of foreign exchange by provid-
ing long-term external capital and by financing projects which will expand
foreign exchange earnings or savings. Bank lending will also aim at support-
ing the Government's efforts to introduce new industrial technologies, to im-
prove the quality of products, to make more economic use of materials and
factor inputs and to reduce production costs. Market aspects and marketing,
especially for export goods, will also be emphasized. Special attention is
also being given to agriculture where productivity levels are still relative-
ly low. The Government is aware of this situation and has stepped up efforts
to develop the agricultural sector as evidenced by the rapid expansion of ir-
rigation, the increasing use of fertilizer and the continuing pursuit of in-
stitutional improvements in this sector. The Bank will assist the Government
in implementing plans in this field.
23.       In furtherance of these objectives of Bank lending, loans for an
irrigation project in the area of Giurgiu-Razmiresti and an agricultural
credit operation to develop agricultural production within the recently com-
pleted Sadova-Corabia irrigation system are envisaged within the next year.
Also being proposed for Bank consideration is a multi-purpose power and irri-
gation project on the Lower Olt River and a pulp and paper project.
24.       In addition to significant help with the preparation of projects
for Bank financing, the Bank (through EDI) has assisted in establishing a
project appraisal training course for Romanian officials (held in Belgrade
in October 1973). The preparations for additional such courses in Romania
are underway.
25.       Romania is not yet a member of IFC but preliminary contacts have
been made to discuss Romania's cooperation with IFC.
26.       The projects in the pipeline would represent only a small propor-
tion of Romania's total need for external financing, and of its total dis-
bursed convertible debt. However, they would provide a substantial net ad-
dition to the present inflow of convertible currency finance and hopefully
set a pattern for obtaining finance on longer repayment terms. The disbursed
debt outstanding to the Bank is not expected to constitute more than 10 percent
of Romania's total projected convertible currency debt in FY79; the Bank's
share in Romania's debt service payments in FY79 would be less than 4 per-
cent.

PART III - ME INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN ROMIIA
Industrial DevelopEent
27.       Romanian development policy during the last 25 years has emphasized
industry in general and producer goods in particular. The aim has been to
transform a nation that once specialized in the exportation of raw materials
into a country with an integrated, self-sufficient and diversified industrial
structure. Since the mid-1950's investment in industry has averaged 50 per-
cent of total investment and around 60 percent of this total has been in fuel,
chemicals, metallurgy, engineering and metal working. The 1971-75 Five-Year
Plan calls for a continued emphasis on heavy industry and stresses technical
improvement, product diversification and increased capacity utilization.
28.       Thus, industry is playing an ever increasing role in Romania's eco-
homic growth. Gross industrial output grew at an average annual rate of al-
most 13 percent between 1960-71 and is scheduled to grow at 11-12 percent
per annum during the 1971-75 Five-Year Plan. In 1955, industry, including
power and construction, accounted for 45 percent of national income, 17 per-
cent of employment and about 20 percent of exports. By 1972, these percent-
ages had grown to 66 percent for national income, 35 percent for employment
and over 60 percent for exports.
29.       In developing various branches of heavy industry, Romania has to
some extent already introduced foreign technology and equipment in expanding
its heavy industry exports in recent years (the share of machinery and chem-
icals in total exports having increased from 7.4 percent to 33.1 percent in
1972). Despite these achievements, however, the quality of product and ancil-
lary services offered in these branches is still such that competition remains
difficult in the markets supplied by the world's most advanced producers of
these goods.
Steel Industry
30.       Crude steel production grew at an annual rate of nearly 14 percent
throughout the 1960's, increasing from 1.8 million tons in 1960 to 6.5 mil-
lion tons in 1970 and is projected to grow at about 10 percent per year during
the present decade, reaching 17 million tons by 1980. According to its plans,
Romania will become in 1980, for the first time in its history, a net exporter
of steel, with steel consumption equal to 682 kg per capita. Plans call for
more diversified and higher quality steel-based end products. Alloy steel
production is planned to rise from 525,000 tons of crude steel equivalent (or
7 percent of total steel production in 1973) to about 2.0 million tons (equal
to 12 percent of total production in 1980).
Market for Alloy and Stainless Steel
31.       Rapid growth is foreseen in the sectors which consume alloy and
stainless steel. They include consumer goods, machine tools, motor vehicles,



-8-
railway rolling stock, electronic and electrical equipment, construction ma-
chinery and equipment for food processing, chemicals, paper, textiles, ship-
building and power generation. In particular, between 1970 and 1980, the
demand for metal-processing equipment is planned to increase 8 times, for
food processing equipment 6.5 times, for power generating equipment 5 times
and equipment for the chemical, petroleum refining and paper industries 4
times. Based on previous success in heavy industry, these targets are likely
to be met. It is only through the availability of locally produced raw mate-
rials, some of which the project will provide, that such high rates of growth
will be possible.
Industrial Organization
32.       At present ten industrial ministries are responsible for the Romanian
industrial sector. Subordinate to each Ministry are several foreign trade en-
terprises, research and design institutes and a number of Centrals, which in
turn direct the activities of a group of related enterprises. The work on
overall design and supervision of projects is delegated by the Ministry to
one of its research and design institutes; in the case of Otelinox, it is
IPROLAM, the research and design institute for steel rolling mills, within
the Ministry of hetallurgical Industries. The enterprises, Centrals and
design institutes, which have not been authorized to trade abroad, conduct
their foreign business indirectly through the foreign trade enterprises which
belong to the same Ministry. Similarly, the Otelinox enterprise would deal
with METAROM in regard to the procurement of foreign equipment.
The Borrower
33.       The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Investment Bank which
is the specialized agency under the Ministry of Finance for investment projects
in all sectors of the economy except agriculture (including water resources)
and food processing.  It has a large technical and economic staff with branch
offices in all districts of the country. The Investment Bank's involvement
in investment projects commences in the preparation phase; its staff appraises
all major investment projects technically and financially and recommends ap-
proval or otherwise when their financing is considered by the Council of Min-
isters. When a particular project and its financial plan have been approved
by the Council of Ministers, all major funds (budget allocations, deprecia-
tion funds, share of planned benefits) are channeled through the Investment
Bank in accordance with the approved financial plan. All payments in Lei
for the execution of a project have to be authorized by the Investment Bank
which keeps separate accounts for each category in the financial plan for
every enterprise. It is the Investment Bank's obligation to ensure that a
project is executed according to the financial and technical data included
in the final technical and economic study as approved by the Council of
Ministers. Its inspectors check whether the project is proceeding according
to the schedule approved in the Plan.
34.       While the Investment Bank's supervision and control function is thus
rather strong during the implementation phase of project, its functions are
much more limited during the operation phase of a project. Although it has



- 9 -
the right and obligation to verify that the enterprise is meeting the invest-
ment targets set in the Plan, it has no legal authority to influence the man-
agement of the enterprise or to force the enterprise to take operational ac-
tions which it considers necessary. In practice, however, it can request such
actions very effectively by reporting through the Ministry of Finance to the
Government. In order to reflect this factual situation and yet to ensure that
the Otelinox enterprise meets the requirements specified in Article IV of the
Loan Agreement concerning the operations phase, the Guarantor has agreed that
it shall cause the enterprise to comply with such requirements (see Section
2.03 of the Guarantee Agreement).
35.       As mentioned above, the Investment Bank is the channel for all sources
of major domestic investment financing, but its own funds are still relatively
small. Its prime source of funds is the State Budget. The Guarantee Agree-
ment, therefore, includes a provision (Section 2.02) that the Guarantor shall
provide all necessary funds for the implementation and operation of the proj-
ect. The Guarantor would also provide sufficient funds to the Investment Bank
to ensure that it can meet the debt service on the Bank loan (see para. 43
below). In view of the status of the Investment Bank within the government
system, it is considered sufficient to rely in this respect on the Guarantee
Agreement (Section 2.01).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       In early 1973, the Romanian Government submitted a list of possible
projects to the Bank including the Otelinox Special Steel Project. IPROLAI4
delivered a preliminary technical and economic study for Otelinox to the Bank
in June 1973. A pre-appraisal mission in August 1973 was followed by an ap-
praisal mission in November 1973. Negotiations were held during April/May
1974 in Washington. The Romanian delegation was led by Mr. Mihai Diamandopol,
President of the Investment Bank.
Project Description
37.       The project is important for the development of the Romanian metal
processing and machine building industries. Otelinox represents the second
stage in the development of a specialty steel complex in Tirgoviste, and will
be the only domestic manufacturer of stainless steel sheet and strip and one
of the few domestic producers of small sizes of alloy bar and rod products.
Its detailed analysis, first in the form of a preliminary and later in the
form of a final technical and economic study, as well as the initiation of
construction is included in the 1971-75 Five-Year Plan.  Its completion and
attainment of full capacity will be part of the 1976-1980 Five-Year Plan.
38.       A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.  The Appraisal
Report entitled "Appraisal of Otelinox Special Steel Project (No. 359a-RO)
dated May 21, 1974, is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
The project will include:



- 10 -
(a) engineering and construction of a cold rolling mill complex
designed to produce about 30,000 tons per year of stainless
steel sheet and strip from hot-rolled coils;
(b) engineering and construction of a rod and bar rolling mill
complex designed to produce about 120,000 tons per year of
alloy steel rod and bar products from billets;
(c) training of staff in the application of special production
processes and techniques and in plant management and opera-
tion; and
(d)  studies on the end use of Otelinox's products, on the feasi-
bility of the establishment of intermediate warehouse facil-
ities and steel service centers, and on the export potential
for Romanian special steel products.
Project Execution
39.       The responsibilities for project execution have been delegated to
several different agencies, but the Otelinox enterprise shall have overall
responsibility for the coordination of project execution and of the project-
related activities of the other agencies involved (see Section 3.01 of the
Loan Agreement). IPROLAM, with many years of experience, is responsible
for basic design and engineering, and the technical evaluation of bids;
moreover, it provides technical assistance to the Otelinox enterprise in
the supervision of construction.  NETAROM, the foreign trade enterprise
engaged for a number of years in the buying and selling of equipment and
know-how for the metallurgical industry, will undertake the commercial eval-
uation of bids and handle contracts with foreign suppliers; goods and serv-
ices required for the project and to be supplied from within Romania will
be procured directly by the Otelinox enterprise witn the guidance of IPROLAM.
Actual construction and erection will be performed by either the Industrial
Construction Trust under the Ministry of Industrial Construction or a con-
struction trust under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries. The former
trust is presently engaged in the construction of Stage I of the Tirgoviste
complex. The construction of both mills is expected to be completed by June
197S and they are scheduled to reach full production in 1980.
Project Operation
40.       Otelinox is one of the nine enterprises in the Steel Central which
is part of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries. The organization and
functioning of Otelinox will be in accordance with the 1971 law on the or-
ganization of State production units. This law provides for a general manager
of the enterprise (appointed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries) who,
assisted by a management committee, decides on and supervises the daily opera-
tions of the enterprise. Under. the Romanian system of collective decision-
making the organization of the enterprise further includes an Assembly of
Working People in the enterprise, which meets twice yearly to determine



- 11 -
matters of broad policy interest, and a Committee of Working People (formed
from the Assembly) which determines operating policies at monthly meetings.
All decisions of these bodies must be made within the framework of the na-
tional plan. This decision-making process seems to work well in practice.
Project Cost
41.       The total costs of the project including working capital but ex-
cluding interest during construction ($11.1 million) are equivalent to
US$174.2 million with a foreign exchange component of US$86.6 million or
about 50 percent of total costs. The local cost component, based on fixed
Romanian prices, is unlikely to change significantly; 1/ foreign costs con-
tain a 10 percent contingency per annum for price escalation. In addition,
a physical contingency of 10 percent has been added to total fixed costs.
The project consists of two separate units; a cold mill with a foreign ex-
change cost of $39.9 million representing 47 percent of its total cost of
about US$85.1 million (excluding interest during construction) and a bar mill
with a foreign exchange cost of $46.7 million representing 54 percent of its
total cost of about US$89.1 million (excluding interest during construction).
Financing
42.       The proposed Bank loan of US$70 million would be sufficient to fi-
nance about 73 percent of the total cost of equipment imports and engineering,
know-how and technical assistance for the project and is intended to cover
100 percent of such cost for the cold mill and about 65 percent for the bar
mill. The remainder of the foreign exchange requirements, as well as interest
on the Bank loan during construction (amounting to about US$9.2 million) and
the small foreign exchange component of working capital, would be met by the
State. However, an understanding has been reached that any undisbursed loan
portion as a result of cost savings would be used to finance part of interest
during construction on the Bank loan. Budgetary advances totalling lei 1,790
million will be channeled through the Investment Bank and the National Bank 2/
and will cover all lei expenditures (including financial charges during con-
struction) that are required for the Otelinox project for the items not fi-
nanced by the Bank loan; it would also cover a deficit of lei 99.5 million
in the first year of Otelinox's operation.
1/ The overall effects of a forthcoming revision of prices, the extent and
direction of which are not yet known by the Bank, may cancel out on bal-
ance. No revision of prices of local goods required for the project is
expected to take place before orders will be placed concerning the proj-
ect. Romanian practice is to keep producer prices fixed for relatively
long periods (see the Economic Report on Romania, pp. 5-7).
2/ Only advances for working capital are channeled through the National
Bank.

Lending Terms
43.       The proposed loan to the Investment Bank would be guaranteed by the
Government and would be for a term of 15 years including 5 years of grace at
an interest rate of 7.25 percent per annum. In accordance with the financing
mechanism for projects in Romania, which is described in detail in Annex 5-3
of the Appraisal Report, the Investment Bank would not actually relend the
Bank loan to the enterprise. However, the enterprise would be the beneficiary
of the Bank loan and the cost of the loan to the enterprise, inc'Ludinig a guar-
antee fee of 1-3/4 percent, would be 9 percent per annum. The an.nual transfer
of funds to the State Budget and Investment Bank by the enterprise would be
sufficient to cover the lei equivalent of the debt service on the Bank loan
(Section 4.01 (h) of the Loan Agreement).
Financial Analysis
44.       Enterprises in Romania cannot determine their general level of pro-
fitability because production targets and the broad product mix are set in
the plan and both input and output prices are set by the central authorities.
Given the output target and these prices, the enterprise has a planned bene-
fit set each year which the enterprise may over- or under-fulfill depending
on the extent to which it meets the productivity and efficiency goals stipu-
lated in the pian.  Actual benefits are not a guide for future investments,
which are determined by the State. However, they are not irrelevant to the
financial analysis of an enterprise, because, since 1971, there has been an
attempt to increase the role of enterprise self-financing over the use of
State Budget funds.
45,       Moreover, any shortage of funds within a Romanian enterprise mnust
be covered by transfer payments through the respective Centrals, budgetary
allocations, and/or bank credits. In this context, standard financial indica-
tors, such as debt/equity ratios and debt service coverage hav7e limited signi-
ficance; however they are satisfactory except for the first year of operations.
As mentioned in para. 42 above, the funds to cover the entire investment fi-
nancing of the Otelinox project, part of which would represent the lei cost
of the foreign assets financed by the IBPD loan, will be provided from the
State Budget.  After commissioning, working capital will be financed by trans-
fers through the National Bank. After the first year of operations, internal
cash generation should be sufficient to cover all expenses including interest
on and principal of the IBRD loan. The project would provide for a suitable
financial return of about 13 percent, in constant value terms.
Audit
46.       Romania has a well developed system of internal and external audit-
ing primarily to ensure that the activities of enterprises conform to state
plans. Any deviations are brought to the attention of higher authorities.
The Steel Central, Ministry of Metallurgical Industries and the Ministry of
Finance periodically audit financial statements prepared by the enterprise,
and the Bank will receive annual audits of the enterprise and the Borrower



- 13 -
carried out by the Ministry of Finance (Section 6.01 (e) and (f) of the Loan
Agreement). This arrangement would adequately meet the Bank's information
requirements in this respect.
Procurement
47.       Procurement of the items to be financed by the proposed loan will
follow international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's pro-
curement guidelines. The major facilities for the project together with
engineering, know-how and technical assistance will be grouped in two large
single-responsibility contract packages - one for the cold mill and the other
for the bar mill. There will be a staged bidding procedure for these packages:
first, following prequalification, preliminary technical offers will be sub-
mitted, by consortia which are expected to be led by foreign suppliers, and
discussed at a pre-bid meeting to answer any technical and any other question
which the suppliers may have; second, firm technical proposals and separate
priced bids will be submitted followed by consultation and modification of
the technical bids to achieve reasonable uniformity among the final techni-
cal bids; and third (and only at this stage), will the original price bids
be opened accompanied, where necessary, by supplemental price bids to reflect
the technical changes (Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement). The Romanian equip-
ment which will not be included in a foreign bid but will form part of the
two mills and be covered by the performance guarantee of the consortium leader,
will be prescribed to all foreign bidders alike. IThile no Romanian supplier
is expected to be prequalified as consortium leader for either of the two
contracts, Romanian sub-suppliers for the bar mill package are possible. The
selected procedure is considered appropriate and efficient under the circum-
stances and consistent with Bank guidelines. The procedure to ask for firm
price bids represents a departure from previous Romanian practice which was
to procure by inviting tenders from selected manufacturers and then negotiat-
ing a supply contract. Civil construction, to be carried out by a specialized
Romanian construction firm, will not be part of the bid packages. Some addi-
tional specialized expertise may become necessary to assist the Romanian ex-
perts in the evaluation and comparison of the technical aspects of the bids
(including equipment selection) for the cold mill, the first of its kind in
Romania. A letter supplemental to the Loan Agreement to be delivered by the
Borrower will provide that consultants will be employed for this purpose
unless the Borrower and the Bank agree that such assistance is not needed.
Disbursements
48.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of total ex-
penditures under the two contracts and 100 percent of foreign expenditures
for the procurement consultants. This procedure has been selected also for
disbursements against expenditures under the bar mill contract; however, dis-
bursements would be limited by the loan amount which, as mentioned in para.
42 above, is sufficient only to finance about 65 percent of the total cost
of equipment imports and engineering, know-how and technical assistance for
the bar mill. The loan would become fully effective when the Romanian Council
of Ministers approves the main indicators of the technical and economic study
for the project as a whole. However, to permit early loan disbursements on



- 14 -
account of down payments under the two contract packages for the project, the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements may become effective if the Romanian Council of
Ministers authorizes the conclusion of one of the two contract packages (cf.
para. 47 above - Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of the Loan Agreement); however, dis-
bursements under either contract may not exceed $3 million equivalent, i.e.,
the estimated amount of down payment, until the Council has approved the main
indicators of the technical and economic study for the project as a whole
(see para. 4(b) of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement). Disbursements would
take place over five years from the end of 1974 through 1978. A schedule of
estimated disbursements is given in the Loan and Project Summary (Annex III).
Markets
49.       Otelinox's markets appear well assured.  Domestic consumption of
special steel, which grew at the rate of 23 percent per annum in 1965-70,
is planned to increase from 668,000 tons in 1970 to 2 million tons in 1980,
implying a yearly growth rate of 14 percent throughout the present decade.
Most of the major consumers of Otelinox's products, such as producers of
equipment for food processing, chemicals, agriculture and construction, as
well as producers of road vehicles, rolling stock, consumer durables, and
electrical equipment, are targeted to grow at rates in excess of 15 percent
per year during the 1970's. There will be only very limited competition
among special steel producers in Romania not only because their production
is fully planned but also because their product mix and dimensions largely
differ, with Otelinox concentrating on the smaller, and thus more difficult
to produce, dimensions of higher-grade steels. Prices for special steels
have been held fairly stable by government control at levels roughly com-
parable to world market prices for the total product mix. Given the state
trading monopoly, foreign imports will not be permitted at the expense of
unsold domestic production. Even if exports of stainless steel sheet and
strip products were not to materialize as predicted, the domestic market
should be able to absorb most if not all of the excess.
Environment
50.       Otelinox, being basically a rolling operation, presents fewer eco-
logical hazards than an integrated steel plant. The enterprise will arrange
to neutralize acids released by pickling in a special facility and to remove
oil, grease, suspended solids and scale from liquid effluents prior to dump-
ing. Since the final selection of the processes for the project has not yet
been made, the possible ecological hazards are not yet known exactly.  However,
enviromental factors are covered by rather strict and detailed legislation in
Romania at the present time and Otelinox would fully comply with this legis-
lation. Moreover, the Borrower has agreed specifically that the project will
include facilities adequate to protect the plant's environment from potentially
harmful effects of the operation of the plant and that the facilities estab-
lished under the project will be operated with due regard to ecological and
environmental factors (Part A3 of Schedule 2 to, and Section 4.01 (a) of the
Loan Agreement).

Labor Force
51.       At full capacity, the Otelinox project is expected to utilize more
than 1600 employees. The recruitment plan has been worked out in detail, re-
quiring about 750 graduates of technical and secondary schools, 300 transfers
from existing steel plants, 342 craftsmen transferred from various industries
and 200 plant trainees.
Justification
52.       The economic rate of return for the total project would exceed 14
percent. The calculation of basic raw material costs and the value of final
output is based on world market prices in 1973. Operating cost estimates are
converted from lei into dollars at the rate of US$1 = lei 20 (see para. 2
above). Even under foreseeable adverse conditions the rate of return exceeds
12 percent while it would be 18 percent if a conversion rate of US$1 = lei 25
was used.
53.       The project is inportant for the rapid development of Romanian in-
dustry and well in line with the Government's policy both of reducing import
dependence and of quality improvement and technical innovation in production.
Limited foreign exchange resources would not permit the importation of all
high-grade raw materials necessary for the construction of a wide range of
equipment, machinery, electrical devices, road vehicles, and other facilities.
Without this equipment, many other industries such as food processing, chemis-
try, paper, and agriculture could not continue their rapid growth.
54.       The provision of up-to-date technology, equipment and technical ex-
pertise will enable Romania to embark on some industrial processes hitherto
not undertaken in the country. The Romanian labor force is well-trained and
experienced and the domestic supply of appropriate raw materials is assured.
The demand could very well exceed supply during the rest of this decade in
the international market for steel products in general, with the possible
exception of stainless steel, Tirgoviste is an acceptable location, being
near most of the future customers and the suppliers of billets for the bar
mill while relatively low tonnages of the higher valued hot-rolled band to
be used in the cold mill would be transported 270 kilometers. The net for-
eign exchange savings resulting from the project would be about US$60 million
per year after the project achieves full production in 1980.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Investment Bank
of Romania, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist Republic of
Romania and the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The special features of the loan documents are described above.

56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
