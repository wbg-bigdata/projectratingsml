STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Tli. Transport System
1.01     Yugoslavia has an extensive and diversified  transport  system,  of
which roads and railways are the backbone, carrying respectively, about 70%
and  20%  of  the  total  traffic.   The  transport  network  comprises  about
110,000 km of roads, 9,400 km of rail lines, 7 main ports, 15 airports (of
which 10 handle international flights) and a sizable network of inland (the
main one being the Danube) and coastal waterways.  Pipelines have come into
increasing use in recent years. Yugoslavia borders seven countries (see Map
IBRD 13136R) and has extensive access to the Adriatic; it is thus an impor-
tant crossroads for European traffic, including traffic to the Middle East.
Its transport system has traditionally provided sea access for central
European countries and has become of major importance for international
tourism.
1.02     Over the past  two decades,  Yugoslavia  has enjoyed  an impressive
record of economic development on a par with other southern European market
economies, though it has also experienced economic difficulties from time to
time, as at present.  During the seventies, the growth rate in gross mate-
rial product I/ rose to nearly 7% per annum.  Per capita incomes have more
than tripled since the mid-1950s, and absolute poverty has been eradicated.
A major force behind this rapid economic development has been the signifi-
cant growth of industry  and  services.   Increasing  economic  activity  and
personal incomes led to a rapid growth in transport demand.   Between 1960
and 1980, total freight traffic grew in the public transport system at about
5% per annum and total passenger traffic (including private car transport)
by about 6% per annum as indicated below.  However, since 1980, GMP growth
has only been at about 1.5% per year and overall freight and passenger traf-
fic growth has slackened to about 3% and 1%, respectively.
1/  Gross  Material  Product   (GMP)  or  Social  Product  excludes   'non-
productive' (in Yugoslav terminology) services such as education,
health,  administration,  defense  and  other  public  services.   Gross
Domestic    Product    is    approximately    14%    higher    than    GMP.

-3-
1.03     During the 1970s, freight traffic (ton-km) on railways increased by
about 2.6% per annum compared to an increase of about 12% per annum on high-
ways, while passenger traffic on railways remained practically unchanged in
contrast with an increase of about 8% per annum on highways.  As a result,
road  transport has replaced rail  transport as  the doninant carrier.   The
railways, however, continue to play a crucial role as  ae main carrier of
bulk materials needed by key industries, as well as the carrier of just
under one-half of total freight in the public transport sector, and an esti-
mated 35% of all domestic freight transport (including own-account trucking
¾w non-transport companies).  River transport has retained an important and
competitive place,  carrying about 9% of total freight traffic.  The ports
have more than doubled their cargo handling since the early 1960s and cur-
rently handle more than 25 million tons per annum.
104     Although  continuing  to  carry  a declining  share  of  traffic,  the
position of the railways has improved somewhat in recent years.  During the
period 1976-80, railway freight traffic grew at 4.5% per year compared to
only  1.4%  during  the  period  1970-76.   This  upward  trend  reflected  the
Government emphasis since the beginning of the 1976-80 plan on the develop-
ment of a more efficient and competitive railway system, a policy which
followed from the energy crisis and the railways' lesser reliance than road
transport on imported fuel.  During the same period,  the competitive posi-
tion of the railway was enhanced by steep increases in oil prices, the lat-
ter generally reflecting world market prices, and by physical shortages of
gasoline and diesel fuel for road transport.
1.05     Total  freight  traffic  growth has  slackened  substantially  in  the
past two years as a result of the recent slump in the economy. However, the
slump has been felt mainly by road transport where freight traffic growth
has come down from an average 12% per year during the period 1970-80 to less
than 3% between 1980 and 1981. Current indications are that the economy can
only be expected to improve very slowly through the remainder of the current
mid-term plan (1981-85).  The latest forecasts  indicate an average growth
rate of 1.5% per year for industrial output through 1985 which implies a 2%
per year increase for the commodities carried by rail. This would result in
a somewhat higher rate of increase for rail freight which is made up essen-
tially of long distance bulk traffic.   In addition,  further impetus is now
likely due to the introduction in October 1982 of fuel rationing for road
transport.  These restrictions have confirmed the physical shortage of fuel
felt throughout 1982 by Government measures aiming at a 20% reduction in
gasoline consumption, a 15% reduction in diesel fuel allocations for own-
account road transport and a 10% reduction for public transport companies.
However, the restrictions are expected to be lifted when the foreign
exchange position eases and the Bank is urging their removal at the earliest
opportunity. On balance, therefore, the Government expects that rail freight
traffic will increase during the current mid-term plan (1981-85) at about 3%
per year, followed by a slightly lower rate of between 2% and 3% per year in
the longer term.
1.06     Although rail passenger traffic has stagnated over the past decade,
it increased at 1% in 1981 compared to only 0.3% for road transport.  More-
over, provisional figures for 1982 show that rail passenger traffic has been



-4-
boosted by some 6 to 7% due to fuel  shortages  for road  transport.   The
Government expects rail passenger traffic to continue increasing at at least
2% per year through 1985, with the rate of increase returning to a more nor-
mal level of around 1% in the longer term.
1.07     Despite lower growth forecasts for transport demand,  increases in
capacity are still required to meet existing demand over many parts of the
primary transport system.   Modernization and strengthening of the railway
system is a major priority in the transport sector.  Emphasis is also being
given to improvements of key links in the primary road network, including
many sections of the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH), the country's principal
road artery and a major transit route between Europe and the Middle East.
The corridor shared by TYH and the main railway route, spanning Yugoslavia
from the Italian and Austrian borders in the northwest to Bulgaria and
Greece in the southeast, provides the backbone to the Yugoslav economy and
directly serves the main centers of population and economic activity.  Pre-
sent traffic volumes in this corridor range from 80 to 100 trains per day on
the railway and some 12,000 to 20,000 vehicles per day on the road. Although
high priority is given to TYH, attention is also being paid to completing
the primary highway network in the less developed regions of the country.
The Bank is preparing, in addition to the proposed railway project, a pro-
ject which supports these basic needs in the highway sector.
B. Transport Policy, Planning and Implementation
1.08     Since the mid-1960s, the Yugoslav economic system has been increas-
ingly characterized by decentralization of decision-making with enterprises
operating under workers' management in a market-oriented economy. Principal
governmental responsibility for transport was transferred during the late
1960s from Federal to Republican and Provincial authorities.   The Federal
Secretariat for Transport was replaced in 1975 by a Federal Committee, whose
President and Vice-President are Federal officials, and whose other members
are the Republican and Provincial officials responsible for transport. This
committee has a largely coordinating function. Much of governmental respon-
sibility has been transferred to Communities of Interest (COIs), which
consist of representatives of one or more transport enterprises and their
users;  normally,  a COI covers  only one  Republic  or Province.   Transport
enterprises, including the railways, are generally constituted as associa-
tions of Basic Organizations of Associated Labor (BOALs), each consisting
typically of a few hundred workers.   The BOALs are the prime sources of
authority in the enterprise and enjoy a large measure of autonomy.
1.09     The transfer of authority to the grass roots agencies and transport
organizations has increased the number of decision-making bodies, and has
made country wide transport planning and coordination more difficult.   In
supporting transport infrastructure development, the Bank has emphasized the
need for improving coordination between sub-sectors at regional and national
levels as well as the need for developing adequate institutions and an appro-
priate policy framework.  At  the national  level,  the Bank encouraged and
supported the establishment and strengthening of important planning and
coordinating institutions.   Notable among these are the Federal Committee



-5-
for Transport and Communications, which oversees the total transport picture
in Yugoslavia, the Council of Republican and Provincial Roads Organizations
(CRO), which deals with nationwide standardization of engineering and design
criteria in the highway sub-sector, as well as other matters such as highway
safety, and the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) which deals with over-
all issues of the railways.
1.10     The Government has long recognized the importance of the transport
sector in the growth of the economy and in achieving balanced regional
development.  Tne sector has, therefore, been an area of major investment,
not only to meet domestic market needs, but to improve the country's own
integration and its integration with the rest of Europe.  The main objec-
tives in the sector, as formalized in the Social Agreement on Transport
Policy, are: (a) to provide appropriate transport infrastructure to support
the development of the economy; (b) to integrate the various modes of trans-
port in such proportions and combinations as to meet total demand at minimum
economic costs; (c) to open up less-developed regions and foster regional
and economic integration; (d) to provide adequate connections with neighbor-
ing countries; and (e) to rationalize the use of energy in transport and to
reduce the negative effects of transport on the environment. The Bank Group
has generally supported the Government's objectives in the sector through
its active role in strengthening the transport system with loans for high-
ways,  railways and ports.   Bank-financed  transport projects have provided
support for growth in industry and agriculture, for regional development and
for export expansion.
1.11     Tnere  is relatively  free  entry  into  the  transport  market which
functions without any significant problems.  The current rationing of fuel
for road transport is considered to be a temporary measure and will be
lifted as soon as possible.   In addition,  two issues are currently being
addressed in order to permit full competition based on cost-based pricing:
(a) the railway compensation system, by which part of the railway cost is
met indirectly by COIs (though predominantly railway users) instead of full
cost recovery by tariffs, and (b) the adequacy of road-user charges, particu-
larly those imposed on heavy trucks which compete with the railways. Railway
compensation and the introduction of a rail costing system are discussed in
more detail  in Chapter II.   Regarding user charges  on road  transport,  a
recent study undertaken under Section 3.04(b) of the Guarantee Agreement for
the Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU) shows that for 1980, overall road
user revenues covered all maintenance expenditures and contributed 20%
towards investments.  However, as expenditures on roads in 1980 were rela-
tively high, it can be considered that in a normal year user revenues would
adequately cover expenditures on the road network.   The study also shows
that for a realistic level of road expenditures, there is no evidence that
heavy trucks are not paying their full share of road costs.  The main issue
in the financing of road expenditures is that only about one-half of total
road user revenues are ea-rmarked for roads, a situation which has contri-
buted to recent funding difficulties for on-going projects.  This issue is
being discussed with the Government with a view to firming up a realistic
program of expenditures on road infrastructure as well as identifying sources
of finance.

C. Previous Bank Projects
1.12     So far,  the Bank has made  23 loans  for  the Yugoslav  transport
sector,  totalling  US$1,248 million  equivalent.   These  include  six  loans
totalling US$382 million for the railway sub-sector; five of these were for
investments on modernization and one loan was for the construction of the
Belgrade-Bar line. An additional loan for US$14 million was made for recon-
struction following the 1979 earthquake in Montenegro. The proposed project
which focuses on modernization investments in four of the eight Railway
Transport Organizations (RTOs) (Novi Sad, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Skopje) would
in fact be the eighth railway project (see also paras. 2.33 to 2.37).
1.13     In the highway sub-sector, eleven loans have been made totalling
USt629 million. An additional loan of US$21 million was made for rehabili-
tation following the 1979 earthquake in Montenegro.   The main emphasis in
highways has been on improvements of key links in the primary road network,
including many sections of the TYH, the country's principal transport artery.
The Draft Completion Report for the Seventh and Eighth Highway Projects has
indicated that Bank lending has also enabled the Yugoslav authorities to
introduce and establish on a systematic basis the major administrative func-
tions such as planning, project preparation and evaluation as well as pro-
grams for improving highway safety.  Recently, highway lending in the less
developed regions has been within a broader sector type of lending, an
approach which has provided greater flexibility in adjusting to the current
lower level of expenditures on roads.   The thrust of future Bank lending
will be to continue to focus on eliminating bottlenecks on TYH while at the
same time providing assistance to some less developed areas for improvements
in their primary highway networks.
1.14     In the ports sub-sector, a loan of US$44 million was made for the
Port of Bar in Montenegro. This project was nearing completion in 1979 when
the port was severely damaged by the 1979 earthquake. Rehabilitation is now
underway with a loan of US$50 million.  A ports sub-sector survey has been
carried out with the Bank's encouragement. The study was conducted by local
consultants financed by the Yugoslav Association of Seaports and has indi-
cated priorities for future port development in the country.
1.15     The Bank has also made two loans for pipeline projects (US$108 million).
After some delays due to procedural and other implementation difficulties, one
of these projects has been completed successfully and the other is expected
to complete early in 1984.
II. THE RAILWAYS
A. General
2.01     The railways in Yugoslavia are organized along the basic pattern of
the economic system, with eight separate and independent RTOs each serving a
republic or province, each named after its capital city, and together forming
a rail network of 9,393 km.  The four RTOs participating in the proposed pro-
ject are Belgrade, Novi Sad, Sarajevo and Skopje serving respectively Serbia,



-7-
Vojvodina, Bosnia-Herzogovina and Macedonia, the last two of which are less
developed  republics.   These  four  RTOs  together  have  a  route  length  of
5,058 km and, in 1981, carried 51% in volume of the country's rail traffic.
They vary considerably in size, the largest of the four being RTO Belgrade
with a route length of 1,889 km and carrying 21% of total railway traffic,
the smallest being RTO Skopje, with a route length of 673 km carrying only
3% of total traffic (Annex 1, Table 1.1).  About 80% by volume of freight
traffic is in bulk commodities, traffic density being highest in RTO Sarajevo
serving heavy industries centered round the Zenica Mining and Metallurgical
Combine (Table 7).  Traffic growth Ior the railway system as a whole over
the period 1976-80, has averaged 4.5% per year for freight traffic and 1.2%
per year for passenger traffic (Table 6).
B. Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR)
2.02     Three-quarters  of  rail  freight  traffic  in  Yugoslavia  is  inter-
enterprise  so  that  operations  are  highly  interdependent.   RTOs  have,  by
federal law, established the CYR, in effect an agency of the RTOs, which
serves as a forum for common decisions and as an executing agency for joint
operations  (e.g. timetables, wagon utilization,  revenue distribution).   It
is directly responsible to the Federal Government for safety on the railways
as well as for overall investment planning and for all international aspects
of railway operation--including international timetables, joint planning and
international financial settlements.   It has a well-qualified  professional
staff and represents RTOs at federal and international levels.  It also pro-
vides  technical  aid  and  advice,  particularly  to  the  smaller  and  less-
developed RTOs, including assistance with technical and economic studies and
preparation of investment plans.
2.03     CYR fulfills a very useful planning and coordinating  function and
was the borrower for the Bank's Fourth and Fifth Railway loans, with respon-
sibility for reporting on the projects and coordinating technical assistance.
CYR will have an important role in the present project in rendering technical
assistance to the RTOs, coordinating procurement, loan administration and
reporting, and will be a signatory to the Loan Agreement.
C. Communities of Interest (COI)
2.04     Many areas of economic and social activity in Yugoslavia have orga-
nizations known as COI comprising the users and suppliers of particular ser-
vices. Thus, each republic and province has a COI for railway transport in
which actual or potential freight user groups are represented.   Membership
is usually obligatory unless it can be shown that railway transport is of no
or marginal significance.   The interests of passengers are represented by
the Republican government. The COI's role is to link the RTO and its manage-
ment with the wider economy and society that the railway serves.  This is
done, among other ways, by monitoring the operating and financial perfor-
mance of the RTO and the quality of service provided to the public.   This
oversight function derives from the fact that in the Yugoslav system the COI
are above both the market mechanism and the state as regulators of economic
activities.   Thus,  the COI make rail policy,  planning and financing deci-
sions of a type that in most other countries would be taken by the central



-8-
government as the owner of the railways.  The COI, for example, make recom-
mendations for tariff levels, examine and agree on rail investment programs,
on what the financing arrangements for them will be, and how the RTOs operat-
ing deficits are to be covered.  The law is for the members of the COI to
raise a levy on themselves to fill the gap between tariff-generated revenues
and operating expenses caused by the federal/republic governments denying or
partially approving RTO tariff increase requests, or to finance particular
investment projects or to service outstanding debts.  The proceeds of this
levy are paid by the COI directly and monthly to the RTO and are called com-
pensation payments.  In 1981 compensation payments reached a total of about
U.S.$450 million equivalent (Annex 3).
2.05     The COI involvement  in investment  and  financing  decisions  leads
them also into considering productivity, service quality, and traffic fore-
casting aspects of RTO operations.  Thus, in some ways, they both complement
and, in other ways, substitute for commercial judgments and decisions by
railway managers.  The COI are also important in easing problems associated
with structural change in the railway system.   In Bosnia-Herzegovina,  for
example, the COI played a major part in the process of closing uneconomic
lines and passenger services, and in retraining and facilitating the employ-
ment elsewhere of staff made redundant.
D. Rail Tariffs and Compensation
2.06     Freight tariffs in Yugoslavia are approved by the Federal Government
and are uniform for the whole  railway system 1/.  Passenger  fares, which
are approved for each RTO by Republican and Provincial authorities, tend also
to be maintained at uniform levels.  Rail tariff and compensation (or sub-
sidy) policies in Yugoslavia have changed significantly since the 1970s.
Previously, average tariff levels were usually at or about average operating
costs. Operating deficits were generally small and confined to the marginal
rail enterprises, although capital investment was subsidized in various ways.
From the mid-70s onwards, rail costs rose rapidly as a result of higher oil
prices, growing inflation, more expensive imported equipment as the exchange
rate declined, and wage/labor policies that had objectives other than rail-
way efficiency and viability.  The Federal price control authorities, how-
ever, as part of the Government's anti-inflation policy, did not permit rail
tariffs to be increased in line with the higher costs or general price level.
As a consequence, rail freight tariffs declined between 1974-81 in real terms
by 27% and passenger fares by 17% and operating deficits, which in earlier
years were only a few percent of total rail revenues, reached about 28% or
the equivalent of US$450 million in 1981. (See also Annex 3 with Table.)
2.07     These deficits have to be covered by subsidies or compensation pay-
ments from the Republican/Provincial COIs which have evolved different sys-
tems. In some cases, it is a standard percentage levy on the incomes of all
1/ A system of coefficients used for revenue apportionment between the
RTOs recompenses the smaller RTOs partially for higher costs while
still enabling a common tariff book to be presented to customers.



-9-.
enterprises.   In others  (e.g. Croatia), a highly differentiated  system is
used that reflects the nature and value of the output or services produced
by the enterprises making up the COI.  The previous system of ex-post pay-
ments has been abandoned in favor of one where agreement is reached with the
particular railway in advance of the operating year.  Under this process the
COI, Republic and Provincial governments and the railway enterprises agree
about various operating assumptions, proposed investments, expected output
and service levels and so on.  This is a more rational process and avoids
some of the difficulties found in railway subsidization schemes used in other
countries.  The actual and potential users of railway services have to face
the issues of how much and in what way to compensate the railways mainly for
revenues foregone as a result of policy decisions. The railways are, there-
fore, under direct pressure to reduce cost, improve service and avoid exce..
capacity. Advance knowledge of the compensation payments (i.e. non-operating
revenues) they can expect assists the railways to plan and start projects.
2.08     An important factor in the total amount of compensation payments is
that enterprises in the Yugoslav socio-economic system are expected to retain
surplus workers until alternative, work becomes available and to pay them at
least a minimum wage.  As a result, programs for railway staff redeployment
and/or reductions have generally been based on natural attrition, early
retirement schemes, and staff retraining.  Major staff reductions would not
be possible, especially at the present time, since unemployment has been
rising and is widespread following the slow-down in economic growth and the
return of many Yugoslav workers from Western Europe.  Under these circum-
stances, at least part of the compensation payments could be considered as a
form of unemployment compensation being funded by the rest of society
although this is not an explicitly stated objective.
2.09     However,  the conclusions of recent reviews and  investigations by
the authorities into railway tariff and compensation payment systems are
that:
(i) rail tariffs, in accordance with the basic principle for deter-
mining all other prices, should be based on cost;
(ii) compensation payment is inconsistent with this general pricing
principle;
(iii) compensation payment levels are becoming onerous burdens on the
other enterprises which themselves are having to adjust to dif-
ficult economic conditions; and
(iv) compensation payment involves hidden cross-subsidies among commodi-
ties, routes and enterprises with demand distorting consequences.
2.10     Following these re-examinations the authorities have taken the fol-
lowing steps:



-10-
(i) preparation of a new Compact on Tariffs between the various
Republican-Provincial authorities and railways which is shortly
expected to be finalized and which provides that, as a general
principle, railway tariffs should reflect costs;
(ii) approval of tariff increases of 17% for freight and 15% for pas-
senger traffic in March 1982 at a time when inflation for the year
was expected to be 15%, implying the intention to increase tariffs
in real terms;
(iii) approval of further tariff increases for both freight and revenue
of 17% from December 25, 1982 and 15% from February 5, 1983 to com-
pensate for higher than anticipated inflation; and
(iv) given a commitment in the draft Letter of Development Policy for
the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) to increase railway
tariffs in real terms with the aim of eliminating compensation
payments.
2.11     A number of measures have been taken by the Federal and/or Repub-
lican authorities that should benefit the financial position of the railways
and lessen the demands for compensation. These include:
(i) the mandatory loading and unloading of freight wagons on Saturdays
and Sundays--a measure which should reduce wagon turn-around time
considerably and allow the railways to reduce their foreign exchange
payments to neighboring country railways for wagon rentals;
(ii) the adoption of a nationwide incomes policy under which labor costs
(including those on the railway) will not increase as fast as the
inflation expected in 1983; and
(iii) strong pressures on the railways to rationalize operations, reduce
cost, time and size investments better, and improve service quality
and marketing efforts so as to attract traffic from other modes.
The authorities have taken two other steps which, while they might benefit
railway finances, risk misallocating transport sector resources through
failing to set correct price signals. These are: (a) gasoline rationing and
the restricting of bus services on some long-distance routes; and (b) heavy
pressure on production enterprises to use rail in preference to road trans-
port either by the enterprise's own vehicles or public road carriers. These
are short-term measures forced by physical shortages of fuel, tires and spare
parts resulting from the limited allocation of foreign exchange for these
purposes and are expected to be lifted when the foreign exchange situation
eases.  The Bank is urging that these restrictions should be ended at an
early date (para. 1.05)
2.12     The Bank, while recognizing that the system of compensation pay-
ments avoids certain of the disadvantages of subsidies, considers that,
since the amouunt of an organization's contribution does not vary with its
use of the railway system, the inherent cross-subsidizations distort pricing



-11-
policies.  The Bank has, therefore, strongly supported the early introduc-
tion of better railway costing (para. 2.28),  and cost-based tariffs.   The
Government has now agreed a program of rail price increases that is aimed at
eliminating compensation payments at all RTOs in a phased approach which
recognizes the different economic and social circumstances of the different
RTOs (see para. 5.06 and Annex 3).
E. Organization, Management and Staff
(a) Organization
2.13     Each RTO is a working organization consisting of a number of Basic
Organizations of Associated Labor (BOALs) and a Working Community.   BOALs
engaged purely on railway transport functions must by law join together in
the RTO and include, for example, those responsible for traffic, operations,
current maintenance of fixed installations, maintenance of traction and roll-
ing stock and track overhaul of lines. Other BOALs covering activities only
partly related to the railways have a looser form of association with the
RTO. The number of BOALs varies between the RTOs. As an example, the struc-
ture of the RTO Novi Sad is shown in Chart Cl.  The Working Community func-
tions as the headquarters of the RTO.  In particular, it is responsible for
coordinating the work of the BOALs as well as for overall direction and
management, planning, finance, marketing, personnel and administration.
Chart C2 shows the structure of the Working Community at RTO Novi Sad.
(b) Management
2.14     Each RTO is headed by a Director General, who is assisted by one or
more deputies.  Directors of departments report through Assistant Directors
General (Chart C2).  Each RTO and each of the BOALs has a workers' council,
which decides on matters of policy and development as well as the appoint-
ments of senior management.   Management  is ultimately  responsible  to the
councils, which may meet once or twice a month or more frequently where
necessary. Management and decision-making are complex processes with exten-
sive  interactions  between management  and workers'  councils.   Management,
which has always been technically competent in traditional railway disci-
plines, has been strengthened in planning and marketing during recent years.
CYR, with its responsibility to the Federal Government for overall railway
planning, assists RTOs in this respect.
2.15     Traditionally,  responsibility  for executing  investments  was  dis-
persed among specialized BOALs, whose activities were coordinated by central
service departments.  However, the concept of project management was intro--
duced to the railways under the Fourth Railway Project and extended under
the Fifth. Under this concept, certain interdependent works such as electri-
fication, signalling and telecommunications and track overhaul on a section
of line were grouped into projects, with an appointed officer for each
project responsible for its execution in accordance with agreed specifica-
tions, budget and time schedules. Although the RTOs were initially short of
suitable staff, a satisfactory number of staff is now available. Since this
type of project management has given satisfactory results, an assurance has
been obtained that the RTOs: (a) will continue the system of project manage-
ment; and (b) will appoint project managers as needed to implement the list
of works, as agreed from time to time between the RTOs and the Bank.



-12-
(c) Staff
2.16     Between  1976 and  1981 the- four RTOs  reduced  staff  by  9,415  to
58,105, mainly due to re-organization and to closure of 553 km of uneconomic
lines.  Despite the increase in traffic which is forecast, requiring more
staff in certain sections, the RTOs intend to achieve a further overall net
reduction of 1,016 staff by 1986.  Reductions will come chiefly as a result
of the installation of modern signalling equipment and also from track over-
haul where new long-welded rails and mechanical equipment will give rise to
manpower savings.  The staffing and targeted savings are shown in manpower
plans for each RTO, which are subject to annual review.  Productivity, mea-
sured as traffic units per employee, is forecast to increase by 18% over the
period  1981-86.   Staff  numbers  and  productivity  forecasts  are  shown  in
Tables 4 and 5.  Assurance was obtained at negotiations that, as part of
their Action Plans, the RTOs will undertake to achieve their agreed manpower
targets.
F. Railway Facilities
(a) Network
2.17     In 1981  there were  9,393 km of  railway  in Yugoslavia  (See Map
IBRD 16460), 100% standard gauge, of which 891 km or 9.5% were double track
and with 3,320 km or 35.4% of the network electrified.  The networks of the
four RTOs comprised:
Of which were electrified:
Kmn                  Km
RTO Belgrade       1889             897   or   47%
RTO Novi Sad       1463             223   or   15%
RTO Sarajevo       1033             640   or   62%
RTO Skopje          673              60   or    9%
TOTAL          5058            1820
2.18     Despite considerable progress in improving track conditions on main
lines- the four RTOs, during 1978-81, rehabilitated about 540 km of track-
many sections on these lines are in need of overhaul and subject to severe
speed limits.  These restrictions cause high operating costs; the proposed
project would improve track conditions to reduce these costs.
2.19     Most of Yugoslav railways' main trunk lines, carrying over 60% of
total gross ton kilometres, are now electrified and have been equipped with
modern signalling and telecommunications.  Many of the secondary lines have
no modern signalling system however and are equipped with old and obsolete
mechanical  systems which are difficult to repair.   To improve safety and
operational efficiency, the proposed project provides for installation of
modern equipment on some of these lines.



-13-
(b) Traction and Rolling Stock
2.20     At the end of 1980, the four RTOs: Belgrade, Novi Sad, Sarajevo and
Skopje, had together 248 electric, 335 diesel and 137 steam locomotives,
about one-half of the diesels being shunting locomotives. All electric loco-
motives have been procured in the previous 15 years, but availability should
be improved and this problem is being addressed by means of a consultants'
study carried out under the Fifth Project (para. 2.30).  About one-third of
the diesel locomotives are more than 15 years old.  It is planned that the
steam locomotives will be withdrawn before the end of the planning period,
1981-86.
2.21     One of the main operational problems of Yugoslav railways in receLaL
years has been that procurement of new freight wagons has been insufficient
to keep up with rapidly growing traffic.  As a result, the RTOs have been
forced to hire foreign wagons to meet their operational needs and have been
unable to carry all offered traffic.  The freight wagon fleet of the four
RTOs at the beginning of 1981 comprised about 24,500 wagons, about 10,500 of
them being of four-axle type.   About a third of this fleet was procured
before 1950. The withdrawal of about 3,350 wagons within the planning period
will allow the on-going modernization of the freight wagon fleet to continue.
2.22     An analysis of the traction and rolling stock fleet of all four RTOs
is given in Annex 1, Table 1.2.
(c) Operations
2.23     Since most of the main lines have already been electrified,  the
share of total traffic (gross/ton km) hauled by electric traction is already
high for RTO Belgrade (72% in 1981) and' Sarajevo (71% in 1981) and growing
in all four RTO regions (Annex 1, Table 1.1).  It will rise considerably in
RTO Skopje after completion of the electrification of the Skopje-Gevgelija
main line before the end of the planning period.
2.24     Inadequate maintenance facilities and operational difficulties due
to construction works on lines and junctions cause efficiency figures to be
lower than desirable. These should improve as a result of the proposed pro-
ject. The productivity of passenger and freight rolling stock in RTO Skopje
is lower than in the other RTOs because of the marginal market in this region
due to the low density of its population and industry and the uneven balance
of traffic flow.  In general, actual figures on rolling stock use as well as
the  targets  are  satisfactory  and  show a  clear  tendency  towards  further
improvement.
(d) Procurement of New Stock, Withdrawal and Efficiency
2.25     The procurement of new traction and rolling stock under the Invest-
ment Plans is justified by comprehensive and detailed Operational Plans,
covering forecast traffic growth, productivity targets, and proper with-
drawal plans of old uneconomic units.  These Plans emphasize the necessity
to improve operational efficiency by making better use of the existing trac-
tion and wagon fleet as opposed to investment in new equipment.



-14-
G. Uneconomic Lines
2.26     Tie four RTOs have closed 2,075 km of uneconomic lines since 1965,
including 553 km in the last four years.  The economic assessment of lines
is now an annual process and is carried out according to a methodology for-
mulated  by CYR with advice from the Bank.   The assessment is subject to
review by the COI. At present, 267 km of track are closed to public service,
but still receive minimum maintenance; a decision regarding eventual closure
and recovery of the rails will be made next year. A further 202 km of track
are used only during harvest time and as shunting tracks, pending a further
review of their use later this year.  The closure of uneconomic lines will
be reviewed annually as part of the annual review of the RTOs Action Plans.
R. On-going Railway Related Studies
2.27     The status of three on-going studies from previous projects is out-
lined in the following paragraphs.
(a) Railway Costing Study
2.28     The purpose of the study, which formed part of the Eighth Highway
Project (Loan 1377-YU), was to formulate a uniform costing system for all
RTOs and to make available to railway management the data needed for the
continuous analysis, comparison and control of costs and to provide the basis
for deternining freight rates and passenger fares and for a comparison of
costs with different transport modes.  The study was carried out by Yugoslav
consultants and was completed in 1979, but a consensus by all RTOs on this
complex and critical matter was only reached in 1982.  A contract was signed
in May 1982 between the CYR and the consultants to introduce and test the
system at RTO Belgrade.   The system is to be tested and installed in RTO
Belgrade during 1983 to be followed, if satisfactory, by implementation at
the other RTOs in 1984.
(b) Study of Economic and Technical Criteria for Signalling on
Secondary Lines
2.29     The contract for the study, which formed part of the Fifth Railway
Project (Loan 1534-YU), was awarded in June 1981 to Yugoslav consultants.
The study has been carried out and, after consideration by the CYR commis-
sion, certain sections are presently being reworked and supplemented.   The
final report is due in the first half of 1983.
(c) Electric Locomotive Maintenance Study
2.30     The study formed part of the Fifth Railway Project (Loan 1534-YU)
and is being carried out by Deutsche Eisenbahn Consulting GmbH (DECONSULT)
in association with Jugoslaviaprojekt. DECONSULT started work in Yugoslavia
in June 1981 but difficulties arose, particularly in gaining access to work-
shops and depots.   These difficulties have now been resolved and a final
report is expected in the second half of 1983.



-15-
I. Accounts and Audit
2.31     Railway  Accounts  are kept  separately  by  each  RTO on a uniform
Government prescribed basis.  The accounts are kept to a good standard with
extensive use of computers.  As a result of the Bank's requirements,  cash
flow analysis has come to play an important role in the ..TOs accounting pro-
cesses. Fixed assets are subject to an annual revaluation, based on replace-
ment costs, using coefficients obtained from price indices of the Federal
Institute of Statistics.  Book values of fixed assets are thus maintained at
realistic levels and depreciation plays a proper role in funds generation.
The Government's awareness of the importance of depreciation in ensuring an
adequate generation of internal funds is evidenced by a Federal law of
December 1981 which increased depreciation rates for the various categories
of railway fixed assets.
2.32     The accounts of each RTO and of each BOAL are subject to audit by
the Social Accounting Service (SDK) which verifies their accuracy in consid-
erable detail and ensures that they are properly kept in accordance with the
prescribed accounting code.   Since SDK has not so far had the capacity to
perform an audit of the type normally required by the Bank, for an organiza-
tion as large as the railways, it has reported in respect of each RTO with a
more  limited annual audit certificate.   However,  SDK's  capacity has  been
strengthened through a Bank sponsored training scheme and it is expanding
the scope of its audit of the RTOs.  An assurance was obtained at negotia-
tions that the RTOs will continue to have their accounts audited in accor-
dance with sound auditing principles consistently applied by SDK, or another
competent and experienced independent auditing organization, and that the
certified accounts together with the auditors' reports will be submitted to
the Bank within eight months of the end of each year.
J. Previous Railway Projects
2.33     The  Bank  has  made  seven  loans  to  Yugoslav  Railways  totalling
US0396 million during 1963-81 (Annex 2).  The Fourth Project (Loan 1026-YU;
July 1974; US$93 million) financed the completion of investments from an
earlier modernization program as well as related investments needed to maxi-
mize benefits.   The  investments,  which were complex,  were delayed  for a
while by anti-inflationary measures taken by the central government which
limited investment funds, but works were successfully completed and the loan
was fully disbursed and closed in June 1981.
2.34     The  Fifth  Project  (Loan 1534-YU;  April   1978;   US$100 million)
included works in all RTOs and assisted track overhaul and electrification
as part of the railways 1976-80 investment plans as well as technical assis-
tance and training.  Physical progress with the project has been satisfac-
tory, the loan is 98% disbursed and is expected to close with all works
completed, after a one-year extension, in June 1983.  Works have included:
1,285 km of track overhaul or reconstruction, 93 km of route converted from
single to double track,   314 km of route electrified,  53 km equipped with
modern electric signalling and 434 km equipped with automatic block equip-
ment.   These  improvements  have  been  reflected  in operational  results  as
follows.

2.35     Institution building features under the project included the exten-
sion of action plans for all RTOs and the extension of the system of project
management  introduced under  the Fourth Project.   While  physical  progress
under the Fifth Project has been satisfactory and operational efficiency has
improved, difficulties have arisen in relation to the financial covenants
which required the railways to reduce compensation payments and increase the
proportion of tariff revenues.  Under the proposed project, a revised plan
for reducing compensation payments has been agreed with the Yugoslav authori-
ties (para. 5.06).
2.36     A further on-going project is the Kosovo Railway Project (Loan 1977-YU;
May 1981; US$34 million) which assists in the rehabilitation of the railway
network of RTO Pristina through the reconstruction of the main Kosovo Railway
Junction, the provision of modern signalling and of rolling stock and
equipment.
2.37     The last OED Project Evaluation Report available for a rehabilita-
tion railway project in Yugoslavia is that for the Second Railway Project and
is dated October 1974. This was a very ambitious project, including electri-
fication of main lines, signalling and telecommunications, and construction
or modernization of six major marshalling yards.  The OED report criticized
the project for its size and complexity and for a lack of adequate project
preparation. A main recommendation was that future projects should include a
well defined action plan covering technical financial and institutional
aspects.  Although the Third and Fourth Projects also experienced delays and
financing problems, performance has been much better with the Fifth Project
and there has been good progress in improving investment planning and execu-
tion and  in  strengthening  the  coordinating  role  of CYR  (paras. 2.02 and
2.03).  A comprehensive action plan for each RTO and a detailed implementa-
tion schedule will be an important part of the proposed project (see
paras. 3.25 and 3.26).

III. THE INVESTMENT PLANS AND THE PROJECT
A. The Investment Plans
3.01     The four RTO's Investment Plans  (Tables 1(a)  to  l(d))  cover the
period 1981-1986 and amount in total to Din 116.7 billion (US$1,331 million)
with a foreign exchange component of Din 55.3 billion (US$621 million). Price
base is December 1982.  Included in 1981 to 1983 is the completion  of the
1976-1980 Investment Plan (balance remaining Din 5.1 billion-US$76 million),
which formed part of the Fifth Railway Project.  The four-year Bank project
(Tables l(a) to 1(d)) will cover Part A of the Investment Plans during the
period 1983-86 totalling Din 76.3 billion (US$866.6 million) with a foreigrn
exchange component of US$405 million.  The. Bank's US$110 million  loan will
be allocated to specific items in the project (Table 2), with a total cost
of Din 27.1 billion (US$291 million) and a foreign exchange component of
(US$150 million).  The loan represents about 27% of the estimated  foreign
exchange cost of the Bank project.
3.02     The principal objective of the RTO's Investment Plans is to con-
tinue the process of modernization of the railways to enable them to effi-
ciently fulfill their role of principal carrier of bulk materials in a
competitive  transport environment.  The agreed  Investment Plan amounts to
about 30% less than the railways original proposals, which were reduced to
bring them more into line with expected financing resources, and to focus on
the most pressing needs and investments, taking into account possible
improvements in productivity.  On the recommendation of the Bank, the Plans
have been divided  into two parts:  Part A consisting of investments which
are to proceed as scheduled, and Part B, containing items which will be
proceeded with only after appropriate technical/economic studies and when
financing is secure and upon agreement between the Borrower and the Bank.
Part B investments comprise about 25% of the 1981-86 Investment Plans and
27% of the investments which were proposed for the project period.

1/  Physical contingencies of 10% have been included for all items,
except for traction and rolling stock.
2/  Price contingencies, when basic costs are expressed in US$ equivalent,
have been estimated assuming annual price increases of 8% for 1983,
7.5% for 1984 and 7% for 1985 and 1986; and when expressed in Dinars,
30% for 1983, 25% for 1984 and 20% for 1985 and 15% for 1986.
3.04     About 65% of all expenditures on investments in Part A of the Plan
will be on track overhaul and on traction and rolling stock.   Investments
will include 775 km of track overhaul and reconstruction, purchase of 53
locomotives, 20 motor trains, 86 passenger coaches and 5,632 freight wagons.
Also planned is modernization of signalling and telecommunications on 421 km
of line and electrification of 437 km of line as well as investments in inte-
grated transport, workshops and depots and some reconstruction of stations
and junctions.



-19-
3.05     The Investment Plans as now proposed are adequate to achieve the
objective outlined above (para. 3.02) and the components are economically
justified.  The results and benefits of these investments will be measured
by means of agreed operational and financial targets to be included in an
Action Plan (paras. 3.25 and 3.26).  Feasibility studies for the components
of the plans were prepared by the RTOs and CYR, and also by Transport Facul-
ties. The formal approval by the appropriate authority (Assembly or Workers
Council) of the investment plans as submitted to the Bank will be a condi-
tion of loan effectiveness.  Assurance was obtained at negotiations that,
except as the Bank otherwise agrees, the RTOs will: (a) implement their
Part A Investment Plans; (b) will review their Investment and Financing Plans
annually with the Bank, taking into account traffic results and trends and
propose any necessary revisions; and (c) will not in any year, undertake
investments not included in Part A of their investment plans in excess of 5%
of the investments included in Part A of their investment plans in that year,
without having demonstrated their technical and economic justification to the
satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank.
B. The Project
3.06     Project objectives are as follows:
(i) to strengthen the four participating RTOs so as to enable them to
compete effectively in a competitive market, by improving produc-
tivity and the quality of their services;
(ii) to further strengthen project management and the preparation and
implementation of sound Operational and Action Plans; and
(iii) to put the railways back on the road towards financial viability.
3.07     The proposed project comprises the 1983-1986 slice of Part A of the
Investment Plans.
The four-year project is summarized below:

-21-
(a) Capital Overhaul of Track
3.08     About 32% of the project expenditures is for about 700 km of track
overhaul and 34 km of line reconstruction.  Worn-out track -in some cases
about 40 years old and subject to severe speed restrictions (para. 2.18)-
will be renewed with new UIC 60 rails, type 49 rails and on other than main
lines with used rails to increase the axle load to 22 and 20 tons and speeds
to 120 km/h. These improvements will be major factors contributing to bet-
ter utilization of traction and rolling stock which in turn will result in
reduced investment and increased productivity.  The use of UIC 60 rails on
the main Trans-Yugoslav line from Austria to Greece will allow higher speeds
of up to 160 km/h for passenger trains but its main benefit will be in
reducing high track maintenance cost, due mainly to heavy freight traffic.
(b) Signalling and Telecommunications
3.09     New installations of signalling and telecommunications account for
6% of the project total. Obsolete mechanical signalling systems with tech-
nical characteristics below modern safety standards will be replaced on
143 km of lines by modern equipment, including automatic block and auto-
matic train stopping.  This will improve line capacity and rolling stock
utilization.  Other works on SS and TT are improvements of existing systems
in conjunction with the electrification of lines.  To increase capacity by
allowing faster and more punctual operation of trains, a centralized traf-
fic control system (CTC) will be installed on the line Skopje-Gevgelija.
In total, 393 km of lines will benefit from the above works.
(c) Electrification
3.10     About 5% of project expenditures are provided for the electrifi-
cation of about 374 km of line, which would close two remaining gaps in the
electrified network of main lines. The works will complete the electrifica-
tion of the basic network of RTO Sarajevo and the last link from Skopje to
Gevgelija, on the main Trans-Yugoslav line from Italy and Austria in the
north to Greece and Turkey in the south.  Electrification will improve the
capacity and reduce operating costs on these lines and will also yield
additional network wide benefits by allowing a higher degree of standardi-
zation of equipment and rationalization of operations than is at present
possible with mixed traction.
(d) Reconstruction of Stations and Junctions
3.11     About 3% of project costs is allocated for reconstruction works at
stations and junctions with the objective of increasing capacity.   Plans
for all major reconstructions are phased and were reviewed by the mission.
Major expenditures will be on renewal and extension of tracks, points and
platforms.



-22-
(e) Traction and Rolling Stock
3.12     Planned procurement  of traction  and rolling  stock  is based  on
operational plans which take into account forecast traffic, the scrapping
of old and obsolete stock, and also planned increases in operational effi-
ciency through comprehensive action plans (paras. 2.25, 3.25 and 3.26).
The planned acquisitions represent 34% of the project cost total and
include about 4,272 freight wagons, 2 diesel locomotives, 13 electric loco-
motives 38 diesel shunters, 6 electric and 8 diesel motor trains, 67 pas-
senger coaches, 4 sleepers and spare parts for locomotives.l/ This further
modernization of the transport fleet, together with improvements in track
conditions and terminal facilities, will enable better rolling stock utili-
sation and considerable improvements in turnaround times and other effi-
ciency indicators.
(f) Integrated Transport
3.13     Investment in integrated transport is coordinated through national
and regional planning committees. About 4% of project expenditures will be
on works and equipment for integrated transport, including container han-
dling equipment, cranes, forklifts and pallets. Civil works will be mainly
for track and access roads in integrated transport centers in Belgrade,
Sarajevo, and Senta.
(g) Training and Technical Assistance
3.14     A study for the improvement of electric locomotive maintenance and
operation formed part of the Fifth Railway Project  (Loan 1534-YU).   This
study is presently being carried out and it is expected that the final
report will be available in October 1983. Provision will be made under the
proposed loan for the results of this study to be followed up and for con-
sultancy assistance in the implementation of its  recommendations.   This
would include a staff training scheme for technical and operating staff in
a country where recommendations from the consultants have already been
successfully applied.
3.15     The project will also provide for a study of methods adopted by
railways in other European countries for the increase of mainline speeds by
improvements in fixed installations, in traction and rolling stock, and in
timetabling.   The two studies in total are expected to require about 22
months of consultancy assistance.
3.16     Provision is made for assistance in staff training for senior and
middle management of technical and financial departments and also for train-
ing staff, including acquisition of equipment, in the maintenance of modern
signalling and telecommunications installations.
1/ Figures here relate to the project period 1983-86. An analysis of the
rolling stock fleet at December 31, 1980 together with planned with-
drawals and procurement during the planning period 1981-86 is given at
Annex 1, Table 1.2.



-23-
C. Cost Estimate
3.17      The cost estimates (Tables l(a) to l(d)) which have been prepared
by the RTOs and Transport Faculties (para. 3.05) are based on recent experi-
ence with similar works, acquisitions of traction and rolling stock, and
feasibility studies.  The estimates include import duties and local taxes.
In calculating the foreign exchange components, items have been assumed to
be imported only where there is a high probability that contracts will be
placed abroad. Examples are signalling and data processing equipment, com-
ponents for rolling stock and track maintenance machines. Where the source
of supply is uncertain it has been taken as domestic and an estimate of
foreign content made, based on similar previous projects.  Base costs are
at December 1982 price levels and physical contingencies of 10% have been
included for all items except for traction and rolling stock. Price contin-
gencies when calculated in U.S.dollars have been estimated assuming annual
price increases of 8.0% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984 and 7.0% for 1985 and 1986,
and when calculated in Dinars, 30% for 1983, 25% for 1984 and 20% for 1985
and 15% for 1986.  For consultancy services and assistance  in the general
training programs, a lump sum of US$12,000 per man-month (on an average)
per foreign consultant has been allowed to include salary, costs, fees,
international travel and subsistence, and US$6,000 equivalent per month on
an average for local consultants for equivalent expenses.  It is expected
that some of these services would be provided by Yugoslav experts. Depend-
ing upon the proportion of Yugoslav experts that might be provided, this
lump sum would allow between 30 and 40 man-months of consultancy services
together with subsistence abroad for management staff estimated at about
US$5O,ooo.
D. Financing Plan
3.18     A financing plan for each RTO's investment plan has been drawn up
and agreed with the COI and Republican or Provincial Government.  Sources
of funds have been identified for all planned project expenditures.  Grants
from Republican and Provincial Governments will contribute about 9% of the
total.  Of the US$405 million  foreign exchange component of the project,
about 53% is expected to be met from: (a) the proposed Bank loan of
US$110 million; (b) a loan from the European Investment Bank of about
US$20.0 million equivalent which will be utilized for works on the main
Trans-Yugoslav trunk line; and (c) by credits of about US$83 million from
Eurofima, the European rolling stock financing cooperative. The balance of
the foreign exchange component will be largely financed by suppliers' cre-
dits from foreign and domestic rolling stock and equipment suppliers. About
38% of project expenditures will be financed from internal resources.  The
formal approval by the appropriate authority (Assembly or Workers Council)
of the financing plans as submitted to the Bank for each RTO will be a con-
dition of effectiveness of the loan.  Financing for the project is summa-
rized on the following page.

E. Lending Arrangements
3.19     The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the Federal Government and
would be made jointly to the four RTOs for a 15-year period including three
years of grace.   The Loan Agreement will contain a separate amortization
schedule for each RTO in accordance with its share of the loan.  CYR will
also be a party to the Loan Agreement as it will retain certain responsibi-
lities for project execution and coordination.  The allocation of the loan
is summarized below:
RTO                                 US$ million
Belgrade                                  30.5
Novi Sad                                  24.3
Sarajevo                                  36.5

Technical Assistance & Training            0.5
Total                               110.0
F. Implementation
3.20     Each RTO will be responsible for executing its part of the project
with CYR acting as a coordinating agency for procurement, technical assist-
ance and staff training, the annual revisions of Investment, Financing,
Action and Operational Plans and for all communications and reporting with
the Bank. Agreement was reached at negotiations on maintaining the capacity
of the CYR panel set up for the administration of the Fourth and the Fifth
Project. A schedule for implementation of project items which has been pre-
pared with CYR and the RTOs is shown at Chart C4.



-25-
G. Procurement
3.21     The contracts  for track materials, equipment  for electrification,
signalling, telecommunications and CTC, and spare parts for locomotives
would be placed by ICB in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
Domestic firms would be permitted to participate in biddings and would be
accorded a preference of 15%, or the customs duties, whichever is lower.
The whole of the loan other than the portion for technical assistance and
training would  be  disbursed  against  these  contracts.   An  assurance  was
obtained that consultants for technical assistance and staff training will
be employed in accordance with the Bank guidelines and that qualified coun-
terparts will be appointed.
3.22     About 59% of the loan would be disbursed on the purchase of steel
materials  and  timber  sleepers  for  track  overhaul  of  permanent  way
(para. 3.08).  Particularly in view of world market conditions which cur-
rently reflect substantial over-capacity for steel products, it is not
possible to assess the extent to which Yugoslav manufacturers are likely to
be successful under ICB procedures.  However, whatever proportion of con-
tracts for steel materials are won by domestic suppliers, the loan will
still represent only about 27% of the total foreign exchange cost of the
project and would be less than the foreign exchange component of the invest-
ments to which it is allocated.  To achieve the full benefits of ICB, CYR
and the RTOs should undertake to give bidders the opportunity of quoting for
part of the quantities of track materials.   The procurement timetable is
contained in the implementation schedule at Chart C4.
H. Disbursements
3.23     Agreement was reached between rhe RTOs as to the allocation between
them of the Bank loan (para. 3.19).   Disbursements would be made against
contracts for materials and equipment for track overhaul, for electrifica-
tion and signalling and telecommunications for respective lines and for
spare parts for locomotives. The categories would be as follows;
RTO Belgrade
100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported or ex-factory
prices of locally manufactured track materials;
100% of foreign expenditure on spare parts for locomotives;
RTO Novi Sad
100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported or ex-factory
prices of locally manufactured track materials;
100% of foreign expenditure on spare parts for locomotives;



-26-
RTO Sarajevo
100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported or ex-factory
prices of locally manufactured track materials; and
100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported or ex-factory
prices of locally manufactured equipment for fixed installa-
tions for electrification and for signalling and telecommuni-
cations;
100% of foreign expenditure on spare parts for locomotives;
RTO Skopje
100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported or ex-factory
prices of locally manufactured equipment for fixed installa-
tions for signalling, telecommunications and CTC;
100% of foreign expenditure on spare parts for locomotives.
Technical Assistance and Staff Training
100% of foreign expenditures on consulting services.
A schedule of estimated disbursements is shown at Table 3.  The estimated
disbursement period is about two years less than disbursement profiles for
Bank-wide and regional transportation projects but is similar to that
achieved for the Fifth Yugoslav Railway Project where, together with tech-
nical assistance, disbursement was similarly against purchase of track
materials and equipment.
I. Employment
3.24     The anticipated results of the project in terms of eventual staff
savings are discussed at para. 2.16.  It is estimated that about 9,000 man-
years of work, mainly civil works and installation of equipment, will be
provided in carrying out the project.   In facilitating planned industrial
expansion in Yugoslavia, the indirect effects of the project upon employment
will be positive.
J. Action Plans
3.25     Besides each RTO, its BOALs and COI, railway decisions may involve
the Federal Government (SFRY), Governments of Republics and Autonomous
Provinces as well as organizations such as the Chambers of Economy.   This
led, under the Fourth and Fifth Railway Projects, to the establishment by
CYR and each RTO of comprehensive Action Plans which are an important instru-
ment for reaching a common understanding by all concerned on objectives and
responsibilities, and on the measures and time required for their achieve-
ment. The Action Plans are an important means of extending the RTOs' plan-
ning process.   Their overall  objectives  are to reduce cost,  improve  the
quality of service and improve the market position. They address themselves
to organization, planning, investments, marketing, productivity, information



-27-
systems,  finance, government support and staff training.   The RTO specify
actions to be taken to achieve agreed productivity, operational and finan-
cial targets.  Appropriately updated,  these Action Plans have a continuing
role to play in the development of the RTOs.  Assurance was obtained at
negotiations that the RTOs will: (a) implement their Action Plans as agreed
during  negotiations,  including  their  manpower  plans,  (b) undertake   to
achieve the operational targets, included therein, and (c) review and update
their Action Plans annually with the Bank under the present monitoring sys-
tem (Annex 1).  The approval by each of the Borrowers of the agreed Action
Plans will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.26     As part of their Action Plans, the RTOs have prepared Operational
Plans to improve the utilization of their traction and rolling stock and to
serve as a basis for procurement, renewal and scrapping of traction and
rolling stock.  CYR has prepared general plans for the whole network cover-
ing signalling, telecommunications, data processing and integrated trans-
port.   The  RTOs  will  continue  to  update  annually  and  implement  their
Operational Plans in collaboration with CYR (Annex 1), in order to adjust
them to actual and forecast traffic requirements.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. The Proposed Project and the National Development Plan
4.01     While the 1976-80 Development Plan achieved an impressive annual
growth rate of 5.6% in gross material product (GMP) and 6.8% in industrial
production, the Yugoslav economy has been facing, from about the last year
of the Plan, a serious economic crisis, partly arising from external shocks
such as a further increase in oil prices in 1979 and a slump in the world
economy affecting Yugoslavia's export performance, and partly from domestic
shocks such as the high inflation rate, reaching 38% in 1981.  As a result
of these economic difficulties and the restrictive economic policies adopted
to restore the economy, GMP grew only 2.5% in 1980 and 1.5% in 1981, with a
1.4% increase expected for 1982.
4.02     The 1981-85 Development Plan presents both short-term and medium-
term strategies in coping with the country's recent economic difficulties
and in charting a course of continued development for the economy. A series
of economic stabilization measures are already bearing fruit in controlling
inflation and in reducing external deficits.   Despite these measures,  the
macroeconomic forecasts have been revised downwards substantially at the end
of 1982.  The current tentative forecasts show GMP expected to decline by
some 2% in 1983 followed by moderate increases of 1 to 2% per year through
the end of the plan.   Overall growth in GMP during  the current  plan is
expected to average about 1% per year.
4.03     The revised 1981-85 Plan envisages an overall annual growth rate of
only 1.5% in industrial production compared with the 6.8% annual rate
achieved under the 1976-80 Plan.  However, as will be discussed below (see
para. 4.09), the 1981-85 Plan gives higher priority and aims at higher



-28-
growth targets for coal and lignite mining, needed for domestic energy
production,  non-ferrous  mining,  metals  and  basic  chemicals.   These  pro-
duction commodities, which generate long distance bulk traffic for the
railways, are expected to continue increasing at moderate rates through the
end of the current plan.
4.04     The  1981-85  Plan  also  emphasizes  continued  development  of  the
country's rail system since it is the optimal and economic mode to move
bulk, long-distance commodity traffic both for exports and domestic needs.
In addition, the railways dependence on imported fuel is minimal.  Studies
in Yugoslavia have shown that where loading is done directly from an indus-
trial siding to railway wagons, traffic in full wagon loads is more economi-
cally carried by railway than by road, for distances beyond 100 km.  About
54% of rail traffic in Yugoslavia is loaded from industrial sidings; 99% of
the rail traffic is in full wagons loads, 80% of which is in bulk form; and
the average haul has been increasing in recent years and is now about 300 km
per ton. Expected increases in the production and transport of commodities
involving such long-distance and bulk traffic would require that rail capa-
city be adequately strengthened to cope with such higher demand.  Since the
railway operates in a competitive market, it is also necessary that the rail
system be made more efficient and competitive to attract and retain the traf-
fic to which it is best suited. The 1981-85 Plan stresses these objectives
for strengthening the railway system.
B. Traffic Projections
4.05     Following  two major  downward  readjustments  in  the macroeconomic
forecasts between September and December 1982, the freight traffic forecasts
were revised.  However, these revisions were made solely on the basis of an
overall estimate of growth in industrial production as revised projections
for individual commodities and data on regional growth patterns were not
available.   The detailed  forecasts  for each segment of the network will
therefore need to be updated as part of the annual review of the investment
programs and financing plans (para. 3.05). A summary of the traffic projec-
tions for the Yugoslav railways and for the four RTOs covered under the pro-
ject is presented below, and additional details are given in Tables 6 and
7. The figures also show the actual traffic growth during the 1976-80
period for the CYR; corresponding data for 1976-80 for the four RTOs sepa-
rately are not available since some RTOs came into existence only in 1978.

(NTKM+PKM) in millions
4.06     As the above figures indicate, the average traffic growth rate is
expected to be somewhat lower during 1980-85, compared to 1976-80.  A 2.9%
growth rate in total traffic units is expected for CYR during 1980-85, com-
pared with a 4.6% growth projected for 1976-80 under the Fifth Railway Pro-
ject and a 3.5% growth actually achieved.  The four RTOs under the project
are projected to have growth rate of 3% during 1980-86. This growth rate is
in line with the overall results achieved for rail traffic since 1976.  The
basis for the projections is discussed in the following sections.
4.07     The four RTOs under the project (Novi Sad, Belgrade, Sarajevo and
Skopje) carry at present about half of the total traffic units in CYR.  In
freight traffic, more than half is from these four RTOs.  This is because
most of the ore and coal mining is done in the Republics comprising these
RTOs; Bosnia-Herzegovina (comprising RTO Sarajevo) is, after Kosovo, the
largest producer of coal, iron ore and non-ferrous minerals in the country;
Belgrade and Skopje are both producers and consumers of these items, while
Vojvodina (RTO Novi Sad) is a major consumer of coal from Sarajevo as also
of other bulk raw materials.
(a) Freight Traffic
4.08     The growth of freight traffic in 1981, of 2.8% for the CYR, and 4.0%
for the four RTOs, has to be seen against a low growth in GMP of 1.5% in
1981, and an increase of only 3% in the ton-km carried by road transport
which had grown by 17% in 1980 and by an annual 12.5% during 1976-80. These
figures, in a sense, underline the resilience of the railway traffic base



-30-
against the current restrictive economic policies, and suggest that these
policies have affected, only to a lesser extent, the priority sectors of the
economy which generate most of the railway traffic.
4.09     Although detailed regional and line-by-line forecasts had been pre-
pared at appraisal based on an assessment of development plans and prospects
for each main commodity, the traffic projections have now been revised in
the light of the recent downward revision in the overall growth rate.  The
freight traffic forecasts have been prepared by deriving individual commo-
dity growth rates within a projected overall annual increase in industrial
output of 1.5% during 1981-85.   It has been assumed that the 1981-85 Plan
continues to assign a high rate of growth for mining, raw materials and basic
chemicals, at the expense of consumer and capital goods.  For coal and lig-
nite, which is the single largest element in rail traffic, production is
expected to increase by at least 6% per year compared to a 4% growth rate
during 1976-80.  Most of the new capacity in these basic industries comes
from delayed completion of on-going projects started under the 1976-80 Plan
and therefore provides a firmer basis for realization.

-31-
4.10     Based  on  the  revised  commodity  forecasts,  the  average  annual
increase in output for those commodities generating rail traffic is expected
to be about 2% during 1981-86.  Much of this increased production, such as
coal, is meant for long distance transport rather than for local use, which
implies an even higher increase for rail traffic.  Moreover, other factors
such as the Government's emphasis on developing a more efficient railway
system as well as the high cost and physical shortages of petroleum pro-
ducts,  are now encouraging greater use of rail  transport.   In addition,
public policy is now stressing improved multi-modal transport through the
creation of freight terminals for container traffic while many major rail
users are making joint investments with the RTOs in new or additional rail
sidings.  These developments indicate a firm commitment to continued growth
in rail traffic.  The slackening of growth in road transport freight ton-km
from an annual average growth rate of 12% during the 1970s to 3% in 1981,
while rail transport maintained its growth rate at about 3%, is an indica-
tion of a marginal shift in the relative shares in the transport market. In
the case of the four RTOs and Republics covered by the project, rail traffic
in 1981 increased by 4% while road traffic increased only by 1%.  As a
result, it can be expected that rail freight traffic will increase at a
slightly higher rate than the forecast 2% annual increase in output for com-
modities entering into rail traffic.  On balance, a 3% annual increase in
freight traffic during 1980-86, in line with trends during the past decade,
would represent a realistic forecast for the four RTOs covered by the pro-
posed project.   The  longer term trends would  indicate  a growth  rate  of
between 2 and 3% per year for freight traffic as the restrictions on road
transport gradually ease.
(b) Passenger Traffic
4.11     The achieved growth rate for rail passenger traffic on CYR during
1976-80 was only 1.2% followed by a similar low rate in 1981.  However, the
low growth in traffic in 1981 has in fact been due mainly to a 13% drop in
international passenger traffic, domestic traffic having gone up by 3%. The
reduced international traffic is understood to reflect the economic slump in
Europe, depressing tourist and other traffic to Yugoslavia.  The low growth
rate in rail passsenger traffic during 1976-80 was a reflection of the con-
tinued inefficiency of rail passenger services in attracting passenger traf-
fic; this was in turn partly the result of the low priority given to passen-
ger services in rail investments in the recent past and the consequent poor
quality of passenger services.   However, recent emphasis on improved rail
services, as well as shifts in traffic demand, are changing the picture. On
the one hand, due to the steep increase in petroleum prices and the shortages
of gasoline and diesel supplies, road passenger transport, particularly in
passenger cars, has considerably slackened, thus creating demand for alterna-
tive modes of transport. Domestic air traffic has also declined by about 9%
in 1981, due to frequent service interruptions caused by a shortage of jet
fuel.  On the other hand, CYR's recent experience shows that wherever they
have introduced, since 1980, special high-quality passenger services (for
example, the business and express services on routes like Belgrade-Sarajevo,
Belgrade-Zagreb, Belgrade-Novi Sad) with comfortable cars, greater speed and
punctuality, the demand for rail services has far outstripped supply, with
long passenger waiting lists being common for such services.



-32-
4.12     The railway's strategy is to provide more high-quality passenger
services during the 1981-86 Plan so as to meet the growing demand of traffic
diverted primarily from road transport and to some extent from domestic air
services. Many elements in the proposed railway investment plan will assist
in increasing rail capacity and efficiency to attract and retain the expected
traffic increases; for instance, the proposed new motor trains and passenger
cars will provide more comfortable travel, the proposed track overhaul will
ensure better riding qualities, and the proposed signalling and telecommuni-
cations will ensure faster and more punctual services.  Preliminary figures
for 1982 indicate that passenger traffic has already jumped by 6 to 7% due
to the restrictions on road transport.  A growth rate of about 2% per year
is expected during the remaining years of the Plan, providing an overall
average annual increase in passenger traffic of 2.6% during the period
1980-86.  In view of the various factors discussed above, particularly the
upsurge in demand for good quality services and the railway's efforts to
provide such services,  the projected rates seem reasonable and realistic.
However, in the longer term it is expected that rail passenger traffic growth
will slacken to around 1% per year in line with a gradual improvement in the
competitive position of road transport.
C. Economic Appraisal of Proposed Investment
(a)  The Planning Process
4.13     The  proposed  Railway  Investment  Plan  for  the  four  RTOs  (see
para. 3.03) is the result of a long iterative process involving economic and
financial analyses, as well as discussions between the railway agencies (RTOs
and CYR), Republican authorities, professional institutes, which have pre-
pared individual feasibility studies, and Bank staff.  Due to the successful
institution-building efforts in railway planning initiated through previous
Bank projects, the RTOs and CYR now prepare operational plans and technical
and economic feasibility studies for all investment proposals, sometimes
with the assistance of transport planning institutes.  These studies, which
are critically reviewed by the COIs for the railways, are a necessary prere-
quisite for including projects in the Republican and Federal Investment
Plans.
4.14     The proposed Railway Investment Plan forms part of the Republican
and Federal Development Plan (1981-85).   Owing to the critical review by
related agencies and also by the Bank, the original railway plan has been
scaled  down  by  over  30%  to  form  the  present  plan.   As  noted  earlier
(para. 3.02), the present plan has been further scaled down to a core
program of high priority investments in Part A of the plan, with Part B
(about 25% of the plan) including other items of lower priority.   It has
been agreed (para. 3.05) that items in Part B will be implemented only after
their technical and economic justification has been demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank.   Part A, therefore, represents
the basis of the railway investment programs during the remainder of the
1981-85 Plan and extending into 1986.



-33-
(b)  Economic Return for the Project
4.15     The main benefits of the Investment Plan will be felt in improved
operational efficiency and the ability of the railway to perform its role in
the transport market.  As a major component of the project, the track over-
haul of about 700 km of main lines will provide substantial savings in
stepped-up track maintenance costs, which would otherwise be necessary, as
well as savings in equipment and rolling stock through higher operating
speeds.   Other benefits,  such as  increased axle  loadings,  have  iot been
included in the evaluation of the track overhaul items.  Moreover, as the
main savings from these items are in avoided track maintenance costs, their
viability is not affected by changes in traffic growth.  Proposed invest-
ments in traction and rolling stock are based on detailed operational plans.
The bulk of the equipment component covers replacement and is therefore a
fundamental part of the investment program.   If equipment was not replaced
in a timely manner, the bottlenecks in the railway system would disrupt
economic activity and it would be necessary to move traffic at higher cost
by road transport. Improved signalling and telecommunications which will be
introduced on about 400 km of line will provide direct operating cost savings
through higher operating speeds as well as savings in system operating costs
through the automation and centralization of signalling functions. Electri-
fication items cover about 375 km of single-track main line routes located
in difficult or mountainous terrain; benefits from these electrification
projects include operating cost savings as well as increased capacity due to
higher speeds and increases in net payloads.
4.16     Of  total  project  expenditures,  about  5%  is  on-going  investment
started under previous Bank projects, and for which the economic viability
has been previously established. A further 75% is supported by new feasibi-
lity studies, most of which have been reviewed in detail by the Bank staff;
these studies indicate high economic returns from the proposed investments
(see para. 4.17 below for a discussion of these studies). The remaining 20%
of the plan has not been covered by economic feasibility studies, as this
includes a number of miscellaneous items for which it is difficult to quan-
tify  benefits.   These  items  include  workshops,  computer  equipment  and
installations, technical studies and designs, and miscellaneous investments
to be undertaken by BOALs, the self-managed service organizations serving
the railways.  Technical studies have been prepared for most of these items
which are considered essential for improved operations.
4.17     Table 8 presents a list of the major investment projects subjected
to new feasibility studies, along with estimated costs and estimated ERs.
The feasibility studies were reviewed by Bank staff and adjusted where neces-
sary to reflect  the  revised  traffic  forecasts.   The  feasibility  studies
included detailed line-by-line traffic forecasts which were reviewed by Bank
staff and adjusted to reflect the revised overall traffic forecasts.  Gen-
erally, the revised individual forecasts are based on annual growth rates of
3%  for  freight  and  2%  for  passenger  traffic  through  1986,  followed  by
slightly lower rates in the longer term.  In some cases, no further growth
in traffic is assumed after 1990.  Several studies, particularly those for



-34-
plan components in RTO Novi Sad, had adopted conservative annual traffic
growth rates of 2 to 3% through 1986, followed by rates of 1.5 to 2.5% in
the longer term; no revisions were necessary to the traffic forecasts in
these studies.  Adjustments were made for border prices applicable to both
cost and benefit streams.  The costs and benefits are expressed in constant
prices as of January 1982. The exchange rate applicable in January 1982 was
used for the analysis, with costs and benefits converted to world price equi-
valents using border-price conversion factors.  The results of the calcula-
tions remain valid, therefore, in spite of the subsequent devaluation of the
dinar. In many cases, unquantified benefits exist and, therefore, the esti-
mated ERs are often conservative.   Individual ERs from projects were found
to range from 12% to 34%. The overall economic return from all the projects
studied (comprising 75% of the project) amounts to about 22%.    Assuming
conservatively a minimum ER of 12% on the parts of the investment plan for
which no separate ER was computed (see para. 4.16), the composite ER for the
whole project would amount to about 19%.
(c) Economic Return for Bank-Financed Items
4.18     The ER for the Bank-financed items has been separately estimated;
the total cost of these items amounts to 27.1 billion dinars, and the over-
all ER is estimated at 19% (Table 8).  All project items show acceptable
First Year Benefits (FYB) and are therefore justified on the basis of exist-
ing traffic.
(d) Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risks
4.19     A sensitivity analysis  of individual project items,  involving an
increase in costs by 10% or a decline in benefits by 10%, indicates that the
ERs would not fall below 12%, except for the Skopje signalling and telecom-
munications project, which would show an ER of about  10%.   However, this
item is an integral part of the electrification of the last section of the
main line to Greece and has broader indirect benefits which are not included
in the analysis.
4.20     Considering  the major  categories  of  projects  in  the  investment
plan, a large part is for procurement of rolling stock for which the ER (26%)
is estimated on a unit basis.  The actual procurement of rolling stock is
related closely to traffic demand and adjustments can be made to the opera-
tional plans should traffic growth fall below expectations.  Another major
part of the program is for track overhaul where benefits are not very sensi-
tive to traffic increases and are related more to the avoided costs of
stepped-up track maintenance and ultimate rail replacement, which would be
needed even if the traffic were to remain stationary.  For the only major
electrification project (Bosanski-Novi-Knin), the analysis shows that even
if traffic were to grow at 20% less than the modest rates assumed, the ER
would still be about 13%.
4.21     As project costs were computed on the basis of the recent experi-
ence of the CYR and as the traffic projections used are conservative, there
is little risk that the ERs will fall outside the range indicated.  More-
over, in view of the rolling annual plan mechanism followed by the Yugoslav



-35-
railways, there is flexibility in adjusting projects on an on-going basis to
changes in traffic levels.  Given the generally high ERs obtained for indi-
vidual project items and in view of the considerable experience of Yugoslav
railways in implementing similar projects, the proposed investments are free
from any significant risk.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Introduction
5.01     During  the  Fourth  and  Fifth  Railway  Projects,  railway  tariff
increases failed to match inflation with the result that compensation pay-
ments have contributed an increasing share of railway revenues (paras. 2.06
to 2.12).  The railways and the Government have stated that tariffs will in
future play a bigger role in revenues and that tariff policy is to be defined
in a compact on railway pricing which should very shortly be available. The
railways are also required in the context of the Fifth Loan agreement to
produce a plan for a phased reduction and eventual elimination of compensa-
tion payments at all RTOs.
5.02     In  an  effort  to  halt  the  rise  in  compensation  payments  the
Government approved increases in freight tariffs of 17% and in passenger
fares of 15% in March 1982, and of 17% for both freight and passengers in
December 1982.  These were followed by further increases of 15% for freight
and passengers in February 1983. As a result, compensation payments in 1983
in real terms are expected to be marginally lower than in 1982, although
still running at a very high level.  In the context of its stringent anti-
inflation policy, the Government has said that it does not intend to make
further tariff adjustments this year.  However, it has given assurances that
it will make substantial tariff increases in real terms in 1984 and subse-
quent years (para. 5.06) which will have the effect of reducing and ulti-
mately eliminating compensation payments at all RTOs.  The financial fore-
casts which are shown and discussed in this chapter have as their basis the
increasing tariff revenues which would arise from such tariff increases.
B. Past Financial Performance
5.03     Financial performance of Yugoslav Railways in recent years has been
marked by tariff increases which have been insufficient to counter growing
inflation and as a consequence, compensation payments, which were intended
to reduce as a proportion of revenues, have increased (see Table 1 to
Annex 3).   The  proportion  of  operating  expenditures  covered  by  tariff
revenues at each of the RTOs in 1981 compared to 197811 is shown below
together with targets for 1980 agreed under Loan 1534-YU.
1/ 1978 was the first full year of operation of RTOs Belgrade and Novi Sad.
Prior to that time RTOs Belgrade, Novi Sad and Titograd were combined
as one enterprise.

1981 Actual        76.1        79.0         99.8          72.2          a2.5

During the period 1978-81 all four RTOs reduced unit operating expenditures
in real terms but tariff revenues covered 3.4% less of operating expendi-
tures in 1981 than in 1978.  As well as showing the inadequacy of tariff
increases to cover inflation during this period, the figures give a measure
of the relative efficiency of operating performance of the different RTOs.
5.04     Only at RTO Sarajevo have tariff revenues covered a bigger propor-
tion of operating expenditures in 1981 than in 1980 and has the 1980 target
been achieved.  This resulted from a reduction in operating unit costs in
real terms of 19% over the period, which in turn resulted from stringent
cost control, staff reductions, and cost efficiency benefits arising from a
largely electrified system with few small branch lines.  At RTO Novi Sad,
staff reductions were also achieved and with the help of a 10% increase in
traffic, unit costs were reduced by 13%, but the proportion of costs covered
by tariff revenues was smaller in 1981 and the 1980 target was not achieved.
At RTO Belgrade, staff numbers went up by 1% and although unit costs were
reduced by 5%, tariffs covered a smaller portion of costs and the RTO was
far short of its 1980 target.  RTO Skopje shows the poorest performance of
all.  Traffic stagnated in the period under review so that no new revenue
generated and despite a reduction of 4% in unit costs, only 72% of costs
were covered by tariffs in 1981.
5.05     Financial performance of the four RTOs from 1978 to 1981, with fore-
casts for 1984 and 1986, is shown in summary tables on the following pages.
Compensation payments filled the gap in 1981 between tariff revenues and
operating expenditures at all RTOs except Skopje.  At RTO Skopje, where the
OI is newly organized, a token sum only was paid as compensation and a
large deficit resulted which had to be recovered from the Republican Fund
for Losses!l.  With the aid of compensation payments the other three RTOs
showed returns on net fixed assets of 2.1%, 2.6% and 1.3%.
1/ Compensation payments were made from Republican Funds in 1978 and 1979.
In 1982, the newly organized COI commenced quarterly advance payments
of compensation to the RTO on a regular basis.

C. Forecast Financial Performance
5.06     The Government has given an assurance that tariff increases will be
made early in 1984 (expected to be in January 1984) of 10% over the increase
in cost levels as measured by the Producer Price Index between January 1983
and the date the tariff increase takes effect.  This will be follwed at the
beginning of each subsequent year through 1990 by annual tariff increases of
6% over the rise in the Producer Price Index during the immediately preced-
ing twelve month period.  These tariff increases form the basis for a pro-
gram agreed with CYR and the RTOs for the achievement of viability through
tariff revenues which will result in the reduction and eventual elimination
of compensation payments.   The  completion  of measures  necessary  for the
tariff increase at the beginning of 1984 will be a co dition of effective-
ness of the proposed loan.  Annual operating ratios!', based on operating
revenues not including compensation payments, have been agreed with the RTOs
as financial targets for monitoring this program and are included in the
Action Plans of the RTOs. An assurance has been obtained from the RTOs that
they will use their best efforts to achieve these financial targets.  The
table below shows forecasts of reductions in compensation payments together
with operating ratios through the project period. If the forecasts are pro-
jected further.on the basis of continuing real increases in tariffs, traffic
increases at the same rate as forecast for 1982-86, and further increases in
productivity as forecast for this period, then compensation should be elimi-
nated in 1987 at RTO Sarajevo, ia 1988 at RTO Novi Sad, and in 1990 at RTOs
Belgrade and Skopje.

5.07     The principal criteria used in preparing the financial forecasts
for 1981-86 are summarized below.  The main assumptions on which they are
based are given in para. 5.12.  Revenues reflect 1982 tariffs, increases in
subsequent years as stated in para. 5.06 above, and forecast traffic levels.
Working expenses are based on 1982 figures and are adjusted for inflation
at  rates  forecast  for  the  countryl .   Depreciation  charges  assume  an
annual revaluation of assets on the basis of indices published by the
Federal Institute of Statistics.  The following table summarizes the fore-
cast income account results for the four RTOs by years to 1986.

5.08     For purposes of cash flow forecasting, financial contingencies have
been added to the estimated base costs of investments (plus physical contin-
gencies) at inflation rates  forecast  for the country.   In converting the
Bank loan into local currency, allowance has been made for forecast diver-
gence between local and international rates of inflation.   Cash flow esti-
mates for the project are satisfactory and sources of finance have been
identified.   A  combined  Internal  Resources  and  Financing  Plan  for  the
project is shown below while cash flow figures for each of the RTOs for the
years  1980-86  are  shown  at Tables  5 to  8 of Annex  4.   Gross  internal
resources comprise 64% of total cash availability for the project period
while net internal resources should finance about 38% of project invest-
ments.  Depreciation provisions are forecast to provide 69% of the internal
funds while the remaining 31% which is to be met from net revenues is con-
sidered to be within the earning capacity of the RTOs.

5.09     Average debt service coverage from internal funds was 1.5% in 1980
and 1.7% in 1981.  This should improve to 1.8% by 1983 and 2.5% by 1986 as
internal fund generation improves. An understanding was obtained at negoti-
ations that the RTOs will not incur debt beyond agreed debt limitation
ratios without consulting the Bank (Annex 4).

The  increase  in fixed asset values  reflects  the effect  of  annual  asset
revaluations as well as of the investment program.  The highest debt equity
ratio is 23/77 forecast for.RTO Belgrade in 1986 which is satisfactory.
5.11     Improvements in the working capital position are forecast by all
the RTOs, although these are limited by the forecast progressive reduction
in compensation payments.  Nevertheless, cash as a proportion of cash work-
ing expenses is expected to average 6.5% in 1983 and to improve to 8.7% by
1986 while the proportion of other working capital to cash working expenses
is expected to average 8.5% in 1983 and to rise to 15.0% by 1986.  Rate of
return on net fixed assets which averaged 0.7% in 1981 is forecast to rise
to 3.8% in 1983 and to 4.4% by 1986.  Details for RTOs are shown in Annex 4
together with targets as agreed at negotiations.
F. Assumptions Used in the Projections
5.12     The  financial  forecasts  are  based  on  the  following  principal
assumptions:
(a)  Freight and passenger revenues are based on the traffic forecasts
discussed in Chapter IV and shown in detail in Table 7.  Tariffs
have been assumed to increase by 37% for both freight and passen-
gers from January 1984 followed by increases of 28% in January 1985
and 23% in January 1984, these increases being respectively 10%, 6%
and 6% over the forecast increase in the Producer Price Index
(Industrial) for Yugoslavia for the twelve months preceding the
date of each increase.
(b)  Salaries  reflect  forecast small adjustments  in staff numbers and
increases to compensate for inflation.



-46-
(c) Fuel costs are based on forecast increases in gross ton-km.
Increases in other expenses are based on apportionment of expenses
to fixed and variable and forecast traffic volumes.
(d) Depreciation figures assume an annual revaluation of assets as
required by Yugoslav law.
(e)  The basis for all of the working expense figures are the forecasts
for 1982 based on ten months actual results.  Adjustment has been
made for inflation each year at rates forecast for Yugoslavia.
G. Sensitivity
5.13     The  forecasts  are sensitive  to  tariff  increases  and  to  traffic
growth.  The table below shows the effect upon compensation payments (assum-
ing that compensation payments are increased to cover the difference between
operating revenues and operating expenditure plus loan interest) of: (a) only
half the forecast real increases in tariffs being made from 1984 to 1986 and,
(b) only half the forecast growth in traffic being achieved.

5.14     The fact that the projected traffic increase is in line with past
long-term trends and, as indicated in para. 4.03, the emphasis on mining and
raw raaterial production in the current medium-term plan, supports the view
that the traffic forecast is realistic. Real increases in tariffs are essen-
tial to eliminate compensation payments, which the Government has stated to
be its aim unde..r its long-term price policy for transport.  Assurances have
been received (para. 5.06) regarding real increases in tariffs to be made in
1984 and subsequent years.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During negotiations agreement was reached with SFRY,  CYR and the
four RTOs on the following main issues:
(i) Tariff increases of 10% over the increase in the Producer Price
Index during the previous twelve months will be made at the begin-
ning of 1984 and of 6% over the increase in the Producer Price
Index at the beginning of subsequent years in order to reduce and
ultimately eliminate compensation payments at each RTO according to
an agreed program (para 5.06);
(ii) the RTOs will implement Part A of their investment plans as the
project and will review their investment plans and financing plans
annually and prepare necessary revisions.   During any year,  they
will not, without prior approval of the Bank, undertake investments
beyond those included in the project, in excess of 5% of the value
of investments to be carried out under the project during the same
year (para 3.05);
(iii) the RTOs will implement their action plans, including their opera-
tional plans, and will use their best efforts to achieve their
annual operational targets, including their manpower targets, and
their annual financial targets (paras 3.25 and 5.06); and
(iv) the RTOs will appoint project managers to be responsible for an
agreed list of works at each RTO (para 2.15).
6.02     The following will be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
loan:
(i) The completion of all measures necessary for the required tariff
increases to become effective at the beginning of 1984 (para 5.06);
(ii) the approval by the appropriate authority (Assembly or Workers
Council) of the investment plans and financing plans as transmitted
to the Bank (para 3.05);
(iii) the approval by the borrowers of the action plans, including opera-
tional plans, as transmitted to the Bank (para 3.25); and



-48-
(iv) assurances from each of the Republics and Provinces of funds as
required to enable its respective RTO to complete the investments
on which the Bank Loan is to be disbursed (para 3.18).
6.03     Based on the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$llO million for a period of 15 years including three years of
grace.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Action Plans and Operational Plans
Action Plans
1.       The Action  Plans  for  the  Fifth  Project  covered  the  following
matters for all RTOs for the period up to 1980:
(a) measures needed to attain financial targets;
(b) measures necessary to achieve annual operational and productivity
targets;
(c) manpower plans covering departmental and section requirements,
re-training   needs,   planned   reductions   and   recruitment   and
retirement;
(d) studies for actions on uneconomic lines;
(e) execution of a study for electric locomotive maintenance;
(f) operational plans for signalling and for telecommunications, for
traction and rolling stock, for track overhaul of track, for data
processing and for integrated transport; and
(g) rail costing study.
The four RTOs' updated Action Plans, dated April 1983, are structured as
those  for  the  Fifth  Project.   Based  on  actual  figures  for  1982  they
determine agreed financial, operational and productivity targets for 1984,
1985 and 1986. The Action Plans will be reviewed annually.
Operational Plans
General
2.       As part of their Action Plans, the RTOs in collaboration with CYR
have prepared Operational Plans, which require updating as follows:
(a) the plans for traction and rolling stock should be updated annually;
(b) the data processing plan should be updated by the end of 1983; and
(c) the plan for integrated transport should be updated by the end of
1983.

ANNEX 1

Operational Plans for Traction and Rolling Stock
3.       Each Operational Plan estimates equipment requirements based on an
analysis of the traction and vehicle fleet, the proposed withdrawals during
the planning period, planned improvements in the quality of service, and
forecasts of traffic and vehicle utilization, the latter represented by
agreed productivity ratios and targets.  These estimates are shown for all
four RTOs and all types of vehicles  in Table 3.1.   They also  take  into
account that, in some cases, actual productivity figures are particularly
low because of special temporary conditions, e.g. delays in spare part
procurement from abroad, as well as fundamental differences between the RTOs
in maintenance capabilities and operational conditions, which cannot be
completely eliminated during the planning period.
4.       One example illustrates the analysis on which the procurement of
additional traction stock is based.  It compares the estimated operational
production volumes in gross ton kilometres per year with the gross ton
kilometres expected to be performed by the existing traction fleet.   The
method of calculation is shown below in detail for RTO Sarajevo.
5.       The  targets  for  availability  of  locomotives  and  their  average
performance have been agreed with the RTOs.  Availability depends on the age
and quality of the fleet and on maintenance facilities and procedures.
Average performance depends on scheduling constraints and seasonal and other
traffic variations.   Improvements  in availability and average performance
are planned for all RTOs during the project period.  Based on the uncovered
GTKM/year, the required increase of stock is calculated.   In order to meet
all traffic demands, traction and rolling stock should be available at end
of the year preceding the demand.
6.       The procedure used for rolling stock is illustrated by the table
below, which relates to RTO Sarajevo's freight wagons.  The method is based
on the comparison of the required capacity for carrying the forecast freight
traffic and  of the total capacity  of the  existing  fleet.   The  required
capacity was calculated by means of the productivity ratio of freight wagons
in NTKM per ton capacity per year, which includes improvements in turnaround
time.  Tne targets derived from the actual figures for 1980 and 1981 are
satisfactory both in level and increasing tendency.  The total capacity of
the fleet was derived from the freight wagon fleet analysis which form parts
of the  Operational  Plan.   The  figure  is  amended  from  year  to year  by
deduction of the capacity withdrawn and by addition of the capacity procured
in the previous year. The age structure review and the withdrawal plan form
also part of the Operational Plans.  The result of the comparison is the
required additional capacity.  This figure was divided by the average capa-
city of one new wagon.   This average value was obtained by a calculation
based on the detailed procurement plan for the whole planning period which
form parts of the Operational Plans.
7.       The procurement of traction and rolling stock included in Part A of
the Investment Plans for all four RTOs was based on analyses similar to
those given above.   Procurement, which requires  further review,  has been
included in Part B of the Investment Plans.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Transportation Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
Previous Projects
1.       So far, the Bank has lent US$1,248 million in total to the tran~-
port sector, including US$629 million for eleven highway projects, US$108
million for two pipeline projects, US$382 million for six railway projects,
US$44 million for the Bar Port Project, and US$85 million for earthquake
rehabilitation assistance for restoring damaged roads, railways, and a port
in SR Montenegro.
Highway Projects
2.       The First Highway Project  (Loan 344-YU),  US$35 million)  in 1963
financed the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway
(422 km) and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road (174 km).  The Second Highway
Project (Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the
improvement of 367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via
Sarajevo and Tuzla with the Adriatic highway.  Both projects were completed
within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules.   The Third
Highway Project (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million), financed in 1969, comprised
about 120 km of roads in Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia, and was completed
in August 1974 with a 20-month delay, primarily due to delays in completing
an access road, but which did not impede the operation of the main highway.
This' project had an 8% cost overrun because of inflation and foreign
exchange  adjustments.   The  Fourth  Highway  Project  (Loan  678-YU,  US$40
million) was financed in 1970 for the construction of about 220 km of roads
in Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Vojvodina. Because of
expropriation problems in the section of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the project was
completed in December 1975 with an 18-month delay.  There was a 12% cost
overrun due  to  inflation  and  foreign  exchange  adjustments.   The  Fifth
Highway Proejct (Loan 751-YU, US$35 million) became effective 8 months late
due to Government administrative delays.   The project comprises 153 km of
roads in Kosovo, Macedonia and Slovenia, procurement of US$1.7 million worth
of engineering equipment, consultant's services and a staff training compo-
nent to improve highway planning and project preparation.   All roads are
open for traffic.   The engineering equipment has been delivered and the
consultant's  services were completed  satisfactorily.   The  staff  training
component was delayed because of difficulties encountered in securing
training of candidates in the head office of foreign consultants and in
foreign institutes and because of language problems (insufficient candidates
proficient in English). Consequently, a restricted program was adopted.

Because of the delay in training, the project was completed by the end of
1977, involving a delay of about 15 months.  This project had an 8% cost
overrun because of the combined effect of inflation and foreign adjust-
ments. The loan for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 990-YU, US$30
million) was made in May 1974 and became effective six weeks later than
estimated in December 1974.  The project finances six road sections in
Bosnia-Herzegovina,  totalling  150  km,  the  training  of  transportation
economists and road engineers and US$1.1 million worth of engineering and
laboratory equipment.   The loan for the Seventh Highway Project  (Loan
1143-YU, US$40 million) was made in July 1975 and became effective in
March 1976.  The project comprised about 90 km of road construction in
Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, and US$0.1 million worth of technical
assistance to improve preparation of highway feasibility studies and to
provide a related training program. The project was completed by the end
of 1979.  The Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU, US$56 million) was
made in April 1977 and became effective in September 1977.  The project
comprised about 130 km of roads in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia
and Kosovo, studies by consultants of road user charges and rail costs
and technical assistance for the preparation of a highway master plan for
Kosovo.  All road work is completed and the loan closed March 1981.  Both
the Seventh and Eighth Highway Projects focused on improving section of
the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH), which was to become the primary objec-
tive of later projects, while at the same time promoting regional
development  by  improving selected  regional  roads  in  lesser  developed
areas. The Ninth Highway Project (Loan 1535-YU, US$80 million) was made
in April 1978 and became effective in August 1978.  The project comprises
construction  of  four  highly  congested  sections  of TYH  in  Slovenia,
Croatia and Serbia, totalling about 86 km, and the procurement of equip-
ment for maintenance and for monitoring loadings of vehicles using the
primary highway network, including TYH.  All road work was completed by
January 1982 and the final delivery of highway maintenance equipment and
weighing  scales was made  in December  1982.   The  loan  for  the Tenth
Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU, US$148 million) was made in April 1979 and
became effective in August 1979.  It comprises the first phase (a three-
year tranche from mid-1979 to mid-1982) of the 1979-85 highway sector
programs of five participating Republics and Provinces.  The monitoring
and evaluation units have been established. Although all road contracts
have now been awarded, construction is suffering from delays of about one
year due to a shortage of local funds.  A request for a postponement of
the loan closing date to September 30, 1984, has been submitted to the
Bank. The loan for the Eleventh Highway project (Loan 1819-YU, US$125
million) was made in April 1980 and became effective in August 1980.  It
comprises construction of six sections of the TransYugoslav Highway (TYH)
with controlled access facility in four Republics and Provinces, total-
ling about 164 km, and the procurement of highway maintenance and road
monitoring equipment, technical assistance and a highway safety program.
Although execution is facing delays of up to 18 months because of a
shortage of local funds, progress varies

according  to  the  individual  participants,  Slovenia  having  only  just
started their component while Serbia is 75% complete    A request  for a
postponement of the closing date to June 30, 1985, has been submitted to
the Bank.  Construction work for nine highway projects has been satis-
factorily carried out.  Delays in execution of works on the two on-going
projects  reflect  constraints  in  the  overall  financial  situation  in
Yugoslavia since 1981.
Naftagas and Oil Pipeline Projects
3.       The loan for the Naftagas Project (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million)
was made in June 1973, but, due to organizational reform within the
Enterprise, became effective only in March 1974 after six months' delay.
The project is for the expansion of the gas transmission and distribution
systems in Serbia and Vojvodina by provision of gas field compressors,
pipelines, treatment plants and distribution rings. The supply of natural
gas will come from gas fields in Vojvodina and from Hungarian imports.
Because of a substantial increase in the project costs and a reallocation
of priorities in the use of natural gas which caused the elimination of
some consumers, who withdrew their finances from the project, the imple-
mentation of the project will be implemented in 3 phases, only the first 2
being taken up at this stage.  The additional funds required were to be
provided by agencies in Yugoslavia and by a supplementary loan of USt11
million from the Bank under the Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project,
Loan 1264-YU.   Construction restarted  in the latter half of  1976,  but
progress  has  been  slow.   Phase  I  was  scheduled  for  completion  by
December 1978 and Phase II by June 1979.  However, because of procedural
and political difficulties Phase I is in operation now and Phase II is
likely to be delayed until the middle of 1983.   The  loan  for the Oil
Pieeline Project (Loarn 1173-YU, US$49.0 million subsequently revised to
US 48.5 million) was made in November 1975 and became effective in
July 1976 after four months' delay.  The project comprises the construc-
tion of an oil port on the Adriatic coast at Omisalj, near Rijeka, as well
as oil storage tank farms, pumping stations, and the pipelines running
from the port through Croatia and Vojvodina and to the Hungarian border to
transport crude oil to the refineries in Yugoslavia, and to Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.  The project was to be completed in two stages:   Stage I
to provide a yearly capacity of 16 million tons; and Stage II, 20 million.
Stage I was completed with a delay of 18 months and the project as a whole
in December 1979 with a delay of 7 months due to problems of design and
procurement. The loan was closed in March 1981.
Port of Bar Project
4.       The loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in November 1974
to finance port development  and  related  railway  facilities.   The  loan
became effective on June 13, 1975. All works have been completed and the
loan was closed in Decemmber 1981.

Earthquake Rehabilitations (Transportation Facilities)
5.       The Montenegro Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Roads
(Loan 1759-YU, US$21 million) was made in September 1979 and became
effective in December 1979.  The project was completed on schedule at the
end  of  1982  and  the  loan  has  been  fully  disbursed.   The  Montenegro
Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Ports  (Loan 1768-YU, US$50
million) was made in November 1979 and became effective in April  1980.
Civil works are in progress and should be completed early in 1983.  Pro-
curement  of equipment has  been delayed and delivery  is  expected  to be
completed by mid-1984. Since the present closing date is December 31, 1982
the Borrower is requesting an appropriate extension of the closing date.
The Montenegro Rehabilitation Project for Earthquake Damage, Railways (Loan
1769-YU, US$ 14 million) was made in November 1979 and became effective in
April  1980.   It comprises  repair  and  restoration  of railway  facilities
damaged by the earthquake and the expansion of railway yards at Bar and
Titograd.  Most of the works are on schedule.  Delay on some parts have
been due to the fact that much more time than anticipated has been
necessary for design and geological works, while the need for work under
traffic  has  also  hampered  progress.   The  project  is  expected  to  be
completed in October 1983.
Railways
6.       The  First  Railway  Loan was made  in  1963  (Loan  316-YU,  US$35
million) to finance the conversion of the 195 km Sarajevo-Ploce line to
standard gauge, with electric traction' and modern signaling and telecommu-
nications. The project was substantially completed and put into operation
in 1970, with a delay of four years.
7.       The Second Railway Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in
1964 to help finance the modernization of 1,509 km of main lines traversing
Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border.  It
includes  electrification,   signaling,  telecommunications,  and  six  key
marshalling yards.  This project ran into major difficulties because after
the 1965 political and economic reforms the railways' internal funds fell
substantially below expectations, but also because of deficiencies in
project planning and preparation which resulted in an underestimate of
quantities and of time needed for completion of such an extensive project.
With hindsight, this was much too ambitious a project in relation to the
railways'  resources.   The  Bank  loan  was  fully  disbursed  in  1972;  the
project was refinanced from the fourth railway loan (para. 9 of this annex)
and was completed in 1981 at a total cost of about US$410 million, over
twice the original cost estimate in US dollar terms.
8.       The Third Railway Loan made in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million)
helped to finance construction of 370 km of the Belgrade-Bar line, with
electrification, signaling and telecommunications for the entire 475-km

line. This was a project of great technical complexity involving the
construction of over 300 tunnels and several major bridges; these civil
works were undertaken satisfactorily by local contractors. Completion was
originally scheduled for 1973 but geotechnical and other construction
difficulties delayed the opening of the line till 1976, and the project
was completed in December 1978. Technical problems and inflation aggrava-
ted by delays raised the cost of the project in US dollar terms to US$422
million.
9.       Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement
with the Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the
railways with the assistance of consultants. This prepared the ground for
tne Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU, US$93 million), agreed in 1974,
under which the Bank's loan was allocated to the completion of the 1964
Modernization Program and to "Related Investments" needed to maximize its
benefits, all to be completed by the end of 1976.  However, in contrast
with earlier projects which consisted only of investments to which the
Bank loan had been allocated, the fourth project was defined as the
totality of the railways' investments in 1974-76, whose cost was estimated
at US$1,138 million; the Bank loan thus amounted to about 12% of project
cost.   Agreement  was  reached  on  measures  to  resolve  the  railways'
financial problems, principally by tariff increases. An important feature
of the project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans which,
given Yugoslavia's decentralized system, were designed to contribute to a
common understanding of objectives and responsibility by all concerned.
10.      Only about two-thirds of project investments were executed by the
end of 1976; however, they were reasonably balanced to maximize system
effects, and the remainder were included in the 1976-80 Investment Plan.
Execution of Bank-financed "Related Investments" was substantially better
(about three quarters), and the electrification of the main line traver-
sing Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border
was completed under the 1964 Modernization Program.  Works were completed
satisfactorily in mid-1981 and the loan was closed on June 30, 1981.
11.      The Fifth Railway Loan (Loan 1534-YU, US$100 million) was made in
April 1978; it became effective in September 1978.  The project consists
of a three-year (1978-80) portion of the eight railways' investment plans
1976-80.   Its principal objective was to improve further the efficiency
and the competitive position of the railways by 1,285 km of track overhaul
or, reconstruction of 93 km of route conversion from single to double
track, electrification of 314 kIn, equipping of 53 km with modern
signaling, installation of automatic block on 434 km, technical assistance
and staff training.  Execution of the project was on schedule for about 90
percent.   Track  overhaul  and  especially  reconstruction  of  some  line
sections were delayed due to administrative and financial difficulties,
the latter beginning in 1980.

The Bank-financed items of the investment plans 1976-80 were completed in
mid-1982, while the non-Bank financed projects are scheduled to be completed
by the end of 1982. Track maintenance machines will be delivered within the
next six months.  The project period was extended by one year.  The closing
date is now June 30, 1983.
12.      The Kosovo Railways Loan (Loan 1977-YU, US$34 million) was made in
M4ay 1981 and became effective in November 1981.  The project comprises the
1981-83  slice  of  the  railways  investment  plan  1981-85.   Its  principal
objective is helping improve the operating capacity and efficiency of the
rail network in Kosovo, which is the weakest part in the Yugoslav railway
system.   The  main  components  are  reconstruction  of  Kosovo  Junction,
signaling  and  telecommunication  on  the  line  Lesak-Djeneral  Jankovic,
procurement of rolling stock and training and technical assistance to
improve management and freight operations.  Progress of works on the major
parts of the project suffered delays of seven to nine months for various
reasons.   The  obstacles  have  been  resolved  and  final  preparations  for
execution are completed.  Works were to commence in September 1982 and are
scheduled  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  1984.   The  closing  date  is
December 31, 1984.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF
A SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
Tariffs and Compensation
1.       The "enterprise income" (i.e. revenues earned from freight tariffs
and passenger fares) of every RTO is less than "operatinf/ expenses" (i.e.
materials  cost and  depreciation)  and  interest  payments._    For  the  four
RTOs in this project taken together, tariff revenues in 1981 covered 83% of
operating expenses, or 79% when interest charges are included.  The operating
deficits, as with many railways elsewhere, result partly from governmental
decisions as to the level and structure of ralway prices, the imposition of
certain public service obligations on the railway, and the retention of
excess staff.   Railway freight rates are approved by the Federal Institute
for Prices and passenger fares by the Republic governments.  Decisions are,
in  the  final  analysis,  made  on  the  basis  of  macroeconomic  and  social
judgments and not solely on factual information about the costs of providing
services. The Federal Committee for Transport and Communications and the CYR
play an important advisory role in preparing the Social Compacts or agree-
ments which set railway prices.  These administered prices adjust standard
rail tariffs to serve a number of purposes, e.g. (i) by lowering rates to aid
certain regions, industries or classes of travellers; (ii) converting actual
kilometre distances into "commercial kilometres" for charging purposes in
order to give more average revenue per ton-km or passenger-km to the smaller,
less efficient RTOs and to reflect their different cost and traffic condi-
tions; (iii) reducing rates on exports that have a high local labor,
materials and technology content and to encourage transit traffic (forms of
export subsidy).
2.       The RTOs are compensated for revenues foregone as a result of such
pricing decisions and provided with funds to meet part of their infra-
structure maintenance and renewal costs by a self-determined levy on the
incomes of those who are members of the COI.!/  The so-called compensation
payments form a contracted obligation and are forecasted for three to five
years ahead, subject to annual review in the light of cost and traffic
experience.  The rate of levy adopted varies from Republic to Republic.   In
Serbia, for example, it is a flat 1.75% on the 'enterprise income' of the
BOALs and other working communities making up the COI; in Skopje it is

societies.

0.7%; in Slovenia it is 3.6% on 'small' railway user enterprises and 1.5% on
'big' railway user enterprises--this may not necessarily be a subsidy
because  of differences  in the costs  involved.   In Croatia,  by contrast,
there is a multitude of rates ranging from around 0.6% to 5.8% on the
industrial and other economic activites in the Republic, including on the
RTO itself as well as other transport modes since they may also use rail
transport as part of their activities.
3.       The compensation payments are an effort to devise a formula that
will  serve  three  purposes.   First,  to  avoid  protracted  annual  disputes
between the railways, users and Government authorities about the level of
subsidy to be paid--as happens in some countries--by having a simple, agreed
formula.   Second,  to facilitate financial planning by the railway and COI
members by giving railway management some degree of certainty about future
income and the members about future commitments. And, third, to induce some
sense of efficiency and service. to the public  in railway mangement.   In
return for the compensation subsidy, the railways are expected to meet
agreed productivity and service level standards (e.g. on-time running of
trains or the numbers of wagons available daily) and if these are not
achieved  or  traffic  is  below  expected,  compensation  is  reduced.   If  a
financial  deficit  exists  after  payment  of  compensation,  the RTO  has  to
borrow from the banks or the Republic's Reserve Fund.  In this latter case,
the RTO has to show that it has tried to curb internal expenditures by, for
example,  saving on materials and, in the final analysis, on the personal
incomes of the staff.
4.       The  existing  arrangements  haive  some  financial  discipline  and
efficiency stimulating effects that distinguish  them from,  and make them
somewhat  superior  to,  many  railway  subsidy  financing  schemes   found
elsewhere, but they have many weaknesses.  Also, their high level and rate
of  growth  from  a  system-wide  total  of  6.9 billion  dinars  in  1978  to
16.1 billion dinars in 1981 is of great national economic management concern
1/  This concept and rationale of railway compensation payment is similar
to that in Articles  5 and  6 of a 1965 Decision by the Council  of
European Communities  and in Regulations  1191/1192 of  1969 passed  in
pursuance of this Decision.  Article 2 of a later (1975) EEC Council
Decision  states  clearly  "railway  undertakings  are  to  be  managed
accordance with economic principles."  This is the same objective set
out in the Bank's 'Railway Problem Paper' (1982) and towards which this
project is aimed.

to  the  Federal  and  Republic  authorities.!/   Payments  are  based  on  the
'enterprise incomes' of COI members and not the actual costs incurred by the
particular RTO for carrying traffic on their behalf.  They do not relate to
the costs of moving traffic on specific routes within and amc..g the RTOs and
they do not separate out those lines or traffics which are or, with proper
pricing, could be commercially viable from those that are being subsidized
to carry traffic that might otherwise move by more economic m7Is                  The
existing system is probably full of cross-subsidies within and between the
COI.   Sufficient  firm  information  on  these  judgmerts  is not  available,
however, because the recommendations of the Rail Costing Study carried out
under  the Fifth  Railway Project  are  still  to be  implemented nation.-,Ace
(para. 2.27).  This must be done as early as possible  since the pre~i -:
compensation arrangements are attempting to maximize  two separate  objec-
tives.  Internal operating efficiency in the railways by their management,
and socially optimum levels of railway prices, outputs and subsidies on the
basis of decisions by other authorities.  The existing arrangements attempt
to relate these two objectives, but in doins so they dilute the financial
decision powers and responsibility implied in selfmanagement of the railways
and are not achieving the low cost-efficient railway system that is expected
to serve the national economic and social objectives.
5.       The Federal authorities,  acutely aware and concerned  about  such
problems, are seeking to develop and have the railways implement a more
rational railway pricing policy.  Furthermore, current pricing policies and
compensation levels are recognized to be a contributory factor in current
inflation and put pressure on public borrowing and lending ceilings.  The
aim of the Federal authorities is that the RTOs should cover the cost of
isimple reproduction' (i.e. operations, maintenance and renewal) and an
agreed portion of resources needed for modernization and capacity expansion
investments  from their revenues.   To this end,  rail  tariff classes were
reduced in number from five to three and freight weight limits adjusted.
The revisions made possible an increase in rail prices in 1981 of 13.8%--to
which was added another 'across-the-board' 3.7%--but the total increase was
still below the 25.2% asked for by the  railways.   A program envisaging
increases in rail prices of 20% in 1982, 30% p.a. in 1983 and 1984, and 20%
in 1985 was prepared in 1981.  These were expected to be sufficient to cover
general price level increases and to reduce significantly the compensation
payment gap which was widening because in previous years rail prices had
increased at a slower rate than inflation.   The size of tariff increases
needed to attain these aims has been overtaken by events.  This is particu-
larly so because inflation has been at a higher rate than expected.  Federal
authorities have stated that "problems in the area of transport prices, both
as regards their level and the system of setting such prices,

are the chief cause of the socio-economic position of various railway
transport organizations and of the majority of difficulties with which
railways  must  contend."'l/   The  tariff  increase  of  17%  in December  1982
followed by a further 15% in February 1983 are an earnest of their intent to
deal with this problem.  Accordingly,  the Bank is strongly supporting the
early introduction of better railway costing and cost based tariffs, and, in
discussions, will agree to a program of rail price increases that is aimed
at eliminating compensation payments in a phased approach which allows for
different treatment by each RTO to reflect its particular economic and
social circumstances.

Financial Details and Targets
1.       Tables 1 to 12 of this annex show, for each of the RTOs, Incomei
Accounts and Forecasts for years 1981 to 1986, Cash Flow, Balance Sheets
and Forecasts for years 1980 to 1986.
2.       Forecast working and operating ratios before compensation payments
are as follows:
Actual                  Forecast
RTO               1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
Operating Ratios
Belgrade           132      137      131     120      115      109
Novi Sad           127      135      126     113      108      101
Sarajevo           100      106      105      98       94       90
Skopje             139      135     125      117      108      103
Working Ratios
Belgrade           110      107      102      93       88       82
Novi Sad           107      114      107      97       91       84
Sarajevo            82       84       81      75       71       67
Skopje             112      103       97      88       82       76
3.       Despite tariff increases in 1982 which were less  than inflation,
RTOs Belgrade and Skopje both forecast reductions in working ratios in that
year. At Novi Sad, where rail traffic was affected most by the heavy import
restrictions imposed by the Government during the year, working ratio is
forecast to rise from 107 to 114 and operating ratio from 127 to 135 while
RTO Sarajevo also forecasts a small rise in working ratio.  Operating ratio
at RTO Belgrade is forecast to rise in 1982 despite the forecast reduction
in working ratio because of a new law increasing minimum depreciation rates
on fixed assets.  Forecast ratios at all four RTOs show a steady improvement
in years from 1983 reflecting programs for stringent control of costs as
well as real increases in tariffs each year.  This is calculated to bring
about a reduction in the level of compensation payments at all RTOs in
accordance with an agreed program.



-70-
ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.       This program for the progressive reduction and eventual elimination
of compensation payments is in the form of annual targets for operating
ratios_/  based on operating revenues without  compensation payments.   The
operating ratios forecast above have been adopted as targets for 1983 to
1986 with targets for subsequent years showing ratios reducing to 90 at all
RTOs.
5.       Forecast Rates of Return on Net Fixed Assets are shown below:
Actual                      Forecast
RTO           1981     1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
Belgrade       2.1      2.8      4.2      3.2     3.5      2.9
Novi Sad       2.6      4.0    12.2    11.4    10.0    11.4
Sarajevo       1.3      1.1      2.0     2.9      4.0      4.9
Skopje          -       2.7      3.7     3.4      3.3      3.0
6.       High rates of return at Novi Sad reflect the low net value of the
generally old fixed assets in that RTO.  Rates of return at all RTOs depend
upon compensation  payments.   Without  compensation  payments  the  rates  of
return in the table above would be negative for all RTOs except Sarajevo.
In the circumstances of Yugoslav Railways where the main financial objective
is to eliminate compensation payments and achieve viability through tariffs,
it is considered that operating ratios as shown above should be the main
target and measure of financial improvement and that separate targets for
rate of return on net fixed assets should not be given.
7.       Debt/Equity ratios are forecast as follows;
Actual                  Forecast
RTO            1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986

Skopje        27/73    20/80   19/81   17/83   15/85   14/86
8.       Debt equity ratios are generally low reflecting minimum borrowings
and equity values increased by asset revaluations during a period of high
inflation.  The low ratios for Sarajevo reflect the considerable amount of
grant capital which the RTO received for line doubling and track improve-
ments during the last plan period.

12.      Compensation payments have generally had the effect of maintaining
reasonable levels of cash and working capital.  Agreement should be reached
at negotiations that each RTO will do its best to ensure that cash levels
will not fall below 8% and other working capital below 15% of cash working
expenses.   High levels of outstanding creditors  reflect  in part,  amounts
owing for services by associated BOALs.  It was agreed at negotiations that
target ratios of 3.0 (current) and 2.5 (liquid) would be aimed at by all
RTOs for 1986.
