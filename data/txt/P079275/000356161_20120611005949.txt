       A. SUMMARY
   1.     This Restructuring Paper proposes a second level restructuring of the Rural
   Capacity Building Project (RCBP) for a reallocation of proceeds for IDA Credit No.
   42010 and CIDA co-financing TF 090084.

       B. PROJECT STATUS
   2.      Implementation of RCBP is close to completion. With a few exceptions, most
   notably the construction of a livestock quarantine station at Metema, project activities
   will be completed by June 30, 2012. All indications are that the Project Development
   Objective: “to assist the Ethiopian Government to strengthen agricultural services and
   systems and make them more responsive to clients' needs? will, to some extent, be
   achieved by the extended closing date. Achievements will be properly quantified by an
   impact evaluation study currently under way. A final supervision mission of the Project
   was undertaken from April 22 to May 7, 2012 during which it was agreed that Ministry
   of Agriculture would fully take over the construction of the Metema Livestock
   Quarantine Station but carry this out at its own pace. Since other components have been
   curtailed due to a financing gap faced by the Project, funds allocated for the construction
   of the station can be used to cover outstanding activities under other components of the
   Project.

       C. PROPOSED CHANGES
   3.       Reallocations: In a letter to the Country Director on May 22, 2012 (Attachment
   1), the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) has formally requested
   for a reallocation of IDA Credit No. 42010-ET and Grant No.TF090084. The Task Team
   has reviewed budgetary requirements, by category, to allow proper completion of Project
   activities and proposes that proceeds for Rural Capacity Building Project be reallocated
   as follows:

   IDA Credit No. 42010-ET

            4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to shift funds allocated to the construction
            of the Metema Livestock Quarantine Station to cover some outstanding activities under
            other components of the Project, particularly expenditures on long term training. An audit
            report for the year ended 7 July, 2011 was submitted to the Bank on time and found to be
            of satisfactory quality albeit with a qualified opinion. The Task Team has confirmed that
            issues raised by the audit are currently being addressed. The next audit report is expected
            January 7, 2013.
