           SUMMARY
   1.       This Restructuring Paper proposes a second level restructuring of the Rural
   Capacity Building Project (RCBP) and accompanying amendments to the Project’s legal
   documents whereby the project development objective and outcomes remain unchanged.
   The proposed changes are: (i) an eight-month extension of the closing date of the project
   up to June 30, 2012; and (ii) reallocation of proceeds for Credit No. 42010. These
   changes would allow the Government of Ethiopia to complete some essential project
   activities currently underway and to carry out a rigorous evaluation of the Project’s
   impacts as well as to document lessons learnt.


           PROJECT STATUS
   2.       After a slow start up, implementation of the Rural Capacity Building Project
   (RCBP) has been proceeding moderately well. Disbursements are strong, particularly on
   Components 2 (Strengthening Agricultural Extension Services) and Component 3
   (Enhancing Institutional Capacity of the Agricultural Research System), which constitute
   the bulk of the Project’s funding. While implementation is slightly delayed, most
   activities are close to completion or the prerequisites to move quickly have been fulfilled.
   All indications are that the Project Development Objective: “to assist the Ethiopian
   Government to strengthen agricultural services and systems and make them more
   responsive to clients' needs? will be achieved by the extended closing date. This will be
   further confirmed by an impact evaluation study to be undertaken in mid FY12


           PROPOSED CHANGES
   3.      Reallocations: In a letter to the Country Director on October 12, 2011
   (Attachment 1), the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) has
   formally requested for a reallocation of IDA Credit No. 42010. The Task Team has
   reviewed budgetary requirements, by category, to allow proper completion of Project
   activities and proposes that proceeds for Rural Capacity Building Project, Credit No.
   42010 be reallocated as follows:

                                                       Allocation

   4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to: (i) ensure that planned training and
   physical capacity building activities are properly implemented; and (ii) to program a
   small amount of unallocated funds. The RCBP Steering Committee has determined that
   some operating costs and grants as well as cost overruns on civil works and procurement
   of goods that have arisen due to inflation can be covered by an allocation from the
   Government treasury – while project funds are reallocated to training and physical
   capacity building. An audit report for the year ended 7 July, 2010 was submitted to the
   Bank on time and found to be of satisfactory quality albeit with a qualified opinion. The
   Task Team has confirmed that issues raised by the audit are currently being addressed.
   The next audit report is expected January 7, 2012.

   5.      Closing date extension: In a letter to the Country Director on May 12 2011
   (Attachment 2), MoFED requested that the Project closing date be extended until March
   31, 2012. In its letter of October 12, 2011, it has indicated that due to implementation
   delays beyond the control of the Project, some activities cannot be completed by March
   31, 2012 and has asked that the Bank instead extend the closing date to June 30, 2012.
   The Task Team believes that most project activities will be completed by December 31,
   2012 with the following exceptions. (a) long term training; (b) research projects started
   through the National and Regional Agricultural Research Funds (NARF/RARF); (c)
   construction of a livestock quarantine station at Metema; (d) delivery and installation of
   IT infrastructure equipment to support the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX); (e)
   implementation of development innovation grants in two agricultural colleges; and (e)
   M&E activities such as documentation of lessons learnt and evaluation of project impact.
   Not all of these activities will be completed by the Project; e.g., NARF/RARF research
   projects will be institutionalized through a national competitive agricultural research
   grants program; and, while the Project will take most long term training to completion,
   some students entered the program late with the understanding that the Ministry of
   Agriculture (MoA) would take over the remaining cost of training. The MoA is
   committed to do so. The remaining activities can be completed by June 30, 2012. The
   Task Team therefore agrees with the amended request from MoFED and proposes that
   the closing date for RCBP, Credit No. 42010 be extended from October 31, 2011 until
   June 30, 2012. This will be the first extension of the project.

   6.          The proposed extension is necessary for the following reasons:

        i.     Under its support to market institutions component, the Project has planned the
               construction and equipping of a quarantine station on a major livestock trade
               route (through Metema) to maintain quality of Ethiopia’s livestock exports.
               Construction on the quarantine station was started on July 1, 2010 but, as per the
               Bank’s recommendation, was halted because the land for the station was acquired
               without an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) while 12 households
               have been displaced. Preparation of the ARAP is now completed and its
                                                   6
        implementation underway. Construction is expected to resume soon. Extension of
        the closing date would give the GoE sufficient time to complete all construction
        work (being carried out in two phases) once the issue of resettlement is resolved
        and to fully equip the station once its construction is completed.

  ii.   Also, under its support to market institutions component, RCBP is providing partial
        support to bringing information technology solutions for more effective operation of the
        ECX. Delays in procurement have meant that delivery and installation of IT
        infrastructure to the Exchange can only be completed in April, 2012. A further two
        months are required to test the equipment and have the supplier redress any issues before
        accepting the goods as delivered.

 iii.   A key aspect of making agricultural services more responsive to clients’ needs is
        reorienting Agricultural Technical and Vocational Education Training (ATVET).
        RCBP has provided institutional strengthening and development innovation grants
        to federal agricultural colleges towards this end. While the institutional
        strengthening grants are mostly completed, implementation of the development
        innovation grants has been slow, as it is linked to complementary activities to
        elaborate a new ATVET National Strategy and individual strategic plans for the
        colleges that are in line with the National Strategy and has faced procurement
        difficulties. Although complementary activities are now finalized, the
        development innovation grants require additional time to be properly used.

 iv.    On the Agriculture Research Component, the Project has introduced competitive
        grants to support broad based, innovative research projects. National and Regional
        Agricultural Research Funds (NARF/RARFs) have been set up and research
        projects awarded. The Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research (EIAR) that
        is the primary implementing agency for the Agriculture Research Component is
        developing a strategy for mobilizing resources from various private and public
        stakeholders for the competitive agricultural research grants program. The EIAR
        has agreed with the Task Team on a timeframe for the institutionalizing of the
        competitive grants program which is expected to take over from the Project only
        in late FY 2012. The proposed extension will allow RCBP to continue to support
        awarded NARF/RARF projects until the competitive agricultural research grants
        program can take over.

7.     In addition to the above, the extension would allow sufficient time for an in depth
impact evaluation and associated case studies to allow the GoE to assess the impact from
the project and to draw lessons from the implementation of the RCBP for effective
implementation of related Projects such as the Ethiopia Agricultural Growth Project.

8.     During the most recent supervision and implementation support mission, the Task
Team has reviewed and accepted an action plan that lays out remaining activities and
timeframe for their completion; and, has agreed on actions to enhance implementation.
No     action    is    required     for    compliance      with    loan    covenants.
