PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OMAN: ENGINEERING FOR POWER AND URBAN WATER SUPPLY
(LOAN 1442-OH)
PREFACE
This is the Completion Report of the Engineering for Power and Urban
Water Supply Project for which Loan 1442-OM was approved on May 18, 1977, for
US$ 1,500,000, of which US$ 1,088,601 was disbursed and US$ 411,399 was
cancelled on May 15, 1981. The objective of the project was to prepare the
studies necessary to enable Oman (i) to address the urgent development needs
of the power and urban water supply sector in the period through 1980; (ii) to
carry out the next phase of development through 1985; and (iii) to improve
sector institutions.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Region Office on the basis of a review carried out in
Washington during February 1982. Comments from the Oman Government indicate
concurrence with the findings of the Project Completion Report. These
comments are attached in Annex 6 to this report.
The project has not been subjected to audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OMAN: ENGINEERING FOR POWER AND URBAN WATER SUPPLY
(LOAN 1442-OM)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project consisted of the preparation of studies necessary for the
Government to undertake the rehabilitation and expansion of the power and
water supply sector in the short and medium term and to improve institutional
arrangements (para. 2.03).
The loan was approved in May 1977 and became effective in September
1977. Proposals received were substantially lower than original estimates and
US$ 411,399 or 27% of the loan was eventually cancelled. The consultants
mobilized rapidly and produced their reports with diligence. The Government
accepted these reports, except the one on institutional aspects which it found
inappropriate. The Bank concurred with this view.
The project was very successful, the major objective of
rehabilitating and expanding the power and water supply sector having been
rapidly undertaken by the Government. Supplies of electricity and water have
already improved dramatically while water losses have been substantially
reduced (para. 4.03).
The principal lesson learned is that consultants expected to advise
on institutional matters should have developing country experience (para.
5.01).
Another point of special interest is the identification of a major
water source (para. 3.05).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ENGINEERING FOR POWER AND URBAN WATER SUPPLY
LOAN 1442 OM
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Oman occupies most of the southern corner of the Arabian peninsula,
and covers an area estimated at 300,000 square kilometers. No reliable popu-
lation census has been taken, and estimates of the total population in 1975
ranged from 750,000, based on UN figures, to the Government's official esti-
mate of 1.5 million. The dominant urban region is the Capital Area, compris-
ing a strip some 50 km in length along the coast between the Sultan's palaces
in Muscat and Seeb. The 1975 population of the Capital Area was estimated at
about 80,000. Oman's second urban region, Salalah, located along the southern
coast some 850 km southwest of the Capital Area, had a 1975 population of less
than 25,000. Some 30 towns and villages were all much smaller in size.
1.02     Oman has an arid climate characterized by extremely hot and dry
summers and mild winters. Annual precipitation averages about 100 mm along
the Gulf coast and rises to about 300 mm in the Hajar mountain range in the
north. Scarcity of water has been a factor limiting agricultural development
of the country. Since 1973 various water resources studies have been conduct-
ed, and considerable information exists on the water available in the country.
1.03     Prior to exploitation of oil, which was first commercially exported
in 1967, Oman's economy was at a subsistence level and was based entirely on
agriculture, fisheries and handicrafts. Infrastructure was negligible. The
road network consisted of only 10 kilometers of paved roadway and an unknown
length of earth tracks. There were no modern port facilities. The public
power system consisted of scattered small diesel generators. The Capital Area
had a small distribution system supplied by a total capacity of 2.2 MW. Sev-
eral unconnected diesel generators with a combined capacity of 2.1 MW served
Salalah. Water supplies consisted mostly of private wells, occasionally
equipped with diesel-powered pumps and a few small pipelines.
1.04     In July 1970 when Sultan Qaboos bin Said came to power, a series of
political and social reforms were initiated to transform the country's medi-
eval society into a modern one. The economic development efforts of the Gov-
ernment and the growth of the private sector caused dramatic increases in the
demand for basic infrastructure. The Government was thus anxious to complete
projects to provide, inter alia, electric power and water supply, particularly
in the urban areas.
1.05     Until 1978 most of Oman's infrastructure was the responsibility of
the Ministry of Communications, power and water being the responsibility of
two separate Directorates General. In June 1978, these Directorates were
taken over by a newly created Ministry for Electricity and Water. Omani and
expatriate skilled staff were extremely scarce. Technical staff were pre-
occupied mainly with managing construction of urgently needed facilities and
operating the rapidly expanding systems.



- 2 -
1.06     In 1974, the Ministry of Communications had contracted for the con-
struction of the Ghubrah desalination plant to provide a total of 50 MW of
power plus 18,250 m3/day of water. In the same year several other contracts
were signed to provide transmission systems to convey the electricity and
water produced at the Ghubrah desalination plant to the Capital Area. In 1976
the Ministry of Communications was already anticipating power shortages by
mid-1978 despite the committed installed capacity of 115 MW for the Capital
Area. This view, which was shared by the technical and economic planners, was
reflected in the country's first Five-Year 1976-1980 Development Plan, pub-
lished in mid-1976. This Plan envisaged expenditures totalling OR 122 million
(US$ 365 million) for the power and water sectors, about 15 percent of total
planned investments. Oman's request for Bank assistance led to the Engineer-
ing Loan described in this report.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     Request for Bank assistance was first made to a Bank economic mission
in November/December 1976 by the Minister of Communications, and was confirmed
by Oman's Development Council in January 1977. The request was for the Bank
to carry out or finance the execution of a study of Oman's electricity and
water requirements during the next ten years. The Bank confirmed its willing-
ness to assist the Government in February 1977.
2.02     In early March 1977, a former Bank staff member was contracted by the
Bank as consultant to prepare the project. Preparation work consisted of the
review of available sector information and the drafting of terms of reference
for the project studies at Bank Headquarters. A mission visited Oman during
the last ten days of March, 1977, and reached agreement with the Government on
the scope of the project, its objectives and the terms of reference for the
proposed b,udies.
2.03     The work of the proposed study was grouped into three phases and
included:
a)  Phase One
1. Studies to identify high priority projects to supply power and
water to the Capital Area and Salalah for the period 1977 - 1980,
and to prepare designs and tender documents for approved pro-
jects.
2. Supervision of construction and commissioning of facilities
for projects identified in Phase One (1) above.
b)  Phase 2
1.  Studies to identify projects required to meet urban power and
water requirements for the period 1981 - 1985 (essentially for
the Capital area, Salalah and 26 towns and villages), including
field investigations and preparation of feasibility studies with
preliminary designs.



-3-
2. Preparation of a master plan for development in the power and
water sectors covering the period 1986 - 1995.
c) Phase Three
1. Studies relating to strengthening the institutional structure,
organization, procedures, operations and finances, including ary
necessary legislative changes for the power and water sectors.
2.04     The objectives of the Project were included in the Consultant's terms
of reference. These objectives are detailed in Annex 1. The scope of the
work reflected the priority given by the Government to the expansion of ser-
vices in the Capital Area and Salalah. Hence these cities were included in
Phase One. However, since the Government had already arranged for the con-
struction of isolated power systems (up to 2.0 MW each) to supply 26 rural
towns and villages and because modern water supplies were non-existent in most
of these rural locations, these towns and villages were included in the scope
of work for Phases Two and Three. Finally, although contained in the project
description, the costs for (i) construction supervision for power and water
facilities for the Capital area and Salalah to be built by 1980, and (ii)
field investigations required for the studies had not been included in the
cost estimates for the study, because a realistic estimate for these could not
be established at the time of loan approval. These items were to be financed
separately by the Government. The Government was also to provide financing
for detailed engineering of projects recommended for implementation in the
period 1981 - 1985.
2.05     Bank loan negotiations were concluded on April 21, 1977.     An engineer-
ing loan of $1.5 million was approved in May 1977 to cover the foreign ex-
change portion of the cost of consulting services.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Invitation for engineering services was made in early 1977, and pro-
posals were received from four consulting firms in May 1977. Three of the
proposals contained offers of less than $ 1 million, i.e. substantially below
the original estimated cost of $ 2.5 million. The proposals were independent-
ly evaluated by the Ministry of Communications and the Bank, and after some
exchange of views concurrence was reached to enter negotiations with a con-
sulting consortium from the United Kingdom. The consultant's proposal was
accepted in principle by the Government on June 18, 1977 and the contract was
signed on July 10, 1977. The contract amounted to $954,000 equivalent. Annex
2 provides a list of the key dates and Annex 3 provides data on consulting
manpower and costs.
3.02     The power and water studies were conceived to be implemented as
separate but related activities, linked primarily by the existence and possi-
ble expansion of the Ghubrah thermal power and desalination plant serving the
Capital Area. This separation between the power and water supply studies was
observed consistently:



-4 -
a) Within the Bank, the Water Supply and Power Divisions were
responsible for the project, with the Water Supply Division
designated as the lead division;
b) in Oman, power and water systems were the responsibility of two
separate Directorates, at first within the Ministry of Communica-
tions, and after 1978 within the Ministry for Electricity and
Water;
c) the terms of reference for the consultant contained separate
scopes of work for the power and water studies;
d)  the consultant's team comprised two main firms, each working
fairly independently, albeit under common leadership, on their
respective tasks.
Reports for Phase One, which covered immediate measures to be taken were
required within three months for both sectors. Reports for the remaining
phases were scheduled for 12 months after commencement for the power study and
26 months for the water study, where considerable field work was anticipated.
3.03     The consultants mobilized quickly and arrived in Oman in August 1977,
less than one month after the signature of their contract. The draft Phase
One reports were prepared during the first four months, separately for power
and for water supply. A consultant was engaged separately by the local Gov-
ernnor to advise on the water supply situation in the Salalah city area. This
city was therefore not included in the Phase One of the water supply study,
although it was included in the power study.
3.04     The draft Phase One Power report underwent extensive revision follow-
ing discussions with the Government, and was finalized and issued in March
1978, i.e. eight months after it was started. The Phase Two Power study,
which covered developments from 1981 to 1985, was done only for the Capital
Area and Salalah, because service to the other 26 rural towns and villages was
contracted by the Ministry to another organization, the Oman National Electric
Company, which would be looking after the operational and developmental needs
of these communities. The Phase Two Report was submitted by the Consultant in
January 1979. An interim report for the Phase Three Power Studies, which
covered institutional arrangements and accounting procedures, was submitted to
the newly created Ministry of Electricity and Water in July, 1978. However,
for reasons explained in para. 4.04, the Consultant was instructed by the
Ministry to discontinue work on this Phase of the studies.
3.05     The draft Phase One Water report, which covered water supply develop-
ments for the Capital Area up to 1980 was submitted in November 1977. An
important contribution of this study was the identification of a major surface
water source at Wadi Dayqah some 90 km. southeast of the Capital Area. A
study was thus initiated to determine the feasibility of using this source.
This feasibility study financed under the Bank Loan proceeded until Loan
closing and subsequently continued with Government funds. The study is now
nearing completion. The Phase Two Water report, which presented development
proposals for the period 1981 to 1985 for the Capital Area, was completed in
April 1979. Hoever, the report for rural towns and villages was not completed



until the latter part of 1980. A preliminary Phase Three Report on institu-
tional recommendations for the water supply sector was completed by the con-
sultant in July 1978. However, for reasons explained in para. 4.04, further
work on this phase of the studies was discontinued at the request of the Min-
istry of Electricity and Water. The full report was never completed.
3.06     The original Loan Closing Date was December 31, 1979, and the actual
Closing Date was May 15, 1981. This slippage was due to a delay of about one
year in completing the engineering water studies and another four and one half
months to finalize disbursements. Bank Loan disbursements totalled
$1,088,601.38, and some 27% of the original loan amount of $ 1.5 million was
cancelled. The disbursements are listed in Annex 5.
Outcome of the Studies
3.07     The recommendations of the final Phase One Power Study Report for the
1978-80 developments in the Capital Area and Salalah were generally accepted
and implemented by the Government. In the Capital Area this involved (i) the
procurement and installation of three 17.5 MW gas turbine generation units in
1977/78 and a further six 17.5 MW units in 1978/79; (ii) construction of a 132
KV transmission line; and (iii) the expansion of the low voltage distribution
system. In Salalah two 6.8 MW diesel generation units were ordered and in-
stalled in 1978/79. The consultant was retained by the Ministry to help
implement the recommended developments, except for the low voltage distribu-
tion system which the Ministry undertook itself.
3.08     The Phase Two Power Report recommended that for the Capital Area a 50
MW steam generation plant be installed at Ghubrah by 1983. The Ministry, how-
ever, decided to continue to use gas turbines which, although not the best
alternative, were cheaper in capital cost, quicker and easier to-procure and
install.
3.09     Based on the consultant's Water Studies, a water supply project was
identified for possible Bank financing, comprising:
(a) water supply development for the Capital Area
- modifications to the existing desalination plant in order to
increase its output;
- development of the nearby Wadi Mayh groundwater source as a
near-term supply; this prospective source was identified by the
consultant late in 1978;
- distribution and storage facilities;
- equipment to improve operational capabilities;
- detailed engineering of a long-term supply source;
(b) water supply program for villages;
(c) wastewater master plan for the Capital Area.
The appraisal of the proposed project with Wadi Mayh as groundwater source
could not be completed, however, as its feasibility could not be demonstrated
due to the lack of data to confirm the quantity and quality of the water and
to the increasing use of this source for agriculture.

3.10     In the event, because the other potential source for the Capital
Area, Wadi Dayqah, could not be developed rapidly enough to meet near-term
requirements, the Ministry decided to construct a second desalination unit at
the Ghubrah plant. Separate consultants were engaged by the Ministry to pre-
pare technical specifications and tender documents for international competi-
tive bidding for this desalination unit. These documents were sent to the
Bank for review in May 1980. Nevertheless, the Government preferred to obtain
financing from Arab sources rather than from the Bank. A contract was sub-
sequently awarded, and the new desalination plant is expected to be operation-
al by late 1982.
IV. PERFORMANCE
4.01     This engineering loan, and the Bank supervision of the studies, pro-
vided the technical assistance requested by the Government. A review of the
key dates (Annex 2) confirms that the Bank reacted promptly to the Govern-
ment's request, the loan having been approved within six months of this
request. Consultants began work in Oman less than three months later. The
list of Bank missions shows that fourteen technical missions were mobilized to
prepare and supervise the project over a period of 39 months.
4.02     The principal objectives of Phases One and Two of the power and water
studies, as outlined in Annex 1, were achieved. The studies provided the
first comprehensive development plan for power systems in the Capital Area and
28 towns and villages. The studies also provided the Government with useful
data and analyses for the development of the basic power and water supply
infrastructure at minimum economic cost.
4.03     The Government has been implementing most of the technical recommen-
dations of the study. Supplies of electricity and water have improved dramat-
ically in the Capital Area. Water losses were substantially reduced. The
improvements in water supplies in the towns and villages outside the Capital
Area and Salalah have been equally impressive. Feasibility level studies
exist for 28 towns and villages and by early 1982 new systems had been design-
ed and constructed in four towns, with eight more in the process of implemen-
tation.
4.04     The institutional and financial objectives associated with Phase
Three of the project were not achieved. These aspects of the study were sub-
contracted by the consultants to two elderly individuals who had no experience
in developing countries. The Bank felt some concern about their suitability
but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for objection and decided
to await their initial report before forming a judgment. As feared, their
report put forth recommendations which were overly elaborate and inappropriate
to Omani conditions. The Bank agreed with the Minister that little would be
gained by pursuing these aspects of the study, and the consultants were asked
to suspend work on them. The Minister was nevertheless keen to initiate
organizational changes which would lead to improved efficiency and better
financial control and hoped measures to this effect could be introduced in
conjunction with the implementation of a project which was under discussion
between the Government and the Bank. However, as pointed out in paras. 3.09
and 3.10, this project did not materialize and for the only remaining near-
term alternative, the Government elected to proceed with funding from Arab
sources rather than from the Bank.



V. LESSONS LEARNED
5.01     The Bank's experience with this project reinforces its long-standing
knowledge that developing country experience is essential for consultants,
especially for those who are called upon to advise on institutional matters.

OMAN - POWER AND URBAN WATER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
OBJECTIVES IN CONSULTANT'VS TERMS OF REFERENCEI/
1.   The required work can be divided inco three activities related to
the short-term, long-term and institutional requirements of the power
and urban water seccors as follows:
Phase One - Power and Urban Water Development Program Through 1980
The objectives of the Phase One part of the Study are:
(a) to quickly determine the least-cost development
program for supplying the power and water require-
ments of the Capital Area and Salalah through 1980;
and
*(b) to implement the approved projects in this short
term program, including the design, procurement,
supervision of construction and commissioning of
facilities.
Phase Two - Power and Urban Water Development Program Through 1995
and Feasibility Studies Through 1985
The objectives of the Phase Two work are:
(a)  to determine   the least-cost   program to meet    the
power and urban water requirements for the Capital
Area and Salalah in the short-term period 1981-1985
and to conduct feasiability studies and related
exploration work so that the recommended projects
are fully prepared for the commitment of the relaced
investments for the detailed 1981-1985 development
program.   For the specified towns and villages the
least cost program for power and water supply
facilities should be prepared in detail from the
present until 1985.
(b)  to prepare a broad plan for future projects required
to meet the long-term 1986-1995 power and water
requirements at least cost as a basis for initiating
feasibility studies of the identified projects and
as a guide to future investment requirements.
/   These objectives form part of the Terms of Reference prepared
for the consultants and presenced in the Technical Appendix to
the Presidents' Report of May 18, 1977.

Phase Three - Institutional Recommendations for the Power and Water
Supply Sectors
The objective of Phase Three is to prepare recommenda-
tions  for  improvement   in  the  legislacion,   structure,
organization, finance, procedures, operations and mainte-
nance of the power and urban water systems in the Capital
Area, Salalah and the specified towns and villages.
2.    Although the three activities have been designated as Phases, the
actual work related to achieving the objectives of the three Phases of
the Study would necessarily overlap, to some extent, particularly the
institutional requirements which must be considered from the outset of
the Study.
3.    In conducting a power study, normally the long-term program would
be developed initiating the short-term projects.        In this Study, the
results of exploration programs including groundwater investigations may
dictate the possible need for desalinacion for water supply in
particular cases. This, in turn, may affect the power program if power/
desalination stations are found to be part of the least-cost, power/
water development program.     Therefore the long-term program cannot be
fully developed until the water resource situation is clarified for each
town or vi_lage.    Thus the timing of the work related to achieving the
short-term, long-term and institutional objecciv2s is not necessarily
sequential.
