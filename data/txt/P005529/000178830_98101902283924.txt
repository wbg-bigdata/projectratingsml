INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED ENGINEERING LOAN
TO THE SULTANATE OF OMAN FOR POWER AND WATER STUDIES
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Sultanate of Oman for the equivalent of US$1.5 million to help finance
studies of the power and water sectors. The loan would have a term of 10
years, including 2 years of grace, with interest at 8.20 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Oman'" dated February 10, 1976 was distributed to the Executive Directors on
February 17, 1976. An economic mission visited Oman in November/December 1976
and is preparing its report. Its main findings are summarized below. Country
data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The Sultanate of Oman occupies most of the southern corner of the
Arabian Peninsula covering an area officially estimated at 300,000 square
kilometers. Since no reliable population census has been taken in Oman,
little is yet known of the size, characteristics or the detailed geographical
distribution of its population. Under these circumstances, estimates of total
population for 1975 range from 750,000 (based on the UN estimate for 1974) to
the Government's official estimate, adopted for planning purposes, of 1.5
million.
4.        Oil dominates the economy.   Deposits of limestone and natural gas
are known to exist in commercially exploitable quantities, but they have not
yet been exploited. Deposits of copper, iron, coal and asbestos are also
known to exist, but their value remains to be established. The only other
natural resource which is currently being tapped in commercial quantities is
fisheries. Due to scarce water resources, the total area under cultivation
is limited to 36,000 ha, which is less than 0.2 percent of the total area of
the country, although nearly 60 percent of the Omanis live in rural areas.
Recent Developments
5.        When Sultan Qaboos took power from his father in mid-1970, he
initiated a series of political and social reforms to transform a medieval
society into a modern one, with the principal aim of boosting economic
development as rapidly as possible. As part of this process, he undertook
a major government reorganization, which resulted in significant power being
delegated to individual ministers and the creation of three high-level coun-
cils to control and coordinate development activities and expenditures.
However, Oman continues to suffer from a serious shortage of trained Omani
manpower at both a managerial and worker level; it is thus heavily dependent,
and for the foreseeable future will continue to be dependent, on expensive
expatriate services in almost all fields.



- 2 -
6.        The decade-old guerrilla movement in the southern province of
Dhofar, known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman, gave rise to
heavy defense expenditures. Following a major offensive launched in late
1975, guerrilla activities seem to have been substantially crushed, if not
stopped, but the process of consolidation in Dhofar has not allowed such
expenditures to decrease since then.
7.        Prior to the commercial exploitation of oil, Oman's economy existed
at a subsistence level, based entirely on agriculture, fishing and some minor
handicraft activities. Output probably merely kept pace with the growth of
the population. Since 1967, with the emergence of oil as a major export,
Oman's economy witnessed a period of significant growth as well as structural
change. Real GDP is roughly estimated to have increased between 4-6 percent
annually between 1967 and 1973, about 40 percent from 1973 to 1974, and 20
percent from 1974 to 1975; a much smaller growth rate is expected in 1976.
The growth of oil revenues provided the basis for this exceptionally rapid
growth, including public expenditures for development. This, in turn, is
reflected in the expansion of construction, public administration and trade.
The share of the oil sector in GDP rose from an estimated 30 percent in 1967
to over 67 percent in 1970 and thereafter; the share of construction, almost
negligible prior to 1967, grew to 10 percent of GDP in 1970, and subsequently
leveled off in the 10-16 percent range. Public administration expenditure
las continued to increase in importance, from 2 percent in 1967 to 7 percent
in 1975. The agriculture sector stagnated and accounted for only 2 percent
of GDP in 1975, in contrast to 37 percent in 1967.
8.        Using the 1974 UN population estimate of 750,000, the per capita
GNP is estimated at $1,980 in 1975, based on the Bank's Atlas methodology.
However, based on the current official Government estimate of 1.5 million
people, the per capita GNP would be half that figure. Both figures are mis-
leading as a measure of the income and living standards of the average Omani.
A high proportion of the income generated in oil, industry, construction,
transport and commerce accrues to the foreigners who undertake those activi-
ties, although the Government receives most oil revenues. Taking this into
account, the average per capita income of an Omani is roughly estimated at
around $485 in 1975; but even this does not reveal the true picture of the
poverty and backwardness of the bulk of the population. While the average
per capita income of Omanis in major urban centers (who make up 25 percent of
the total population) is estimated at about $1,250, most of the rural popula-
tion (which accounts for approximately 60 percent of the total population, the
remaining 15 percent being expatriates), has an average per capita income of
less than $200 per year, even including transfer incomes from families working
in urban centers and neighboring countries.
9.        Oil revenues account for almost all government revenues and foreign
exchange earnings. There are two views as to Oman's oil reserves. One, which
seems more realistic on the basis of available data, estimates Oman's estab-
lished oil reserves at only 1.1 billion barrels as of January 1975, which is
equivalent to 9 years production at the 1975 production rate (125 million bar-
rels). The other, less plausible, estimate is 3 billion barrels, which would



extend the 1975 level of production up to 24 years. Oman is not a member of
OPEC but follows most OPEC decisions. The only company so far producing and
exporting oil is Petroleum Development (Oman) Limited (PDO), in which the
Government acquired a 60 percent share in 1974. While extensive exploration,
both on and offshore, is underway by foreign companies, only two new fields
with very limited reserves have so far been found in Dhofar and in the Straits
of Hormuz (offshore) near the Musandam Peninsula. Production from these fields
will require substantial investments, and hence the companies involved have not
yet decided whether to invest the required amounts. The costs of production
from these new fields will be considerably higher than that of other oil
produced in Oman and in neighboring Gulf countries. Even if these new fields
are exploited in the medium-term future, the total volume of oil production
will continue to decline for some time from the peak level (135 million bar-
rels) reached in 1976, mainly due to technical problems at the existing oil
wells.
10.       The relatively high level of oil income has enabled the Government
to sustain high levels of expenditure in the post-1970 period, when the Gov-
ernment launched major investment projects aimed at providing the minimum
amount of economic and social infrastructure, as well as a substantially
increased defense effort to combat the guerrilla operations in Dhofar. Gross
capital formation increased from 18 to 37 percent of GNP between 1970 and 1975
while the proportion of defense expenditures in GNP grew from 15 to 39 percent
over the same period. With the concomitant growth of recurrent expenditure
for the maintenance of social infrastructure, the ratio of national savings to
gross national product declined from 58 percent in 1970 to 34 percent in 1975,
thus requiring external resources to finance part of the capital formation.
Over the same period, the ratio of public to total investment increased from
around 22 to 78 percent. Most of the private investment has remained in the
oil sector.
11.       The higher levels of public expenditures since 1970 brought about
a marked deterioration in the fiscal situation. The budget, which showed a
surplus of OR 25 million in 1970, registered deficits of about OR 18 million
in 1972, OR 65 million in 1974, and OR 43 million in 1975. The deterioration
took place despite continued increases in revenues resulting from successive
upward revisions of oil prices (more or less in line with OPEC prices), as
well as of the Government's share of income taxes and royalties and its income
from its shares in PDO. While the Government's total revenue increased from
OR 45 million in 1970 to OR 459 million in 1975, development expenditures
also increased from an estimated OR 2 million to OR 173 million in that
period.  The overall budgetary deficits since 1972 were financed partly by
short-term borrowing from banks at home and abroad, and partly by drawing
down Government reserves, as well as by loans and grants from neighboring
governments.
12.       The increased level of economic activity brought about a substantial
increase in the money supply, which grew from OR 7.6 million in 1970 to an
estimated OR 94 million in 1976, an average annual increase of 54 percent.
With an expanded money supply and the economy's limited production capacity
together with the limited import capacity due to severe port congestion,



inflationary pressures were exerted on prices, particularly during 1974 and
1975. In 1976 however, due to declining growth of both Government expenditure
and money supply, as well as increased imports following improvements in
port facilities, inflationary pressures seem to have lightened significantly,
although no reliable domestic price data are available.
13.       Since the private sector plays only a minor role in the economy and
all goods and services are imported under liberal trade and exchange regimes,
Oman's balance of payments closely reflects developments in the public sector.
Like the budget, the balance of payments has registered deficits since 1972.
Due to increased Government spending, imports of goods and services increased
by 88 percent per year in current prices during 1970-75, and reached OR 360
million in 1975, resulting in commensurate increases in current account
deficits, even though oil exports rose sharply from OR 44 million in 1970 to
OR 373 million in 1975. Non-oil exports amounted to less than OR 1 million
annually in recent years. Increased imports of services reflected Oman's
increasing reliance on expatriate labor and foreign construction companies.
Compared to a surplus of OR 28 million in 1970 the current account balance
registered a deficit of OR 25 million in 1972 and increased to OR 116 million
in 1975. However, a smaller deficit is projected for 1976, mainly due to
stabilized commodity imports accompanied by an increase in oil exports by
about OR 100 million.
14.       These current account deficits were financed partly by grants, mainly
from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, and partly by external commercial
loans. Private foreign capital investment appears to have contributed little
to financing these deficits, mainly because of Oman's unfavorable resource
endowment, including a small domestic market and a shortage of trained man-
power, rather than to inadequate incentives. Use of accumulated foreign ex-
change reserves was necessary in every year since 1972, to fill the gap in the
current account. Thus, Oman's net reserves fell from OR 82 million at the end
of 1970 to OR 33 million at the end of 1975, and declined further to OR 8 mil-
lion by the end of September, 1976, representing approximately one month of
commodity imports.
15.       Oman had no foreign debts outstanding until 1972.    Since then, it
has acquired sizeable debts. They totalled OR 78 million (outstanding
and disbursed) as of December 1975. The structure of Oman's officially re-
ported external debts is heavily biased toward commercial loans. Some 20 per-
cent of outstanding debt was in supliers' credits, 60 percent in commercial
bank credits, and the remainder in governments' and Bank loans. Thus, most
of the debt has medium-term maturities of 3-7 years, and interest rates of
6-9 percent. Debt service payments on existing loans amounted to OR 13
million in 1975, about 3.5 percent of Oman's export earnings. These debt
service payments were stable for 1975, but are projected to rise slightly
in 1976 with a similar debt service ratio.
The Five-Year Plan and Prospects of the Economy
16.       One of the striking features of the Plan, which was prepared under
a Technical Assistance Project which the Bank helped to finance in 1974, is



-5-
a sharp decline in the volume of public investment by about 20 percent per
annum between 1976-80, directly reflecting the prospect of falling oil revenues.
The Plan also projects a 3 percent per annum increase in GNP (1.5 percent in
GDP), despite a decrease in the value added in the oil sector by 2 percent per
annum. While construction is expected to decline by 11 percent per annum,
mainly due to declining Government development expenditures, agriculture and
manufacturing are projected to increase by 14 percent and 70 percent per annum
respectively. The Plan also projects a sharp decline in the share of economic
and social infrastructure investments in overall public investment: from 84
percent in 1976 to 60 percent in 1980. In the context of declining oil reve-
nues, it is important that in the next few years Oman's investment be con-
centrated in directly productive sectors, including fisheries. The Plan
therefore envisages investments in such projects as cement manufacture, a gas
pipeline, oil refining, fisheries development, a flour mill, and sponge iron
production.
17.       Most of the macro targets of the Plan were projected on the basis
of fairly rudimentary assumptions, and the projects, apart from a few major
ones, are mere concepts not yet supported by feasibility studies. The
economic growth targets, therefore, will probably be difficult to achieve.
The situation both in the presently exploited oil fields, and with regard to
new exploration activites, suggests that oil production will decline at a
somewhat faster rate than envisaged in the Plan. Similarly, slower growth
is expected in agriculture and manufacturing. Targets in manufacturing also
seem high and are unlikely to be achieved, due to delays in major public and
private projects and perhaps over-optimistic targets for private investment.
18.       With this background, GDP is at best likely to stagnate over the
Plan period, 1976-80. "Omanization" of the existing labor force will probably
not progress as fast as the Plan forecasts, due to limited training and other
educational shortcomings. The Plan also envisages a sharp decline in loans
and grants from OR 155 million in 1976 to OR 19 million in 1980 (in constant
prices), based mainly on the assumption that military expenditures will fall.
If they do not decline as fast as expected in the Plan, or if recurrent ex-
penditures grow faster than projected because of the operating and maintenance
costs associated with the large investment program in recent years, external
assistance requiremments are likely to be substantially higher than projected;
part of these requirements may continue to come as grants from neighboring
Arab countries. However, given its present low debt service ratio of 3.5
percent, Oman has the capacity to service conventional debt at much higher
levels of borrowing than projected in the Plan, and remains creditworthy for
Bank financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN OMAN
19.       The Bank has made only two loans totalling $8.4 million to Oman,
both in FY74, and none thereafter. The details are provided in Annex II.
The education project, for which a loan of $5.7 million was made in April



- 6 -
1974, was part of an integrated program of assistance by the Bank, UNDP
and the United Kingdom. Bank funds are financing two basic education/skill
training centers, a primary teacher training institute and an agricultural
secondary school; the United Kingdom and UNDP/UNESCO are financing technical
assistance and overseas fellowships.
20.       The second Bank loan, made in May 1974, provided $2.7 million for
a Technical Assistance Project to help finance three specialist teams for (i)
economic planning and management, (ii) agriculture and fisheries, and (iii)
transport. The work of these teams has been of considerable value to the
Government. The leader of the economic team and his colleagues were largely
responsible for the content of the country's first Five-Year Development Plan,
published in mid-1976. The team continues to play a central role in the
economic management of the country. It not only introduced an awareness of
the financial constraints likely to be faced, but shaped most of the budgetary
and fiscal procedures being followed by the Government. The transport team
has provided valuable advice to the Ministry of Communications in several
areas of road transport and development, and did feasibility studies which
formed the basis of the highway maintenance project, for which a loan of $15
million is being proposed. The agriculture team, after a slow start, is now
helping the Government to identify and prepare a future project in rural
development for Bank financing, and has provided agricultural research data
to the Government.
21.       These two projects, as well as likely future projects in fields such
as education, non-oil industrial development (cement), fisheries, telecommuni-
cations, rural development, and development finance companies, are designed to
help Oman to develop despite the following serious constraints it faces: the
acute shortage of trained manpower; the absence of a non-oil productive re-
source base; and the lack of an institutional framework within which economic
development benefitting all Omanis can be approached on the basis of economic
priorities, technical feasibility and least-cost solutions. The Government is
becoming increasingly aware of the need for selective development, made all
the more imperative by the prospect of declining oil revenues in the early
1980s; an example of this was its recent request to the Bank to organize and
monitor studies to determine short and long-term priority power and urban
water needs in the country, and how these can be met on a least cost basis,
which constitutes the basis of the proposed project.
22.       IFC has made no investments in Oman, but has expressed an interest
in helping to finance industrial development in the private sector. Oman has
purchased almost $40 million of Bank bonds, of which $30 million consisted of
15-year bonds purchased in 1974.
PART III - THE POWER AND WATER SECTORS
23.       The greatly increased economic activity, undertaken following the
commercial exploitation of oil starting in the late 1960s, has resulted in an



- 7 -
unprecedented surge in all aspects of economic, social and commercial develop-
ment, with accompanying increased demands for electric power and water,
centered in the Capital Area (comprising the cities of Muscat, Mutrah and
Ruwi) and the coastal strip extending to Sib.
The Power Sector
24.       Oman had no public electricity supply until 1948 when the Municipal-
ity of Muscat installed small diesel generating sets to serve the city. In
1967, private interests purchased this system, constructed the Riyam Bay diesel
station and expanded the distribution system to supply the Capital Area. In
1971, the Government purchased these facilities, consisting of about 4 MW
generating capacity, as the basis for expanding public electric service. At
the time the country's total generating capacity was only about 22 MW, in-
cluding privately-owned diesel stations at industrial sites, at the oil fields,
and 2 MW of public supply at the major town of Salalah in the south.
25.       Since 1972 the country's generating capacity has expanded six-fold
to about 134 MW. Public electricity supply is the responsibility of the
Directorate General of Electricity (DGE) which reports to the Ministry of
Communications. DGE supplies the Capital Area via a 33/115-kV transmission
system from the Riyam Bay diesel station and the Ghubra power and desalination
station (totalling 114 MW capacity), supplies Salalah and seven regional towns
from separate isolated systems, and is constructing small systems to supply
nineteen rural centers. The national oil company, Petroleum Development (Oman)
Ltd., owns power stations at the oil fields in the interior and at the oil-
loading facilities in the Capital Area. Because of the absence of an adequate
public supply system, there are also many small generating sets scattered
throughout the country supplying industries, shops, schools, hospitals and
military establishments.
26.       The country's national power system can be divided into three
independent systems: Northern, Southern and Rural. The Capital Area is
served by the Northern System; the town of Salalah and its surrounding area
in Dhofar Province are served by the Southern System, and the Rural System
supplies a number of towns and villages from separate local power stations.
27.       Electricity rates are determined by the Ministry Qf Communications
in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. Currently all customers are
charged a uniform rate of Omani Rials (OR) 0.020 ($0.06) per kWh, which bears
little relation to the cost of the service. All revenues collected go to the
Government's general budget, and yearly requests for funding are made by the
electricity authority to the Government. The disadvantages of this system,
with regard to efficiency and incentive for improvements, are considerable.
28.       Little reliable work has been done on projected lQad growth, which
will be one of the prime concerns of the consultants to be hired under the
proposed project. Very rough estimates are that, from a peak load growth of
63 percent in 1977, annual growth rates will fall to 25 percent in 1978 and
20 percent in 1979.



-8-
The Water Sector
29.       Oman has an arid climate characterized by extremely hot and dry
summers and mild winters, with the exception of the Dhofar region in the south
which has a monsoon climate. The winter rainfall averages about 100 mm for
most of the country and increases to about 300 mm in the Hajar mountain range
in the north. The only available water sources are the mountain streams in
the north and groundwater resources in the Batinah plain and in the Dhofar
region. Several regional water surveys were initiated in the last few years
by consultants. Although most of these studies were incomplete or inconclu-
sive, they suggest that the country has few, if any, large unexploited water
sources.
30.       The only major piped water system in the country supplies the city
of Muscat in the Capital Area by pipelines from wells about 50 km west on
the coastal plain and from the Ghubra desalination plant which has a nominal
capacity of 4 million gallons per day. Town water supplies also exist at
Salalah in the south and at Sur on the east coast, supplied from area wells.
The Muscat and Salalah systems are operated by the Directorate General of
Water (DGW) of the Ministry of Communications and the system at Sur is pri-
vately operated.
31.       The water problem in the Capital Area, at the moment, is more a
matter of distribution rather than of supply. The DGW believes additional
output could be obtained fairly readily from the desalination plant, but
because the piped distribution system is inadequate, the full benefits of the
desalination plant are not available to the consumers.
32.       Rural water supply is a more serious problem, as the sources are
very limited, and whatever water there is has to serve both domestic and
agricultural needs. The domestic supply in most rural areas consists of
carrying water by hand from a public source, such as a single village well,
or the outlet of a small spring, which is also used for washing and bathing.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
33.       The Government's intensive development efforts, as explained in Part
1, have resulted in rapid economic growth around the Capital Area and other
urban centers, where power and water demand has expanded rapidly. At the same
time, there is considerable pressure to provide adequate sources of rural
water supply in the key rural regions, where the great majority of the Omanis
live. Given this situation and the limitations of financial resources which
can be spent on the development of these utilities, and given other develop-
ment needs, it is essential that steps be taken to ensure that adequate sup-
plies of power and water are provided, based on priority and least-cost solu-
tions, to facilitate the balanced development of both the urban and rural
areas.



- 9 -
34.       In December of last year, the Government proposed that the Bank
organize consultants' studies to determine the short- and long-term needs for
power and urban water of the Capital Area, Salalah in the South, and other
growth centers, both urban and rural. They requested that the consultants be
required to recommend a development program for the immediate period 1977-80,
(to coincide with the remaining years of the Development Plan) and for the
medium term period 1981-1985, and also prepare a broad master plan for future
projects required to meet the long-term 1986-1995 requirements. The Govern-
ment also wished the consultants' work to include detailed engineering of
projects identified as having priority for the 1977-80 period and supervision
of their construction, besides detailed feasibility studies of identified
priority projects for the 1981-85 period. The Development Plan, prepared with
the help of a Planning Team provided under the on-going Technical Assistance
Loan, envisages an expenditure of OR 122 million (US$365 million) for these
two sectors, about 15 percent of total planned investments. The Government is
anxious that such expenditures should be made on clearly identified priority
needs, and be based on least-cost solutions. Finally, the Government wanted
recommendations in these studies for improvements in the legislation, struc-
ture, organization, finance, procedures and operations of the power and water
sectors. At the request of the Government, in early 1977 Bank staff under-
took a desk review of available power and water studies done in the past by
consultants or equipment suppliers. In late March 1977, a mission visited
Oman and discussed the technical aspects of the Government's request, and
reached preliminary agreement on draft Terms of Reference for the studies
involved. At this time, the Government urged the Bank to consider providing
at least a portion of the foreign exchange cost of the work involved, besides
undertaking the monitoring of the consultants' work.
35.       The normal channel for financing such studies is the UNDP, for whom
the Bank could act as executing agent. However, the UNDP allocation for Oman
for 1977 has been reduced substantially to less than $1 million in view of the
UNDP's fiscal constraints and general reduction of its country programs. Fur-
thermore the amount available for Oman is fully budgeted for experts provided
under existing commitments. The Bank, therefore, agreed to consider the Gov-
ernment's request for financing and technical assistance. Negotiations were
held in Washington from April 18 to 21, 1977. The Omani delegation was headed
by Mr. Abdullah Bakatheer, Director General for Electricity, Ministry of Com-
munications.
Project Description and Financing
36.       The scope of work for both the power and water studies would follow
the same. general pattern, and would be divided into three phases to reflect
the Government's request mentioned in para 34 above. Phase One would be to
determine the optimum projects to supply the power and water requirements of
the Capital Area and Salalah for the period 1977-1980, and to implement the
approved projects required immediately, including the design, procurement,
supervision of construction and commissioning of facilities. The amount of
work involved in the supervision of construction and start-up operations can-
not be clearly identified until the studies are well underway, and in any



- 10 -
case would not be financed by the proposed loan. Phase Two would be to deter-
mine the projects required to meet the power and urban water requirements for
the period 1981-85, and to conduct feasibility studies and related exploration
work so that these high priority projects could be fully prepared for construc-
tion within this period. This Phase would also involve the preparation of a
broad plan for future development during 1986-1995 as a guide to future invest-
ment requirements. To the extent that there are competing claims on the same
source of water for both urban and agricultural purposes, the consultants will
evaluate the alternative water uses to determine the most appropriate alloca-
tion. Phase Three would be related to institutional aspects, and the consul-
tants would be required to prepare recommendations for improvements in the
legislation, structure, organization, finances, procedures, and operations of
the power and water sub-sectors. As is normal in cases when several studies
are scheduled to be undertaken at more or less the same time, and therefore
will necessarily overlap, one contract is expected to be a.:arded for all the
studies. The terms of reference for the studies have been agreed with the
Government. A summary of the scope of work to be performed by the consultants
is attached as a Technical Appendix.
37.       The proposed loan would cover all three Phases of the studies, except
(a) sub-contracts for test drilling under the water studies, (b) the supervi-
sion of construction and commissioning of facilities with regard to projects
for power and water which may be undertaken between 1978-80, and (c) detailed
engineering of projects recommended for implementation in the 1981-85 period.
The costs of these items will not be known until the studies have begun to
yield results, and would be borne by the Government. The estimated total
cost of the studies (excluding those items) is about $2.5 million. This cost
estimate includes the consultants' salaries and overhead, external travel and
living expenses, local living expenses and office accommodation. The proposed
loan of $1.5 million would cover the estimated foreign costs, with the
balance of $1 million in local costs, and any overrun of foreign costs, to
be borne by the Government.
38.       The estimated foreign exchange cost is based on 146 man/months of
professional services at $9,000 per man/month, plus 118 man/months of support
services at $1,000 per man/month. Details are given below. Most of the
support staff will also be expatriate, but hired locally. The Government
would be required to provide the consultants with appropriate support facili-
ties and counterpart personnel.
Foreign Cost Estimates

Personnel                  Water   Power   Total      Rate $      $1,000

Project Implementation
39.       The project would be implemented by consultants working under the
direction of the Ministry of Communications. At the express request of the
Government, the Bank will help in evaluating the proposals and in monitoring
the work of the consultants covered by the loan. The Government's short list
of consultants has been reviewed and approved and the Government is taking
steps to select and hire consultants according to Bank procedures (Loan Agree-
ment, Section 3.02). The Bank and appropriate Government officials will dis-
cuss the findings and proposals of the consultants at various stages during
the course of the studies. The Government's request for comprehensive Bank
help stems from previous experiences in Oman where, due to lack of manpower
for supervision on the part of the Omani authorities, the selection and per-
formance of consultants have not always been in the best interests of the
country. In many cases, consultants and suppliers have written their own
terms of reference, and their recommendations have sometimes led to unneces-
sary and costly investments. Wishing to avoid a repetition of these exper-
iences in an area as economically vital as power and water, Oman is seeking
the Bank's technical and financial assistance. This request provides the Bank
with an opportunity to play a needed and important role in establishing the
future development of these sub-sectors on an economically and financially
sound footing.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Sultanate of Oman and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Special con-
ditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex III. The employment
of consultants acceptable to the Bank, on conditions satisfactory to the Bank,
is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
Robert S. McNamara
President

SULTANATE OF OMAN
POWER AND URBAN WATER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR 1977-1995
SUMMARY OF SCOPE OF WORK
1. GENERAL
Introduction
1.01      This outlines the purpose and scope of work for a study "Power and
Urban Water Development Program for 1977-1995" and related engineering work to
be carried out by a Consultant for the Government of Sultanate of Oman. The
Consultant will be engaged by the Ministry of Communications and the Consul-
tant's activities will be supervised by the International Bank for Reconstruc-
tion and Development (the World Bank), at the request of the Government.
Background
1.02      Oman's population is approximately one million.    The largest urban
region is the Capital Area, comprising the cities of Muscat and Mutrah and
the coastal strip to Sib with a population estimated at 80,000. All other
towns and villages are considerably smaller, none having more than 25,000
residents.
1.03      Oil exports began in 1967.   Modern economic development in Oman
began with the accession to power of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said in
1970. Much success has been achieved in the continuing development program
aimed at building the infrastructure and at establishing industries to util-
ize the country's resources. A main objective of current developments is
to increase income-generating projects to sustain the economy after the oil
reserves are depleted. A gas pipeline is under construction from a gas field
in the interior to the Capital Area to provide fuel for industries, power
generation and desalination. Oman has no refinery so all oil products must
be imported.
1.04      Public electricity supply in Oman is the responsibility of the
Directorate General of Electricity (DGE) in the Ministry of Communications.
DGE supplies the Capital Area via a 33/115-kv transmission system from the
Riyam Bay diesel station and the Ghubra power/desalination station. Salalah
and 26 other towns and villages are supplied from isolated power systems, most
of which will become operational in 1977. The national oil company, Petroleum
Development, Oman Ltd. (PDO), owns power stations at the oil fields and the
oil-loading facilities in the Capital Area. Privately owned and operated gen-
erating sets provide electricity to many industries, shops, schools, hospitals
and military establishments (autoproducers) throughout the country.



1.05      The major piped water system in the country is in the Capital Area
supplied by pipelines from wells on the coastal plain, augmented by the Ghubra
desalination station. Town water supplies also exist at Salalah and at Sur,
supplied from area wells. The Capital Area and Salalah systems are operated
by the Directorate General of Water (DGW) of the Ministry of Communications;
that at Sur is privately operated. Newly constructed village water systems,
including two small desalination plants, exist in the Musandam province and
are also the responsibility of DGW.
1.06      Oman is arid.   Precipitation along the Gulf coast averages about
100 mm annually and is higher in the Hajar mountain range (with peaks ex-
ceeding 2,000 meters above sea level). Water availability has been the
limiting factor for agricultural development, which is located mainly on
the Batinah plain, and also in the near interior and in the Dhofar region.
Water resource studies have been conducted throughout regions of Oman by
various consultants since 1973 so considerable information is already avail-
able on the water supply situation in much of the country.
1.07      Aware of the critical importance of water to economic development in
Oman, the Government has recently created an interministerial Water Resource
Council (WRC). The Technical Secretariat of WRC, supported by engineering
consultants, is continuing to accumulate and evaluate hydrological data for
use in water resources planning, following an earlier FAO project in this
field.
1.08      The Government has prepared the first five-year Development Plan
for the period 1976-1980. In early 1977 a World Bank economic mission visited
Oman to review current development prospects; the mission's findings will be
made available for the purposes of the Power and Urban Water Development
Program.
II. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
General
2.01      The Government's intensive development efforts have resulted in
rapid economic growth, particularly in the Capital Area and Salalah, where
power and water demands are increasing rapidly. Existing sources and distri-
bution facilities for both power and water systems have limited capacities
which need to be augmented in the near future so that economic development
is not restricted. Accordingly the Government wishes to take steps quickly
to determine an appropriate investment program for power and water supply
facilities to be installed in these two dominant urban centers between now
and 1980. The short term development program must be prepared rapidly and
implemented immediately thereafter.
2.02      Longer term planning is also required for the power and water supply
systems for the Capital Area and Salalah. A master plan for phased develop-
ment of system facilities for the period until 1995 is required, as well as
feasibility studies to select the optimum investment program for the next
5 year period, i.e.1981-1985.



- 3 -
2.03      Intermediate towns and villages throughout Oman will continue to
develop and many of them need supporting infrastructure, particularly water
supply facilities. Isolated power systems are nearing completion for the
26 towns and villages specified but most lack modern water supplies. A few
may also require expansion of their power systems in the near term. Accord-
ingly the Government wishes to obtain recommendations for the phased develop-
ment of water and power systems in the specified towns and villages with a
planning horizon of 1995, as well as feasibility studies to determine the
optimum investment program for the period up to 1985.
2.04      Separate studies of the power and water supply systems are required
in all cases in order to determine the least cost investment programs. Common
assumptions about future economic development in each center should be used
for both studies. In the occasional case where desalination plants exist or
are indicated in future, the power and water supply development programs must
be evaluated in an integrated manner as outlined hereafter.
Objectives
2.05      The required work can be divided into three activities related to
the short-term, long-term and institutional requirements of the power and
urban water sectors as follows:
Phase One - Power and Urban Water Development Program Through 1980
The objectives of the Phase One part of the Study are:
(a) to quickly determine the least-cost development
program for supplying the power and water require-
ments of the Capital Area and Salalah through 1980;
and
(b)  to implement the approved projects in this short term
program, including the design, procurement, supervision
of construction and commissioning of facilities.
Phase Two - Power and Urban Water Development Program Through 1995
and Feasibility Studies Through 1985
The objectives of the Phase Two work are:
(a) to determine the leapt-cost program to meet the power
and urban water requirements for the Capital Area and
Salalah in the short-term period 1981-1985 and to con-
duct feasibility studies and related exploration work
so that the recommended projects are fully prepared
for the commitment of the related investments for the
detailed 1981-1985 development program. For the spe-
cified towns and villages the least cost program for
power and water supply facilities should be prepared
in detail from the present until 1985.



- 4 -
(b) to prepare a broad plan for future projects required
to meet the long-term 1986-1995 power and water
requirements at least cost as a basis for initiating
feasibility studies of the identified projects and
as a guide to future investment requirements.
Phase Three - Institutional Recommendations for the Power
and Water Supply Sectors
The objective of Phase Three is to prepare recommendations
for improvement in the legislation, structure, organization,
finance, procedures, operations and maintenance of the power
and urban water systems in the Capital Area, Salalah and the
specified towns and villages.
2.06      Although the three activities have been designated as Phases, the
actual work related to achieving the objectives of the three Phases of the
Study would necessarily overlap, to some extent, particularly the institu-
tional requirements which must be considered from the outset of the Study.
2.07      In conducting a power study, normally the long-term program would
be developed before initiating the short-term projects. In this Study, the
results of exploration programs including groundwater investigations may
dictate the possible need for desalination for water supply in particular
cases. This, in turn, may affect the power program if power/desalination
stations are found to be part of the least-cost, power/water development
program. Therefore the long-term power program cannot be fully developed
until the water resource situation is clarified for each town or village.
Thus the timing of the work related to achieving the short-term, long-term
and institutional objectives is not necessarily sequential.
