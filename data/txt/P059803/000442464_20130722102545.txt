F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the project is to improve the welfare of the population in
the Nura River Basin by cleaning up serious mercury pollution in area adjacent to the
Nura River, providing a safe, secure and cost effective alternative source of water supply
to meet growing needs of local water users, and restoring flow control in the river for
flood management and ecological purposes.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Upon independence in 1991, the Republic of Kazakhstan inherited a legacy of environmental damages
caused by many years of output-focused development, with little regard for economic viability or
environmental impact. At the time of project preparation, the Government of Kazakhstan was facing a
number of challenges with respect to remediation of environmental degradation, cost-effective supply of
potable water to the population, and ongoing protection of environmental resources. Some of the key
issues facing the Government were: (i) Environmental Degradation: Nura river basin, data confirmed
3,000 tons of mercury remained in the top soil of the flood plain, river bed, and banks and on the ground
of the now defunct industrial plant at the time of appraisal. These environmental hazards, unless
remediated, were to act as a constraint on economic development; (ii) High Cost of Water Supply: The
Government inherited a costly and elaborate system for water supply from the Soviet times and was
responsible for providing water to the population and also irrigation water for agricultural schemes that
subsequently proved to be uneconomical; (iii) Sustainability of Water Supply: a large part of the country
where significant economic activity was happening was arid, and dependence on ground water was not
feasible, while surface water schemes were costly and technically complex. Therefore the Government
was looking for sustainable alternative sources of water supply for current and future needs at low costs;
(iv) Lack of Effective Integrated Water Resource Management. Integrated planning and management of
water resources and water supply systems received limited attention, with past approaches to meet the
growing demand dominated by technical solutions without any regard for integrated planning or cost-
effectiveness; (v) Inadequate Legal Framework for Basin Management. Kazakhstan’s 1993 water code
needed to be updated to provide an overall framework for the regulation of domestic, industrial, and
agricultural water use in compliance with environmental regulations; (vi) Effectiveness of Pollution
Control Measures. Though legislation existed, many issues hindered its effective implementation.

The Nura River in the northeastern part of Kazakhstan served for many years as a receptacle for a brew of
untreated industrial wastes. Of particular concern, the Karbide factory in Temirtau, Karaganda District,
discharged large quantities of mercury into the river for about 25 years. Mercury is a very toxic, mobile,
persistent, and bioaccumulative pollutant. Discharges ceased when the factory closed in 1997, but various
surveys of the factory site, river channel and floodplains conducted by international and Kazakh experts
suggested that large quantities of mercury remained in the environment.

The Intumak Dam and Reservoir, approximately 80 km downstream from Temirtau, was built in the early
1980’s mainly for irrigation purposes. However, the regulating gates and spillway of the dam were not
completed and flow control was never achieved; as a result, filling the reservoir during the flood season to
less than three-fourths of its design capacity. Rehabilitating the dam would offer significant benefits in
terms of downstream flood prevention and dry-season supply of water to downstream users, including
Kugaldzino wetlands, an internationally-recognized nature reserve with significant biodiversity, as
approximately 80% of the annual flow in the river occurs over a two-month period in the spring.

Within this context, the 2001-2004 Country Assistance Strategy (approved on January 16, 2001) included
lending to: (i) support the most vulnerable, through improvement in the delivery of municipal and
industrial water supply and sanitation; and (ii) protect the environment by addressing environmental
degradation. The Bank's strategy concentrated on addressing industrial pollution in the Northeastern
industrial area, promoting integrated planning of water resources and addressing the security of water
supply and access to clean water for vulnerable population.




                                                     1
The project was to address the main sector issues of Kazakhstan in relation to the Nura River Basin in the
following manner: (i) remediating environmental degradation through mercury clean-up; (ii) ensuring
effective management of the landfill site where contaminated soil was contained; (iii) flow and
downstream flood management; (iv) enhancing capacity for integrated water resource management of the
Nura River by improving the regulatory framework, water resource management, and building monitoring
capacity; and (v) ensuring availability of sustainable and cost-effective water supply. It was necessary to
take action to resolve pollution of the Nura river, especially since mercury accumulation in the river and
reservoir sediments, severely impeded the reservoir to serve as a reliable water source (for consumption
and irrigation). The key problem was the leaching of Hg-compounds from sediments especially in a
dysfunctional reservoir where water is stagnant for long periods of time which increases the risk of
methyl mercury formation 1 and the subsequent contamination of river water downstream. If not
addressed, the issue could have taken a turn for the worst, proving to be extremely difficult and costly to
treat contaminated water to drinking and irrigation water standards.

In essence, this was an environmental clean-up project, which required substantial international expertise
in risk assessment, engineering, and impact assessment, as well as operations, and monitoring and
evaluation. Bank involvement was regarded as critical, since it would: (i) introduce international best
practice into the design and implementation of environmental remediation and pollution management,
water management, regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder involvement; (ii) ensure proper technical
standards not only for remediation but also for operation and maintenance; and (iii) strengthen
implementation capacity of relevant government institutions.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The Project Development Objective (PDO), as noted in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 2, p.12) was
to:“(a) improve the welfare of the population in the Nura River Basin by cleaning up serious mercury
pollution in and adjacent to the Nura River; (b) provide a safe, secure and cost effective alternative
source of water supply to meet growing needs of local water users; and (c) restore flow control in the
river for flood management and ecological purposes.?

According to the Project Appraisal Document (p.2) the PDO was stated differently than in the LA
formulation: “to improve the welfare of the population in the Nura River Basin by cleaning up serious
mercury pollution in and adjacent to the Nura River, providing a safe, secure and cost effective
alternative source of water supply to meet growing needs of local water users, and restoring flow control
in the river for flood management and ecological purposes.? The Implementation Completion Report
adopts the LA formulation of the PDO as it is legally binding.

The mercury clean-up as well as the rehabilitation of the reservoir, which provides flow control
downstream and functions as a pollution trap of mercury contaminated reservoir sediments, serve as the
means for the reservoir to be part of a reliable, safe and cost-effective drinking water and irrigation
scheme. The existing problem of leaching of mercury-compounds from sediments, especially in a
reservoir where water is stagnant for long periods of time, and the subsequent contamination of river
water makes it difficult and costly to treat to drinking water standards at the consumers’ water supply

  Methylmercury is formed from inorganic mercury by the action of anaerobic organisms that live in aquatic systems including
lakes, rivers, wetlands, sediments, soils and the open ocean. This methylation process converts inorganic mercury to
methylmercury in the natural environment because it is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified in aquatic food
chains from bacteria, to plankton to herbivorous fish and to predator fish. Acute methylmercury poisoning occurred at Grassy
Narrows in Ontario, Canada and an acute methylmercury poisoning tragedy occurred in Minamata, Japan following release of
methylmercury into Minamata Bay and its tributaries from a similar type of factory as in the case in Kazakhstan.

intake points. Cleaning the mercury pollution and providing flow control in the river improves as a result
the welfare of the people in the Nura River Basin.

This project was conceived as an environmental clean-up and integrated water resource management of
the Nura River and the PAD design and the indicators are linked to such clean-up and flow control rather
than a more standard drinking water supply/treatment project and there were no indicators defined
directly linked to cost-effectiveness. However, as stated above, as a result of the clean-up and flow
control, the water is available and pollution removal at source is a much more cost-effective mechanism.

PDO Indicators. These were: (i) increased reliance on local water resources by the users in the Nura
basin; (ii) availability of additional land area for productive use; (iii) increased summer time flows to
Kurgaldzhino wetlands; and (iv) availability of Nura water to meet the additional demand for the city of
Astana.2

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The Project Development Objectives were not revised, but the key indicators were revised and realigned
in July 2007 based on the request of Bank’s management - as most original indicators did not have
quantitative baseline data or target values. This made it difficult to monitor implementation progress and
PDO achievements. Most importantly, due to the nature of clean-up operations, establishing baselines and
target values requires considerable investment in detailed design assessments which could be realistically
done during implementation rather than prior to appraisal. Under the project these assessments were
completed in 2007, allowing a revisit to the indicators. However, no formal restructuring of the Loan
Agreement and its Supplemental Letter was undertaken due to the lengthy countersignature procedures
(and Parliamentary ratification) in Kazakhstan, as a result of which the restructuring would not become
effective prior to the closing date of the project. The revised indicators being used for the assessment of
project achievements are as follows:

PDO Indicators. These were: (i) removal of mercury concentrations at designated polluted locations at
the Karbide Factory site and adjacent territories; (ii) removal of mercury pollution of the Nura River and
flood plains of designated polluted areas; (iii) Nura River water quality downstream of the Intumak
Reservoir suitable for drinking water preparations with regard to mercury content; (iv) increase in
reservoir volume and regulate flow downstream and to the Kurgaldzhino wetlands; and (v) safe dam
structure and village protection dams.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators. These were: (i) construction of hazardous waste landfill for polluted
soil and sediment disposal from designated project sites based on pollution sampling and mapping; and
(ii) demolition of the Karbide factory.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project was conceived to benefit: (i) the residents of Temirtau City by increasing their ecological
safety as a result of the containment of mercury pollution from the AO Karbide Factory; (ii) rural
residents of the Nura River basin whose health was at risk for using the Nura River as a direct drinking
water source, for fishing, and crop irrigation; (iii) the residents of Astana City (estimated at 375,000 at

 One set of indicators were proposed in the PAD, which was followed by another iteration as an outcome of negotiations. The
projects were still in the investigation phase, and it was only in 2007 that the project was ready to qualify baselines and target
values based on detailed design assessments; it was at this time that the indicators were revisited and realigned as shown in the
cover datasheet.


                                                                 3
appraisal) by providing them with a second source of water from the Nura River, that was less expensive
than existing arrangements based on the Ishim River and the Irtysh-Karaganda Canal; (iv) the residents of
Temirtau and Karaganda (estimated at 600,000 at appraisal), who rely on water from a combination of the
Irtysh-Karaganda Canal, groundwater sources and the Nura River, by making available a less expensive
and regular source of water as a result of the clean-up from Nura River; (v) recreational visitors, including
fishermen and hunters, along the Nura River banks and the buffer zone of the Kurgaldzhino wetlands
protected area; and (iv) those members of the community who value biodiversity protection by improving
Nura River water quality, which would reduce biodiversity degradation in the Kurgaldzhino wetlands.
These target beneficiaries were not revised throughout project implementation.

1.5 Original Components
The PDOs, under the Specific Investment Lending (SIL), were to be achieved through four main
components.

Component 1: Nura Valley Mercury Clean-Up (appraisal amount US$44.08 million; actual US$58.77
million). This component would include: (i) construction of a secure landfill for proper containment of
contaminated soil and materials; (ii) excavation of contaminated hotspots at the AO Karbide plant site at
Temirtau (factory building, main drain, and adjacent waste disposal sites); and (iii) excavation of other
highly contaminated areas including the Zhaur Swamp, and critical areas of mercury accumulation along
the banks and floodplains of the Nura River, as well as the transport of materials to the landfill. The
component would also finance the testing of polluted materials being delivered to the landfill, the
operation of the landfill until all polluted materials were disposed, closure and vegetation of the landfill.
The component was to also include the preparation of a long-term monitoring and maintenance program
for the closed landfill (Confined Disposal Facility). Funding would also be provided for elaborate
pollution mapping of contaminated areas, inspection and monitoring of landfill construction and soil-
excavation processes by independent experts to ensure that selected contractors meet all technical and
environmental standards and safeguards.

Component 2: Intumak Reservoir Rehabilitation (appraisal amount US$19.13 million; actual
US$33.76 million). This component would finance the rehabilitation of the Intumak Reservoir, including
reinforcement of the earth-fill dam and completion of the spillway and gates to allow the dam to operate
as a mechanism for flow control at its original reservoir design level. This would allow for development
and implementation of an integrated water resources management plan for Intumak and the upstream
Samarkand and Sherubianur Dams and reservoirs. However, owing to uncertainty about the effect of
raising the operational level at the Intumak Reservoir on mercury methylation, any disbursement for civil
works related to this component were to be conditional on the review and agreement by the International
Expert Advisory Group. Provisions were to be made in the cost estimate for this component to cover any
cost of additional dredging works required, in the event that the results of the monitoring and assessment
would indicate a risk of unacceptable levels of mercury methylation associated with increased operating
levels; completion of the spillway and gates would be postponed until mercury deposits at the bottom of
the reservoir could be removed and transferred to the landfill.

Component 3: Nura-Sarysu River Basin Authority Strengthening (appraisal amount US$1.68 million;
actual US$1.67 million equivalent). This component was to finance technical assistance, training and
equipment necessary to develop the institutional capacity of the Nura-Sarysu River Basin Authority in
resource planning and management, as well as to strengthen the water quality monitoring network, water
pollution control system, and regulatory framework (gauging stations in the river as well as laboratory
mercury measurement equipment). Supplementary assistance from the Japanese government would
provide (with the participation of Japanese experts from the Minamata Institute) technical support in the
design and implementation of a program to monitor and assess mercury pollution in the Intumak



                                                     4
reservoir. Long term support for the development and implementation of comprehensive water quality
monitoring program to be provided address the risks associated with occasional recontamination of the
river due to residual mercury depositions and/or periodic high flood levels. This component would also
fund the participation of the International Expert Advisory Group as well as the development of a
mathematical model to estimate the accumulation of bottom sediments in the reservoir and estimation of
the sediment flow at the reservoir’s bottom; study tours to review different international dam structures
and operational regimes and the operational manual for the Intumak dam and reservoir.

Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring (appraisal amount US$2.53 million equivalent;
actual US$3.20 million). This component would cover a number of activities related to project
management and monitoring, including the incremental operating costs and technical assistance to PMU,
including: (i) training in areas such as procurement, disbursement, and project accounting; (ii) auditing of
project accounts; (iii) assistance in the implementation of the environmental management plan, especially
with regard to public awareness; and (iv) specialist assistance in areas such as hydrology, social sciences,
and environmental management.

1.6 Revised Components
Project components were implemented as envisaged. However the institutional organization of
Component 3 on the Nura-Sarysu River Basin Authority, under the Committee of Water Resources, and
tasked with planning and management function (Dam, reservoir, and spillway), changed during
implementation due to Government restructuring and to better align institutional responsibilities. The
responsibilities were split between the Nura-Sarysu River Basin Inspection (planning and control) and
Karaganda Vodghoz (operation, and management of the Dam, reservoir, and spillway), both of which
continue to reside under the Committee of Water Resources (CWR), the implementing agency under the
Project. Moreover, the water quality monitoring network of 19 gauging stations on the Nura River was
procured under the project and its assets are on the balance sheet of the CWR. An agreement has been
made with KazHydromet situated under the Ministry of Environment Protection during early stages of
project implementation for mercury monitoring. KazHydromet was tasked with different levels of
monitoring (water, ambient and soil) annually and had the unique qualifications and ability to perform
specialized work on mercury monitoring under Component 3.

1.7 Other significant changes
 Projects Costs: The cost of the project was initially estimated at US$67.83 million. At completion
project costs were US$ 97.80 million (144% of the original project costs). Such large variations were due
to the increased extent of polluted territories and level of discovered pollution in Nura River flood plains
during the detailed design and pre-construction excavation phase. More than 140,000 samples were taken
to establish the baseline pollution situation. Costs were further increased due to the delays in state
approvals for the design, the requirement to update the feasibility study (and the accompanying state
approvals) resulting in the delay in construction works. However, the Government financed the escalated
costs as well as the remaining costs of works pending at loan closing.
        Borrower Contribution: At appraisal the Borrower planned to contribute US$27.4 million;
whereas the actual contribution was US$57.41 million equivalent or 209% of planned. It should be noted
that this large increase in Borrowers’ contribution was due to the reasons explained above under the
project costs section, and was fully funded through the Borrower’s own funds after the loan closing in
June 2011.
        Project Effectiveness: It was necessary to extend project effectiveness one time (to June 17, 2004
as the later date), due to a delay in ratifying the Loan Agreement (LA) by Kazakhstan’s Parliament.
Consequently, the LA became effective on June 14, 2003 almost 15 months after project approval.




                                                     5
        Project Extension: The Loan closing date was extended twice due to significant delays in project
implementation. Initially, the extension was processed as a legal amendment for nine months, establishing
June 30, 2010 as the closing date. The second extension was processed as a level-two restructuring and
was granted for 12 months, establishing June 30, 2011 as the closing date.
        Design Changes: An important change occurred to the design of the Intumak Dam. The original
design of the dam was to have rubber gates, but gate materials were changed to steel after construction
started as it was deemed more suitable to the local climate with long and harsh winters and other
conditions. A small hydropower station was also added to the design in the bottom outlet. Based on risk
management and costs considerations, the remote areas were cleaned to a standard of 50 mg/kg. Lastly, a
road was added on top of the Dam crest of the Intumak Reservoir to substantially shorten the travel
distance between nearby villages on both sites of the reservoir.
        Loan Closing/Project Completion Date: The loan closed on June 30, 2011; however, project
completion is assessed as of December 30, 2012. While further extension was discussed with the
implementing agency to streamline the Loan Closing Date with the actual completion date of the works,
the Ministry of Finance did not want to request such extension in order to save the associated Bank fees.
The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) was delayed to comprehensively cover the full impact of
the project which was pending at loan closing due to the nature of mercury clean-up, remediation of river
bed sedimentation required a settling time before surface water monitoring could appropriately reflect
results, and for completion of works on rehabilitation of Intumak Reservoir.
        Funding Allocation: Funding allocations for the components were changed during negotiations
allowing Government of Kazakhstan to finance 100 percent of all technical assistance and incremental
operating costs, and the IBRD loan to be used only for works and goods under Components 1, 2 and 3. As
the World Bank does not track counterpart financing in its SAP system, this caused the project to show a
lack of disbursement for a long time.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project Design: The project was to assist Kazakhstan to address water resource management issues in the
Nura River basin comprehensively, including mercury pollution management (remediation, containment,
and safe disposal), water quality monitoring, flood prevention, securing alternative water sources for
future population needs of the basin, and ensuring seasonal water flow to the ecologically important
wetlands. Alternative approaches for project design were duly considered, including: (i) doing nothing;
(ii) focusing only on the AO Karbide plant site; (iii) focusing only on clean-up; (iv) alternative technical
options for remediation; and (vi) landfill siting. From a technical perspective, the project design was
relatively straightforward and solid piece of environmental remediation, and the methodology adopted
was standard for clean-up operations. A detailed assessment of the level of mercury contamination,
monitoring, and detail design was planned to be undertaken during implementation as it was intensive,
timely and costly. Moreover, the project design showed due foresight in view of the technical
uncertainties especially related to the construction of spillways and gates, and increasing the operating
capacity of the Intumak Reservoir. Additional monitoring and expert analysis was programmed, and
disbursement of dam civil works was contingent on a panel of experts’ reports.3 The project design did
not however plan any beneficiary assessment, to ascertain the project’s welfare impacts.
Lessons learnt from previous sector projects were adequately reflected in project design, mainly:

 Also endorsed by QAG/QAE6 (2003): “The choice of a low-tech approach for clean-up is convincing, and the decision to delay
completion of the dam pending research on potential aggravation of mercury contamination in the Intumak Reservoir is also
prudent.?


                                                             6
(i) rigorous economic and environmental criteria should be applied in project planning and design -the
project hired international consultants to undertake thorough economic, environmental and social analyses,
vetted their conclusions with broad consultations and workshops, and included local consultants in all
activities. Moreover, international experts were engaged to provide guidance on technical issues such as
mercury methylation processes, toxicology, and dam safety issues; (ii) project scope and design should
take into account the difficulties in coordinating among key government agencies – the project made
extensive use of the Inter-Ministerial Committee to ensure coordination; (iii) competent and efficient
national management staff is necessary and should be recruited prior to project effectiveness to ensure the
viability and sustainability of the project – the PMU was adequately staffed before effectiveness; ( iv)
timely provision of counterpart funding is imperative - as the loan was ratified under the Government
budget, counterpart resources were not a constraint and budget processes were followed; (v) provision of
timely and adequate technical assistance is essential; and procurement, financial management and
construction quality control need to be given proper emphasis in project implementation - competent
training and technical assistance was budgeted and provided for project implementation, procurement,
monitoring and supervision; and (vi) local institutions need to be fully involved in project preparation and
design - the project integrated local counterparts during project preparation and design, so all stakeholders
were included in decision-making meetings of the Inter-Ministerial Committee.
22. Risks: Risks were generally and adequately identified and mitigation measures were provided,
including: (i) local and regional water authorities and water users were unwilling to cooperate in the
operation of the river basin management system; (ii) local industries were unwilling or financially
incapable of complying with environmental standards; (iii) lack of proper long-term operation and
monitoring of the landfill to avoid leakage and quickly identify the need for remedial actions; (iv)
cooperation between the regional environmental and water management agencies was not forthcoming; (v)
monitoring unit not financed for long-term; (vi) mercury disaster; (vii) timely availability of counterpart
funding during project implementation; (viii) government capacity and commitment to finance ongoing
operating and maintenance costs of the Basin Management System; (ix) mercury clean-up operation
proves to be technically and/or financially infeasible; and (x) a lack of adequate implementation capacity
within the PMU results in poor project management and/or extensive implementation delays. However,
the risk of substantial delay on engineering and State approvals was not included in the critical risk
analysis of the PAD, and though understood, were understated.4 Associated risks that may possibly cause
project delays were also not fully mitigated, related to: government budget system operation in
Kazakhstan, contractor pending payments, increased costs based on detailed site investigations and design,
and the risks of delay in construction works due to the size of the clean-up operation required (e.g.
2,000,000 tons of polluted materials were excavated and disposed in the landfill).
Quality at Entry (QEA): The project underwent a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA6) by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) in 2003.5 The Panel considered the overall quality of project preparation to be
Satisfactory, and Bank contribution as a solid piece of environmental remediation. The Panel was of the
view that: “benefits from improved urban water supply were highly hypothetical since the project will not
address them directly. That said, the remediation of the AO Karbide site at Temirtau and nearby stretches
of flood plain heavily contaminated by mercury is well justified.? The Panel acknowledged the strong
aspects of the project to be: (i) adequate allocations of the project costs (more than 10%) for monitoring
and evaluation of the clean-up and communication with the public; (ii) first project in Kazakhstan to


4
  The QEA6 and QSA7 Panels also confirmed this conclusion: “There are some inherent technical risks in clean-up of a heavily
polluted site (in the US, remediation in many "Superfund" sites has proven difficult and costly to achieve).? The panel
considered that the preparation team has generally understood the risks but tended to understate these in the PAD.
5
  The QEA6/QAG point scale comprised: (a) strategic relevance and approach (2), (b) technical, financial, and economic aspects
(2), (c) poverty and social aspects (2), (d) environmental aspects (2), (e) fiduciary aspects (2), (f) policy and institutional aspects
(1), (g) implementation arrangement (2), (h) risk assessment (2), and (i) Bank input and processes (2). This was evaluated on a 6-
point scale from “Highly Satisfactory? to “Highly Unsatisfactory.?


                                                                  7
publicly disclose monitoring data; (iii) establishing useful linkage between the Borrower and international
best practice, proactive in anticipating potential risks of clean-up (AO Karbide factory) and plans to
complete Intumak Dam (appurtenant structures), and been effective in developing mitigation measures;
and (iv) handling of the environmental assessment was exemplary. Handling of poverty aspects was noted
as a main weakness by the Panel, to be improved in implementation, and add value to the overall Bank’s
contribution. Panel suggestions to the team were: careful monitoring of the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP), given the risks inherent in the clean-up of sites contaminated with mercury, including
inadvertent exposure of clean-up workers, nearby residents, and improper operation of the secure landfill;
and enhancing the already developed plans for raising awareness among local groups with greater
attention to poverty-environment linkages.

2.2 Implementation
Supervision: Project implementation, from effectiveness, spanned 7 years till loan closing and 8 years till
project completion, with regular (average of two to three missions annually, except for 2007 and 2008
when one supervision mission was fielded; however field missions continued after loan closure until
project completion). The task team leader (TTL) was HQ based, but country-level staff were responsible
for dealing with day to day issues; and with only three TTL transitions over the life of the project.
Admittedly, Aide Memoires were not sufficiently detailed and tended to focus on key implementation
issues, and as a result the quality of project documentation suffered. The project successfully dealt with
several implementation hurdles, for example:

(i) Project effectiveness delayed by 15 months. This created some issues early in implementation support
as the Borrower and PIUs had to carry out substantial preparatory work to prepare and issue tender
documents for priority contracts for mercury clean-up activities. The design contracts were signed in
2004;

(ii) Early in implementation, as a result of delays and the fact that the loan agreement only financed goods
and civil works, while the detailed designs (for the construction of the hazardous waste disposal facility,
the clean-up program for the Karbide factory and adjacent territories and the Nura River clean-up as well
as the Intumak rehabilitation design) were financed by the government, the project appeared to have a
very low disbursement ratio (2003 to the end of 2006 – disbursement stood at US$1.2 million);

(iii) Early in 2006, to reduce costs of civil works, 3 civil works contracts (landfill construction; clean-up
of the Karbide Factory site and adjacent territory; and the Nura River clean-up works) were merged into
one contract under component 1 for which bidding failed and only one bid was received at a price double
the cost estimate; so the Borrower decided to split the contract into two civil works contracts6;

(iv) Findings from the detailed design, pollution mapping and contaminant investigations, lead to an
increased total project cost estimate (from the original US$63.24 million to US$97.42 million).
Government processes were followed to approve the cost increase of the detailed design and updated
feasibility study by all applicable state agencies in Kazakhstan and was subsequently approved by the
Republican Budget Commission in order to include the additional costs under the project and financed
them from increase government counterpart financing (withdrawal percentages were maintained and paid
the last part of the completion of works 100% from government counterpart financing); and




6
  (1) landfill construction and clean-up of Karbide Factory site and adjacent territories; and (2) Nura River Clean-up works and
rebid again, which was successful; this allowed for the civil works contracts to be signed and saving US$ 60 million compared to
the results of the previous failed tender.


                                                               8
(v) The first civil works contract (development of a landfill and clean-up of the Karbide factory site and
surrounding territories) was signed in January 2007. The landfill was completed, operational and able to
receive contaminated materials by November 2008. The second civil works contract (mercury clean-up of
river beds, river banks, floodplains, and other adjacent contaminated areas) was signed in December 2007,
and the third civil works contract (rehabilitation of the Intumak Dam) was signed in April 2008. The
project suffered significant delays (almost 2 years) due to rebidding of the contract and thus IP ratings
may have been overly optimistic in the ISRs.

It should be acknowledged that legacy pollution remediation is a risky business intrinsically exposed to
high levels of uncertainty, and even with the most advanced knowledge and sophisticated technology -
inherent delays can be triggered because of the unknown and there is always the case of “learning by
doing.?7
Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission took place October 25–November 6, 2009, when actual
MTR was planned for May 2006, was extended to October 2008, and then again to June 2009. The Bank
delayed the MTR due to the delays in preparation and state approval of the detail designs and the start of
the construction works. It was by late 2008 and early 2009 when project implementation was picking up
and on the ground that results and implementation progress could be sufficiently monitored. The Bank
noted that (i) the first million tons of polluted soil had been disposed in the landfill; (ii) disbursements
stood at US$ 30.7 million or 76% of the total funds from the Loan and that the Loan Closing Date had
been extended until June 30, 2010. There was no need to restructure components under the project, the
main conclusions and key issues raised by the mission were: (i) Procurement Plan required update with a
current staffing plan for Bank approval; (ii) Environmental compliance shortcomings were noted the
implementation of works under one contract8 supported by complaints received from people living in the
vicinity of the works. The PIU agreed and subsequently prepared an action plan to improve the
Contractor’s environmental compliance approved by the Construction Supervision Engineer and
acceptable to the World Bank; (iii) With regard to the complaints received from Chkalovo village,9 a
complaint facility was established under the Construction Supervisor’s office, and an NGO was hired to
raise public awareness of the objectives, planning and implementation progress of the project as well as to
share the environmental monitoring data; (iv) the need for an immediate decision on the approval of
contract addenda to reimburse the construction supervision consultant for the incurred costs from
payment of taxes. The issue of taxes was, in the end, resolved through the tax office issuing a tax credit to
the construction supervision engineering company; and (v) the Bank would hire a social research firm to
strengthen winter supervision to review possible loss of crops and proposed crop compensation.10

   As contamination involves physicochemical processes governed by complex, multifactor conditions that can lead to extremely
irregular distributions, this creates a high probability for unforeseen situations that are uncovered only during remediation works.
No amount of up-front information gathering by drilling, sampling and analysis will lead to certainty. There is an inherent
riskiness in pollution management projects, and this is reflected in the challenges in design and execution.
8
  B2 Contract shortcomings were related to a lack of wheel washing of trucks carrying polluted soil, driving through the
Chkalovo village, insufficient demarcation of the working sites and clean-up areas close to the vicinity of the village and no clear
delineation between black and working zones.
9
  In addition, the villagers wanted more information about the project, the environmental monitoring results of air, dust, surface
and underground water, the need to have drinking water well in the village, health facilities and a bus route. The elements which
were part of the project were addressed in the action plan which was submitted by the PMU and signed by the contractor and
construction supervisor on November 2, 2009. A design for a water-well was provided by the project and financed by the
municipality as the provision of drinking water wells was not eligible under loan activities. In addition, a complaint facility was
established at the Construction Supervisor’s Office and environmental bulletins were prepared with monitoring results and
progress of works.
10
   The crop compensation review showed that adequate crop compensation was proposed.


                                                                 9
Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA): The project underwent Quality of Supervision Assessments
(QSA) by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in 2006 (QSA7).11 The QAG Panel assessed the project’s
overall supervisory quality as Moderately Satisfactory. The Panel’s key concerns were: (a) that the ISR
ratings were too generous given the significant delays and issues in project implementation and
Management guidance had been uneven; (b) though the project had been effective in a limited set of
activities carried out so far (3% of the loan), component 1 bid was expected by October 2006, almost two
years behind schedule and component 3 was substantially delayed; and (c) limited progress was seen on
water monitoring, specialist assistance and awareness raising in the affected population on mercury
contamination; and the MTR (which was delayed and to take place after reception of bids) would offer an
opportunity to revise implementation details and take into consideration an earlier suggestion from QAG
(QEA6) reviews; which had not been implemented, so far.
The Panel’s key lesson was: “When projects are appraised without detailed engineering and sufficient
consultation with stakeholders...detailed engineering and technical specifications are likely to change the
cost estimates for the project? and “…water monitoring and awareness raising of the affected population
by toxic contamination… should be initiated earlier to improve long-term sustainability.? The rejoinder
from the region confirmed that sampling and monitoring had been executed as part of the detail design
and pre-construction excavation works - which could not be completed during preparation due to the
reasons explained above. Despite the above problems and changes, project implementation progressed
well with some implementation delays while others were truly exogenous (outside the scope of the
project’s influence). The PIU, in conjunction with the Bank, took adequate, timely and proactive actions
during implementation in technically complex project which in itself was an exercise of “learning by
doing.? As a result the project produced satisfactory outcomes.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design: The M&E design depended upon the use of annual implementation progress reports to
monitor and evaluate progress of the Results Framework. Several indicators did not have a quantitative
baseline or target values, which made it difficult to monitor implementation progress and PDO
achievements. In addition, project indicators did not comprehensively cover the scope of the project. The
project’s monitoring indicators were revised and realigned in 2007 when baseline data became available
from the detail design and extensive pollution mapping, sampling and laboratory analysis (with new
mercury monitoring equipment provided under the project). Staffing to undertake project level M&E at
the PIU was not defined and neither was the scope of monitoring activities at appraisal.
M&E Implementation: As the project was a mercury clean-up operation, pollution mapping was integral,
so the project undertook extensive mapping of all sites by reputable international firms, identifying all
“hot-spots? for mercury remediation, removal or dismantling. More than 6,000 hectares and 140,000
samples were investigated in grid a of 20x20 meters near villages, 25x25 meters near the river, and 50x50
meters in remote areas, with newly acquired mercury measurement laboratory equipment to establish the
baseline pollution situation for the Nura River, Karbide Factory, Zahur Swamp and adjacent areas. In line
with international standards, a clean-up criterion of 10 mg/kg was adopted for river bed sediments, river
banks, Zhaur swamp, and floodplains and for more remote areas 50 mg/kg. For house gardens growing
vegetables and fruits, the clean-up criterion of 2.1 mg/kg was applied. The MPC (Maximal Permissible
Concentration) of mercury content in air of 300ng/m3, and MPC for drinking water of 500 ng/l and
irrigation water of 300 ng/liter were adopted. Moreover, a quarterly water monitoring program (testing
and collecting hydrological, hydro-biological and hydro-chemical data on a monthly basis) also began in
2007 after all water monitoring stations (17 hydro-posts) were installed along the Nura River, and detailed


11
   The QSA7/QAG point scale comprised: (a) focus on development effectiveness (3), (b) supervision of fiduciary/safeguard
aspects (2), (c) adequacy of supervision inputs and processes (3), and (d) candor and quality of project performance ratings (3).
This was evaluated on a 6-point scale from “Highly Satisfactory? to “Highly Unsatisfactory.?


                                                                10
training of laboratory personnel on mercury analysis was completed. The operational budget (staff and
infrastructure) for monitoring (air, water, soil, and fish) was provided to Kazhydromet by the Ministry of
Environment Protection since 2007 and a bulletin is published annually for dissemination.12
The outcome indicators of the clean-up operation were measured by a very detailed success control
sampling and investigation program using the same sampling grid as prior to the clean-up operations;
which provided maps of all the cleaned areas and verified by the international supervising engineer (see
Annex 10). As the contractor had a contractual obligation to continue clean-up operations until the target
value was reached, detailed success control sampling and investigation was part of its contract as well as
the contract of the supervising engineer13.
The outcome of the surface water quality monitoring program by Kazhydromet was a series of quarterly
and annual reports on the ecological state of the Nura River. Finalization of the rehabilitation of the
Intumak Reservoir was reported in annual international supervisor reports. However, the PIU did not
monitor the PDO progress nor did the Bank in its supervision mission Aide Memoires; the progress was
captured as part of the ISRs. When the indicator revisions took place in 2007, the mission Aide Memoire
did not report it, and a review and update of the project indicators was also not undertaken at the Mid
Term Review. It was also not documented if the Borrower was formally informed about the changes to
the results framework of the project (PDO indicators), though the indicators were integrated in the
contracts as outlined above. At project completion, a comprehensive stocktaking of the PDO indicators
was undertaken.
M&E Utilization: On the one hand, the M&E was clearly integral to the cleanup exercise (soil, air and
water for mercury contamination) and was more than effectively employed for project execution (through
international consultants for design and implementation); on the other hand, project level indicators
(PDOS) were not effectively employed to monitor implementation progress. This was due to: (i) the Bank
not updating the indicators as part of Aide Memoires; and (ii) the Borrower not updating it as part of its
annual reports by the contractor (as the Borrower did not submit the reports). In sum, limited attention
was paid to project indicator monitoring. On the contrary, perhaps the most successful aspects of
reporting was Kazhydromet’s annual publication: “Informational Bulletin on Environmental Situation of
Nura River Basin,? on water, air, soil, and fish life monitoring. Hard copies were publically available and
electronically through their website.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Among the Bank’s Operational Policies (OP) for Safeguards, three policies were triggered. These were (i)
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), (ii) Safety of Dams (OP 4.37), and (iii) International Waters (OP
7.50).

(a) Safeguards
Environment: The Project triggered OP 4.01 and was classified as Category A (Full Assessment) at
appraisal since it could cause significant environmental impacts affecting an area broader than the sites or


12
   This includes analyses of mercury content in fish tissue at four sampling stations along the River and reservoirs and
communication to the public regarding recommended fish consumption.
13
   A results story was produced about the clean-up operation which can be viewed below, a second one on completion of Intumak
Reservoir Rehabilitation is scheduled to be released July 2013:

facilities subject to remediation. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was
conducted by a team of international and local consultants, independent of the project proponent (CWR)
and the World Bank. A final EIA report was submitted in October 2002, and was made available through
the World Bank’s Infoshop in May and again in July 2002. The EIA analyses included, among other
things, an in-depth evaluation of three alternative landfill sites, concluding with a strong recommendation
in favor of Opan Landfill site option, in view of floods and other environmental risks impacting the other
two sites. The EIA also provided an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which specified the
mitigation measures applicable to different stages of mercury clean-up. The EMP covered site
management and institutional control, health and safety protection for clean-up workers and nearby
residents, contingency planning and emergency response, waste removal from buildings, soil removal and
transport, and landfill operation. 14 During project implementation, some non-compliance with EMP was
reported from time to time, including the lack of mercury testing of workers and bypassing of trucks past
the transfer station, which was constructed to separate the white zones and black zones in transporting
contaminated materials; absence of fencing of working areas; and the conduct and wearing of protective
clothing by workers. 15 These shortcomings were treated as most serious, diligently handled with
immediate corrective actions during implementation, as agreed by the Bank, CWR, and PIU to help
improve the environmental performance of the contractor. Environmental safeguard monitoring
compliance, if undertaken during supervision regularly, was not always reported in the mission record
(Aide Memoires).
Dam Safety: Before appraisal, a dam safety assessment at the Intumak Dam was undertaken by
international experts, which confirmed the need for priority rehabilitation measures including completion
of the spillway and rehabilitation of the main dam (crest and bottom outlet) to allow the reservoir to retain
water, particularly during the flood season. The Intumak Reservoir could also act as a sink for residual
contaminants coming from the clean-up of upstream river stretches and the industrial and municipal
effluents being discharged. Moreover, the integrated water resource focus of the project favored the
rehabilitation and up-grading of the reservoir, dam and spillway, so it could play a multipurpose role. A
sedimentation management strategy was developed and a year-long monitoring program of mercury
levels and the observed methyl mercerization rates in the Intumak reservoir was launched. The findings
showed that 5% of all measured sediment samples had a mercury content of higher than 2.1 mg/kg and
that the organic mercury formation (methyl mercury) in the sediments was very low, up to a maximum of
0.1% of the already quite low total mercury content. Water analysis showed low mercury concentrations
but bio-accumulation in fish, particularly in predator species. Therefore, an accumulation of additional
sediments would cover the existing, more polluted, sediments and the rehabilitation design for the bottom
outlet would provide retention of the actual sediment layer allowing a controlled drawdown of water and
avoiding the discharge of suspended sediments as much as possible. Following the one-year monitoring
program of the mercury levels in water, sediments and fish in the reservoir and the evaluation by the
International Panel of Experts, it was concluded that the dredging of the bottom and riverbank sediments
in the reservoir was not required.
Legal Covenant: A legal covenant was embedded in the LA (Schedule 1, 3b) to mitigate uncertain risks
associated with mercury methylation in the Intumak Reservoir, making disbursement for civil works
under the Component 2 contingent on establishment of an International Panel of Experts (IPOE) and its
approval of the proposed work program for removal and management of sediments. A panel (established
in 2007) consisting of three international experts (chemical analyst, microbiologist, toxicologist) agreed
that the most important risk of the reservoir was associated with fish intake, and recommended this risk to

  Also endorsed by QAG/QAE6 (2003): “Handling of the environmental assessment was exemplary.?
15
  In 2009, during the MTR, the Bank mission found serious shortcomings in the compliance to environment, health and safety
requirement in the implementation of works under the B2 contract and that these findings were supported by complaints the Bank
received from people living in the vicinity of the works, in particular in the village of Chkalovo.


                                                             12
be regulated through communication to the public regarding the recommended fish consumption based on
the measured mercury levels.
International Waters: The Bank’s policy on International Waterways (OP 7.50) was triggered as under
the project as the Nura River is connected to Ishim River (which ends in Russia) by a canal near Astana.
Compliance with this Bank’s policy was considered as Satisfactory since Kazakhstan met its requirement
in terms of notifying the riparian country, and requesting comments. No comments were received, and in
absence of objections the project went ahead.
Social: At appraisal, Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) was not trigged. However, in 2010, one farmer
complained that her land was affected by project’s civil works (construction of temporary channel used
for the diversion of main drain channel during its clean-up). The affected land area was estimated to be
1.74 hectares out of a total 11.8 hectares of her land. The team consulted the Regional Safeguards
Coordinator and it was confirmed that adequate compensation for the temporary crop loss was paid to the
farmer, and restoration of land was planned. However, this issue was not fully resolved as the farmer
demanded more compensation instead of restoration works and did not allow the contractor to enter the
land to do the restoration works. At completion, the matter rests with the Government of Kazakhstan to
resolve.
(b) Fiduciary Compliance
Procurement: Overall rating of procurement during the project cycle is Satisfactory. At appraisal, a
procurement plan for project implementation for all components was developed and prior-reviewed. The
overall project risk for procurement was rated Medium to High, considering the lack of Bank procurement
experience in the PMU and the prevalent procurement environment in Kazakhstan. It was decided that in
order to minimize overall project cost and increase procurement and implementation efficiency - to tender
all three civil works contract packages under component 1 into one single contract package. However,
this tendering process was not successful as only one contractor submitted a bid with a significantly
higher price than the estimate (more than twice the estimate). The implementing agency proposed, with
agreement of the Bank, to reject this bid and to go for a re-bidding process by splitting the combined
package into two. This re-bidding process was successful, resulting in US$ 60 million cost savings and
was in line with estimated costs, however this did cost time (2005 when design packages were completed,
2007 when bids were awarded).Procurement staffing at the PMU was adequate but did encounter some
staff turnover (two changes of the procurement staff) during implementation.
Financial Management: Overall, Financial Management (FM) for the project components is rated
Moderately Satisfactory. This includes project accounting and reporting arrangements, staffing, internal
control procedures, planning and budgeting, counterpart funding, and financial manual and external
audits. The project was generally in compliance with the financial management requirements of the Loan
Agreement, the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) as well as audit reports. The IFRs were prepared in
format and content acceptable to the Bank. At the beginning of project implementation, problems of
delayed audit report submission was experienced mainly due to an inadequate budget allocation for audit
purposes by the Ministry of Finance; which made the project unattractive to audit firms acceptable to the
World Bank. However, submitted reports were unqualified and no major internal control issues were
highlighted, including the final one for FY2010.. The CWR/PMU maintained a manual accounting
system in Excel, after the system used during preparation became obsolete in 2005. This was mainly due
to insufficient technical support by the developer and frequent changes in legislation for governmental
agencies in Kazakhstan, as well as lack of allocation for the software update. The FM supervision mission
recommended an upgrade but this was never implemented. Nevertheless, the manual accounting system
and system back-up was adequate. FM staff turn-over at PMU was high (3 changes over an 8 year period).
The FM assessment of counterpart funding was generally considered Satisfactory, as the funds were made
available in full and in a timely manner; with the exception of the taxation reimbursement to the firm

eventually got resolved.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

All post completion institutional arrangements were either in place or planned for at completion. The
KazHydromet under the Ministry of Environment Protection, strengthened with the provision of
analytical equipment and training under the project, will continue to be responsible, and are budgeted by
the State (since 2007), to monitor water quality of the Nura River. They will continue to test and collect
hydrological, hydro-biological, and hydro-chemical data on a monthly basis from the 19 hydro posts
established along the Nura River and reservoirs. The findings will continue to be published annually in
“Informational Bulletin on the Environmental Situation of the Nura River,? and also disseminated through
the Ministry of Environment Protection website. The Karaganda branch of the CWR (Karaganda
Vodghoz) is responsible and budgeted to operate and manage the completed Intumak Dam, Reservoir,
and Spillway based on training, operation manuals and guidelines prepared in 2005. The energy generated
onsite would be sufficient for the dam operation, as well as supply to secondary users is possible (villages
or businesses in the vicinity). Nura-Sarysu River Basin Inspection is responsible and budgeted for
planning and inspection of the Dam, Reservoir and Spillway, however, water allocation plans for the
Intumak Dam and Reservoir were pending at project completion.

The hazardous waste landfill, constructed under the project, is completed, closed and re-vegetated. The
landfill is owned by the Karaganda branch of CWR (Karaganda Vodghoz), and was planned and budgeted
to be responsible for guarding, maintaining, and monitoring of the landfill after its closure. The landfill
has been designed for minimal maintenance after its closure and a post-closure management and
maintenance plan has been prepared. Land is still available in the landfill, which can also be used if
required for future containment of hazardous waste. However, the final decision is pending on who will
be the future operator of the landfill; responsible for the post-closure management and monitoring. This
matter has already been brought to the attention of the Vice Minister at the Ministry of Environment
Protection and should be resolved quickly.16 No direct follow up project has been planned, but the Bank is
financing the remediation of industrial waste dumps in Ust-Kamenogorsk and preparing a project on
POPs waste management in Kazakhstan.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project’s objective, design and implementation remain highly relevant to Kazakhstan’s development
and environmental priorities. The project’s objectives remain consistent with the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012-2017, and directly responds to two out of three broad areas of
engagement mainly: strengthening governance and public services, and ensuring development is
environmentally sustainable. Additionally, the project’s objectives also align with the Government’s
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP - 1998) which includes: de-mercurization to prevent loss of
water source in the basins of Nura River; and National Development Plan (2007-2010) identifies mercury
issues as a high priority. The project is also fully in line with the objectives of the recently approved
Green Economy Concept (2013) – that aims to reduce industrial hazardous and toxic wastes.17 In addition,



16
   This delayed decision was partly because the Government was debating whether to keep the landfill open for disposing of other
hazardous materials or whether to close its operations after completing mercury clean-up under the project. In the end, all the
stakeholders agreed to close the landfill.
17
   Green Economy Concept for the Republic of Kazakhstan, Astana, May, 2013.


                                                              14
the project places Kazakhstan in a good position regarding the new United Nations global, legally-binding
treaty to address mercury – the Minamata Convention on Mercury (signed in Geneva after four years of
negotiations on January 19, 2013).18 Therefore, the objective, design and implementation remain highly
relevant to the country context, sector demands, and the results focus is clear.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO consists of three parts: (i) improve the welfare of the population in the Nura River Basin by
cleaning up serious mercury pollution in and adjacent to the Nura River; (ii) providing a safe, secure and
cost effective alternative source of water supply to meet growing needs of local water users; and (ii)
restore flow control in the river for flood management and ecological purposes.

(i) improve the welfare of the population in the Nura River Basin by cleaning up serious mercury
    pollution in and adjacent to the Nura River.– Moderately Satisfactory

The primary focus of the project was to clean up a large concentration of mercury that threatened the
well-being of the local population both through: direct exposure and contamination of the water supply in
the Nura River Basin. All works were fully completed and the direct exposure and contamination of the
water supply from mercury has been removed successfully. Clearly, there are welfare gains achieved
under the project as a result of clean-up activities both in terms of overall well-being and health but are
not quantifiable for which reason the PDO achievement is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.
Outputs:
To achieve this objective, the focus was on the Karbide Factory Site Clean Up and adjacent territories, the
Landfill Construction for safe disposal of mercury contaminated waste and the clean-up of the Nura River
and its flood plains.
Karbide Factory Site Clean Up and adjacent territories
- Dismantling of the Karbide factory was completed in 2008. This comprised of nine structures in total
   (including six buildings, a heating plant, sediment pond, etc.) in a 3.5 hectare area on the factory side
   and 70 hectares of adjacent territories. All wastes, sub-ground structures and contaminated soils
   (varying from 2m-5m) were transported to the landfill. The sedimentation ponds of the wastewater
   treatment plant were fully remediated. The site was backfilled with clean clay, compacted, leveled
   and filled with top soil of 70cm and was covered with green vegetation.

Landfill Construction
- The construction of the hazardous waste landfill, meeting international standards, was completed and
   the facility has been operational since November 2008. The first hazardous waste landfill in
   Kazakhstan, with a capacity of 2 million tons covering an area of 160 hectares.
- A total of 2,142,457 tons of contaminated materials was disposed in the landfill cell for hazardous
   waste classes I, II, III, and IV (273,548 tons in Cell A2.1 for I class waste,19 1,868,909 tons in Cells
   A1.1-A1.3 for II-IV class waste20), which were closed, and sealed.

Nura River Clean Up



18
   The Minamata Convention on Mercury as the Global treaty is named after a city in Japan where serious health damage
occurred as a result of mercury pollution in the mid-20th Century. These damages occurred due to the uncontrolled release of
mercury in the bay from an Karbide Factory, the same type of factory which released the mercury in the Nura River in Temirtau
in Kazakhstan (http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43963&Cr=mercury&Cr1)
19
   Class I waste is all waste with mercury contamination higher than 1,500 mg.kg.
20
   Class II-IV waste is all waste with mercury contamination between 10 and 1,500 mg/kg.


                                                             15
-   A 30 km stretch of the Nura River, from the Samarkand reservoir to Rostovka village, was cleaned
    for mercury deposits, specifically 18km of Nura river bed, 9.2 km of bottom and banks, Zhaur
    Swamp, and cleaning the riverbed in Sadovoe village (500 m).
-   In total, 2 million m3 of polluted soil and river sediments were removed from the Nura River, its flood
    plains and the Karbide factory sites and its adjacent territories and were safely disposed.
-   Approximately 140,000 samples were undertaken and analyzed for mercury content in the pollution
    mapping over an area of 6,000 hectares.
Outcomes:
-   Beneficiaries - Six (6) villages between Temirtau and the Intumak reservoir where mercury
    contamination was removed and contained directly from the river bed, river bank and the flood plains
    under the project (Molodetskoe, Tegizzhol, Samarka, Volkovskoe, Rostovka, Samarkand villages), a
    population of approximately 6,000 directly benefited from having availability of service quality water
    for household needs and agriculture. In addition, there were three villages in the Bukhar-Zhyrau
    district of Karaganda region, which also benefited from clean up works: Chkalovo, Sadovoe and
    Gagarinskoe with a population of 1,600, where water samples from the operation boreholes used for
    household water supply taken after the clean-up works showed that mercury concentrations were less
    than 500 ng/l (MPC for drinking water preparation). Flood protection works were executed in
    Gagarinskoe village, with a total population of 750 people benefiting from flood protection. In
    addition, the population of Temirtau, 170,000 people benefited from clean-up works on the Karbide
    Factory site and adjacent territories.
-   Welfare gains - Clearly, the welfare gains were achieved under the project but are not systematically
    quantifiable. Also not quantifiable, but significant, were the reduced risks associated from exposure
    to mercury and the accompanying environmental and health risks.
-   Soil clean-up for mercury - Completed for the Nura River, Karbide Factory, Zhaur Swamp, river
    beds, flood plains and adjacent areas completed, confirmed accepted safe levels for upper soils 2.1
    mg/kg for garden use and 10 mg/kg for other uses of land (Annex 10).
-   Availability of agricultural and grazing land - Approximately 6,234 ha of land became available for
    agricultural and grazing purposes after the clean-up works were completed (see the economic analysis
    section).
-   Hazardous landfill - 71% (113 hectares) of the hazardous waste landfill is available for future
    activities. The landfill site also has the potential to operate commercially for revenue generation, but
    currently legislation to tax industries for hazardous waste are currently not in place in Kazakhstan.
-   Ambient mercury concentrations - Significant ambient mercury concentration emission reductions
    were recorded in and around the vicinity of the Karbide factory after clean-up. The air monitoring
    data confirms that prior to clean-up of the Karbide factory site the ambient mercury concentrations
    exceeded by far the permissible limit of 300 ng/m³ (ranging from over 6,000 to 140,000 ng/m³). By
    May 2009, on completion of clean-up activities, the MPC reading of ambient mercury concentration
    had fallen below 300ng/m3 (Details about the demolition and soil clean-up results are shown in Annex
    2 and 9).

(ii) restore flow control in the river for flood management and ecological purposes.– Highly Satisfactory

At the time of ICR completion of the Intumak Dam, Reservoir, and Spillway, 95% of civil works had
been completed which includeed the Dam, Spillway, Hydro power unit, transmission line, etc. Cosmetic
civil works are pending, such as lighting, road asphalting, clearing the site, etc. The reservoir is already
operational, with the newly available capacity, the spring floods of 2013 were retained in the reservoir, a
constant supply of water is now available to the wetlands and the flow control as originally foreseen for
the Nura River has been successfully restored as a result of the rehabilitation works and construction of
the Spillway.



                                                    16
Outputs:
- Reservoir designed capacity increased by 95% from 56 million m3 to 108.9 million m3, and
   operationally tested to a capacity of 120 million m3 (114%). The achieved operational capacity of
   reservoir was at least 10% more that the target value of 108.9 million m3.
- 118m length of spillway structure constructed with 11 operational gates, a cross bridge, an operation
   bridge, tower and a spillway with throughput capacity of 3000 m3/sec (once in 1,000-year flood
   event) was achieved.
- Dam rehabilitation and repaired capacity allows for a controlled flow downstream to the wetlands and
   villages, where in the past the spring flood could not be kept in the reservoir and resulted in
   downstream flooding.
- Upstream – a 5.7 km long flood-control protective dam near Amangeldy / Aktobe settlements was
   completed.
Outcomes:
- Flood management - downstream villages (approximately seven villages, and perhaps more smaller
   settlements) of the Intumak Dam will benefit from the reduction in the incidence of flooding and
   regulated surface water availability over the year due to flow control. In addition, up-stream villages
   (Amangeldy / Aktobe settlements) also benefitted.
- Ecological purposes - As a result of spillway and flow control a regulated supply of 253 million m3
   (based on constant supply of 8m3/second) would be available annually to the Korgaldzino wetlands.
   Moreover, an operational Intumak reservoir will also allow adapting the discharge in the lower Nura
   river section to the requirements of Korgalzhyn wetlands, if needed.

Source: Before – calculations based on Draft Detail Design Report for the Design of Intumak Reservoir Rehabilitation and
Technical Re-equipment. April 2007. After – calculated by the ICR team based on: Constant discharge of 8 m³/s over the entire
year can be provided up to a water recurrence probability of P=75%. In a very low water year the discharge will have to be
reduced to approx. 5 m³/s

-   Water allocation plans – were not completed, by project completion, but the strong institutional
    structure in the Ministry of Environment Protection and its affiliated institutions will ensure that
    these are undertaken.
-   Electricity generated - The hydro power unit in the Intumak Dam will also supply electricity to
    adjacent village Aktobe with a population of 764, through a power transmission line constructed
    under the project, in addition to meeting its own needs.
-   Employment - The reservoir and dam structure provided employment for 12-15 people and staffed 24-
    7 in the administrative building.
-   Accrued health and other benefits – Although this benefit cannot be quantified, accrued health
    benefits to the communities downstream as a result of cleaner water (i.e. free of mercury), and
    reduction in the incidence of flooding cannot be refuted.
-   Recreation and fishing – A functional and guarded reservoir could encourage recreation and fishing
    while eliminating the injury risk of visitors. The potential of developing a fishing industry can also be
    explored in the future. The safe dam structure, controlled water regime and clearly defined water level
    fluctuations could also allow for the development of enhanced recreational facilities such as boat
    rental or restaurants for the population in the cities of Karaganda, Saran and Shachtinsk.
-   Beneficiaries – Approximately 7 villages (a.Samarka (968), Akmeshit (Zakharovka) (684), a.Kievka
    (5,956), Akhmet (Entuziast) (1,396), Shakhtersk (983), Romanovka, Korgalzhyn (1067)), with a total
    population of 11,054, downstream from Intumak, benefitted directly from the clean-up of the Nura


                                                              17
    River, flow control and flood management. In addtion, 2 villages (Amangeldy / Aktobe settlements)
    upstream, with an approximate population of 1,000, also directly benefitted..
(iii)    provide a safe, secure and cost effective alternative source of water supply to meet growing needs
of local water users – Satisfactory
Outputs:
This objective was more of an outcome of the PDO, as a result of upstream mercury clean-up
rehabilitation of the Dam, Reservoir, and construction of the Spillway resulting in a safe and secure
alternative source of water supply to meet the growing needs of local water users. The evaluation of the
“cost-effective? part is beyond the project’s scope.
Outcomes:
-   Water availability downstream and to Astana – As a result of the reservoir’s retention potential of
    spring floods to be released throughout the year in controlled manner (i.e. a continuous discharge of
    8m³/s over the entire year) – which ensures a constant water supply downstream. Moreover, the
    rehabilitated reservoir has an higher “pollution trap? efficiency which has further reduced mercury
    concentrations downstream of the reservoir; and increased dilution of wastewater which still enters
    the Nura River (the portion of wastewater in Nura River can reach up to 60% of the total water
    volume upstream of the Intumak reservoir and even as high as 80% in water-poor years). As a result,
    the wastewater portion downstream of the reservoir will be approximately 35% of the river flow.
    Besides this dilution effect, the reservoir will improve water quality during natural self-cleaning
    capacity and sedimentation processes. Finally, water to the City of Astana (785,000 people), can be
    made available from spring 2013 onwards as a second source through the Ishim channel.
-   Water quality - The water sampling and analysis program, established under the Project produces
    quarterly and annual ecological monitoring results which showed a steady decline in mercury levels
    in surface water after the completion of works. All surface water is now meeting the Maximum
    Allowable Concentrations standard for drinking water of 500 ng/l as well as the EC Framework
    Directive standard for mercury levels of 270 ng/liter (see Annex 2).
-   Irrigation - Irrigation water quality on the 600 km long river stretch downstream of Yntymak
    reservoir in addition to improving the well-being of the population in this area, would increase
    irrigated land from the current 3,500 hectares to 20,000 in 2020.
-   Beneficiaries – Approximately 9 villages upstream (population: 7,600), and 9 villages downstream
    (population: 12,054), directly benefitted from a safe and secure source of water supply to meet
    growing needs of local water users. The city of Terimtau (population: 170,000) also indirectly
    benefitted from the availability of additional clean water. In addition, Astana (785, 000 people), can
    also benefit from the availability of water downstream of the Intumak Reservoir, its utilization,
    however, depends on the water needs, if it meets the State water quality standards, and if the required
    volume is guaranteed for the entire year.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The economic analysis in the original PAD was based on the cost effectiveness of two issues: (i) the need
to remove hazardous mercury deposits from the Karbide plant site and from the flood plains of the Nura
River, and (ii) the need to provide a secure and safe drinking water supply to residents of Astana as well
as communities adjacent to the river. In the ex-post analysis the cost-effectiveness of supplying water to
the residents of Astana is not included since, although available, it is only a standby supply option. Flood
protection benefits, biodiversity benefits for the Korgaldzino wetlands, health-risk benefits of mercury
removal and hydropower benefits are positive, however were not quantified. A more detailed discussion
on the inclusion of benefits is contained in Annex 3.


                                                    18
Benefits included in the ex-post analysis are those associated with water availability for irrigation
improved land values as a consequence of mercury removal. This allows the land to be used for more
productive uses and hence increases its value. Clean-up of the territories resulted in the following amount
of land being available for different purposes:


Upstream territories                   Hectares                              Land use availability
Karbide factory side                   3.5 hectares                          Industrial purpose
Adjacent territories                   70 hectares                           Industrial purpose

Downstream territories
Chkalovo gardens                       2.5 hectares                          Agricultural purpose
River Banks and floodplains            100 hectares                          Grazing purposes
Zhaur                                  28 hectares                           Grazing purposes
Hectares investigated and founds       6,103 hectares                        Grazing purposes
suitable for grazing purposes

Based on information from Karaganda land prices, average grazing land values are about USD360 per
year. Soil sampling and analysis found that a total of 6,231 hectares became safely available for grazing
yielding a total benefit of USD 2.24 million per year..

Approximately 2.5 hectares of land was also remediated to a level suitable for agricultural purposes.
Improved agricultural performance can be expected based on increased yields of agricultural products,
increased prices of commodities from more sustainable crop patterns with higher value crops, improved
soil conditions due to improved irrigation, better quality of water and lower risks of desertification. Using
a per hectare land benefit based on agricultural irrigation projects in Kazakhstan, USD 3,600 per hectare,
adding this to the grazing benefits and reduce total benefits to 50% as additional investments would be
required to realize the irrigation benefits, the total Economic Internal Rate of Return is 12%.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The Project was highly successful in achieving its project development objective of mercury clean-up of
the Nura River and the adjacent areas and restoring flow control downstream through the rehabilitation of
Dam, Reservoir and Spillway. It also lead to the welfare improvement of the adjacent population,
ensuring the availability of a safe and secure alternative source of water for local water users and those
further downstream to Astana. The clean-up also resulted in a more secure flood management regime for
downstream users and ensured the sustainability and survival of Kurgaldzhino wetlands from a constant
water flow. Overall the project benefitted almost 20,000 people directly and around 950,000 indirectly
due to availability of mercury-free service quality water. The project did suffer from some delays and
increased costs for reasons explained above, but charted a new path for a territory in Kazakhstan that has
been subject to severe environmental pollution problems for decades. The project positively dealt with
many unknowns and through a process of “learning by doing? resulted in full disbursement, and a
successful completion.

Relevance of the objectives is rated Highly Satisfactory, and design is rated Satisfactory. Part one of the
objective “improve the welfare of the population in the Nura River Basin by cleaning up serious mercury
pollution in and adjacent to the Nura River? is rated Moderately Satisfactory , Part two of the objective
“providing a safe, secure and cost effective alternative source of water supply to meet growing needs of
local water users? is rated Satisfactory; and part three of the objective “restore flow control in the river

for flood management and ecological purposes? is rated Highly Satisfactory. Overall, efficiency is rated
as Moderately Satisfactory. As a result, the overall Project Outcome is rated as Satisfactory21.

Rating: Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Inevitably welfare was improved through mercury removal to a level comparable to internationally
determined (WHO) standards as safe for public health. Performance indicators were linked to the
specified environmental and infrastructure interventions and not to the overall level of the population’s
welfare. Thus although welfare gains can be argued to be positive, they were not the focus and were not
quantified.

Investments in flood protection under Component 2 benefitted approximately 1,500 people from Aktobe
Village (764 people) and Gagarinskoye Village (730 people). These are relatively poor villages, and the
poor tends to be affected disproportionately affected when floods occur. So, the flood protection
investments are expected to have a positive impact on the poor in these villages. From the total amount of
beneficiaries under the project, as identified under section 3.2, half of them are females.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The following institutional changes were a result of the project:(i) The Nura River clean-up is the first
Government executed clean-up and realized construction and operation of a hazardous waste landfill
outside of the industrial sector; (ii) a definitional update and application of international clean-up norms
for soil remediation and hazardous waste land-filling, providing a practical application of ‘theoretical’
(Soviet) environmental soil quality standards; (iii) proper long-term environmental monitoring by a fully-
equipped and trained Kazakhstan Laboratory. In addition, the project also provided: (i) detailed design for
the first public hazardous waste landfill properly engineered according to international standards,
finalized and approved by all respective Kazakhstan institutions and government agencies; (ii) clean-up
norms have been defined and all governmental approvals for application of these international clean-up
norms have been obtained. Institutions and persons involved in these approvals and consultations were:
Ministry of Ecology, Sanitary Department of Ministry of Health, State Committee of Construction for
technological review and approval of design, Municipality and Regional Government Authority (Oblast),
NGO’s and local experts, Committee of Water Resources under the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
Economy and Kazhydromet (the laboratory). Kazhydromet received all equipment and all licenses related
to the measurement of mercury, were trained to international standards along with a new monitoring
program.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
- The Government demonstrated its commitment through continual financial support even after costs rose
in light of new information gained during implementation. This allowed the project to achieve, and even
exceed, several of its primary objectives.




21
   The last Implementation Status Report was rated as Moderately Satisfactory as not all works under the Project were completed
at Loan Closure and indicators were not yet met and the remainder was to be finalized and financed by 100% Government co-
financing. It is for this reason that the ICR was delayed until all works and results were completed with accompanying outcomes
and results achieved. It is for that reason that there is a disconnect between the last ISR and the ICR rating.




                                                              20
- The Committee of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture demonstrated their commitment to
engage the World Health Organization to examine mercury exposure and health effects in the burdened
areas of Temirtau and Karaganda. Specimens were collected (urine, hair, blood, breast milk) which
typically provide clinical effects of chronic elementary mercury burden, the results fortunately showed
that it was unlikely that severe mercury intoxication is very frequent in the area.

At project completion, all infrastructure investments and clean-up activities were complete and the assets
created were of good quality. The project ensured the sustainability of outcomes, including: (i) all assets
created under the project are owned by the Committee of Water Resources (CWR), under the Ministry of
Environment Protection (previously CWR was under the Ministry of Agriculture); (ii) Kazhydromet,
under the Ministry of Environment Protection, with offices in Karaganda received recurrent state budget
allocation since 2007; and has been nationally mandated the responsibility of water, soil, and air,
monitoring; (iii) the responsibility of managing the Nura River, Intumak reservoir, spillway and the dam
is spilt under two separate agencies: Nura-Sarysu River Basin Inspection and Karaganda Vodghoz, the
former responsible for planning and control of water resources in the Nura River, and the latter
responsible for the operation, management and implementation of the reservoir, dam and the spillway.
The State budget is also available to these agencies for these tasks.

One remaining task at completion, however, is the handing over responsibility of the landfill remains
pending, from the contractor to Karaganda Vodghoz. The budget is already available as well as an
operations manual for its maintenance. This matter has already been brought to the attention of the Vice
Minister at the Ministry of Environment Protection and should be resolved quickly. Therefore, the overall
risk to the development outcome is rated Moderate.

Rating: Moderate

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank’s performance during preparation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The project adequately
responded to sector and country demands with the objective to help Kazakhstan’s developmental and
environmental priorities through the reduction of mercury contamination in the Nura River Basin area and
rehabilitation of the Intumak Dam and Reservoir to improve downstream flow control. In addition, project
activities targeted priority areas identified in the National Environmental Action Plan. The project was
well-designed as a solid piece of environmental remediation, which also encompassed benefits from
improved water supply through improved water quality, availability for irrigation, and flow control of the
spring floods in the Nura River. While the PDO’s definition differed from PAD to LA it did not influence
the design of the project. In instances where the project’s objectives were unclear among some project
beneficiaries, this was corrected through a communications campaign.
The results framework was appraised without the detailed engineering studies, sampling and pollution
investigations and target values, as clean-up operations require a dense grid of sampling and lab analysis.


                                                    21
Despite this lack of prior information – when the information became available – baseline indicators were
established through the risk assessment; the target values were agreed based on international good
practice22.
The EIA, on the other hand, was complete and provided a pragmatic evaluation of alternatives and raised
the right design and implementation issues, including potential health risks. The impacts of
implementation delays on engineering, procurement implementation, and Government design approvals
could have been better identified at appraisal. Likewise, the project would have benefitted from a
beneficiary assessment. But overall, and technically speaking, the project was sound and activities were
implemented as designed.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank’s performance during implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Project supervision was
adequate during implementation, with the exception of two years when only one supervision mission was
fielded (2007 and 2008). Supervision missions continued even after loan closing to provide technical
advice to the implementing agency on completing the full project (the last part financed 100% by
government). It is acknowledged that for an environmental clean-up project, supervision was challenged
on many fronts, and the Bank responded proactively and was vigilant on project progression, such as
taking the necessary steps to keep it on track through procurement, technical design, and effectiveness
delays.
In the early period of implementation, the ISR ratings were too generous and optimistic. The supervision
documentation (ISRs, AMs) was rather succinct and brief focusing on the identification of strategic
implementation issues rather than a detailed overview of all aspects of project implementation; as they
were resolved on a real-time basis (e.g. phone calls, video conferences, etc) rather than only as part of
missions. Almost all procurement packages were handled on a prior-review basis, financial management
missions were undertaken separately; however the Aide Memoires also did not report on M&E.
If countersignature procedures in Kazakhstan would have allowed for a restructuring to become effective
prior to loan closing, the PDO and results indicators would have been formally restructured. However, the
project successfully achieved its outcomes for each component and in the launch of a successful and
sustainable monitoring program for the Nura River.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
The project was well-designed as an environmental clean-up operation. While there were some lapses
during project implementation support, they were not significant enough to downgrade performance, as
the technical thinking for the project evolved during implementation and the team managed them well.
The project not only faced extensive technical challenges inherently linked with pollution legacy and a
project of this scale - with 6,000 hectares of soil being investigated and 205 hectares physically cleaned -
but also the inherent riskiness of pollution management projects and the associated challenges in design,
execution, and associated costs. The Bank responded proactively to issues that arose during
implementation and adapted to the unpredictable circumstances in Kazakhstan and inherent to clean-up
operations. World Bank support to the Government of Kazakhstan in preparing and implementing the
project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory largely due to the impossibility of restructuring. Most
importantly, the project responded directly to the Borrower’s needs in a timely and responsive manner.



22
  Due to the costs associated with the detail design and detailed environmental site investigations, as well as the need for the
local laboratories to obtain modern lab equipment and training to be able to monitor mercury in addition to the need for the
investigation program for the Nura river flood plains to be done immediately prior to excavation due to changes in the spread of
contamination due to spring floods, the designs and full determination of extent of pollution could not be done during preparation.


                                                               22
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Government strongly supported the project and its objectives aligned with the National
Environmental Action Plan. This was demonstrated by the fact that the Government included this project
in its public investment program of 2004. The Government was willing during negotiations to increase its
share of overall financing and did so when the detailed sampling and investigations indicated the need for
additional financing. At project completion, Government’s contribution to the project was almost twice
(209%) the committed amount, a confirmed indicator of its unwavering commitment to the environmental
clean-up of the Nura River, its adjacent areas, and the rehabilitation of the Intumak Reservoir. The fifteen
months’ initial delay in reaching project effectiveness, as the parliament ratification process of the Loan
Agreement had to follow due course of the Kazakhstan legislation, did not majorly impact
implementation as the procurement process was happening in parallel. The Borrower continued to support
the Bank’s action in dealing with delays during design and implementation and through issues
encountered during implementation: regarding treatment of taxes in the contract of the supervising
engineer (as the changed legislation required foreign companies to establish registered companies in
Kazakhstan and thereby changing their taxation status). Also on the need to update the Feasibility Study
and the accompanying State approvals caused some delays, however these issues took time and were
resolved during implementation, and additional counterpart financing was made available. On this basis
the Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Committee of Water Resources (CWR) under the Ministry of Agriculture, as the main implementing
agency, remained committed to the project and provided satisfactory support and day-to-day project
implementation in resolving issues with intra-governmental procedures and supervision of contractors and
consultants. There were a few issues - with several changes of CWR’s Chairman and Deputy Chairman
CWR which led to delays in signing of procurement and payment documents. Staff turn-over also
remained high especially for procurement and financial management. The Implementing Agency/PMU
did not take a lead in submitting progress reports, which was adjusted in lieu of the contractor’s annual
progress report. Project level M&E of PDO indicators to monitor project progress was not undertaken by
the PMU during implementation. Management challenges of the Implementing Agency were also brought
to stage when the contractor had to take care and continue security and maintenance of the mercury
confined disposal facility after the expiration of the 7-month defect guarantee period.

Counterbalancing this shortfall, the PMU and Implementing Agency were effective in their role to obtain
State approvals for updated feasibility studies required to obtain additional budget; needed for the
supervision of contractors and to ensure on-target completion of activities for clean-up operations and the
rehabilitation of Intumak Reservoir. The PMU should also be commended for their ability in attracting
WHO for a Minamata disease investigation in the Nura River basin and Temirtau region.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
The overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the Government’s
commitment to achieve the Project Completion and Project Development’s Objective, their increased
financial contribution, but also taking into account delays in project implementation. Their support
remained strong at both the central and local levels of government even though the Committee of Water


                                                    23
Resources changed Ministries (from Agriculture to Environment) and two independent local agencies
were involved (Kazhydromet and Karganda Vodghoz). The project was successfully able to complete its
objectives of mercury clean-up of the Nura River, its adjacent areas, construction of the country’s first
international hazardous waste landfill and the rehabilitation of Intumak Dam and Reservoir.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned

Beneficiary assessment should be programmed in some form or manner in an environment clean-up
project. The project did not have much planned to assess the beneficiary impact of clean-up activities .
Ideally, this should be done at the design stage or during implementation, to better understand the
project’s impact on beneficiaries but also on other qualitative aspects related to welfare, poverty reduction,
etc. The beneficiary assessment can be a valuable tool in understanding the social gains made under the
project.

In pollution clean-up projects, adaptation to local conditions and inherent uncertainties regarding the
extent of pollution is largely a process of “learning by doing.? Pollution remediation is a risky business
based on its legacy, and exposed intrinsically to a high level of uncertainty, even with the most advanced
knowledge and sophisticated technology. When contamination occurs, the involved physicochemical
processes tends to be governed by complex, multi-factorial conditions that can lead to extremely irregular
pollution distributions and create a high probability for unforeseen situations that are uncovered only
during remediation works. And this all has implications on costs. No amount of up-front information
gathering by drilling, sampling and analysis will lead to 100 percent certainty and thus there is a need to
adapt to these circumstances during implementation.

The project design should factor in the risks associated with recurrent institutional changes and state
approval processes in Kazakhstan leading to delays. The project team should be cognizant of the country
systems in place and assess whether they pose any apparent risks. Then appropriate mitigation measures
should be in place to minimize the impacts of potential delays.

Upfront agreement with counterparts about operation and maintenance for the post closure landfill
should be planned. Post completion arrangements of all assets created, especially the landfill, should be
discussed and agreed with the Borrower before project completion or loan closing.

Project level M&E should be given due attention during project preparation and implementation. Due
to the nature of a clean-up operations, project level indicators need to be given due attention for changes
and monitoring during implementation. Since monitoring is complex it should thus be given greater
attention and weight during implementation. It is also important to have the client assume these
responsibilities to foster a target- and results-driven mindset within the country.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Nura Valley Mercury Clean-Up. This component included comprised of: (i)
construction of a secure landfill for proper containment of contaminated soil and materials; (ii) excavation
of contaminated hotspots at the AO Karbide plant site at Temirtau (factory building, main drain, and
adjacent waste disposal sites); and (iii) excavation of other highly contaminated areas including the Zhaur
Swamp, and critical areas of mercury accumulation along the banks and floodplains of the Nura River, as
well as the transport of the materials to the landfill. The component also financed the initial operation of
the landfill, and the establishment of a long-term monitoring and maintenance program for the landfill.
Additionally, funding was also provided for inspection and monitoring of the landfill construction and
soil-excavation process by independent experts to ensure that the selected contractors meet all technical
and environmental standards and safeguards.

1a - Landfill Construction
The Landfill Component involved the development and operation of a hazardous waste landfill, the first
one for Kazakhastan, on the Apan site. This site was pre-selected by the Government of Kazakhstan and
World Bank during the preparation/financing phase of the project. It is located on a block of state land
situated south of the city of Temirtau, approximately 4.0km south of and 2.0km west of the Astana-
Almaty Highway. This is bounded in its north east corner by a land tract leased to Asmat-Karmet for use
as an above ground land disposal facility. It is bounded on the south by a rural road running west from the
Astana-Almaty to the rural settlement of Saratovka and on the east by agricultural land (grain and grazing)
along an all weather secondary road running south from the Astana-Almaty Highway to the rural
settlement of Saratovka. The specific area allocated for landfill investigation covers 308.68ha and within
this an area a 162ha has been selected for development and detailed design work. The site itself was not in
use except for low grade pasture although other adjacent areas used for more intensive grazing and grain
production.

This Landfill Design was prepared by COWI A/S (the International Consultant) in partial fulfillment of
an assignment contracted for by the Committee of Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture of the
Republic of Kazakhstan (CWR).23 The physical scope of the landfill consisted of and completed included:
i) a heavy duty access road entering the site from the east and the south by a rural road running west from
the Astana-Almaty Highway/ Saratovka secondary road; ii) gate/reception/weigh scale/waiting area; iii)
landfill operational support infrastructure (offices, staff accommodation, maintenance facilities, utilities,
water capture treatment facilities, interior roads and security fencing); and iii) the active landfill cells. The
landfill consists of two types of cells, the Class I cell for highest mercury concentration of 100 – 1500
mg/kg designed with double layers of the High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) liner and a drainage
network. Another type of cell was constructed with a single layer of the HDPE liner for lower
concentration of mercury. As of September 2012, the landfill operations have been completed (including
all of the above) and the landfill has been closed and vegetated.

Pictures of the construction and re-vegetated landfill can be seen below:

-      All works under this component were satisfactorily completed. A Hazardous Waste landfill of
       728,700 square meters (160 hectares) was constructed in line with international standards in Opan,
       just outside of Temirtau City.
-      The construction of the hazardous waste landfill with capacity 2 million tons on an area of 160 ha
       fully complete and operational since November 2008.
-      The first hazardous waste landfill in Kazakhstan. The landfill has been designed and built in
       accordance with the international standards and with special attention for robustness and limited need
       for maintenance and monitoring after closure of the cell.
-      A 7.3 km of road also constructed to the landfill site for private access from the main road.
-      From November 2008 until end of July 2011, a total of 2,142,457 tons of contaminated materials was
       disposed in the landfill cell for hazardous waste classes I, II, III, and IV (273,548 tons in Cell A2.1
       for Class I waste, 24 1,868,909 tons in Cells A1.1-A1.3 for Class II-IV waste). 25 Closure of Cells
       A1.1-1.3 commenced in June 2011 and closure of Cell 2.1 commenced in August 2011. Closure of all
       Landfill cells was completed in October 2011.
-      113 hectares or 71% of the hazardous landfill site is still available for future containment of
       hazardous waste contamination. The project used only 47 hectares or 29% of the total 160 hectares.
-      The landfill could be operated commercially, however currently legislation is not in place in
       Kazakhstan to tax industries for hazardous waste disposal.
-      At completion, the operational arrangement of the landfill are pending, the landfill has been handed
       over to Karaganda Vodghoz, which has still not accepted. Currently the site is being managed by the
       contractors and is fully secured with operational management plans and budget already in place.

2a- AO Karbide Site Clean Up

Historically, the mercury contamination of the Nura River and the western parts of the city of Temirtau
originated from the AO Karbide factory and specifically the plant area devoted to the manufacturing of


24
     Class I waste is all waste with mercury contamination higher than 1,500 mg.kg.
25
     Class II-IV waste is all waste with mercury contamination between 10 and 1,500 mg/kg.


                                                               28
synthetic rubber using a process that involved the hydration of acetylene in the presence of mercury based
catalyst. The release of mercury in various forms to the Nura River occurred primarily via wastewater
discharges through treatment lagoons and subsequently a combined municipal/industrial wastewater
treatment plant (WWTP). Wastewater from the factory had a substantial content of mercury, and
uncontrolled distribution of the wastewater and treatment residues were the primary source of the
widespread mercury contamination in the surroundings of the factory site and eventually the Nura River
and Valley. Additional contamination also reached the river via airborne mercury vapour and
contaminated particulate transport, and surface water run-off contamination from materials deposited on
the Karbide plant site, in various depositories associated with the WWTP. As a result mercury
contamination spread in the vicinity and the city of Temirtau resulting inevitably in exposure of the
general population. In response, the overall objective of the upstream clean up and the whole of the Nura
River project has been the elimination of mercury contamination threats to the Nura River and
enhancement of the general welfare of the population, specifically reduction of public health risks
associated with mercury contamination.

This entailed detailed pollution sampling (ambient and soil) analysis and mapping showed mercury levels
ranging from 10 mg mercury per kilogram of soil (mg/kg) to more than 1,500 mg/kg. . The air monitoring
data confirmed that prior to clean-up of the Karbide factory site the ambient mercury concentrations
exceeded by far the permissible limit of 300 ng/m³, ranging from over 6,000 to 140,000 ng/m³.

The Karbide factory and its sub-ground structures were safely dismantled and demolished between
November 2008 and May 2009, and the debris were transported and safely disposed off at the new
hazardous waste landfill, which was constructed with international standards and became operational in
November 2008. Adjacent areas were remediated and contaminated soils around the factory were
excavated up to a depth of two meters and transported to the landfill. The total amount of contaminated
materials from this factory site (3.5 hectares) was approximately 125,000 tons, and the site was back-
filled with clean clays and topsoil of approximately 62,000 cubic meters.

The AO Karbide Site Clean Up Design was also prepared by COWI A/S (the International Consultant).
The Upstream Clean up Component design addressed the widespread Hg contamination in the soil and
structures located in the western industrial area of Temirtau. For purpose of assessment and ease of design
the scope was sub-divided ten sub-components as follows: i) Karbide factory site; ii) Sedimentation
ponds; iii) WWTP; iv) Ash Dump; iv) Main drain; v) Areas west and north of the WWTP; vi) Chkalovo
Settlement and areas west of the main drain; vii) Other contaminated areas; ix) New collector (new main
drain); and x) General surface drains.26 The basis for defining these sub-components and the resulting
sub-component specific design approach was the detail site investigations under taken by the Consultant,
AIPET and Azumut. These investigations along with the results of previous investigations have been
utilized to estimate the extent and levels of Hg contamination, along with assessments of existing ground
and surface water contamination, contamination levels in structures and levels of Hg vapour emissions on
the Karbide site, and hydrogeological/hydrological characteristic of the sites. The results indicate that
contamination in excess of 2.1mg/kg was widespread over much of the area of interest. It generally is
highest at the surface but extends to a depth of 4m in some locations. Specific “hot spots? where
significant areas of high concentration levels are identified in the Karbide site structures, on the Karbide
site itself, as well at the WWTP, in the sedimentation ponds and ash dump. Additionally contamination
was identified in the area around the Chkalovo Settlement in garden areas, indicating a high risk of human
exposure. Evidence of surface water contamination is found in the main drain, particularly near the Nura


26
   The threshold level for removal or clean up criteria was set at 10mg/kg in the preparatory and financing stages, even though the
regulatory limit applicable in Kazakhstan is 2.1mg/kg. Similarly, it was assumed that all material in excess of 1,500mg/kg would
require pre-treatment prior to land disposal, although methods for doing so were not specified.


                                                               29
River. Significant shallow ground water contamination was found around the Karbide site and to a lesser
degree around the WWTP and upper main drain. However, the assessment the hydrogeology indicates
that this should be confined to shallow ground water and that area is underlain by significant natural
hydraulic barrier. Furthermore, shallow ground water flows are generally very low, thus limiting transfer
of contamination to potentially connected surface water bodies, particularly the Samarkand Reservoir.27

-    Karbide Factory Site - This area is the site of AO Karbide which was the original source of mercury
     contamination. On the site AO Karbide was manufacturing synthetic rubber using a process that
     involved the hydration of acetylene in the presence of mercury based catalyst. The site area covers
     approximately 35,000m2. Buildings and other structures of the factory still exist on the site, though
     some are partial demolished. One of the buildings is an electrical sub-station that is still in use and
     owned by Alash. Contamination on Karbide is found in soil, groundwater and buildings and
     structures including sub-ground structures like drains, sewers etc. Metallic mercury was known to be
     present in buildings and presumably in soil. The whole of Karbide was seen as one hotspot with high
     concentrations in every media. Pathways of spreading of contamination from Karbide were air in the
     form of dust and to some degree volatized mercury, surface water and groundwater. Karbide was seen
     as a source of ongoing spreading of mercury to surroundings. Besides being a hotspot in general
     Karbide is a major clean up priority for a number of reasons. Buildings must be demolished to
     eliminate the potential spreading of mercury contaminated dust if or when they simply collapsed due
     to their poor structural condition. There were expected to be quantities of metallic mercury present
     which is an ongoing source of air contamination.
-    Sedimentation Ponds – included 4 operating sedimentation ponds which were used by the WWTP,
     contaminated to various degrees. The contamination in the sediment and water was found to be
     relatively high in the 3 smaller ponds (above 1,500 mg/kg), but fairly low in the largest pond. The
     ponds were seen as an ongoing source for contamination of the Nura River via the continuous water
     run-off via the WWTP and the main drain and in case of overflow of the ponds. The sedimentation
     ponds posed special problems for the clean-up project design since they were operational and filled
     with water.
-    WWTP - The WWTP was operating as a combined industrial/municipal biological waste water
     treatment plant for the City of Temirtau and the Alash factory. It was located adjacent to a separate
     waste water treatment plant that exclusively deals with discharges from the Ispat-Karmet steel
     complex that is considered outside the scope of the clean up project. Several major hotspots are found
     in soil and sludge deposits of the WWTP and samples from groundwater are found to be relatively
     contaminated. In general, the WWTP contains substantial surface contamination and subsurface, but
     it is particularly concentrated in the areas around the concrete lined drying beds where historical
     deposits of activated sludge removed from the beds are piled. The sludge now consists of an organic
     peat like deposit which is potentially flammable. There are also a series of long deserted bio-filters
     within the WWTP that likely also contain residual Hg contamination, although it was noted that the
     general population have scavenged the charcoal material from the beds as fuel over the years. The
     WWTP is seen as a major source of ongoing contamination with pathways of surface water,
     groundwater and airborne particulate transfer. There are no indications of metallic mercury being
     present at the WWTP. Contamination from the WWTP area could move relatively rapidly to the Nura
     River via surface run off and the main drain.

   The general clean up standard for mercury used in Kazakhstan is 2.1mg/kg. As in many countries, a criterion such as this is
considered appropriate when the human use of the contaminated area is of the most sensitive kind like children playing,
gardening, farming and intensive recreational activities. However, since the current and historic use of the clean up project areas
is largely industrial and not sensitive based on the above uses, a higher intervention clean up criteria is appropriate. Consistent
with project preparation approach based on EU practice and that subsequently recommended as a “temporary? clean up criteria
by the RSE National Centre of Labour Hygiene and Professional Diseases, a general intervention clean up criteria of 10mg/kg
has been chosen.


                                                                30
-   Ash Dump - Activated sludge was also stored in lagoons constructed on the top of a power station ash
    dump located to the north of the WWTP and connected to it by an above ground small diameter pipe
    line. These deposits were located in one corner of the ash dump closest to the WWTP. The highly
    contaminated material in the exposed bed of these lagoons was similar to that noted around the drying
    beds of the WWTP and understood to periodically ignite. A major hotspot was found on the western
    edge of the ash dump where concentrations above 1,500mg/kg are found in soil/ash. Contamination is
    in general found in the western part of the ash dump. The ash dump and especially the hotspot are
    seen as an ongoing threat to the Nura River. Pathway of contamination is primarily surface water run
    off.
-   Main drain - The WWTP discharges into an open drain running north to the Nura River. This drain
    handles the combined flow of both the WWTP and the separate Ispat-Karmet industrial wastewater
    treatment facility with the latter accounting for more than 90% of the volume. The main drain was
    characterised by a high and relatively constant flow rate. The Ispat-Karmet discharges were also
    responsible for what appears to be the high suspended solids content in the main drain discharges.
    Contamination with mercury in discharges in the main drain is currently relatively low and generally
    meets local and international water quality standards. Higher concentrations of discharges were noted
    at the lower end of the drain close to the river where it takes a 90 degree turn to the west and widens
    up. Contamination in soil of the banks of the drain is found, particularly upstream the road bridge
    near Chkalovo. Dredging of the drain has been done occasionally and sediments from the drain have
    been placed on the banks. Where the main drain runs into the Nura River near the settlement of
    Chkalovo contamination is found in topsoil of the left bank of the main drain. Here concentrations up
    to 100mg/kg were found. Contamination is believed to come from the main drain. Lower levels of
    surface soil contamination are found adjacent to the drain particularly in the sections closest to the
    WWTP, but are also noted in the area immediately around its outfall to the river within and adjacent
    the settlement of Chkalovo. The main drain was seen as an ongoing source of spreading of mercury
    contamination directly to the Nura River especially in spring when water run off is at its maximum.
-   Areas west and north of WWTP – Higher concentrations of mercury in soil were found in areas west
    and north to the WWTP. A hotspot in soil with concentrations above 1,500 mg/kg was located
    directly west of the WWTP. This hotspot must be seen as a part of the western hotspot of the WWTP.
    These areas must be seen as an ongoing threat of contamination where especially surface water run
    off will carry mercury contamination to the Nura River via the main drain.
-   Chkalovo Settlement and areas west of the main drain - In the northern row of gardens in Chkalovo
    contamination above 2.1mg/kg in the topsoil was found. Additionally, the area west of the main drain
    was used for gardening by local people. Part of this area was contaminated with high mercury
    concentrations (above 100mg/kg). The contamination of both these areas was seen as a threat to
    people using them because of the direct contact with contaminated soil. The threat to the Nura River
    was of some concern especially for the area close to the river.
-   Other contaminated areas (New collector/new main drain/ General surface drains) - The original
    primary path of contamination from the Karbide site, and ultimately that going to the Nura River was
    the wastewater drain between the overall plant site and the WWTP. This drain remains in service for
    the Alash factory. Furthermore, the drain within the plant site was understood still to be physically
    connected to the Karbide Site. Indications were that except on the Karbide site itself, it is unlikely to
    contain significant levels of contaminated material. However, once the Karbide site has been isolated
    it should be physically cleaned and access points secured such that surface water access is controlled
    or stopped. Surveys also found contamination in soil in other areas than the above mentioned. North
    of the Alash/Karbide site an area of contamination up to more than 100 mg/kg was found. This
    contamination is believed to be the result of airborne dust from Karbide and Alash. On the route of
    the plant drain between Alash and the WWTP an area with soil contamination up to 100 mg/kg was
    found. Leakages on the drain or random dumping of waste at some point are assumed to be the source
    of this contamination. To the southeast of the sedimentation ponds and the WWTP is an area with soil
    contamination above 100 mg/kg. The origin of contamination was believed to be waste water or


                                                     31
   surface water from old sedimentations ponds or leakage from the present ones. None of these areas
   are considered as a major ongoing threat of contamination.

-    Cleaning the territory and dismantling of Karbide factory and adjacent contaminated territories total
     area is above 70 ha and reconstruction of the main drain of Temirtau city 3.01 km completed.
-    Dismantling of Karbide factory completed in 2008. This comprised of nine structures in total
     (including six building, a heating plant, sediment pond etc.) in a 3.5 hectares area. All wastes, sub-
     ground structures and contaminated soils (varying from 2m-5m), in total 196,500 tons, were
     transported to the landfill. The sedimentation ponds of the wastewater treatment plant have been fully
     remediated. The site has been backfilled with clean clay, compacted, leveled and filled with a top soil

     of 70cm and is now covered with green vegetation.
-    Excavation and removal of mercury polluted soil/materials was done until international accepted safe
     levels for upper soil layers - 2.1 mg/kg for garden use (Chkalovo Settlement), and 10 mg/kg for other
     use. Detailed soil mapping was done with the laboratory analysis before the excavations/containment
     and then the detailed laboratory analysis after the excavation/containment to determine whether the
     soil is sufficiently cleaned to the required standards (some illustration can be seen in Annex 3).
-    Significant ambient mercury concentration emission reductions were recorded in and around the
     vicinity of the A O Karbide factory after clean-up. The air monitoring data confirms that prior to
     clean-up of the Karbide factory site the ambient mercury concentrations exceeded by far the
     permissible limit of 300 ng/m³ (ranged from over 6,000 to 140,000 ng/m³). By May 2009, on
     completion of clean-up activities, the MPC reading of ambient mercury concentration had fallen
     below 300ng/m3 (see graph below). Also, during demolishing and temporary storage of the polluted
     material, access to the factory site was only permitted to authorized personnel sufficiently equipped.

-            Approximately 458,500m3 of contaminated soil was excavated, and almost 959,000m3 of soil was
             backfilled and contained in the Karbide factory and its vicinity.

3a - Nura River Clean Up

The approach adopted to meet the project objectives was to remove all mercury contaminated material
from the section between Samarkand reservoir and Rostovka village showing concentrations higher than
the clean-up criteria. Design of the Nura river clean-up consisting of the removal of contaminated river
sediments, flood plains, river banks, cleanup of polluted areas at the Zhaur Swamp, and area between
Zhaur Swamp and Nura River. All contaminated material was to be deposited at a hazardous waste
landfill near Termirtau.

Since the success of the clean-up depended on accurate investigation results and therefore it is necessary
to do the investigation immediately prior to the excavation works. A total of approximately 11,000
hectares 19 kilometers along the Nura River, downstream of Temirtau, was investigated for mercury
contamination to assess the need for clean-up operations. Based on the 1% probability (100 year) flood of
the Nura river during springtime, all possible areas contaminated with mercury were investigated with
different degrees of accuracy in the following categories:
 Villages and near surroundings (455 hectares)
 Riverbed and floodplains near the river, including the Zhaur Swamp (4,795 hectares)
 Remote floodplains (5,736 hectares)
The sampling was done in villages and their near surroundings on a 20 m x 20 m grid; along the riverbed
and floodplains near the river the grid was 25 m x 25 m; and in the remote floodplains the sampling grid
was 50 m x 50 m. The sampling and testing of mercury-levels was conducted and used in order to assess
the need for clean-up activities. A total of approximately 140,000 samples were taken and analyzed for
this purpose. In line with international standards, a clean-up criterion of 10 mg/kg was adopted for the
river bed sediments, river banks, Zhaur swamp, and floodplains. For house gardens used for growing
vegetables and fruits, the clean-up criterion of 2.1 mg/kg was applied. Consultant conducted a data
verification program during summer 2004. Over 700 samples were analyzed concerning their mercury
concentration and compared with data available. The total volume to be excavated amounts to 1.96
million m³, whereof approximately 7% is located in the Zhaur swamp, 4% in the river bed as sediment
and the major part – 83% - are the ash layers at the river banks. The results of the pre-excavation
investigation program were then plotted onto pollution maps (some examples of the pollution maps have


                                                                                        34
been provided in Annex 10). These maps provided the data for the excavation details and the areas to be
excavated. Finally, all contaminated materials (mercury-contaminated soils, ashes and sediments from the
villages, river banks, riverbeds and floodplains) higher than the clean-up criteria were excavated and
transported to the landfill. The baseline was determined based on detailed pollution sampling, laboratory
analysis and mapping which revealed mercury levels in soil and sediments range from 50- 500 mg/kg.
The results of the pollution mapping exercise are shown in Annex 3.

Mercury polluted soil and materials were excavated to international accepted safe levels for upper soil
layers: 2.1 mg/kg for garden use and 10 mg/kg for other use of land and 50 mg/kg for more remote areas.
In total, more than 2 million tons of polluted soil and materials were excavated and transported to the
landfill alongside the Nura River from Temirtau to 19 kilometer downstream. Excavation works were
finished in July 2011.

Component 2: Intumak Reservoir Rehabilitation. This component financed the rehabilitation of the
Intumak Reservoir, including reinforcement of the earth-fill dam and completion of the spillway and gates
to allow the dam to operate as a mechanism for flow control at its original design reservoir level. This
would allow development and implementation of an integrated water resources management plan for
Intumak and the upstream Samarkand and Sherubianur Dams and reservoirs. However, owing to
uncertainty about the effect of raising the operating level at the Intumak Reservoir on mercury
methylation, any disbursement for civil works related to this component was conditional to the review and
agreement by the International Expert Advisory Group. Provisions were made in the cost estimate for this
component to cover any cost of additional dredging works required, in the event that the results of the
monitoring and assessment indicates a risk of unacceptable levels of mercury methylation associated with
increased operating levels, completion of the spillway and gates would be postponed until mercury
deposits in the bottom of the reservoir could be removed and transferred to the landfill.

Rehabilitation of earth fill main dam (1.6 km long and maximum height of 22.5 meters),

Outputs:
- Reservoir designed capacity increased by 95% from 56 million m3 to 108.9 million m3, and
   operationally tested to a capacity of 120 million m3 (114%). The achieved operational capacity of
   reservoir was at least 10% more that the target value of 108.9 million m3.
-   Rehabilitation of earth fill main dam (1.6 km long and maximum height of 22.5 meters),
    completion of spillway, refurbishment and adaptation of bottom outlet, installation of a small
    hydro power plant of 700kw
-   118m length of spillway structure constructed with 11 operational gates, a cross bridge, an operation
    bridge, tower and a spillway with throughput capacity of 3000 m3/sec (once in 1,000-year flood
    event) was achieved.
-   A 1.52 km diaphragm wall for the earth dam of Intumak reservoir was completed to stop seepage
    through the dam crest (seepage has ceased). As a result, the dam safety issue has been resolved.
-   Reconstruction of the bottom outlet with a small Hydro Power Plant (750 kw) throughput capacity of
    60 m3/sec. In addition a 21.2 km power line to Intumak reservoir was also laid.
-   Dam rehabilitation and repaired capacity allows for a controlled flow downstream to the wetlands and
    villages, where in the past the spring flood could not be kept in the reservoir and resulted in
    downstream flooding.
-   Upstream – a 5.7 km long flood-control protective dam near Amangeldy / Aktobe settlements was
    completed.

-   Following a one-year monitoring program of the mercury levels in water, sediments and fish in the
    reservoir and the evaluation of the International Panel of Experts, the dredging of the bottom
    sediments in the reservoir was not required.

Component 3: Nura-Sarysu River Basin Authority Strengthening. This component was to finance
technical assistance, training and equipment necessary to develop the institutional capacity of the Nura-
Sarysu River Basin Authority in resource planning and management, as well as to strengthen the water
quality monitoring network, water pollution control system, and regulatory framework. Supplementary
assistance from the Japanese government provided (with the participation of Japanese experts from the
Minamata Institute) technical support in the design and implementation of a program to monitor and
assess mercury pollution in the Intumak reservoir. As well as long term support for the development and
implementation of comprehensive water quality monitoring program to address the risks associated with
occasional recontamination of the river due to residual mercury depositions and/or periodic high flood
levels. Also funded the participation of the International Expert Advisory Group.

Accordingly, testing equipment and analytical reagents were procured for the KazHydromet laboratories,
and staffs at the laboratories were trained for mercury analysis. The training and technical assistance,
including study tours, related to water resource planning and reservoir operation remained with the River
Basin Authority under the Committee of Water Resources who are in charge for the operation and
management of the Intumak Reservoir and its new spillways and installed small hydropower station. Also,
detailed guidelines for the Operation and Management for the Intumak reservoir were developed for the
River Basin Authority.

Under component 3 of the Project, water quality monitoring stations where installed in the Nura
River, starting from the main drain where the industrial wastewater used to enter the Nura River
until the monitoring point downstream the Intumak Reservoir. The following monitoring points
were installed: (i) 1 km upstream of the discharge of industrial sewage water in the main drain;
(ii) Main drain channel; (iii) Nura River, 1 km below the main drain at Chkalovo village; (iv)
Nura River, 5.7 km below main drain (Tegiz zhol area); (v) Nura River, Molodetskoye village;
(vi) Nura River, just upstream of Yntumak Reservoir; and (vii) Nura River, Downstream of
Yntumak Reservoir.

The PDO target for water quality downstream of the Intumak Reservoir was defined in line with
the EU Framework Water Directive which indicates that Mercury levels should be 0.07 micro
gram/liter plus the background concentrations for inland waters. This is equivalent to70 ng/liter.
The background mercury pollution (upstream of the pollution source) varies between 50-200 ng/l.
The target was therefore set at 270 ng/l; Kazakh regulations specify 500 ng/l as the maximum
permissible concentration for mercury.

Additional monitoring was undertaken for groundwater resources used for drinking water along
the villages of the Nura River, in particular Chkalovo, Sadovoe, Samarkand and Gagarinskoe
villages. Water was investigated for complete chemical analysis (including all heavy metals and
mercury) and radiological and sanitary- microbiological investigation were carried out as well
and samples were taken from operation boreholes used for household water supply. The analysis
showed that general mercury concentration in the boreholes is less than the Maximum Allowable
Concentration of 500ng/l. The analysis further showed increased level of pollution in terms of
chlorides, nitrate nitrogen, and also total hardness, particularly in Chkalovo village, but that in

general the selected water samples complied with the Sanitary-Epidemiological Requirements
for non-centralized household water supply.

Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring. This component covered a number of activities
related to project management and monitoring, including the incremental operating costs and technical
assistance to PMU, which included: (i) training in areas such as procurement, disbursement, and project
accounting; (ii) auditing of project accounts; (iii) assistance in the implementation of the environmental
management plan, especially with regard to public awareness; and (iv) specialist assistance in areas such
as hydrology, social sciences, and environmental management. Training in procurement, disbursement,
and project accounting provided to the PMU designate staff and implementation of the Environmental
Management Plan and implementation of public information campaigns.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The original PAD based the economic analysis of the benefits on the cost-effective solution of the Project
to two issues: (i) the need to remove hazardous mercury deposits from the Karbide plant site and from the
flood plains of the Nura River, and (ii) the need to provide a secure and safe drinking water supply to
residents of Astana as well as communities adjacent to the river.

With respect to the hazardous mercury deposits, detailed studies were carried out during project
preparation as well as project implementation to define an appropriate level of intervention based on an
assessment of the costs of adopting alternative standards with respect to cleanup versus the risks that
untreated sites would lead to unacceptable dissemination of pollutants. By using international standards
for target clean-up values and based on a risk assessment regarding the exposure paths of the pollution to
the population and the land use, the international value of 10 mg/kg was used for industrial and grazing
land use areas and 2.1 mg/kg for agricultural use which encompassed a much more costs effective
solution than the application of the Kazakh standard of 2.1 mg/kg for all areas.

Regarding the need to provide a secure and safe source of water supply, the removal of mercury pollution
to drinking water standards and possibility for flow management to retain the spring flood and allow for a
regular release of water throughout the year in a controlled manner. This allows for an opportunity for a
costs effective manner of providing a second source of water supply for Astana city, the communities
adjacent to the Nura River and irrigation land. In addition, the regulated flow regime allows for constant
supply to the Korgaldzino wetlands.

The original project evaluated the economic benefits mostly on the basis of the costs savings for water
supply for Astana, According to national development plans, Nura water should be used for the water
supply of the capital city of Astana or at least serve as an economically feasible standby solution. A canal
connecting the Nura and the Ishim river exists and has been rehabilitated and water could be diverted in
the Ishim river and be used as drinking water source for the fast growing population of Astana (785, 000
people), presumed the water quality meets national standards and the required discharge can be
guaranteed year-round. However at this time, water is foreseen as standby solution only, therefore the
benefits of water supply to Astana is not included in the ex-post economic analysis.

The one-year monitoring program to identify the mercury risks, together with the increased water volume
in the reservoir allows for the reservoir to serve as a pollution trend and support the purification of the
reservoir water body and fulfills the objective of a pollution trap. Due to the regular and controlled flow
of water release throughout the year, the reservoir can assist in dilution of wastewater particular in the
current low flow period from June to March (after the spring floods). The portion of wastewater in Nura
river can reach 60% of total water just upstream of the Intumak reservoir and reach more than 80% in
water poor years. Whereas during months of abundant discharge the wastewater is diluted, in the
following months - important for irrigation along the river, fishing and recreational activities – the
anthropogenic contamination in the river water is quite high. Intymak reservoir will store parts of the
spring flood water and provide a continuous discharge of 8m³/s over the entire year. As a result,
wastewater portion downstream of Yntymak reservoir will be approx. 35% of the river flow. Beside this
dilution effect, Ynytmak reservoir will improve water quality during natural self-cleaning capacity and
sedimentation processes. The irrigation water quality on the 600km long river stretch downstream of
Yntymak reservoir will therefore be better and improve the well being of the population in this area. This
could allow for increase of irrigated land from the current 3,500 hectare to 20,000 in 2020 in accordance
with national development plans.




                                                     40
Therefore it is crucial to have a functional reservoir to even out the discharge in the Nura river in the
concerned section according to the water demand. The dilution of the wastewater discharges will allow
less cost intensive water treatment before feeding the water supply network of Astana.

In addition the flood protection works executed in Gagarinskoe village and Aktobe village provided
substantial flood protection benefits and the dam safety issues of the Intumak Reservoir Dam have been
addressed.

Lastly, the reconstruction of the bottom outlet has allowed for installation of small Hydro Power Plant
(750 kw) with throughput capacity 60 m3/sec.

The clean-up of the territories resulted in the following amount of land being available for different
purposes:

Upstream territories                   Hectares                              Land use availability
Karbide factory side                   3.5 hectares                          Industrial purpose
Adjacent territories                   70 hectares                           Industrial purpose

Downstream territories
Chkalovo gardens                       2.5 hectares                          Agricultural purpose
River Banks and floodplains            100 hectares                          Grazing purposes
Zhaur                                  28 hectares                           Grazing purposes
Hectares investigated and founds       6,103 hectares                        Grazing purposes
suitable for grazing purposes

Based on information from Karaganda land prices, grazing land value amounts to USD360 per year,
amounting to benefits of USD 2.25 million a year as 128 hectares have been cleaned to grazing status and
the extensive sampling and analysis program found that an additional area of 6,103 hectares is also
suitable for grazing purposes.

With annual regulated flow from the Intumak reservoir suitable for irrigation standards, based on the
government plans to increase the irrigated land from 3,500 hectares currently to 20,000 hectares in 2020,
benefits have been determined based on estimated average agricultural return per hectare for irrigated
land. Improved agricultural performance can be expected based on increased yields of agricultural
products, increased prices of commodities due to cropper patterns into more sustainable patterns with
higher value crops, improved soil conditions due to improved irrigation, better quality of water and lower
risks of desertification. Based on agricultural projects in Kazakhstan, evaluating incremental benefits
attributable to irrigation benefits, USD 3,600 of irrigation benefits are estimated per hectare. Benefits
have been taken for 50% as additional investments would be required to realize the irrigation benefits.

This leads to an Economic Internal Rate of Return of 12%. Flood protection benefits, the biodiversity
benefits for the Korgaldzino wetlands, the health benefits of removal of mercury pollution and the
hydropower benefits are not quantifiable. Even though not quantifiable, the risk of exposure to mercury
and the accompanying environmental and health risks have been eliminated with the clean-up to
appropriate standards.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal
Brief history and project goals are summarized below.
From the 1950s till 1997 the synthetic rubber factory in Temirtau used sulphuric acid and a sulphate salt
of mercury as catalyst in its acetaldehyde unit. The original wastewater treatment plant was not designed
to remove mercury, resulting in significant releases of mercury to the plant Main Drain, which entered the
Nura River.
Overflow of the WWTP was discharged to the main drain through an underground collecting channel, and
from there into the Nura River. Tank silt that accumulated in treatment tanks was deposited onto sludge
drying beds. Sludge of poor quality was discharged into the depression known as the Zhaur swamp and
mercury containing sludge was also deposited in the old ash lagoon of the KarGRES-1 thermal power
plant, located on the banks of the Nura River.
Though the factory complex closed in the late 1990s, several surveys confirmed that the wastewaters of
Temirtau entering the Nura River still carry mercury and continue contaminating the river and that
mercury contaminated ash deposits can be encountered along the Nura River and its flood plains.
In 2004 Law of Republic of Kazakhstan №556-II LRK dated 26.05.2004 was issued about ratification of
Loan Agreement between Republic of Kazakhstan and International Bank Reconstruction and
Development, as the result was Decree of Government of Republic of Kazakhstan №1254 dated
10.12.2003 about mobilization of IBRD loan for project financing “Nura River Clean-up?.
Loan Agreement №4693-KZ was accepted and signed, but on stage of designing and conclusion of
contracts about loan from IBRD it was planned, that financing will be done from two sources: from loan
part and republic budget with breakdown to 70% of loan and 30% co-financing from republic budget.
Later the Government took decision about changes in parity of financing 55% co-financing and 45% of
loan part.
Project works had been implemented since 2004 and continued to 2012. Loan in amount 40.39 millions
dollars USA was approved in 2003.
Rationale for Bank involvement
At the time of appraisal, the Bank had been very active in supporting Kazakhstan in improving its
environmental management capabilities and in incorporating environmental and social concerns into its
sector operations. The project’s objectives were consistent with the Bank’s Environment Strategy which
focused on improving people’s quality of life, quality of economic growth, and quality of regional and
global commons. The Bank’s technical knowledge on mercury management and its experience in the
design and implementation of investment projects gave it a comparative advantage.
In comparison with World Bank financing the project has suffered from financing part of co-financer
Ministry of Treasury. Due to difficulties in complex regulations inside the Ministries and lack of
experience in international projects from specialists in Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Agriculture
and Committee of Water Resources project works were financed with delays.
1.2     Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
To protect the environment and human health by safely management of mercury contaminated materials,
buried in constructed landfill and prevention of further contamination to downstream of Yntumak
reservoir are the main development objective.
The global project objective was sustainable landfill management and strengthening of the regulatory and
institutional arrangements for long term control of mercury pollution and other toxic substances in line



                                                   46
with the requirements of the Stockholm Convention and other related conventions and protocols ratified
by Kazakhstan.
The objectives are summarized below:
Rise in living standards of population, dwelling on territory of Nura river basin by cleaning the river and
adjacent territories from serious mercury contamination, which will result in safe, effective and less
expensive alternative source of water supply for satisfaction of growing needs of local water consumers.
Also, another goal is to resume control over water discharge along river for regulation of floods and
ecology purposes by:
1) lowering mercury concentration in water, air and earth in project zones (from 3 000 MPC to allowed
MPC of Kazakh standards);
2) reconstruction of Yntumak reservoir to achieve possibility of control design volume (240 mln. m3), in
present time average annual non-regulated volume is 40 mln. m3;
3) technical re-equipment of 19 hydrological posts on Nura river and 4 laboratories of Karaganda oblasty.
1.3     Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
        reasons/justification
The GEO was not revised.
1.4     Main Beneficiaries:
Main beneficiaries of the project are:
•       population, dwelling in Nura River basin, whose profits will be lowering risks for health and
shortening of environmental contamination to acceptable volumes;
•       Temirtau and Karaganda cities, which are supplied by water from Irtysh-Karaganda channel,
underground sources and from Nura river. They will get access to cheaper and regular course of water
supply;
•       Astana city, which would use water from Nura river as additional source of limited drinking
water supply in future;
•        vacationers, including fishermen and hunters along costs of Nura river and buffer zone of natural
resort of Korgalzhino;

1.5     Original components (as approved)
The project “Nura River Clean-up? is divided into 3 components.

Main project components are located in or around Temirtau city Karaganda oblasty of Central
Kazakhstan. Temirtau city is located approximately in 30 km to north-west of Karaganda city.

The part of Nura River, subjected to clean, covers first 30 km from Samarkand reservoir to Rostovka
village.

Most distant project component is Yntumak reservoir, located downstream of the river approximately in
90 km below Samarkand reservoir and Temirtau city, and in 60 km to west from Karaganda city.
In order to meet these objectives, the detailed design of clean-up works was carried out in recent years
based on the findings of the Feasibility study.



                                                    47
The large scope and diverse type of works of the Nura River Clean-up Project Complex has been broken
down into the following works contracts:


1. Contract NRC-B1: Karbide Factory and Associated Sites Clean-up, Landfill Construction and
Operation; - the contract includes the following main elements (amount 4,343 billions Kazakhstan tenge,
according to new revised F.S. 2012, approved by State Expertise) :
a.      Demolition and clean-up           of    Karbide    factory      and     transport     of      contaminated
        material to the landfill site;
b.      Clean-up      of   other   contaminated      areas       around       Karbide       factory     site   and
        transport of contaminated material to the landfill site;
c.      Construction of new main drain
d.      Construction of landfill site
e.      Operation of landfill site (receiving contaminated materials)
f.      Closure of landfill site;
g.      Tegis Zhol monitoring
h.      Environmental monitoring and public information


2. Contract NRC-B2: Clean-up of Nura River and Zhaur Swamp; - the contract includes the following
main elements (amount 2,782 billions Kazakhstan tenge, according to new revised F.S. 2012, approved
by State Expertise):
a.      Pre-excavation investigation program;
b.      Clean-up of Zhaur swamp and transport of contaminated material to the landfill site;
c.      Clean-up of the Nura river bed, river banks and flood plains and transport of contaminated
material to the landfill site;
d.      Prepare "contamination map" showing situation after successful clean-up;
e.      Environmental monitoring and public information;

3. Contract NRC-B3: Reconstruction and Technical Re-equipment of Yntumak reservoir (amount 5,036
billions Kazakhstan tenge, according to new revised F.S. 2012, approved by State Expertise). The
Yntymak Reservoir dam was constructed between 1982 and 1984 on Nura river in the Central Kazakhstan
for irrigational purposes. It is located approximately 60 km to the west from Karaganda city. AS the
program for droughts prevention has ended in 1984, the construction of earth fill dam was not finished,
segmental gates and discharge were not built and do not operate.

The dam was designed and constructed for irrigational purposes. On this account there was no need to
preserve a constant water amount all year round and, as for the second, the definite filtration velocity
(penetration) through the dam and its foundation was considered as acceptable.

The Yntymak Reservoir dam comprises the following elements:
earth fill dam 1,520 m long and 22,6 m high on orographic right bank of the riverbed;
 17 m wide bottom discharge with 76 m3/sec discharge capacity (partially build);
 90 m long earth fill dam section (partially build);


                                                     48
     90 m long discharge with 3,000 mм3/sec discharge capacity (non-constructed); and
     130 m long earth fill dam on the left bank of the valley (non-constructed).

In addition to the above mentioned dam elements, it is necessary to take the following measures in
reservoir area:
• 5,7 km long flood-control dam nearby Amangeldy / Aktobe settlements equipped with pump-station
    for the seepage water return into the reservoir (not finished).

In total scope of works contract NRC-B3 are:
 Reconstruction of protection dam of Aktobe settlement 5,7 km long;
 Construction of power line VL-10 21,2 km long for Yntumak reservoir;
 Construction of diaphragm wall in earth dam of Yntumak reservoir with length 1,52 км;
 Reconstruction of Bottom Outlet with small HPP, throughput capacity 60 m3/sec;
 Construction of the spillway with throughput capacity 3000 m3/sec, and tailwater channel 800 meters
     long;
 Construction of the operational settlement.

For repair works of Yntumak main dam was taken the option of construction of internal wall inside earth
dam body along its length. This implies the construction of diaphragm wall from hydraulic mixture or
concrete through the dam crest. The advantage of the given decision is the compensation of any defect in
loam covering and improving of dam’s impenetrability. The construction works can be carried out
without reservoir emptying.
1.6      Revised components
In contract NRC-B3 the additional works appeared, due to them the decision to revise original Feasibility
Study was taken. These works were not foreseen in original design. The additional works are: grouting
works of the Spillway; grouting works around tunnel of Bottom Outlet, preparation and supply for
diaphragm wall construction, construction of the bridge across the Spillway, technical equipment for
safety system. Total cost estimate of additional works is 360 000 117 tenge. Additional works for
implementation were instructed by the Client Committee of Water Resources.

During the period construction significant changes appeared in contract NRC-B3, which are reflected by
Variation orders and Addendums to the contract. Bases for these variations were additional works for
construction of access roads to bottom outlet, reduction of reinforcement for guide walls, cancellation of
reinforcement carcass inside diaphragm wall, changes in dislocation of the water supply borehole for the
operational settlement and reducing the length of pipeline, change of rubber dam design to regulated steel
gated spillway, changes in original design of bottom outlet reconstruction, asphalt along the main dam
crest and lighting system is foreseen for completion this year.

Due to changes in three contracts the sums for construction works has been changed. Below the
differences are shown (in billions of Kazakhstan tenge).

1.7     Indicators of project implementation
Indicators of direct results in project completion are performance and completion of works for contracts
NRC-B1 and NRC-B2. Contract NRC-B3 will be finished approximately in September 2013.

In contract NRC-B1 the construction of the landfill for burial of hazardous contaminations with capacity
2,0 mln. tons on area 160 ha is completed, along with road construction to landfill 7,3 km long. Cleaning
the territory and dismantling of Karbide factory and adjacent contaminated territories total area is above
70 ha and reconstruction of the main drain of Temirtau city 3,01 km is finished.

In contract NRC-B2 riverbed of Nura is cleaned (18 km), bottom and banks (9,2 km), rectifying of the
riverbed in Sadovoe village (500 m) is constructed.

Indictors for completions of contract NRC-B3 are completion of construction the protective dam of
Aktobe village 5,7 km long, and the power line VL-10 21,2 km long to Yntumak reservoir; construction
of the diaphragm wall inside main dam 1,52 km long, also, reconstruction of the bottom outlet and the
spillway structure with throughput capacity 3000 m3/sec.

Effectiveness of performed project works is obvious in improvement of ecology and sanitary-
epidemiology situation in the region.

By the results of industrial ecology monitoring on environment during whole project activities can be
seen from dynamics of pollution different substances of environment as result from utilization of
contaminated mercury ground in Nura river basin and Zhaur swamp:
1) Mercury concentration in air has decreased on the main drain, Chkalovo village from 416,5 ng/m3 to
10,8 ng/m3, on Zhaur swamp – from 257,4 to 21,28 ng/m3, (maximum permissible concentration (MPC) –
300 ng/m3). After project work completion the mercury concentration in air is lower from maximum
permissible concentration of Kazakhstan standards.
2) Mercury concentration in soil has decreased from 100-1500 mg/kg to 10-50 mg/kg.
3) Concentration of total mercury in surficial water in October-December 2011 was lower than MPC,
which is 500 ng/liter. In accordance with this project, monitoring of surficial water must be done in
following 6 months after work completion for cleaning the riverbed and flood plain of Nura river.
Results on monitoring of underground drinking water in Chkalovo, Samarkand, Gagarinskiy and Sadovoe
villages in 2008-2010 some quantities of total mercury were found in frames from 70 to 300 ng/liter.
After clean-up of river and river banks in all boreholes, used in drinking purpose, total mercury is absent.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project background analysis was generally adequate.
Background preparation benefited from numerous studies done in previous years. First reports dated
1975, but in general stages of studying can be divided in 3 stages:

Stage I:
1986-88     Ecological geo-chemistry evaluation of mercury pollution in Nura river. Study results are
published by Yanin in 1997.

Stage II:
1997-99 Study: development for ways in limiting harm and ecology rehabilitation of contaminated zones
in North and Central Kazakhstan. Several publications were printed as result of the study.



                                                    50
Stage III:
2000-01 Stability study for Yntumak reservoir. Technical and economical study for reconstruction.
2001-02 Feasibility Study: Project of Rehabilitation and Management in Nura-Isim rivers basins as part in
complex strategy of World Bank in Kazakhstan.
2004 "Monitoring of Nura river", done by Karaganda Kazgydromet
2004-05 Designing to works for Nura River Clean-up, moving off pollution from reiver sediments, flood
plains, main drain, Zhaur swamp, ash dump and Karbid factory with construction of the landfill in
Temirtau. Implementation of these works is planned in 2007-2009.

2004-05 Mathematic modeling, performed by PROFCONSULT Ltd, Final Report issued on 21st June
2005.
2004-05 Sampling from Yntumak reservoir, final report issued on 18 October 2005.
2005 Developing of manual for Yntumak reservoir in November 2005.
2005 - 06 Design for reconstruction of Yntumak reservoir in December 2005.

A public survey was also undertaken, focusing in affected areas, which revealed clear support for the
proposed cleanup activities.

The Project reflected on several lessons learned to be incorporated into its design:

Keep the design of the project simple. The design of contracts NRC-B1 and NRC-B3 was complex and
the PMU considered keeping many of these responsibilities, had to arrange the changes to realize project
ideas. Therefore there were some delays in the first year of implementation from the Government side
due to the lack of experience in developing large, complex Terms of Reference, especially for operations
in areas that were new to CWR. This deficient brought to delay in signing and starting the contracts.

Regular changes in CWR management. Problems with several changes of Chairman and Deputy
Chairman in 5 years brought to delays in signing some important documents. Poor management of the
Client brought to stage when contractor has to take care and continue security and maintenance of the
mercury landfill after 7 months of defect guarantee period has expired

Global changes in design. Significant delay in project works has been occurred, also, by changes
proposed by CGCOC (Contractor’s company for site 3) and the Client. The operational settlement
building, rubber dam and bottom outlet changes had to be approved by the local state construction
expertise, what delayed the project to time more than 1 year. Bad experience of this fact leads to
understanding that big design changes are not acceptable in stage of implementation according to local
regulations, what brings to increasing the budget of construction works.

The rationale for Bank intervention was sound. The World Bank was a logical partner in the project given
its relationship with the GEF and previous project experience in mercury management and destruction
(e.g. China, Africa, Belarus, among others). There were also positive synergies with ongoing World Bank
projects in Kazakhstan such as the Ust-Kamenogorsk Environmental project which supported upgrading
of laboratory equipment for identifying underground water pollutions and cleaning works in different
pollution dumps.

Project design was generally sound. The project design for Nura River Clean-up was done in right way.
Well-developed companies like COWI (Denmark) and Posch & Partners Consulting Engineers - Intergeo
(Austria). Changes in design appeared because the contractor could not follow their contractual
obligations in providing adequate quality materials and wishes of the Operator to additional benefits in
construction period.


                                                     51
Minor discrepancy in the design can be explained by the problems of management inside Kazakhstan
ministries. Ministries (Client) requirements are to start project implementation urgently, sometimes even
neglecting necessary studies in planned project zones. The lack of time to prepare well sound design, lack
of experience of PMU staff in international regulations brings to difficulties in implementation time.
2.2     Implementation
Project targets under contract NRC-B1 Karbide Factory and Associated Sites Clean-up, Landfill
Construction and Operation, were achieved with minor delay.
The reason was that first year the Contractor was incapable to mobilize sufficient manpower, which
leaded to delay and transferring part of the works to contract NRC-B2.
Due to the slow progress of the works contractor NRC-B1 and the occurred delay in works
implementation, only now in November 2008 the first transport works started to the landfill. As all input
for the position of the environmental engineer is spent already, the Resident Engineer required massive
backstopping and home office support in controlling all submitted documents and set-up a feasible
transport logistic over this winter period. Increased Resident Engineer's presence on site was necessary in
the winter months to ensure compliance with all health & safety requirements of the hazardous waste
transport and a reliable transport control system had to be set-up to avoid any misuse of the landfill and to
keep control where all the contaminated materials were delivered to and deposited. The winter period
2008-2009 was used by NRC-B1 and NRC-B2 Contractors for excavation and transportation of polluted
material from contaminated areas to the landfill, as well as for containment of polluted territories. NRC-
B1 Contactor transported to the landfill excavated material and waste of Class 1 and Class 2 from Karbide
site, Ash dump, Sedimentation ponds 2 and 3. Contractor NRC-B2 transported to the landfill excavated
material of Class 1 and Class 2 from Zhaur swamp and Main drain.
In following years the Contractor NRC-B1 was successfully done his own part of works.
Since November 2008 and up to end of July 2011 at the landfill 2,142,457 tons of contaminated materials
were disposed (273,548 tons in Cell A2.1 for I class waste, 1,868,909 tons in Cells A1.1-A1.3 for II-IV
class waste). Closure of Cells A1.1-1.3 commenced in June 2011 and closure of Cell 2.1 commenced in
August 2011. Closure of all Landfill cells was completed in October 2011.
Dismantling of Karbide factory was completed in the winter period 2007-2008. In the period November
2008 till May 2009, all wastes, sub ground structures and contaminated soils up to a depth of 2 meters
were transported to the landfill, in total 196 500 tons. The excavated area was backfilled with clean
material and grass seeded in the year 2009.
In 2009 contaminated water from 4 sedimentation ponds was treated by MRP and discharged to the Main
drain. In the year 2010 the Mercury reduction plant was dismantled.
Some troubles were happening because of wrong understanding the project objectives from side of
governmental institutions; claims in changing the ecology regulations to more strict norms for Kazakhstan
were coming from authorities.
Also, one of the big problems encountered was that the Contractor for NRC-B2 was delaying his work
with transporting materials from contaminated areas to the landfill. Contractor for NRC-B1 was not
allowed to start closure of sells before final part of the contaminated materials would be delivered from
the project zone.

Project targets under contract NRC-B2 Clean-up of Nura River and Zhaur Swamp were achieved with
significant delay.
On practically all the sites the works started later than scheduled. On all the areas where works finally
were started, the performance i.e. progress of works was far from the necessary pace to reach the
envisaged time schedule. With Variation Order No. 1 some important works for the start of the landfill,
e.g. Construction of Cell A 1.1 and the roads to the landfill were transferred to B2 contractor. The
Contractor fulfilled those works but he was far away from the milestones defined in his main Contract.
Pre-excavation investigation


                                                     52
Pre-excavation investigation was implemented by the Contractor in the year 2009.
Zhaur swamp
By the end of the year 2010 the excavation quantities that had been started in November 2008 were 344
000 tons of contaminated soil. The weighbridge and other relevant facilities were removed from the site.
NWWC and Main drain
In 2010 the Contractor completed clean-up of the Main drain. The Main Drain bed was cleaned in 2009,
and in 2010 the Contractor carried out containment of Main drain banks with clay. 36,000 tons of
contaminated sediments were disposed to the landfill.
Landfill and roads
 Construction of cell A1.1 was completed in 2008.
 Construction of access road 3.3km and 4km of Saratovka road were completed in 2008.
River-bed and river banks
Excavation of river banks and floodplains continued over winter period 2010-2011 and was planned to be
finished in May, 2011. The Contractor finished success control tests on all areas by the end of July 2011,
so the excavation and transportation works to the landfill were approved as completed. In total 1 428 854
tons of contaminated soils, including river sediments, were disposed to the landfill.
The Contractor changed designed river bed clean-up technology to wet excavation with draglines, for this
new clean-up technology an ecological state expertise was achieved.
This situation was caused by the general disappointing performance of NRC-B2 Contractor, especially in
terms of:
1. Careful studying the tender documents
2. Work experience of key staff lacking
3. Knowledge of the project language by key staff lacking
4. Poor technical know-how
5. Incompetence in organizing the different works and sites
6. Incompetence in basic reporting requirements
7. Reported budgetary restrictions by the Contractor's headquarter
The Contractor had several court investigations about claims from a farmer on destroyed farm land. Final
verdict of the court was satisfaction for the farmer by which the company had to pay contribution for the
incident. No other violations, contradicting with World Bank regulations exist.

In terms of time schedule project targets under contract NRC-B3 Reconstruction and Technical Re-
equipment of Yntumak reservoir were similarly jeopardized.
Works under NRC-B3 contract at Yntumak Reservoir site started on 20th May 2008. The site set-up and
mobilization which had to be completed within a period of 1 month agreed was significantly delayed.
Delay in mobilization and procurement of necessary permits and approvals from the State Agencies
adversely affected the progress of the Project Works.
From the outset, the Contractor requested changes in the Tender Design for the Operational Staff
Settlement (OSS) and replacement of rubber dam original design with a steel gated spillway. The former
was accepted by the Employer in principle and construction commenced without delay. Proposal for the
gated spillway was submitted by the Contractor and eventually withdrawn in September 2008 was
because it was found to be deficient technically, for cost consideration and possible delays in completion.
This situation seriously delayed commencement of spillway excavation works. However, testing of rubber
dam material during winter 2008-2009 indicated that CGCOC was not able to provide the material for
rubber dam as per Tender Design requirements. As a consequence, the gate spillway proposal was
redesigned and accepted by Employer.
Lack of progress at site seriously affected Contractor’s cash-flow situation during all years.
As a consequence of delays and lack of progress mentioned above, it was obvious that the Contractor
would miss the deadline for Project Completion (31st December 2009). The Contractor submitted on 24th


                                                     53
   March 2009 a claim for Extension of Time (EOT) based largely on payments delays, delay in land
   allocation and delay in procurement of permissions and approvals. Engineer evaluated the documentation
   only submitted in August 2009 and after evaluation granted 7 months of EOT and determined the revised
   Completion Date as 31st October 2010. CWR unilaterally granted further 2 months extension with the
   revised Completion Date of to 31st December 2010 on account of spring floods and downstream releases.
   During 2010, the Contractor did not perform well and blamed non-payment, delay in obtaining State
   Expertise and design modifications, although initiated by the Contractor and endorsed by
   Karagandavodhoz.
   It became obvious at the start of 2010 that the Contractor would not finish the project works within 2010.
   The main reasons were as follows:
1. Delay in procurement of State Expertise for spillway design modifications.
2. Delayed payments to the Contractor by CWR and non-payment of Spillway equipment because of lack of
   State Expertise and approved Variation Orders.
3. The Contractor experienced cash-flow problems and shortage of local labour force.
   In addition to the above factors, there remained serious lack of planning and programming.
   In consideration to spillway design change and instruction of additional works by the Employer, the
   Engineer considered Extension of time (EoT) at the request of the Contractor, evaluated and
   recommended the revised completion date of 31 August 2011. The Employer awarded further Extension
   of Time for additional works and the revised completion date of 31 October 2011. But in 2011 the works
   were not finished again.
   Due to bad financial management of the Client the Contractor started to work in 2012 without proper
   planning of financing and signed contract prolongation. The contracts were signed in October 2012, only.
   During construction season 2012 the Contractor did execute work correctly, but blamed the Client for
   non-payment, delay in obtaining approvals from different authorities for Feasibility Study, which was
   received in February 2012.
   From the beginning of the construction in 2012, it was evident for the Engineer that the completion of the
   project in 2012 would be totally impossible, if budget will not be opened this year in-time. As a result,
   the project was not completed in 2012. Approximate completion time is June-July 2013. But at the end of
   the year 2012, it is unclear how remaining works will be financed next year. Budget for technical
   supervision “Posch and Partners?, which was calculated to be sufficient till end of 2012, now utilized,
   because works were not finished in time.
   In addition to incurred delays, the project cost has risen. At present and with design changes and
   adjustment of materials cost and VAT, the Contract sum including VAT becomes 5 036 298 000 KZT.
   This represented sum was approved by the State Construction Expertise in February 2012 and will not be
   changed.
   For the whole construction period 2012 the Contractor was not paid for his work. Only at the end of
   December first payments came from the republic budget. But it will not change present situation with
   works, due to the construction period is over. Some works will not be finished before mid 2013, these are
   related to road repair works and additional works appeared in the contract 2 years ago, according to the
   instructions, done by the Client.
   The total progress achieved so far until the end of 2012 is approximately 95% of works.
   The Contractor failed to meet deadlines defined in the Contract and damages of delay became applicable
   at the end of 2008. In view of the revised Time for Completion, the damages of delay have been
   recalculated and at the end of 2009 damages were 132 million KZT and only approx. 62 million KZT


                                                      54
were deducted as instructed by the Employer to avoid cashflow problems for the Contractor. However,
CWR decided to return the deducted damages of delay in May 2010. The Engineer has not been informed
regarding application of further damages of delay because of continuing delays and lack of progress in
site operations. Up to now the Engineer did not receive any instruction from the Client regarding
deduction for damaged of delay.
Main problems adversely affecting the progress of work are the same in past 5 years. They are: (a) lack of
proper scheduling; (b) deficiency of resources management, manpower and equipment resources for work
to be performed in 2 shifts; (c) difficulties in opening the budget for construction season 2012 which
resulted in non-payment during whole year; (d) difficulties in obtaining of state expertise and Ministries
approval for Feasibility Study necessary for implementation of design changes and increase the budget for
construction works; e) passive attitude of the Client to financial problems in 2012 construction season.

All these facts brought to the relevant delays in construction program and increased budget price for
construction works and works are not finalized yet.
2.3     Replicability.
The Project was nation-wide, but the lessons and experience learned from the elimination of mercury
contaminations can be replicated to address remaining stocks in the country, and there appears to be
sufficient internal momentum to do so. Other more recent developments also make this an imperative.
New project will be started in Kazakhstan related for utilization of mercury content lamps. The ways, how
to utilize the mercury wastages will be raised up in closest future. With remaining capacity of unused
areas the landfill is the best option in this matter. Kazakhstan will ultimately face similar compliance
issues. The MOE would have a continued agenda of drafting relevant policy documents and action plans
for mercury substances, even if future inventorying does not discover presence in the environment.
Approaches in project design could also be replicated in other countries.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Project’s objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant to Kazakhstan’s development
and environmental priorities.This highlights the need to minimize social and environmental risks, human
health such as those associated with mercury pollution. One of the main pillars is regional development
focusing on the rural poor. The Strategy seeks to promote the development of small towns as “poles of
growth?; enhance the performance of the agricultural sector; increase investment in rural infrastructure;
and improve the policy framework in the area of the environment and natural resource use. Regulatory
reform under the Project provides a solid and sustainable foundation for chemicals management. At the
global level, the Project contributed to the fulfillment of Kazakhstan in complying with the Stockholm
Convention.
3.2     Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
A review of Project outputs against key performance indicators reveals that the GEO was achieved. A
total of 2,142,457 tons of contaminated materials were disposed (273,548 tons in Cell A2.1 for I class
waste, 1,868,909 tons in Cells A1.1-A1.3 for II-IV class waste). Karbide factory, which contaminated the
environment of Temirtau city, was dismantled. Environmental and human health conditions were
improved by these actions since the risk of exposure has been significantly reduced or eliminated.
Improvements to trans-boundary (and global) water quality is also ensured through the elimination of
these substances and a more sustainable approach to mercury management. Prior to the Project,
legislation on chemicals and hazardous waste was vague, sparse or minimal, with a complete absence of
mercury pollution in definition or interpretation. Despite this, new legislation would be formed the legal
foundation for a modern regulatory system for the management and control of mercury and other toxic


                                                   55
and harmful chemicals and wastes. Finally, institutional capacity was strengthened through training
activities in draft legislation, mercury monitoring and surveillance systems and analytical capacity (lab
upgrading) of the State environment department for mercury detection in different media (e.g. soil, water).
Prior to the Project no inventory or information system existed in full size and the project has developed
knowledge of mercury pollutions and in the case of laboratories, they did not have the full ability to test
for the presence of mercury pollution.
3.3     Efficiency
An incremental cost analysis (ICA) is not applicable. To calculate economical effectiveness is not
possible due to the fact the outgoing of ecological profits is missing, because no direct profit is existing.
3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not applicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project built and strengthened capacity at several levels. First, capacity was strengthened at the MOE
and CWR in developing regulation and legislation that conforms to the reporting requirements of the
Stockholm Convention as well as harmonizing chemical and waste management law. Second, the
logistics of hazardous waste disposal has been internalized and the experience can be drawn upon for
future operations (important for remaining stocks). Third, support to the Hydrometeorological Service for
mercury detection (both training and equipment) better enables authorities to test and monitor toxic
substances in different media (important for ongoing mercury inventorying). Fourth, public awareness
rose through the continuation of media campaigns on the hazards of mercury, especially among those
with a high risk of mercury exposure such as farmers, industry employees.
In the same time, Yntumak dam reconstruction can become a good practice for students of construction
faculties in universities.

4. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
4.1     Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank identified an area of support that was and remains relevant to the Kazakhstan environment,
public health, as well as with the global commons (Stockholm Convention on mercury). Outcomes
(supported by a design) struck an appropriate balance among three key areas: (i) clean-up/ remediation,
(ii) improving institutional readiness and compliance with EU standards, and (iii) public consultation and
awareness building.
The Bank properly identified regulatory reform as a significant risk at the outset of the Project, and
emphasized an early start (2006) would help mitigate some of the concern about slow implementation.
Unforeseen political instability and poor internal communications in the MOA CWR ultimately resulted
in a Project downgrade to moderately unsatisfactory, not only from slow reform, but also due to the bad
implementation of the contract works. The Bank may have set more modest expectations in terms of
reform, perhaps stopping short of actual legislative enactment.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                     56
The Bank closely supervised Project implementation through semi-annual missions, fiduciary review and
maintained a constructive dialogue between the PMU, the MOA CWR and other stakeholders. Issues
raised were addressed in a timely manner and were candidly reported in official documentation. The
contract NRC-B3 was not 100% achieved by Project closing, but still led to the eventual outcome of a
modern regulatory framework for chemicals and waste management. The Bank maintained focus on the
fulfillment of Project objectives. Since the Project involved the disposal of hazardous materials, constant
supervision of safeguard compliance and worker safety was also necessary. No accidents were reported
during the entire Project period. The Bank revised targets and developed alternative strategies in light of
new information that could only be distilled upon site remediation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

World Bank support to the Government of Kazakhstan in preparing and implementing the Project is rated
as satisfactory largely due to its relative responsiveness to issues and adaptation to unpredictable
circumstances.
4.2     Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government strongly supported the Project and its objectives. As the project progressed, mercury
issues were also elevated to higher priority in the National Development Plan 2007-2010. Operational
activities also benefitted from good inter-agency coordination.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Ministry of Agriculture (later Ministry of Environment), as the main implementing agency, remained
committed to the Project and provided satisfactory support to the PMU on daily issues and in resolving
problems. Some delays were experienced due to governmental changes resulting in several changes of
CWR management over the life of the project. Each change required time to become familiar with the
Project, its objectives and counterpart commitments. Most critical however was the initial lack of
understanding between the MOA CWR and its consultants in charge of Feasibility Study approval
activities which led to delays jeopardizing the Project – resulting in a Project delay for 1 year period.
However, clarifications and a renewed commitment in the final year of implementation led to draft
regulations, laws and legislation.
Counterbalancing this shortfall, the PMU was very effective in its fiduciary and monitoring role as
demonstrated by the success in meeting mercury destruction targets (and exceeding them in some cases)
within budget and without any major issues. A significant determinant of the PMU’s success was their
previous experience and involvement in the international projects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is rated as satisfactory taking into account the Government’s commitment
to achieving GEO. Despite the partial completion of some activities under Contract NRC-B3, actions
taken by the CWR and the superior performance of the PMU justify this rating.
4.3     Proposed arrangements for future operation of the project



                                                    57
Real picture of future operation arrangements includes 2 main points.
Use landfill for mercury contamination

After the project completion Republic of Kazakhstan received finished landfill with necessary
infrastructure for future possible use, and personnel, which is familiar with the works and safety measures
in implementation. The landfill area is not filled 100% and free space is presented. In future
implementation of some ecology project for clean off mercury pollutions there is a possibility for re-
opening the landfill.
These days it is extremely important to name future operator of the landfill, who will be responsible for
security, safety and maintenance. Necessary documents for future maintenance were submitted in its time.

Yntumak reservoir use.
Main of main features of the reservoir became the structure of HPP, producing sufficient quantity of
energy for site needs.
Besides of, part of energy can be transduced and transferred to secondary users, for example, villages,
located in vicinity of reservoir and possible private business, which can appear on territory in future.
Water is wealth of agriculture, which can be used for irrigation of farms with increased productivity.
Because, main pollutions, entering into river from Temirtau, accumulate on reservoir bottom, by sanitary
norms water will be fit for irrigation. In May 2013 volume of the reservoir is 150 mln. m3. In future
Karagandavodhoz plans to increase water to critically acceptable with consideration of safety factors of
Yntumak reservoir.

To Country Manager of the World Bank in Kazakhstan
                                                  Mrs. Sebnem Akkaya

       The Committee for Water Resources of the Ministry of Environment Protection of the
Republic of Kazakhstan having considered the draft Implementation and Completion Results
(ICR) Report for Nura River Clean-Up Project submitted with Letter No. 13/284 dated June 21,
2013 sends the following comments.
       Nura River Clean-Up Project is a large scale and long term project. Initial cost of project
and terms of its implementation were fixed based on preliminary project evaluation conducted in
2002. As mentioned in the draft report, the structure of project results at the stage of preliminary
evaluation was incomplete because of non availability of main and target values as project
indicators covered not all works as per the project. Project indicators were revised in updated
Feasibility Study in 2006 with repeated examination and appropriation of additional funds for
project implementation from the republican budget.
       In 2012 there was an additional adjustment of Feasibility Study in connection with
toughening of safety regulations at strategic sites, increase of project cost due to exchange rate
difference and inflation accumulated during the project implementation period of 8 years for
construction and consultative contracts.
       As a result of Feasibility Study adjustment, additional funds were appropriated from the
republican budget, and co-financing share to the Loan was doubled, which required thorough
analysis of project on the part of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
        Legal framework of the Republic of Kazakhstan has changed substantially during the
period of project implementation. Enhancement of monitoring of international projects also
required additional coordination with state authorities.
       However, despite the fact that a complex of circumstances made some corrections to the
project implementation, we consider that project objectives and tasks are fully achieved.
       The Committee considers the draft ICR report for Nura River Clean-Up Project in
general as acceptable.
