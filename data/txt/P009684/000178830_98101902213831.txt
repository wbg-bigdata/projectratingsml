INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMET OF INDIA FOR
THE HIKACHAL PRADESH APPLE PROCESSING AND
MARKETING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for the equivalent of US$13 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a project for providing apple-processing facili-
ties and developing an integrated apple-marketing system in the State of
Himachal Pradesh (HP). The proceeds of the credit would be channelled in
two ways. For processing and marketing facilities and cableways, funds
would be channelled through the Government of India to the Agricultural
Refinance Corporation (ARC) on terms of 15 years, including two to three
years grace, at 6.0 percent annual interest; the ARC would in turn on-lend
the funds to participating commercial banks for up to 15 years, including
two to three years grace, at 7 percent annual interest; the commercial
banks would then relend the funds to the Horticultural Produce Processing
and Marketing Corporation (HPMC) at 9.5 percent per annum for a term of up
to 15 years with two to three years grace. For road works, road maintenance
equipment, technical assistance, training and a project evaluation study,
IDA funds would be channelled through the Government of India to the
Government of Himachal Pradesh according to established government policy
on terms prevaaiLing at the time.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(156-IN, dated May 8, 1973), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 24, 1973 (R73-113). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance can be criticized on many counts.
Some of the shortcomings have their origins in the open political system,
where the reconciliation of conflicting political views tendsto favor less
than optimal economic solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of
the task facing the Government. Governing a country divided into more than
20 States with a population of 577 million and over 60 major languages is
an extraordinary responsibility. The country's poverty and poor natural
resource endowment, supplemented by a net transfer of external resources
averaging in recent years well below US$1 per head per annum, have imposed
sharp limitations on the rate of growth. Any judgment of India's economic
performance must take these underlying circumstances into account. So,
also, must account be taken of two massive uncertainties which overhang
India. The first is the ava-lability of water. A bad monsoon, which is



-2-
inevitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire
economy and wipes out the results of years of effort. The second uncer-
tainty is the availability of external assistance. The vast majority of
bilateral aid is committed annually, usually several months after the
start of the fiscal year, and has often proved vulnerable to the
political exigencies of the donor. Any delay in IDA replenishment has
an enormous impact on aid flaws. Together, these considerations severely
complicate planning and force a high degree of caution in foreign exchange
management.
4.        In this perspective, the performance of the econcoy has been far
from bad. Since the inception of economic development planning in 1950/51,
national income has grown at nearly 4 percent per annum, which compares
very favorably with the average annual growth rate of less than one percent
during the preceding 50 years. Population has also grown faster in the
past two decades than previously, but per capita income has nevertheless
risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first half of this century
to achieve an average growth of roughly one percent a year since indepen-
dence.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing
on others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs.
The growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education,
health services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved
at high cost and has yielded results cf variable quality; many industrial
and agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others
have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated well below
full capacity; in some regions of the country growth and structural change
have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many other parts
of the world, but in other regions there has been stagnation and possibly
even decline. Despite these improvements and although the distribution of
income in India is relatively even by comparison with many other cawatries,
there has been little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses
of the urban and rural population.  The Government has become increasingly
concerned about the plight of the lower income strata, which, conservatively
measured, consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than
US$60 per head per year. As indicated in its preliminary proposals for the
Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79) GOI is planning to intensify its
efforts to alleviate their poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 42
percent of national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49
percent twenty years previously. The share of output contributed by the
industrial sector has increased only slowly and, partly due to the
generally good performance in agriculture, since the late 1960s has
remained approximately constant at a level of 23 percent. There has,
however, been a shift in the composition of industrial production, with
consumer, intermediate, and capital goods now contributing about one-third
each compared with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods pro-
duction 25 years ago.



-3-
7.        Undoubtedly, one of India's most impressive achievements since
the mid-1960s has been the doubling of the average growth rate of pro-
ductivity in foodgrain production. This has been achieved primarily
through the introduction of new, high-yielding seed varieties and through
complementary improvements in farming practices. Nevertheless, much
remains to be done to consolidate the production growth in the wheat belt
and to extend it both to other areas and to other foodgrain crops, most
particularly rice. Other crops have, in most cases, shown a slow but
fairly constant rate of productivity increase. Irrigation has played a
major part in agricultural growth and, by reducing dependence on the
monsoon, has reduced variability in performance. For instance, the
drought-induced decline in foodgrain output in 1972/73 was only some 6
percent, compared with a fall of almost 20 percent due to the drought in
the mid-1960s. At present only about half the potentially irrigable area
has been developed. Fuller utilization of the existing irrigation system
and the extension of the irrigated area are, therefore, matters of the
highest priority in order to meet India's rising food needs and to protect
the economy against the vagaries of the weather. Land which cannot be
irrigated accounts for about 50 percent of the cultivable area; output
from non-irrigated land will thus remain important and substantial benefits
remain to be realized through technical change and investment.
8.        Performance of the industrial sector has been variable and to
some extent disappointing. Industrial growth averaged about 7 percent a
year in the 1950s, rose to 9 percent in the first half of the 1960s, but
has declined to some 5 percent through the early 1970s. The slower growth
of recent years is especially worrying. To a large extent it was precipi-
tated by the severe drought of 1966 and 1967 and the accompanying general
recession. But it has also been the result of many other factors: the
relatively limited opportunities for further import substitution which had
from the outset been at the center of the industrialization strategy; the
recurring bottlenecks in the production of a number of key intermediate
goods such as steel and cement; shortages of imported raw materials; and
cumbersome administrative procedures. The improvement in output which
occurred in 1972, combined with recent measures to simplify administrative
controls, should lead to better utilization of India's industrial capacity
and a higher rate of reinvestment.
9.        The gross domestic savings rate has been in the region of 14
percent for the past decade. While this compares favorably with other
countries having similarly low income levels, it has fallen far short of
India's resource needs. And although external assistance has been sub-
stantial in absolute terms, in relation to naticnal income it has been
small, so that the gross investment rate has reached as high as 17 percent
in only a few years. More recently, as a result of the recession and a
decline in foreign assistance, the gross investment rate has been only
about 14-15 percent.



-h -
10.       An outstandi.ng feature of the budgetary situation over the past
decade has been a sharp increase in the tax burden.  Overall tax revenues
w-hich represented around 10 percent of national income in 1960/61 rose to
nearly 15' percent in 1971/72.  Although several important sectors, notably
agriculture, are still only lightly taxed, the Government has shown itself
capable of swift and difficult decisions in mobilizing extra revenues.
There was a large additional tax effort in response to the crisis of 1971;
more recently, early in November 1973 the Government doubled the excise
duty on gasoline (raising prices to the consumxer by 64 percent) and
imposed heavy increases on other petroleum products. Despite a near
doubling of tax revenues in the last decade, however, there has been a
deterioration in the savings performance of the public sector, largely due
to a sharp fall in the Central Government's current account savings. A
disturbing feature of the budgetary situation has been the expansion of
the States' expenditures far in excess of the growth of their own revenues.
The Central Government has had to meet the resulting deficits through
budget transfers. This, combined with several other factors (the military
events and refugee relief of 1971 and 1972, drought relief in 1972 and
1973, and a sharp drop in net foreign aid in 1972), has forced a massive
rise in total deficit financing. As a result of this and also of the
shortages of food and other commodities, there has been a sharp increase
in the rate of inflation in the past 18 months as has been the case in so
many other countries of the world. In the past year, wholesale prices
have risen by some 20 percent, campared with an average 4-5 percent in
the previcus three years. The budget for 1973/74 introduced measures to
help curb inflation and there have been further budget cuts in the past
few months, while the Reserve Bank of India has also been intervening to
control the expansion of money supply .
1 *       Ever since the balance of payments crisis of 1956/57, a shortage
of foreign exchange has constituted one of the most critical constraints
to the development of the econony. This has manifested itself in various
ways. The auuhorities have necessarily acted with extreme caution in their
foreign exchange management and have been left with little flexibility or
margin to accommodate special and emergency needs. The exchange control
and also, in large part, the import and industrial licensing procedures
have thus been the result of the acute foreign exchange situation. Even
though the external sector is small in relation to the national economy,
the continuing shortage of foreign exchange together with these controls
have relarded and distorted investment and the rate of utilization of existing
capacity. This is most clearly seen in the stagnation of non-food
imports: for instance, despite expansion of the economy at almost 4
percent per annum, even at current prices the present level of non-food
imports is approximately the same as that of the early 1960s, and there
has been a ccntinuing shortage of imported raw materials, spares, and
components. While exports have expanded somewhat since 1960 and have done
especially well in the past two years, they have never achieved a sustained
grawth sufficient to have an appreciable effect on the foreign exchange
problem. Traditional items such as jute, tea, cashew, and textiles, which
are all beset with supply difficulties at home and highly competitive or



-5-
shrinking markets abroad, still constitute the most important component
of exports. And despite a rapid expansion in the 1960s, non-traditional
items such as engineering goods and chemicals still form only a small
share of total exports.
12.      Extemnal assistance has played an important role in assisting
India's development effort, especially from the late i950s to the end of
the 1960s. Nevertheless, net aid has always been only a small component
of domestic product and has been amongst the lowest for all developing
countries, having averaged well below US$1 per head per annum. Moreover,
with rising debt service payments and more recently a decline in gross
aid, the contribution of net aid has declined, both as a supplement to
domestic investment and as a means of financing imports. However, aid
remains a vital supplement to domestic resources and there are now
encouraging sigas that net aid may rise somewhat in the future above its
currently extremely low level.
13.      As a result of substantial past borrowings, India's external
public debt stood at US$8.5 billion on March 31, 1972. Annual debt
service payments are currently running at a level of around US$725 million
(before debt relief), equivalent to around 26 percent of merchandise and
invisible export receipts. This compares with a level of debt service of
about US$200 million in the mid-1960s. In order to mitigate the negative
effects on grawth of such a high burden of exteroal debt and to forestall
any danger of a foreign exchange crisis, the India Consortium from 1968/69
onwards has extended debt relief to India. In 1972/73, the most recent
year in which the Consortium has taken this action, the amount of debt
relief was about us$150 million. Debt service is projected to grow some-
what more slowly over the rest of this decade than it did during the 1960s,
and the debt service ratio is projected to decline to some 21' percent by
1980. Starting in the mid-1960s there has been some softening in the
financial terms of official assistance offered by several major creditors,
and also an increase in the proportion of program to project aid. These
changes are welcome in helping India to meet her more urgent import
requirements, but they are still modest in relation to the countryt's basic
needs.
14h.     The Government is at present preparing the detailed sectoral
programs to be implemented in the Fifth Plan. It is also re-examining the
overall intemal and external resources position as well as devising the
appropriate policies to achieve the Plan objectives. A first draft of the
ccmplete Plan has been completed with the final document expected to be
published in March 1974.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
15.        Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 41 loans and 57 development
credits to India totalling US$1 ,178 million and US$2,480 million (both
net of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$605 million has
been repaid, and US$1,,O58 million is still undisbursed. Annex II contains
a summary statement of disbursements as of November 30, 1973, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
16.        Sinoe 1957, ISC has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million, of which US$5.9 million has been repaid, US$7.4 million
sold and US$6.3 mirllion cancelled. Of the balance of US$22.7 million,
US$15.4 million represents loans and US$7.3 million equity.   A summary
statement of IE3 operations as of November 30, 1973, is also included in
Annex II (Page 2).
17.        The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years
has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects
the importance of agriculture and the investment priorities of the
Government. Agricultural projects will continue to form an important part
of the Bank Groupts program of assistance to India. Projects designed to
foster agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs,
such as credit for on-farm investment, command area development of existing
irrigation projects, or domestic fertilizer production, form an important
aspect of the program for this fiscal year. Lending for investment in
processing facilities for special crops such as the project described in
this report, and for livestock development would contribute to diversifica-
tion of agricultural production. Special emphasis is being given to projects
benefiting small farmers; examples are the special provisions for small
farmers in IDA-supported agricultural credit schemes, and a project being
developed in support of the Government's drought-prone areas program.
18.        The industrial sector and investments in infrastructure develop-
ment have received substantial amounts of Bank Group assistance, essentially
to cover the substantial foreign exchange expenditures associated with
investments in these fields. Apart from IDA credits for a number of
fertilizer projects, lending to industry in recent years has been principally
through the medium of development finance corporations. In addition,
industrial production has been helped through a series of industrial imports
credits. Assistance to infrastructure development has been concentrated in
the power, telecommunications and railways sectors. Documents for the
Twelfth Railways project have just been circulated to the Executive Directors
for consideration.  Credits in support of the Government' s power transmission
and telecommunications program were extended last year and a rural electri-
fication project is being prepared. India's cities require major investments,
especially in water supply to keep up with the growth of their population,
and water supply projects in Madras and Uttar Pradesh are under consideration.



-7-
19.       The urgent need for a substantial net transfer of external
resources in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of
Bank economic reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium.
Exphasis on lending for such critical sectors as agricultural or urban
development inevitably leads to a relatively slow transfer of IDA
resources. In order to balance its program, Bank Group lending includes
more rapidly disbursing credits, such as for teleczmmunications,
railway and industrial imports.   Because of the capacity of the capital
goods sector of the Indian economy, India imports relatively few capital
goods. As in the case of the credit now proposed, the Association should,
therefore, be prepared to help finance the local cost of high priority
projects in support of India's efforts to sustain a satisfactory rate of
growth.
20.       The Bank Group has come to ccntribute sigaificantly towards the
provision of external assistance to India. In the three years 1966/67--
1968/69 the Bank Group accounted for some 17 percent of total new
commitments of external assistance; in the three years 1970/71--1972/73
this had risen to 34 percent. Because of disbursement lags, however, the
Bank Group's share in total disbursements has risen more slowly from 14
percent in 1966/67--1968/69 to 16 percent in 1970/71--1972/73, but it is
expected to accelerate in the future. As of March 31, 1972, the Bank
Group's share in India's outstanding external public debt was 19 percent.
If current trends continue as expected, the Bank Group's share in the
total amount outstanding will rise to approximately 30 percent by 1979.
Debt service payments to the Bank Group during the year ended March 31,
1972 were 13 percent of total debt service payments made by India. By
1979, the Bank Group's share of total debt service is expected to be
around 16 percent.
PART III - THE STATE OF HIMACHAL PRADESH ANiD THE
APPLE INDUSTRY
21.       This project in BP will contribute to the development of the
Indian agricultural sector, which accounts for about 40 percent of Indian
GNP and employs 70 percent of the total work force. An annual growth rate
of 4.7 percent in agricultural production over the next five years is a
goal of the Fifth Plan. Accordingly, the Government of India is givinag
great emphasis to agricultural development and allocating substantial
resources to agricultural investments.  The main thrust of the Government's
effort is to increase output of foodgrains through increasing the availabi-
lity of improved inputs such as high-yielding varieties of seeds,
fertilizers, agricultural credit and irrigation. Although the primary
focus is on foodgrains, the Government is also aware of the need to achieve
a better regional and commodity balance in agricultural development. This
project contributes to achieving that balance, representing the first Bank
Group project in India aimed at improving the processing and marketing of
a perishable horticultural crop, and the first Bank Group project in this
depressed, mountainous region of India.



-8-
22.       HP, in the foothills of the Himalaya mountains, lies between
Tibet and the Punjab. The pursuit of agriculture is the dominant
occupation of the 3.5 million people of HP and 94 percent derive their
livelihood from cultivating the land. Due to the rocky, mountainous
terrain, however, only about 10 percent of the area of HP is cultivated
and there is little scope for increasing agricultural production by
extending the cropped area. Increased standards of living can come
mainly through improved practices, and by concentration on cash crops
such as apples and seed potatoes.
23.       Apples have beccme the State's main cash crop and have provided
an opportunity for thousands of farmers to move beyond subsistence level.
An average grower has about 1 ha of apples, and these constitute his sole
source of cash income. The apple industry has also contributed to reducing
unemployment as growers generally require additional labor in orchard
operations for about four to five months during the growing and harvesting
season. HP currently accounts for over a quarter of total Indian apple
output, derived from land which is poorly suited to other types of culti-
vation. Areas under apples increased from 3,000 ha in 1960 to 26,000 ha
in 1970, output rose from 10,000 to 76,000 tons, and farmers involved from
7,000 to 30,000. By 1978, apple production in the State is expected to
reach 250,000 tons and farmers involved 40,000 to 50,000.
24.       Apple processing, transport, and marketing facilities in HP are
not adequate to handle efficiently the quantities of apples being produced.
Given the expected increases in production, the need for improvement is
urgent. There are many problems which need to be addressed in order to
effect needed change. Marketing in HP is unregulated. Commission agents
play a dual role, often acting as speculative buyers, thus leaving scope
for malpractices at the expense of the growers. There is no uniform
grading system and the quality of fruit marketed varies widely, a practice
which causes inordinate delays in marketing while apples are unpacked from
crates to allow for inspection by prospective wholesale buyers and then
repacked. Apples are seldom cold stored which means they must be
marketed immediately irrespective of prevailing market conditions and
prices. Only an insignificant portion ofcull apples are processed into
juice or other products, most being left to rot in the fields. The road
network serving the industry is inadequate for efficient transport and
marketing of apples. The project described in this report is designed to
alleviate these problems.



-9-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       In 1970, the Government of India requested Bank Group assistance
for a project in support of the apple industry in HP   An IDA reconnaissance
mission in February 1971 was followed by FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program
preparation missions in September 1971 and May 1972. The project was
appraised in September/October 1972. Following an extended period for
additional preparation of the road component of the project, negotiations
were held in Washington from November 8 to November 14., 1973. The Borrawer
was represented by Mr. M. K. Mukherji, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agri-
culture and Mr. S. N. Saigal, Director, Department of Economic Affairs.
ARC was represented by Mr. M. A. Chidambaram, Managing Director. The State
of Himachal Pradesh and the Agro-Industries Corporation (AIC) were repre-
sented by Mr. K. C. Pandeya, Agricultural Production Commissioner, Mr. Harbans
Singh, Director of Horticulture, and Mr. H. C. Malhotra, Chief Engineer,
Public Works Division. A report entitled "Appraisal of Himachal Pradesh
Apple Processing and Marketing Project" (Report No. 262-IN, dated
December 14, 1973) is being circulated to the Excecutive Directors separately.
A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
26.       The project provides for a commercially-oriented marketing orga-
nization, technological innovations in fresh fruit and juice processing, and
infrastructure improvements. It would establish new market outlets for
about one quarter of HP's estimated 1978 production by providing alternative,
more integrated and more efficient processing and marketing services. This
would improve producer prices, double the present marketing period, reduce
grower's dependence on existing wholesaler/commission agents, and utilize
some currently wasted culls. The project would help prevent the seasonal
apple gluts anticipated within the next 5 to 10 years because of rapidly
increasing production, and lagging processing and marketing facilities.
27.       The marketing organization to be created under the project, the
Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC), would
enter competitively into the apple processing and marketing industry of HP.
The project would provide HPMC with a network of twelve packing houses,
three collection stations, five cold storages, a juice concentrate plant, a
transshipment center, and a system of aerial cableways in selected production
areas. The packing houses and collection stations would be constructed over
a four-year period in HP's four major apple production districts. The
collection stations would be built to be easily converted into packing
stations when production in the area warranted. During the off season, the
packing houses and collection stations would be used to store and distribute
farm inputs. The new transshipment center would help in achieving transport
cost savings through collective, large volume shipping arrangements. Three
cold storage units would be built in New Delhi and one in Calcutta; and an
existing cold storage in Bombay would be taken over by HPMCo ADples would
be held in cold storage for marketing at premium prices after the regular
seasons During the off season the units would be used to store other
perishables. The juice concentrate plant would process apples not marketable
as fresh fruit. During the off season other fruits from the area would be



-1 0-
processed. About 40 km of cableways would be installed for collection
of apples from orchards on steep slopes for direct transport to nearby
collection stations, packing houses and roadsides.
28.       HPMC would offer a wide range of services to growers, including
credit, standardized packing, transportation/forwarding, and wholesale
selling services at fees lower than the present alternatives.  When the
project is completed, HPMC would handle about 55,000 tons of apples (25
percent of HP's production at the time). HPMC would service the apple
growers by providing packing and forwarding services for 40,000 tons of
apples by 1977. It would handle about 20,000 tons on a fee basis for
growers who chose to continue selling apples through commission agents on
consignment.   HPMC would pack, forward and market a further 10,000 tons
on a commission basis. It would purchase and pack still another 10,000 tons
on its own account, to be sent to its cold storage units in Calcutta,
Bombay, and New Delhi. Eleven thousand tons of cull apples would be bought
from growers for processing at the juice concentrate plant.
29.       In addition, the project includes construction of about 100 km
of new roads and improvements to about 300 km of existing roads to provide
sufficient all-weather connections between orchards and collection stations
and packing houses, and the necessary links from them to existing highways.
Also included are training and technical assistance to help ensure success-
ful project implementation and an evaluation study to assess the project's
impact and the possibility of further assistance to the industry.
Project Implementation
30.       Crucial to the project success is the establishment and proper
functioning of the HPMC. It would be established as a subsidiary of the HP
Agro-Industries Corporation (AIC) and staffed with qualified management and
operational personnel. The establishment of HPMO would be a condition of
credit effectiveness. HPM Is finances would come from the Government of
HP, which would provide the equity capital of about US$2.7 million, and
from long-term loans of about US$6.0 million obtained from the participating
conmercial banks. The commercial banks would be selected and supervised by
ARC and would be required to appraise the financial viability of loan
requests from BPM . At full project development, HPMC's estimated annual
operating profit would be about US$1.8 million and net profit (after
interest, tax and depreciation) over US$0.3 million from the second opera-
tional year onwards. HPMC's estimated financial rate of return would be
14 percent, its debt/equity ratio 2.5$
310       To ensure that HPMC gets off to a successful start, engineering
consultants, technical assistance and training have been provided for in
the project. Recruitment of engineering consulting firms and technical
specialists would be a condition of effectiveness. The engineering consul-
tants would assist HPMC, PWD, and the HP State Department of Horticul-
ture (SDH) in selecting sites; drawing up tender documents, detailed
drawings, construction and equipment purchase contracts; and evaluating
bids for the cold storage units and the juice concentrate plant. Technical
experts including a senior packing plant manager, an apple



-11 -
quality control expert, a senior marketing specialist, a food technologist
and a food processing microbiologist would be recruited to assist in
initial operations and training of project personnel. Training needs of
HPMC and HP staff would be met through a program of local training as well
as sending some staff overseas for special courses.
32.       Planning and construction of the processing and marketing
facilities would be phased over a four-year period to coincide with the
expected increase in production in specific locations and the development
of the necessary management and operational expertise. The road improve-
ments and ccnstruction program would be coordinated with the construction
of packing houses and collection stations. The juice concentrate plant
would be built in the second year and the cold storage units in the second
and third years, in accordance with expected volumes to be handled by HPMC.
The buildings for the facilities would be constructed by local contractors.
PWD would conduct about 70 percent of the road works on force account with
manual labor and use local contractors for the balance.
33.       The coordination of inter-agency activity for the project would
be the responsibility of a Central Project Committee. It would oversee
HPM Is operations and the implementation of the project. The Committee
would be located in SDH. Membership would include the Agricultural Pro-
duction Commissioner, the Secretaries of Finance and Transportation,
representatives of ARC, Public Works Department (PWD) and SDH, the managing
directors of the Agro-Industries Corporation (AIC) and HPMC, a representa-
tive of apple growers in HP and two representatives of GOI. The estab-
lishment of the Committee would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Project Cost and Financing
34.       The total project cost is about US$21.7 million equivalent
including duties and taxes of which the foreign exchange component is about
36 percent or US$7.8 million. A detailed breakdown of the cost components
is in Annex III.
35.       The proposed IDA credit of US$13 million equivalent would cover
60 percent of total project costs. The remaining 40 percent would be
financed by HP Government (34 percent), ARC (3 percent) and participating
commercial banks (3 percent). IDA funds of US$6.0 million would be
channelled through GOI to the Government of HP for road works, road
maintenance equipment, technical assistance and training. GOI would on-lend
IDA funds for these items to the Government of HP according to established
GOI policy on terms prevailing at the time. (At the present time, these
are 4.75 percent interest per year over 15 years).
36.       For processing and marketing facilities and cableways, GOI would
make IDA proceeds of US$7.0 million available to the Agricultural Refinance
Corporation (ARC) repayable over 15 years including two to three years grace
at 6.0 percent annual interest. GOI would bear the exchange risk. To
finance these diverse and geographically dispersed facilities, ARC would
in turn on-lend the funds to a number of participating commercial banks at an
annual interest rate of 7 percent. The commercial banks would lend to HPMC
at 9.5 percent per annum on terms of up to 15 years with two to three years
grace. This interest rate is in line with prevailing interest rates and



-12-
neasonable in relation to the risk element involved, the need for
a1jpraisa1 and supervision of individual loans. The banks would repay
Ah  in installments to coincide with collections from HPMC. It would
be a condition of effectiveness that a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satis-
facltory to IDA betwieen GOI and ARC had been executed.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Materials and equipment valued at US$3.2 million or 15 percent
of total project costs, would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's Guidelines.
Domestic suppliers would be accorded the usual preference of 15 percent
or the rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. Other materials and
equipment items valued at US$0.9 million would be procured locally. This
latter category represents items which are not suited for international
competitive bidding because of small amounts involved and the need to
maintain standardization with existing items.
38.       Civil works for the construction of processing and marketing
facilities, costing about US$2.2 million are widely distributed geographi-
cally and in time. Bulking of contracts would not be practical. As such
contracts would not be attractive to expatriate firms, international com-
petitive bidding would not be suitable. Local ccntractors are capable of
carrying out the works, which HPMC would put out to local tender.
39.       Due to a relatively short construction season because of the
weather and the steep and difficult terrain, the State has difficulty in
attracting contractors to do road work. As a result, it executes about 70
percent of its road development by force account, with local contractors
undertaking the balance. Accordingly, this method, which has been
used successfully by PWD in the past, would be used for the project road
works (valued at about US$6.0 million).
40.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against the
full c.i.f. costs of imported equipment and materials and the ex-factory
cost of local equipment bid internationally; against the foreign exchange
component (estimated at 70 percent of local costs) of locally manufactured
equipment and materials not procured by international competitive bidding;
against 60 percent of civil works expenditures; and against the foreign
exchange expenditures on consultant services, technical assistance and
training. The credit is expected to be disbursed over four years. Any
savings would be reallocated by increasing the percentage disbursement for
road works.
Economic Benefits
41.       The project would provide important economic and social benefits.
By extending the marketing area and period, it would reduce seasonal gluts
and by processing cull apples, reducing transport costs, enhancing trade
efficiency and reducing produce losses, it would provide some 10,000 farmers,
whose average holding is less than 1 hectare, with an increase in income on



-13-
the average of at least 10 percent. Growth and employment in the industry
would be assisted by the project and orderly development of agricultural
produce marketing, both physical and institutional would be encouraged.
HPMC's competition would tend to reduce malpractices by commission agents
against growers. Project roads and maintenance equipment would reduce
losses and provide the social advantages of an expanded transport system.
Quantifiable benefits, including HPMC surpluses, income increments for
apple growers, increased production, cost reductions in apple transport,
and other road users savings, result in an estimated economic rate of
return of 23 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRJMENT AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
International Development Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association, the Agricultural Refinance Corporation and the Himachal
Pradesh Agro-Industries Corporation Private Limited, the draft Agreement
between the Association and the State of Himachal Pradesh, the Recommenda-
tion of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the
proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln No. 307      Indian Iron and Steel Company;  US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing Date: December 31. 1973
This loan is expected to be closed at the end of December 1973
as scheduled at which time approximately US$0.7 million will be cancelled.
Ln No. 515     Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project;  US$2h.6 million loan of September 10, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
Ln No. 683     Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3, 1970;
Closing Date:  September 30, 197h
Ln No. 789     Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project;  US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976
Ln No. 902     Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Cor pration of
India Project;  US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1978
These loans have supported industrialization in India through
a well-established development finance company. The first three of these
loans are fully committed. The fourth loan has recently been declared
effective and its proceeds are being committed. There have been delays
in disbursements on the earliest Loan 515-IN as a result of the business
slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
December 31, 1971 for 515-IN has been extended twice to December 31, 1973.
Loan 683-IN has been fully committed as of December 31, 1972. Disburse-
ments under Loan 789-IN are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 89      Beas Equipment;   US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weakness in project execution.

?Paasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has
been subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated
development of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the
credit outstanding is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery up to
December 31, 1973,and as a result, the original closing date of December 31,
1972. has been postponed by a year.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds-  US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops.  The Corporation
is working efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality.
Seed production is meeting targets. Implementation problems concerning process-
ing plant construction and land-levelling have been solved. Expansion of an
existing processing plant is in progress and tenders for a new plant are under
preparation. Large scale land-levelling demonstratiorn have stimulated demand
for such work and orders for machinery are to be placed immediately.
Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This credit will help to finance the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi river and the expansion of the irrigation area below the dam.
The project will also include field channel construction, land-levelling,
drainage and road works, and a program to support agricultural development.
The project schedule was revised to reflect a completion delay of two years
caused primarily by the failure of the prime contractor of the dam itself;
the Govenment was forced to discharge this contractor in October 1971 and to
undertake the work by force account. Expenditures and disbursements under the
revised schedule have been proceeding very well. More recently, progress with
land-levelling has been slow, and a mission reviewed in August 1973 remedial
action to be taken by the project authorities. The outlook for other compo-
nents of the project remains satisfactory. As the delays in implementation so
far incurred have arisen at the start of the project, their effect upon the
economic rate of return is not likely to be significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit
of June 3, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 203     Punjab A ricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit

credit of March 29, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Cr No. 391     Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project;  US$33.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Cr No. 392     Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project;  US$38.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Cr No. 440     Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit of
November 29, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The above agricultural credit projects total US$319.9 million and
are all effective except for the Bihar credit. Except for the Punjab project
which consists of mechanization equipment only, all are similar in structure
being designed to provide long and medium-term credit to farmers through credit
institutians for such on-farm investments as imported tractors, minor irriga-
tion and land-levelling. Disbursement of these credits started slowly. So far,
as the minor irrigation components were concerned, the main difficulties stemmed
from the institutional requirements which were essential parts of the projects,
specifically the introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending terms
and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing groundwater
availability. These constraints have now been overcome and disbursements are
accelerating, reflecting high demand for minor irrigation investments spurred
by the experience of last year's drought. As a result, by November 30, 1973,
US$29.3 million out of US$35 million had been disbursed under the first project
to be approved, the Gujarat project. In all, US$74.6 million has been disbursed
by November 30, 1973 against original disbursement estimates for that date of
approximately US$110 million . The shortfall is almost entirely the result of
the delay in tractor procurement following the substantial change in both the
supply and demand situations affecting tractors since the projects were originally
appraised. It has recently been agreed that the credits should be amended to
permit the financing of indigenously manufactured tractors as well as imported
tractors and that some reallocations of the funds earmarked for tractors should
be made to minor irrigation components reflecting the shift which has taken
place in the relative priority of demand for tractors and minor irrigation.

Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation; US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government has been considering
the procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The Government
has now indicated that it proposes to proceed with procurement as previously
agreed with the Association and some disbursements are anticipated during
this fiscal year.
Cr No. 24l1    Telecommunications IV; US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 197L
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and has
been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over the
last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74).  Procurement action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed. Production problems
in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about 6-9 months. However,
production has now picked up and as of November 30, 1973, US$29.0 million had
been disbursed under the credit. Full disbursement is expected by the closing
date of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II;  US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date:  September 30, 1975
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 4L16-IN,
is designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems associated
with preparing bid documents suitable for international bidding and the analysis
of the very large number of bids involved, but contract awards have now been
made for much of the major equipment. Disbursements started in June 1973 and
should be completed by the closing date of September 30, 1975.
Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer;  US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of fertilizer
manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is now proceeding about six
months behind schedule. Response to tenders has been disappointing and pro-
curement difficulties and labor problems could lead to additional delays.
As of Novrember 30, 1973, US$4.0 million had been disbursed under the Credit.

Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage;  US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
This credit to provide storage facilities in India's wheat belt
comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and 10 silos
(200,000 tons capacity) and anall-India grain storage study.   Warehouse con-
struction is about 75% complete and preparations for silo construction are
progressing. The Government Food Ministry intends to select a local research
institute in the near future to conduct the study.
Cr No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation;  US$39.0 million credit of August 23,1971;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perrenial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains, roads and land
development. Land development is presently very haphazard and increasingly
lagging behind water availability in the project mainly because many farmers
are unwilling to apply or not eligible for credit under the agricultural credit
scheme for land development. Government is aware of the situation and has
requested IDA financing for a Command Area Development Project (CAD), to be
implemented by a Central Authority for all farmers in need of land development.
It will require the setting up of a well-coordinated technical and administrative
organization backed by suitable legal and socio-political measures. Project
preparation is under way.
Cr No. 279     Gorakhpur Fertilizer;  US$10.0 million credit of January 7,
1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
The engineering design for this project, for the expansion of a urea
plant in Uttar Pradesh, is now well advanced and virtually all the equipment
has been ordered. Although delivery of some equipment may take longer than
forecast during appraisal, the project is progressing without serious diffi-
culties.
Cr No. 280     Railways XI;  US$75.0 million credit of January 2h, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1974
This project, consisting of new and ongoing works in the Indian
Railways investment program for three years beginning April 1, 1971, is
progressing in a satisfactory manner. Credit is expected to be fully
disbursed by December 31, 1973.

of the two universities have been staffed with project architects. A campus
planner for Assam Agricultural University is still needed. Additional land
at the site for the main campus of the university in Bihar has still to be
acquired, but no problems are anticipated.

Procurement
Arrangements:       Equipment and material estimated to cost US$3.2
million would be procured on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding with domestic bidders
accorded the normal preference of 15 percent or
customs duty whichever is the lower. Other equipment
and material valued at US$0.9 million unsuitable for
international procurement would be purchased locally.
Civil works valued at US$2.2 million are of diverse
nature, small size, scattered geographically and over
time and are therefore unsuitable for international com-
petitive bidding. The road works of us$6.0 million
would be done largely by force account, with the
balance undertaken by local contractors.
Consultants
ana Techinical      Engineering consultants would be contracted to assist
Assistance:        HPMC with the cold storage units and the juice con-
centrate plant. Also to be contracted are an apple
quality control specialist, a packing plant manager,
a marketing specialist, a food technologist, and a
food processing microbiologist. US$0.5 million would
be provided under the credit for these services.
Rate of Return:      23 percent economic rate of return
