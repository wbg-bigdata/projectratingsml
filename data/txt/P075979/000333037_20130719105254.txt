I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Country context. São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) is a small island nation with
an open economy. It has fewer than 200,000 inhabitants and a gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita of about US$2,500 (2012). As in other small island states, STP
cannot take advantage of economies of scale in economic production, or in the
provision of public goods, while its small domestic labor pool and limited consumer
market seriously constrain diversification. This translates into high marginal costs for
public services, infrastructure and utilities.
2.     In 2004, at the time of appraisal of the Social Sector Support Project (SSSP),
the human development index for São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) was at 0.604,
compared to an average of 0.472 for Sub-Saharan Africa; and the adult literacy rate
was 80 percent. It was estimated that 54 percent of the population was living in
poverty at Appraisal.
3.      STP’s population was estimated at 163,800 in 2010. It is estimated that
population growth rate has declined significantly during the last decade and currently
stands at 1.79 percent. The small size of the population is matched by its reduced land
mass and the fact of relative ease of access to all points on the main island from the
capital city within no more than 2-3 hours thanks to a reasonable good road
infrastructure.
4.      Sector context. At appraisal, the delivery of social services was constrained
by very limited government capacity to plan and implement social strategies and
programs. A weak incentive framework had a negative impact on the performance of
public service providers. Although public expenditure on health and education was
relatively high - about 27 percent of total government expenditure - there were
significant inefficiencies. Despite heavy donor support, donor coordination was poor
and support fragmented, resulting in overlapping programs and activities. Social
mobilization was weak in civil society and communities, and the private sector
practically non-existent.
5.     The education sector was characterized by a weak structure and organization1.
Education services were deemed to be insufficient, inefficient, poorly organized, of
poor quality with insufficient learning time. Almost one third of the primary schools
(grades 1-4) were working under a triple shift system, meaning that average class time


1
  The STP formal education system has been composed, at appraisal (and is still) of the levels of pre-
school, primary education, secondary education, technical and vocational education, and higher
education. Pre-schooling is optional and is composed of a small network of nurseries mostly located in
rural areas, which enroll children 0-5 years old, and pre-schools, located essentially in urban areas and
enrolling children 3-5 years old. Primary education, according to the law, is free and compulsive. It
lasts six years and is divided into two cycles: a first cycle of four years, and, a second cycle of 2 years
(grades 5-6). It enrolls children of age group 6-11. Secondary education is composed of two cycles of
three years. The first cycle, or general secondary education covers grades 7-9; the second cycle, or
complementary secondary education covers grades 10-12.




                                                    1
was severely curtailed, with students having only 2 to 3 hours of class time per day.
Attrition was high: 78 percent of children who entered the first year reached 4th grade
and only 47 percent reached 6th grade. Pedagogical materials were limited and the
curriculum outdated.
6.      The education sector was the largest civil service employer. However, the
ability of the Ministry of Education to use these human resources cost-effectively was
hampered by its weak capacity for personnel planning and management, teacher
supervision, and the monitoring resource use. As a consequence, teachers were de-
motivated and untrained: Fewer than 35 percent of teachers had any training.
Teachers' salaries were very low, corresponding to about 1.5 times the GDP per capita.
There was no career development path for teachers. School inspection for supporting
and improving the quality of teaching was quasi nonexistent. The quality of school
mapping and annual reports and data collection was also weak. Moreover, while
expenditure in education was relatively high - at 14 percent of total government
expenditure - efficiency in the use of funds was low.
7.      In the health sector, malaria and HIV/AIDS were the major issues. Malaria
was the main public health problem in the country and the major cause of death,
especially among children under 5 years of age (with an incidence rate for under 5
children of 1,273/1000 due to the disease which was the cause of 65 percent of under
5 hospitalizations). The disease was hyper-endemic in São Tomé and meso-endemic
in Principe; 300 cases per 1000 inhabitants were registered each year. The number of
cases of HIV infection had been increasing and the prevalence rate among pregnant
women was established at 5.4 percent in 1996 (up from 1 percent in 1993. It was also
estimated that the number of AIDS cases increased from 50 in 1998 to 89 in 2000.
8.      Government expenditure on health was relatively high and had been
increasing. On average, about 13 percent of total government expenditure had been
allocated to the health sector over the previous five years. However, the Ministry of
Health had limited management capacity in terms of strategic planning (including
alignment of human resource management to the health strategy), implementation,
monitoring and evaluation. Staff capacity was extremely low, due to low numbers and
insufficient training. As was the case in the education sector, the very low public
sector salaries and lack of career opportunities exacerbated the capacity problems and
negatively affected staff motivation. The personnel information system was not
computerized. Data availability was scarce, due to a deficient health information
system, in which data were not systematically collected or analyzed. The sector had
not produced an annual report for over a decade. Individual programs often created
their own data collection systems.
9.      Project context. The Poverty Reduction Strategy identified the development
of human resources and access to basic social services, specifically health, as lead
priorities; it also emphasized the increased involvement of civil society in addressing
social sector issues.
10.    Government’s ten-year Education Strategy (2003-2013) focused largely on
basic education.2 Government’s ten-year National Health Development Plan (NHDP,


2
 The Education Strategy covered the following objectives: (i) develop the foundation for a better
managed and integrated six years primary education system; (ii) spread educational opportunities more



                                                 2
  2001-2010) included strategic plans for “Roll Back Malaria? and for the “Fight
  against HIV/AIDS?. 3 The policy aimed at improving curative health care through
  strengthened hospital management and the installation of more efficient diagnostic
  support services. It also aimed to create a statistics and planning bureau within the
  Ministry of Health, responsible for data collection and project preparation; formulate
  and implement an action plan for the extended vaccination program; and increase the
  share of the decentralized districts in total health expenditure.

  1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
  11.     The development objective of the STP Social Sector Support Project (SSSP),
  as stated in the Development Financing Agreement was to contribute to improving the
  delivery of basic health and education services with a focus on greater and equitable
  access, better quality, and improved local governance.
  12.     Evidence of progress towards achieving the PDOs was to be assessed as
  indicated in Table 1, below (columns 2 and 3, as per the PAD):

    Specific objectives Of the NHDP were to (i) improve access to quality primary care services and
  develop primary health care services; (ii) improve access to drinking water and sanitation for the poor
  and improve their nutritional status by strengthening the national health system and the sector’s
  planning capability; (iii) improve public information, education, and communications actions; (iv)
  strengthen reproductive health services (including family planning), preventive services, and (v)
  combat major endemic diseases (malaria, tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases, diarrhea, AIDS,
  and other diseases).

 14.     The Additional Financing (AF) grant, in the amount of US$2.1 million,
 approved on May 4, 2010 and concentrating exclusively on the health-sector and the
 cross-sectoral issues, introduced new targets for some of the original Key Indicators
 of this original project, added new Key Indicators, and dropped some. (see Table 1
 above, column 5) The main objective of the AF was to consolidate the gains achieved
 and to ensure sustainability of Original Financing interventions in a context of
 economic crisis.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
15.      For education, the main beneficiaries as identified at project appraisal are
primary school age children (in particular, rural girls), and teachers (grades 1-6). For
health, beneficiaries are: children under the age of 5 years (for measles immunization
and for malaria prevention) and their mothers; pregnant women (for improved
prenatal care and actions to reduce their HIV prevalence rate); primary school
children (for deworming treatment); and women, in general, who learn how to prevent
HIV infection. Support for Community-Driven Initiatives (CDIs) benefit poor
communities in both rural and urban areas. Also, key organizational units and staff of
the education and health ministries, where basic systems and capacities are targeted.
16.     Beneficiaries of the AF are children under five years, pregnant women and
women in general, more of whom are covered by the AF than under the original
financing. The AF also determined the total number of beneficiaries to be reached by
the project with 103,000 of which 60 percent were to be female.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
17.     The project as approved consisted of three principal components: (i) delivery
of basic education services; (ii) delivery of basic health services; and (iii) addressing
cross-sectoral social issues: HIV/AIDS and Malaria. The AF reinforced and extended
the health-related components.
18.     Component 1: Delivery of basic education services. (US$2.80 million of
which US$ 0.5 million is IDA Grant). This component was designed to improve the
delivery of basic education services by supporting Government’s Ten-year Education
Strategy (2003-2013), with focus on laying the foundation for a better managed and
integrated six-year primary education system. It was also expected to finance CDIs in
education. It is composed of two sub-components: one focused on improving the
survival rate from grades 1 to 6, and the transition rate between grades 4-5, spreading
educational opportunities more equitably across districts, between genders, and
ensuring that services reach the poor and the vulnerable children. It included policy
and reform measures such as 100 percent access to the full six-years of primary
school, and elimination of the triple-shift system in some schools in favor of double-
shifting. The other sub-component was focused on improving the quality of basic
education by reducing repetition and improving the quality of inputs and management
of the system through teacher training, pedagogical/didactic material, and curricula
revision.
19.     Component 2: Delivery of basic health services. (US$2.30 million of which
US$0.5 is IDA Grant). This component was intended to contribute to strengthening
the delivery of basic health services at the district level, as outlined in the
government's NHDP (2001 -2010). The focus was on increasing coverage and quality
of district health services and enhancing institutional capacity in the sector. There
were two sub-components. The first one aimed at improving the coverage of basic
health services with a focus on two districts where about 40 percent of the population
lives and which had no clinical maternity services. The second sub-component
supported improvement of the quality of basic health services by complementing
activities of the Government and other development partners, through (i)
strengthening institutional and management capacity and staff performance in the
health sector at the central and district levels; (ii) improving training of basic health
service providers; (iii) assisting in developing IEC material for preventive care and


                                           5
health promotion; (iv) supporting the Commission for School Health and contributing
to the health of primary school students through hearing and vision checks and de-
worming; and (v) supporting CDIs that contribute to improved health.
20.      Component 3: Addressing cross-sectoral social issues: HIV/AIDS and
Malaria (US$0.50 million - IDA Grant). This sub-component for HIV/AIDS
focused on: (i) support for central coordination, management, and monitoring and
evaluation of the national response by the National AIDS Secretariat; (ii) prevention
of HIV infection through IEC, condom promotion and distribution, rapid tests for
surveys, safe blood handling, VCT; and (iii) implementation of activities by the public
and the private sectors, and CDI. The sub-component for malaria provided
institutional support to the malaria program by supporting the (i) coordination of the
national multi-sectoral response; (ii) updating of management strategies; (iii)
provision of drugs; and (iv) CDI.

1.6 Revised Components
21.     The components were not revised during the life of the project. However,
several existing activities were scaled up and new activities were added to
Components 2 and 3 following the US$2.1 million Additional Financing (AF) Grant
in 2010. The main objective of the AF was to consolidate the gains achieved and to
ensure sustainability of original financing interventions through institutional
strengthening of health institutions at the central and local levels.
22.     The original activities that were to be scaled up by the AF included: (i) the
rehabilitation of health facilities, including the National Center for Endemic Diseases
(CNE, the government Department responsible for malaria and HIV/AIDS programs);
and (ii) institutional support to the Ministry of Health (MoH) including the
completion of the Health Information System, the adoption by the government of a
policy on health financing; and the development of a new strategy on human
resources management.
23.     The additional activities financed by the AF were: (i) the construction of four
residences for health staff in remote areas in order to improve the availability of
health services in those areas (under Component 2); and (ii) capacity development for
the Health Training School, and training of health personnel, including nurses, in
order to increase the availability and quality of human resources in the sector (under
Component 3).

1.7 Other significant changes
24.     As mentioned above, an Additional Grant for the amount of US$2.1 million
was approved in 2010. The rationale for this AF was based on STP’s inability to
provide sufficient funding for the proposed health-related activities as a result of the
increase in international food and fuel prices in 2008 and the global economic
downturn in 2009 that resulted in lower than expected exports and tourism revenues.
(Details see above).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
25.      Project Preparation. Economic developments in the country in the early
2000s called for immediate attention to human development and support for
institutional development in the social sectors in order to ensure effective service
delivery to targeted populations. The multi-sectoral character of the project gave the
Bank a comparative advantage over most other potential financiers. The Bank had
experience in helping establish the managerial, financial and administrative systems
necessary for multi-sectoral projects that include civil society participation. The
project was expected to address a redefinition of the roles of Government and civil
society, along with increased collaboration of international partners. The civil society
and community inclusion dimensions of the project were informed by the Bank’s
growing experience in the design and implementation of Community-Driven
Development programs. The project was prepared in full alignment with the
government’s poverty reduction and human development strategies.
26.      Project Design. The project was initially designed as an Adaptable Program
Loan (APL), which was rejected since there were expectations that the country’s
socio-economic situation might considerably change if and when oil revenues were to
start flowing (this has not yet happened) which would require more flexibility that
would have been available in the APL framework. The multi-sectoral aspect of this
project also worked against a Sector-Wide Approach Program (SWAP) which, also,
would have been more complex for coordination and implementation. Focusing on
just one sector (health or education) was also rejected since the human development
conditions at the time required specific attention to the basic level of social services
overall, and offered efficiency gains in terms of building implementation capacity and
strengthening the institutional enabling environment for both sectors in the existing
context of a small state, low-capacity country context.
27.     A major factor in project design and the selection of the lending instrument
was the fact that, at the time of Appraisal, only three of seven closed Bank projects
evaluated by the Bank’s Operations Evaluation Department (OED, now: Internal
Evaluation Group, IEG) in STP had been rated as satisfactory. The principle lesson
here was that design needed to be kept simple and suited to the specific country
conditions (small island state, limited capacity) and that attention needed to be given
to ensuring that implementation arrangements and monitoring mechanisms are in
place. Support through expatriate advisors was also deemed prudent. The ICR of the
previous Health and Education Project reinforced these lessons and added that: (i)
project scope should be sufficiently comprehensive (multi-sectoral) to have an impact;
(ii) project objectives should not be overly ambitious; and (iii) a multi-sectoral
approach is more efficient in a small country setting.
28.     Experience from the previous Health and Education Project also indicated that
assigning implementation responsibility exclusively to an implementation unit could
lead to a centralized approach that would be removed from implementation realities
on the ground and, thereby, lead to conflict with other stakeholders (such as ministries,
communities, civil society organizations). Indeed, implementation arrangements were
set up to ensure stakeholder ownership through full integration of responsibility for
activity implementation into both the Ministry of Education and Culture and the
Ministry of Health, including to district levels - in cooperation with civil society


                                           7
organizations, i.e. the Federation of Non-Governmental Organization (FONG) for the
technical implementation of community-driven initiatives. Project implementation on
all levels was managed based on agreed Annual Work Plans (AWPs), which
identified priority interventions. Administrative and fiduciary management for
activities implemented by public sector agencies was covered by a specialized agency,
AFAP (in line with World Bank’s procedures and guidelines).
29.     Four areas of moderate to substantial risks were noted in the appraisal report:
(i) political instability; (ii) weak institutional capacity and the incentive framework;
(iii) weak collaboration within the public sector and between it and civil society; and
(iv) lack of experience of the implementation facilitation units (AFAP, FONG and
ministerial financial departments. In retrospect, these risks appear to have been well
managed and/or, perhaps, overstated. True, political stability was wanting (e.g., at
least six governments and 6 education ministers since 2004; 15 governments in 22
years; however, the current education minister is serving his third appointment since
2005; the current head of the Center of Epidemic Diseases has twice held position of
health minister); but this did not appear to weigh forcefully on project implementation.
30.     Quality at Entry. A Quality at Entry Review (QER) was conducted in
January 2004. Part of that Review addressed issues of institutional/organizational
capacity and concluded that it would be a very challenging project for reasons related
to capacity constraints and lack of clarity in terms of capacity constraints. The QER
recommended that implementation be built into the line Ministries. The QER also
recommended that: (i) the development objective be kept simple and straightforward;
(ii) there be fewer key performance indicators that allow for comparisons between
baselines, mid-term and end-of-project targets; and (iii) streamlining the project into
few, core components. The QER also noted that STP commitment had not been clear
throughout the development and preparation phases, which had taken a long time. The
PAD took these comments and recommendations into account.

2.2 Implementation
31.      Implementation has been relatively smooth and the project has been rated as
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory since its beginning. The original closing date of
June 30, 2009 was extended a first time to allow for conclusion of the construction
program; a second extension to December 31, 2011 was allowed to accommodate the
AF for health sector interventions. All funds for the original financing had been
disbursed by the end of the implementation period. Only then was the AF prepared for
the health sector in order to consolidate the gains obtained with the original
financing. 4 Continued support for the education sector was pursued through the
Education For All/Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI, now: Global Partnership for
Education, GPE). The AF grant was approved and became effective in 2010. The
Project closely coordinated with the Gulbenkian Foundation on textbooks,
institutional reforms, curriculum development and teacher training, i.e. through
included joint missions.


4
 The Concept Memorandum (September 7, 2009) for the proposed AF noted that: “the ISR rating for
project development objectives and implementation performance have been consistently satisfactory;?
“key performance indicators continue to show progress;? and “a few indicators have exceeded the end
of program target level.?




                                                 8
32.     The implementation of civil works, however, posed challenges, given that the
capacity of national enterprises to carry out work is weak and international enterprises
did not participate in the bidding, as might have been desirable, due to the limited
options for economies of scale in a very tiny market. The extensions of the closing
date were granted mainly due to delays in works and the need to conclude the work
activities.
33.     The underlying framework for implementation was the development of
operational partnerships between: different ministries; the state and civil society;
community groups and intermediary civil society organizations. An Oversight
Committee led by the Finance Minister and composed of the Minister of Health, the
Minister of Education and the President of FONG was established in order to provide
overall guidance on project implementation and to ensure consistency of proposed
project objectives with government goals and objectives. The Committee met twice a
year to approve the AWP and the Annual Project Implementation Reports.
34.     FONG’s role was central to project implementation on the sub-national level.
Working with its member NGOs (86 currently, 40 of which are operational), FONG
managed “sub-projects? that included: construction activities (schools, classrooms,
latrines); community awareness training on health issues (malaria, HIV/AIDS);
support for community management of public resources; support for formal and
nonformal community education activities, including facilitating labor market
insertion. Overall, FONG managed sub-projects amounting to about US$1.1 million,
which included consulting services, training and workshops; this amounted to about
17 percent of the original project’s costs. Four years after the end of the original
project, FONG is working with several international partners, including the European
Union, and French and Portuguese partners.
35.     A mid-term review of the Project in November 2007 concluded that the PDO
remained relevant and that the overall performance of the project was satisfactory.
Several monitoring indicators were removed and/or revised and/or replaced by others.
Issues that were signaled in other supervision missions include: (i) misuse of project
vehicles by government staff; and (ii) more timely and rapid implementation by the
education sector than for health in the early years of the project.5

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
36.    Design. M&E was designed to be simple and straightforward. The project
financed an M&E system for FONG to monitor the CDIs and also one M&E
Specialist position within AFAP. It also financed the collection of baseline data, using
various data sources, such as UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and
available data from administrative sources (there was no Country Status Report for
education at the time). M&E actions were geared towards maximizing rapid learning
of processes and outcomes of the AWPs and CDIs in order to structure transparency
and accountability linkages between the different institutional actors. To the extent
possible, familiar MDG indicators were used.



5
  These changes were considered “minor changes? under the operations guidelines in place at the time,
which were approved by the Country Director through the ISRs, but not seen as formal restructuring.




                                                  9
37.     Implementation and Utilization. A single, dedicated M&E officer worked in
the AFAP for the full duration of the project (no turnover). This stability meant that
monitoring capacities within AFAP were greater than in the ministries, often
characterized by staff instability. Project activities were continuously monitored using
data based on the financial and physical realization of the activities of the annual work
plans. In addition, outcome (or development) indicators were collected from the two
implementing ministries. The M&E officer trained education ministry staff in the
development and use of educational statistics.
38.     There are few indications of any impact on overall policy. For the health
sector, the SSSP was one input (and not the largest) of several. The implementation
indicators were most useful when it came to elaboration of the AWPs. Also, results
monitoring led to modifications in several indicators in 2007: four of the eleven
outcome indicators were revised either because the original indicator was not
appropriate or because the original indicator was underestimated; seven of the eleven
output indicators were also modified, mainly because they were no longer relevant.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
39.      Safeguards. The PAD identified risks associated with health care waste
management, especially contaminated materials (sharp needles, syringes; body fluids
that could be infected; chemicals, expired pharmaceuticals; etc.). An in-depth analysis
of a health care waste management and disposal system, with particular focus on the
management of wastes from HIV/AIDS and other diseases was carried out. This
resulted in a costed national health care waste management plan with clear lines of
responsibilities, along with an implementation schedule. Also, an environmental and
social management framework and a resettlement policy framework were carried out.
These assessments included (i) relevant baseline information, (ii) the legal,
institutional and regulatory framework, and (iii) an analysis of environmental and
social impacts of the project. All three safeguard instruments were costed and cleared
and disclosed in-country and at the Bank’s InfoShop prior to appraisal. Throughout
the project, the overall ratings for safeguard compliance were “moderately
satisfactory?.
40.     Fiduciary compliance. At the time of appraisal, Country Financial
Accountability Assessment had not been conducted, meaning that the risk of waste,
diversion and misuse of funds could not be assessed. Nonetheless, the overall project
fiduciary risk was considered high since (i) Bank-financed projects were, then, rare in
the country and (ii) the public sector was characterized by weak institutional capacity
and limited financial resources. Of the six risk categories, three were rated substantial
and three moderate. For that reason, at appraisal, the project did not satisfy the Bank’s
financial management requirements. Regardless of these initial reservations, the
supervision missions consistently found that financial management and procurement
were satisfactory and continually improving - to such an extent that in 2009 a mission
recommended that Government transform AFAP into a broader government agency
for the management of such projects. At the time of this completion mission, AFAP
was managing a World Bank project related to bringing high bandwidth internet
access via underwater cable.




                                           10
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
41.     There have been no World Bank follow-up operations, per se. For education, a
(then) FTI grant for US$3.6 million for three years was approved in FY2009 with the
objective of improving of basic education services, focusing on improving (i) access
and equity in primary education, (ii) the efficiency and quality of basic education, and
(iii) capacity building for improved sector management. Implementation of this
project was rated satisfactory. A follow-on GPE project focusing on quality is
currently under preparation.
42.      There are no follow-up projects for health. However, the World Bank’s
contribution in this sector has been relatively small given the activities of other donors
(Taiwan, China; Global Fund; Portugal; Brazil; UNFPA). Unfortunately, there is not a
consolidated view of the actions of all the partners in this sector. Indeed, coordination
is said to be wanting.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
43.     Objectives. The project’s objectives were relevant in that they responded to
the identified needs in the country at the time of project preparation. At that time,
most of the health services were concentrated in the capital city and other urban
centers, while in rural areas population had little access to basic health services.
Indeed, the project focused mostly on rural and remote areas, and therefore
contributed to increased and equitable access to health and other social services.
44.     Project objectives were aligned with the PRSP and with both the Education
Strategy and the NHDP, and also linked to the global MDGs6 and the Education-for-
All (EFA) objectives. Furthermore, the project’s objective regarding access and equity
addresses the MDG #2 (promotion of gender equality) and the EFA goal #5
(eliminating gender disparities). The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy of
2005 (for the period 2005-09) also stresses the importance of reaching the MDGs for
health and education.
45.      Design. The relevance of the original project design is judged to be high. The
choice of lending instrument and implementing arrangements was appropriate, and so
was the credit/grant amount at Appraisal which was roughly equally divided between
education and health; the initial time-line was realistic, except for the challenges that
emerged later for the implementation of civil works. The fact that disbursement was
on schedule within two years of project start (after a slow initial period) attests to the
adequate overall design. One shortcoming for the implementation of health sector
activities, which could be attributed to design, was the lack of intensive donor
coordination, particularly with respect to the elimination of malaria, as this is an area
where several donors (Taiwan, China; Global Fund; WHO; UNICEF; UNFPA;
Brazil) were active with contributions that largely exceeded that of the World Bank.7


6
  For health, the objectives address the MDGs #4 (reduce child mortality), #5 (improve maternal
health) and #6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). For education, STP had already
achieved primary education for all by 2000.
7
  Inputs from Taiwan, China have amounted to around US$ 1 million per year since 2003.




                                              11
46.     Implementation. Relevance of the project’s implementation was satisfactory.
Progress toward the PDO was steady, especially after an initial period of relatively
slow implementation. This drive toward attainment of the PDO was sufficiently
impressive that several indicators were revised upwards and others were added in late
2007. For example, revised targets included the survival rate to grade 6, the per cent
of students in double-shift schools (because triple shifts had already been eliminated);
the percentage of HIV/AIDS positive persons receiving antiretroviral treatment;
revised indicators concerned the percentage of schools with six grades, the survival
rate at sixth grade, and the incidence rate of malaria. Also, minor adjustments were
made in 2007 following the mid-term review, mainly for the health indicators.
Conclusion: high overall relevance.

3.2 Efficacy: Achievement of Project Development Objectives
47.      Project efficacy is considered good. Implementation was pursued through
AWPs, which were a set of activities agreed upon between the government and the
Bank, based on the project objectives and proposed outcomes. Most of the agreed
activities in the AWPs were successfully implemented. The rate of implementation of
the activities ranged between 75 percent and 95 percent. AWPs provided flexibility
that allowed, for example, elimination of activities that were no longer relevant
(because the government or other donors were doing them) and to streamline the
focus of interventions by selecting other activities that, given changes in conjuncture,
had the potential to impact more positively the outcomes.
48.     Education. 8 One important achievement of the project was to help expand
universal primary education for STP to six years through significant improvements in
the transition rates between the first cycle of four years and the second cycle of two
years (from initially 60 percent in 2004 to almost 83 percent in 2011/12) and the
survival rate from grades 1 to 6 from 47 percent in 2004 to over 100 percent9 in
2011/12 (see Figure 1) for a six-year primary school system (which means that the
transition rate from grades 4 to 5 is close to 100 percent). Further, the repetition rate
declined from 27 percent in 2004 to 12 percent in 2010/11 which is the result of a
policy of automatic promotion from grades 1 to 2 and from 3 to 4 as well as the
improved curriculum and pedagogical practices. Successful extension of basic
education to six years is illustrated by large GER increase for grades 5 and 6, which
went from 94.3 percent in 2001/02 to 139.2 percent in 2010/11. In cooperation with
the Gulbenkian Foundation, all students had textbooks by 2007.
49.     Other project objectives included the elimination of triple shift teaching,
curriculum reform, teacher training and increase teaching time, which was reported at
appraisal to be around 2½ hours per day. Triple shift teaching has been eliminated and,


8
  In 2004, primary schooling was largely limited to the first four-year cycle, to which access had
already been universal for several years; in 2001 the gross enrollment rate was 126%, with a Gender
Parity Index of 0.94.
9
  Theoretically, the survival rate should not exceed 100%. The reason given (by the CSR) for this
survival rate over 100% is that some students left school before the elimination of school fees and then
returned and were counted as new entrants rather than as repeaters. In other words, this is a statistical
artifact resulting from the special (and unique) situation subsequent to the elimination of school fees
and the availability of more classrooms resulting from the school construction program.




                                                  12
by all accounts, teaching time has increased to about 3½ hours per day. This was
accomplished through the combined effect of the elimination of triple shifts, which
allowed more time for each individual shift, and the opening of new classrooms as a
result of the school construction program. Officially, primary school students receive
at least 600 hours of instruction per year. There is broad agreement that these
improvements were facilitated by the project’s contributions. 10 Indeed, several
prominent actors indicated that their image of the World Bank had changed over the
course of the project and that they had a strong sense of ownership.
50.     Teacher training was the only area where the project did not meet its education
objectives: 869 teachers received training out of the 1000 planned. Training began
only in 2008. Ministerial instabilities are given as the cause for these delays and,
therefore, underperformance of this objective.

51.    Health. The most striking outcomes related to project activities are the rates of
decline in incidence of malaria (measured by incidence in 1000 children under 5)
which within 8 years dropped from 1273 in 2004 to 62 in 2012. Consequently,
mortality has been divided by almost 9 and morbidity by close to 12. Declining
incidence is seen in Figure 2, below, which shows huge declines from 2004 to 2007-
2008 and, then, a small uptick which is attributed to lack of resources in 2008 for
spraying (which was resumed in 2009) and the fact that the same product was used
between 2004 and 2012. It is reported that there has been no malaria in Principe for
the past two years. These are huge gains of which many other countries may be
envious.11



10
   A learning assessment test administered for pupils in grades 2 and 4 (in 2011) found levels of
attainment in Portuguese and mathematics that were “acceptable.? The assessment used an approach
similar to that of PASEC. Although not strictly comparable, the STP scores are much higher than those
found in the PASEC studies (for francophone countries in Africa). One factor favorable to STP is that
all students entering school already speak Portuguese, which is the language of instruction.
11
  On 28 January 2013, STP (along with six other African countries) received an award presented by
the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) on the sidelines of the 20th Ordinary Session of the
African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government. This is an award for excellence in impact



                                                 13
52.    Two points need to be made here: (i) although progress has been huge, the
uptick suggests that continued efforts (spraying, research, etc.) is needed; and (ii) the
IDA project’s contribution was part of a much larger one to which several donors
contributed, specifically Taiwan, China (US$1 million per year since 2003); WHO;
UNICEF; UNFPA; the Global Fund; and Brazil.12 The Project contributed to these
outcomes more indirectly, through the support to the National Center of Endemic
Diseases, and through improving rural population health services.

53.    Support for containment of HIV/AIDS is also coming from various sources in
addition to the World Bank project (Global Fund and Brazil). In 2008-09 HIV/AIDS
prevalence in the 15-49 age-group was 1.5 percent; according to the PAD, it was 5.4
percent in 1996.
54.      On the whole, the project was quite successful in meeting its targets:
vaccination against measles was successful with a coverage rate of 99.8 percent in
2012; further, by closing 92.4 percent of pregnant women are receiving four pre-natal
visits; and 66 percent of women 15-49 years old know how HIV/AIDS is transmitted
and 69 percent can identify preventative methods. The inputs of equipment for the
districts and the in-service training have also contributed to the overall results.
However, in order to ensure full elimination of malaria, the current level of financing
(for spraying, nets, research, larvae control and sensitization) needs to be




and implementation, given for exemplary leadership in policy, impact and implementation in the fight
against malaria in Africa. Also, see H. D. Teklehaimanot et al. “Malaria in São Tomé and Principe: On
the Brink of Elimination after Three Years of Effective Antimalarial Measures.? in The American
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 80(1), 2009, pp. 133-140. This article mentions
partnerships    between     the     CNE     and    Taiwan,      China    and    the   Global    Fund.
(http://www.ajtmh.org/content/80/1/133.full.pdf+html)
12
   Curiously, STP’s 2011 edition of the « Revue de la Performance du Programme National de Lutte
Contre le Paludisme » does not mention the World Bank as a partner in the fight against malaria (see
Table 2.1 of this document). However, the SSSP is mentioned in the section on financing and as a
project that contributed, along with other donors, to social mobilization, sensitization, advocacy and the
acquisition to drugs and insecticides. By all accounts, coordination was lacking between the World
Bank and other donors in this area.




                                                   14
maintained, 13 which will be the case given the activities of the several donors
involved (Taiwan, China; Global Fund; Brazil; WHO; UNFPA).
55.     The health information system (HIS), which was supported by the original
project and by the AF, is one of the very few project activities that have not been fully
achieved: Although work has been completed, the health information system is still
not operational. In 2005, already, the issue was signaled by a supervision mission.
Various explanations are given: frequent changes in the MoH leadership (political
instability), which is associated with a lack of sustained buy-in to the technical
approaches of the HIS; it was designed as more hospital than district-oriented; lack of
an overall information management strategy for the sector; lack of incentives for
effective ownership. Another activity that was technically completed but not yet used
was the project-financed staff housing in Contagalo district which were not yet
occupied at project closing because the adjoining hospital was not yet operational.
56.     Secondary outcomes: Greater and more equitable access to services. The
project design put specific emphasis on population in rural and under-served areas.
Disaggregated data show that at appraisal there were substantial discrepancies in
terms of access to basic health and education services between rural and urban areas.
Project interventions contributed to close this gap. Most of the improvements
achieved in health indicators (e.g. percentage of pregnant women receiving ante-natal
care; immunization rate for measles; and percentage of births attended by skilled
health attendants) come from improved access to services in rural areas, through the
opening of new health facilities, the rehabilitation of existing ones, and/or CDD
interventions. The expansion of critical health care services has reached between 90
percent and 100 percent. All the twelve health posts/centers constructed or
rehabilitated by the project were in rural areas. The same is true for classrooms. The
22 classrooms financed by the project were essentially built in rural areas, where most
children did not have access to full six-year primary education. The gains in access in
education, particularly the increase of transition rates from 4 to 5 grades, and from 5
to 6 grades, are mostly explained by the provision of new classrooms in incomplete
schools, the vast majority of which are located in rural areas. Clearly, universal access
to education in STP, to which this project contributed, means that there is equitable
access by boys and girls.
57.     Better quality of services. Qualitative improvements in both health and
education are more difficult to measure. The project uses proxy indicators to assess
progress in quality. For example, the substantial reduction in repetition rate, the in-
service training of teachers and the provision of textbooks to all primary education
teachers are deemed to induce better quality of education. But it is more prudent to
talk about better quality of learning environment than better quality of learning, which
STP is still unable to measure because of the absence of a reliable learning assessment
system. Similarly, better quality of health services would be assessed through
increased institutional capacity at both central and decentralized services to provide
such services, which imply, among other things, better management of human
resources and an operational health information system. The moderately satisfactory

   For discussion on sustainability of achievements in (almost) eliminating malaria in STP, see article
referenced in FN 13.




                                                  15
assessment of implementation of these interventions indicates that, at best, quality
improvements were modest.
58.      Improved local governance of services. Finally, the successful decentralized
delivery of both increased public social services as well support to community-driven
initiatives facilitated by civil society organizations can be seen as a proxy for
strengthened capacity of local governance institutions and empowerment of local
communities.

3.3 Efficiency (for IL and GEF only)
59.     The efficiency of project is assessed as moderately satisfactory: The project
did not succeed in implementing its agreed program as planned, requiring an
extension of the closing date to complete activities. These delays should not be
entirely put on the shoulders of the government or AFAP. Procurement in São Tomé
and Príncipe is difficult given the small domestic market and, often, procurement bids
have to be re-launched because of the reduced number or, even, absence of bidders.
Also, costs of planned activities have in some cases exceeded estimated costs,
particularly with regards to works, forcing to adjustments. This was, for example the
case of expansion of CNE and construction of other health facilities.
60.     By thinking of efficiency in terms of value for money, two aspects are worth
mentioning. Project implementation through agreed AWP allowed for flexibility,
which at times, and according to an assessment of needs, led to some activities being
dropped because they were already being addressed by the government through other
financial sources or were no longer relevant because of the change in the sector
context. This was an appropriate way to put money to the best use possible. Secondly,
procurement constraints, due to the limited country market and weak incentives from
international bidders to compete, was an obstacle for efficiency. For example, the unit
cost of classroom in STP (about US$ 20,000) is almost twice as much as the standard
recommended GPE unit cost (US$10,000) and much higher than the average costs
observed in most of SSA countries. The limited number of bidders for specific
equipment often resulted in higher than expected costs.
61.     These inconveniences are not a surprise in a country like STP with little
potential for economies of scale. The project faced those constraints in two ways:
either by carefully choosing activities to be carried out according to top priorities of
the moment (which in principle favored efficiency in the use of money), or by
attempting to obtain the maximum number of bidders for specific procurement
services and works, which in practice often resulted in lengthy procurement processes
and delays in implementation (compromising time efficiency). The balance of both
offers a rationale for a moderately satisfactory assessment of efficiency.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
62.    The project clearly contributed to improving the delivery of basic health and
education services through improved access, quality and local governance. As a result,
progress has been made on four MDGs, one of which (six-year universal primary
education) has been attained. For education, the quantitative outcomes have exceeded
expectations. For health, the project contributions need to be seen the context of a
multi-donor effort, which was very successful in the fight against malaria. With
tremendous progress made overall, it has been demonstrated that elimination of


                                          16
malaria is attainable with continued application of the strategy, inputs and practices
already mobilized.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63.     Increase in enrollment rates, including extension of primary schooling from
four to six years, has benefited additional numbers of girls and rural children.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

64.     Two particularly high-level officials pointed out that, as a result of working
with this project, their perceptions of the World Bank were modified. They no longer
see the Bank as an agency of imposition (their term) but, rather, as one of cooperation
and partnership that is trying to improve its behavior. The smooth implementation of
the project, along with country ownership, improved the Bank’s image in the country.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
65.     The risks identified in the PAD were appropriate, especially given the fact that,
at appraisal, only three of the seven closed Bank projects in STP had been rated as
satisfactory. The overall risk rating was “substantial? (1 “substantial; 3 “moderate; 1
“low?). In retrospect, however, these ratings were over-cautious. The project
objectives were essentially achieved; implementation went smoothly; and the gains
appear to be sustainable. In the event of an inflow of oil and gas revenues (predicted
since appraisal), there is every reason to believe that governments priorities in health
and education will remain.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
66.     The QER took account of the poor performance of previous projects and
recommended modifications in the PAD in the direction of simplification and
attention to implementation capacities. The PAD was revised accordingly and
appropriate technical assistance was incorporated into the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
67.    The 17 supervision missions (two per year, on average) played an important,
collaborative role in maintaining the project on-track. The aide-memoires provided


                                              17
reasonable detail, clearly presented. There was a high degree of stability on the Bank
side, with one TTL leading the supervision missions since 2006 (he is also leading
preparation of the follow-up GPE education financing) and the same operations
assistant since project preparation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
68.    On the basis of the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry and
quality of supervision (including staff stability), the overall rating for Bank
performance is satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
69.    Government was moderately involved in the preparation of the project.
However, 2-3 years into implementation Government demonstrated a high degree of
ownership at all levels (the two ministries and AFAP). Instability at the ministerial
and senior staff levels did cause some delays and other problems related to lapsed
leadership (the health management information system, for example).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
70.    Implementation was the joint responsibility of the respective ministries, the
FONG and AFAP. On the whole, implementation progressed at a reasonable pace. An
extension was granted for the original financing in order: (a) to compensate for
unforeseen delays in construction and rehabilitation of critical health infrastructure
and procurement of essential drugs and medical equipment; (b) to support the
preparation of the additional financing for the health sector; and (c) to ensure that the
project delivers all its outputs, meets its key performance indicator targets and
achieves its Development Objective.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
71.     In addition to the fact that implementation was rated mostly as satisfactory as
of the projects second year, all government agencies (ministries, AFAP) successfully
met the challenges posed by the implementation learning curve. AFAP, in particular,
is now involved in the implementation of a World Bank telecommunications project
and FONG is now working with other development partners.

6. Lessons Learned
72.      The QER appears to have been useful in that it prompted revisions in the
PAD that went in the direction of more simplification and technical assistance for
implementation within the ministries and the AFAP. One compelling reason for this
was the poor performance of prior projects. As a result, the PAD may have
overestimated the potential difficulties and underestimated the development outcomes.
This may well have had beneficial effects in terms of ownership and confidence.
73.    Very small states, especially insular, raise particular issues that need to be
taken into consideration in project design and assessment: (i) Organizational issues


                                           18
(structure, communication, coordination) do not have the same characteristics as in
larger countries, with larger structures and overall numbers. For example, small
absolute numerical differences may appear larger when expressed as percentages,
which reduces the significance of small differences with targets expressed as
percentages; (ii) Given its sociological properties along with its democratic political
culture and practices, the political will established around the PDO carried forward
despite the ambient political instability (i.e., government changes). Indeed, all signs
point to a good level of ownership of this project.
74.      Improved donor coordination in the health sector would have been desirable.
However, there are no clear signs that this lack of coordination was costly since the
targets were met and exceeded. Overall, the education sector performed better than
the health sector in terms of implementation, even though both equally suffered
institutional instability, including frequent changes of the Ministers, high attrition rate
and limited capacity. An example for good of donor coordination in the education
sector was with the Gulbenkian Foundation regarding textbooks, in contrast to very
limited coordination among partners in the health sector. True, there are more players
in the health sector than in the education sector, but this fact, per se, would be a good
reason for future better sector coordination in health to sustain the significant
achievements so far.

75.     The use of a fiduciary agency for project management was critical for
successful implementation by country institutions. AFAP’s role in project
implementation went far beyond fiduciary management; it also acted as a technical
assistant to the health and education ministries in various aspects of project execution,
particularly by supporting the development of terms of reference, contributing to
technical discussions, and training staff on monitoring and evaluation. In addition, in
a context of frequent ministerial change and associated staffing instability, AFAP
played a significant role in maintaining dialogue within government and with its
external partners. By its experience and reputation, AFAP is well placed to become a
government agency for project management.

76.     Having one project for the two social sectors in a small country promoted
relative economies of scale for the fiduciary and procurement functions of the project,
as well as for Bank supervision.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Delivery of basic education services (US$2.80 million)
1.     Rating: Satisfactory. This component was expected to contribute to the
following project outcomes: (i) a better managed, integrated six-year primary
education system; (ii) improved survival rates from grades 1 to 6; (iii) more equitable
access across districts and between genders; and (iii) improved quality in the form of
reduced repetition, more learning time and qualified teachers, an improved curriculum,
and the availability of didactic and pedagogical materials. In order to achieve these
outcomes, the project delivered the following outputs:
    - Printing and distribution of textbooks to all students for grades 1-4 in
       Portuguese, Mathematics, and the physical and social environment;
    - Supplying pedagogical materials to all schools;
    - Teacher training;
    - Rehabilitation of storerooms for educational material;
    - Three cars, a bus, equipment, computers and reproduction capabilities for the
       education ministry;
    - Training four education staff in statistics and informatics;
    - Construction of 22 classrooms; school rehabilitation;
    - Grants for CDIs for classroom construction and other inputs (mentioned
       above) financed through the FONG and implemented by local NGOs.

Component 2: Delivery of basic health services (US$ 2.30 million)
2.       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. This component was designed to
contribute to the following outcomes: increased coverage and quality of district health
services in all seven districts, but with a focus on the two districts that have no clinical
maternity services and where 40 percent of the population lives; and (ii) improved
institutional capacity for the sector. In order to achieve these outcomes the project
delivered the following outputs:
    - Rehabilitation, extension and construction of health posts, latrines, water and
         sanitation infrastructure, canal clearing and information campaigns;
    - Grants for CDIs for latrines and other inputs (mentioned above) financed
         through the FONG and implemented by local NGOs.

Component 3: Addressing cross-sectoral social issues: HIV/AIDS and Malaria
(US$ 0.50 million)
3.      Rating: Satisfactory. This component addressed the two cross-cutting social
issues of HIV/AIDS and malaria and provided support for National Strategic Plan for
the Fight against HIV/AIDS and the National Strategic Plan for Roll Back Malaria,
2001-2010. The project delivered the following outputs:
    - Rehabilitation, expansion and equipment of the National Center for Endemic
        Diseases;
    - Capacity development of the Health Training School in order to increase its
        capacity to deliver high quality training for the health personnel;
    - Grants to CDIs to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria (such as sensitization;
        voluntary counseling and testing; information, education and communication
        activities for HIV/AIDS and malaria; production and distribution of bed-nets;


                                            21
   - In coordination with UNFPA, the purchase of about 50,000 condoms;
   - Environmental improvements such as garbage removal and clearing of
     mosquito breeding sites.

Additional Financing (US$2.10 million)
4.     Rating: Satisfactory. This AF was prepared only for the health sector in order
to ensure the sustainability of the original financing interventions through capacity
building of health institutions at the central and local levels. In order to achieve these
outcomes the project delivered the following outputs:
    - Residences for health care staff in remote areas in order to attract skilled staff
       there; continue the program of rehabilitation, expansion and equipment of
       health centers, including the CNE;
    - Training and capacity development in the Ministry of Health.
    - Support for CDIs implemented by NGOs (for latrines)

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Education
1.     The recent Country Status Report 1 (CSR) provides a detailed review and
economic analysis of the sector, using data up to, and including the school year
2010.11. This means that the data used by this CSR covers the entire period of the
education part of this project, which terminated in 2010. The analysis in this section is
drawn from the CSR.
2.      The education part of the project consists of two sub-components:
        (i) Improving: the survival rate from grades 1 to 6; the transition rate between
        grades 4 and 5; more equitable educational opportunities across districts, and
        between genders; and ensuring that services reach the poor and vulnerable
        children.
        (ii) Improving the quality of basic education by reducing repetition and
        improving the quality of inputs and the management of the system through
        teacher training, pedagogical/didactic materials and curricula revision.
3.     Performance indicators for this sub-component of the project were (i) the
survival rate from grades 1 to 6, and (ii) the transition rate from grades 4 to 5.
4.      The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for basic education (grades 1-4) has been
over 100 percent since well before the inception of this project. It stood at 129 percent
in 2001/02; 144 percent in 2004/05, at the beginning of this project; in 2010/11 it was
135 percent (average annual enrollment increase = 1 percent). Improvements are
especially noticeable at the level of the second cycle of basic education (grades 5-6)
where the GER, which was 104 percent in 2004/05 has increased to 140 percent in
2010/11 (average annual enrollment increase = 7 percent). Increases in the GER for
the first cycle of secondary education are more dramatic, going from 62 percent in
2004/05 to 83 percent in 2010/11; for the second cycle the GER has remained fairly
constant at around 20 percent. It is also noteworthy that in comparison to other
African countries with in the GDP/inhabitant range of US$700-1800, STP has the
highest proportion of its population in higher education (1040 for 100,000 inhabitants,
compared to 682/100,000 for eight comparable countries).
5.      There has been significant progress in the primary school survival rates. Since
2010/11 the second primary school cycle (grades 5-6) has the capacity to enroll all
grade 4 leavers, meaning that the system has the capacity to ensure a survival rate of
100 percent. Indeed, 2010/11 is the first year for which the admissions rate into grade
6 is greater than 100 percent of the age cohort (it was 116 percent). This is illustrated
by Figure 3.1 which shows the survival rates for four cohorts entering primary school
between 2002 and 2004. The improvements are attributed to the decline in dropouts,
as well as an increase in capacity. When compared to eight other countries of similar
wealth, STP is the only one to have attained universal primary education with a
completion rate over 100 percent (the average for Africa in 2009 was 70 percent; for
the countries of similar wealth it was 66 percent).

6.     If education is, indeed, a major determinant of poverty,2 the progress made in
recent years bodes will for reduction of poverty. In 2010, the poverty rate for heads-
of-household with no formal education was 73.8 percent. On the other hand, poverty
in households where the head-of-household has finished some primary education
drops significantly (to 66.1 percent). Poverty rates continue to drop as education
attainment increased: for households where the head-of-household has some
secondary education the poverty rate is 55.1 percent; where he/she has completed
secondary education it is 33.4 percent; and where he/she has tertiary education the
poverty rate is 30.1 percent.
7.     Repetition has declined by about half over the period of this project. In basic
education, the repetition rate went from 23 percent in 2004/05 to 12 percent in
2010/11. This is the result of a policy of automatic promotion from grades 1 to 2 and
from 3 to 4; the very low repetition rate in grade 5 (3 percent in 2010/11) is the result
of the improved curriculum and pedagogical practices. For 2010/11, administrative
measures have reduced repetition rates to close to zero in grades 1 and 3, and only 3
percent for grade 5. However, they are at 27 percent for grade 2 and 12 percent for
grade 4, and 24 percent for grade 6. The coefficient of internal efficiency has
improved from 60 percent in 2007/08 to 88 percent in 2010/11.
8.      The quality of education is thought to be low. São Tomé and Príncipe does not
have a learning assessment system nor does it participate in any regional or
international assessment exercise. It is, therefore, difficult to assess the quality of
learning. The teaching environment has improved with provision of new, equipped
classrooms, textbooks to all primary education students and teachers’ guides.
However, about 60 percent of primary education teachers are unqualified. They lack
adequate academic and pedagogical competencies. Pre-primary and primary
education teacher training suffered a rupture when the former teacher training school
was closed in 1996. For more than ten years there was no system for pre-service
teacher training. New teachers were recruited from secondary schools and sent to
teach. In 2007/08, a new teacher training school was created and 102 students were
enrolled in 2010/11.
9.      The CSR analyzed examination scores (2010/11) finds that the overall level is
reasonable “acceptable?, although with significant variations between districts. By
and large, girls have better scores than boys; furthermore, there is less variation in the
4th grade girls’ scores than for those of boys whereas the degree of variation in the 2nd
grade is about the same for boys and girls. Unfortunately, there is no analysis of the
evolution of learning over the six years of the project.
10.     The time on task of teachers in São Tome and Principe is among the worse in
Africa. In primary education, teachers do not spend on average more than 3.5 hours in
school and yet this time is not fully dedicated to student learning and pedagogical
tasks. 57.5 percent of primary education teachers spend less than 14 hours per week.
This situation is partly due to the inability of the education system to effectively
manage teachers’ work. One explanation for this is that there are four teachers per
class for grades 5-6 whereas there is one teacher per class for grades 1-4. Teacher

assignment, therefore, for grades 5-6 has become a major issue, especially now that
there is universal enrollment in those grades.
11.     The education sector has been and remains a priority in public spending. The
country was able to place education at the center of its development agenda over the
last eight years. The proportion of public expenditure in the sector increased from 2.7
percent of GDP in 2002 to 8.8 percent in 2010. In particular, recurrent expenditures
increased from 17.3 percent in 2002 to 23.8 percent in 2005 to 37.9 percent in 2010,
which places the country amongst the SSA top performers in this category. Ministry
of Education recurrent expenditures increased ten-fold (in current dobras) over the
period 2004-2010 (from 24,749 million dobras in 2004 to 268,056 million in 2010).
Investment expenditures over the same period increased thirteen-fold (from 4,726
million dobras in 2004 to 61,716 million in 2010).

Health
12.    The economic analysis in the PAD for his project points out that HIV/AIDS
has far reaching economic impacts. This is also the case for malaria. The costs of
treatment represent the direct costs related to these diseases; for HIV/AIDS they also
include the costs of caring for orphans. Indirect costs include lost productivity through
days not worked and skills that are lost as the persons who possess them disappear.
The indirect costs far outpace the direct costs.
13.     HIV/AIDS. The PAD proposed two scenarios for the HIV/AIDS intervention
in this project: (i) in the absence of the project, the HIV prevalence rate would double
to reach 2 by 2008; and (ii) the intervention would reduce prevalence rate to 0.5
percent by 2008. According to the CNE, the prevalence rate in 20087/09 was 1.5
percent.
14.    Malaria intervention. The PAD also refers to strong evidence showing the
negative impact of malaria on economic growth. The direct and indirect benefits
estimated by the PAD amounted to about US$2 million, calculated on the basis of an
incidence rate for children under five of 650 per 1000 by 2009. This objective has
been overtaken by events and by 2012 the rate was 41/1000 — divided by a factor of
