    SÃO TOMÉ AND PR?NCIPE: Social Sector Support Project Additional Financing
                               (H559-STP)

                                       Restructuring Paper

      1.      This Paper seeks approval to extend the closing date of the above-mentioned
              Additional Financing (AF) by 12 months (from December 31, 2011 to
              December 31, 2012). The Additional Financing in the amount of SDR1.4
              (US$2.1 million equivalent) was approved by the Board on May 4, 2010 and
              became effective on November 11, 2010 with the closing date set for
              December 31, 2011.

      2.      The original project, Social Sector Support Project (SSSP),1 approved on May
              18, 2004 was first extended from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010 during which
              time the AF was prepared. The SSSP was subsequently extended to December
              31, 2011 to allow for the completion of all project activities. All activities
              under the original project are completed, with 99.9% of funds disbursed and
              the corresponding Credit and Grant accounts will close on December 31,
              2011.

      3.      The AF was sought to provide additional resources to scale up the original
              project activities and to implement two additional activities. The scaled-up
              activities included: (i) rehabilitation of health facilities; and (ii) institutional
              support to the Ministry of Health (MoH). The additional activities included:
              (i) construction of residences for health staff in remote areas to improve the
              availability of health services; and (ii) capacity development of the Health
              Training School, and training of health personnel to increase the availability
              and quality of human resources in the sector. Approximately 50 percent of the
              AF is provided through the Crisis Response Window (CRW) as part of the
              Bank’s strategy to help the country mitigate the crippling effects of the
              financial and food crisis.

      4.      The Development Objective is rated “satisfactory? and remains achievable.
              Implementation was recently downgraded from “satisfactory? to “moderately
              satisfactory?. The rating took into consideration the political context of the
              presidential elections and the organizational changes that occurred in the
              Ministry of Health (MoH).

      5.      Since effectiveness in November 2010, notable results have been achieved as
              illustrated by significant improvement of the key health indicators. Survey
              data shows considerable success in the area of child and maternal health. In
              2010, infant mortality is at 38 per 1,000 live births, well below the Sub-
              Saharan average at 88. Under-five mortality rate is 63 live births in 2010, a
              substantial decrease from 96 per 1,000 in 2004. Maternal mortality has also

    P075979; Credit 3902-STP; Grant H088-STP; Amount: US$6.5 million equivalent
                                                  2
      dropped significantly, reaching 73 per 100,000 live births in 2010, compared
      to 143 in 2005. Malaria is under control with a prevalence rate close to zero.
      HIV prevalence dropped from 5.4 percent in 2006 to an estimated 1.5 percent
      in 2010.

6.    The proposed extension of the closing date will allow the MoH to complete
      the remaining activities, namely (i) the construction and rehabilitation of
      health centers; (ii) purchase of vehicles and hospital equipment; and (iii)
      technical assistance to complete the Health Information System and Human
      Resources Strategy. The procurement process is well advanced and will be
      monitored closely to comply with the procurement plan.

7.    The Additional Financing is performing rather well. After one year of
      implementation, disbursement reached US$0.6 million as of December 15,
      2011, representing about 30 percent of the AF amount. The requested
      extension is key to achieving the Project Development Objective, in a context
      where Sao Tome and Principe is doing rather well in terms of achieving the
      corresponding MDGs on social sectors.


8.    The Government has expressly requested the extension through a letter
      addressed to the Bank on November 15, 2011, with a commitment to complete
      project activities in an efficient manner. There are no overdue audit reports or
      interim financial reports. With respect to the requirements of OP 13.30 (6c),
      the team confirms that there is a qualified opinion because the Fiduciary and
      Administrative Agency (AFAP) does not have adequate records of Project
      assets that enable their physical identification. AFAP has committed to
      addressing this shortcoming by January 31, 2012.



9.    The MoH has prepared an Implementation Plan and a Procurement Plan,
      demonstrating that the remaining project activities will be completed within
      the extended period of the closing date.

10.   The proposed 12-month extension is the first extension of the AF and is
      within the three-year limit of the closing date (June 30, 2010) of the original
      project, in effect at the time of the AF approval.
