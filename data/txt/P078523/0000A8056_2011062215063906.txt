                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key actions have been agreed with the Government, including to complete, equip and hand-over the infrastructure investments (RLCs, MPBs). In addition, key activities have to be
                         carried out to make the tele-medicine system and community pharmacies functional, and to contract qualified NGOs to manage the Job Centers which has proved difficult given the
                         limited market for these services.
