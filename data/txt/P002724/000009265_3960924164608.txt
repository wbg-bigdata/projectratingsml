PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Tanzania Rjral Develonaent Bank Proiect 1 /
(Cr. 987 - TA)
PREFACE
1.       Included in this package are a Project Completion Report (PCR) on
the Tanzania Rural Development Bank Project (TRDB), Cr. 987-TA, prepared by
the Borrower and, supplementing it, an Overview of the PCR prepared by the
Southern Africa Department. The Overview is based on the Borrower's PCR,
the Appraisal Report, the President's Report, the Credit Agreement, the
supervision reports, correspondence anca files on the project. It also
reflects the covmerts of Bank staff who were associated with the project.
2.       The project involved a loan for US$10.0 million, made by IDA (the
Association) on October 24, 1980. The Credit was extended for two
successive years until December 31, 1985. The category of the Credit
relating to technical assistance was extended another year until December
31, 1986, and as of this writing is still ongoing.
S.       A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on February
25, 1988 for coiwnts. No conmments were received from the Borrower or the
Tanzania Rural Development Bank.
4.       This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Tanzania Rural Develogment Bank Prolect
(Cr. 987 - TA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
IDA played an important role in creating Tanzania Rural
Development Bank (TRDB) in 1971 to provide long and medium-term finance for
rural development and finance the purchase of agricultural inputs by either
making or guaranteeing loans. IDA was eager to assist the Tanzania economy
by strengthening TRDB as an institution and developing its capacity to
provide credit for viable rural development activities.
Objectives
The project provided funds for (i) training oi new and existing
TRDB staff and the establishment of six mobile units for the training oi
village administrators; (ii) strengthening TRDB's organizational
structure; (iii)  strengthening TRDB's infrastructure by improving office
accommodation and transport facilities; (iv)  financing TRDB's lending
programs; and Iv) recruiting consultants to assist Government in resolving
input distribution problems.
Imolementation ExPerience
Implementation of the project which was originally scheduled over
a three-year period, took six years due to start-up problems. of the
project components, the major initiative - training and staff development -
was largely carried out by USAID as part of its own separate project,
although this was totally unforeseen at appraisal (Para 13).
Computerization of accounts and loans was successfully carried out, and
minor infrastructure, vehicles.and supplies were provided (Para. 4c). Also,
80 of the $5 million that was provided for rural lending was disbursed.
Institutionally, the Association was instrumental in eventually securing
Government payment to TRDB of long outstanding loans to Government-backed
organizations, filling of several important posts and the correction of
some institutional weaknesses. An amount of US$3 million of the Credit was
cancelled in 1984 and the Credit was extended for two successive years
until Dec. 31, 1985. The category of the Credit relating to technical
assistance was extended another year until Dec. 31, 1986 to cover the
ongoing and resettlement costs of a few essential experts (Para. 8).
Practically nothing from the Credit was disbursed during 1981-83,
the original project period. Nearly all disbursements, some $6.6 million,
were made during 1984-86 after the original Closing Date. During this
extended project period, goods and services costing US$4 million were
immt tiately identified, committed and disbursed under large volume
contracts. This was accounted for, in part, by improved institutional



procedures, especially with regard to procurement, but was mainly
attributed to the fact that the parallel USAID project was being wound down
and the credit was the only major source of foreign exchange available to
TRDB.
The concurrent USAID project to TRDB provided a mult:i-disciplinary
team of specialists and the Association, TRDB and USAID agreed that, rather
than duplicate technical assistance posts, the Credit's institutional
strengthening and training activities would largely be carried out under
the USAID project. However, while this objective was incorporated into the
USAID consultants' contract, the work done was less broad ir. scope than had
been envisaged by the Association.  After the USAID consultants temainated
their work in August 1985, Credit funds were used to finance the
continuation of these consultant services for an additional nine months
(Para. 13).
IDA's performance during preparation, appraisal and implementation
has been mixed. When the project was appraised, IDA was eager to
strengthen TRDB through training and paid little attention to other doniors'
activities in TRDB resulting in duplicated training program which was
difficult to implement. IDA allocated adequate staff resources to the
supervision of the project but the implementation of the credit component
did not benefit from the regular supervision missions. The effectiveness
of supervision was limited in addressing technical and policy problems
which undermined project implementation.
Results
The project was marked by a less than positive development
climate. Disincentives to produce, resulting from distortionary macro-
economic and sectoral polices, seriously reduced the range of viable sub-
projects for which lending was intended. Furthermore, some of these
policies (e.g., requiring TRDB to procure and distribute inputs in addition
to financing them) weakened the Project's executing agency - TRDB (Para.
An unfavorable overall sectoral policy environment, management
weaknesses within TRDB, and expanding responsibilities, which often took
TEDB well beyond its credit function, contributed to the project's
generally low performance. Nevertheless, some tangible benefits were
derived from the project's accounting, computing and villege training
activities.
Sustainability
Most of the project objectives were not met but considerable gains
were made in upgrading TRDB's accounting system, computerization and
establishing mobile units for village training. The gains in these areas
are expected to be sustained.
FindinRs and Lessons
(i)    Project design should have assessed USAID training program
in order to eliminate duplications and minimize
implementation problem (Para 13);



- vi -
(i)  In view  of  the  credit  lssues,  detailed  design  of the credit
component should have  awaited  the  generation  of conclusive and
verifiehle financial data to be included in the project (para.l9);
(ii)  IDA supervision, t'tough  intensive,  was  not consistent in policy
recommendations (para. 19); and
(iII) In situations where the policy actions of the Borrower adversely
impaired project implementation, the project should have been
better served by IDA suspending all credit disbursements by
invoking the General Condition Clause (para. 17).

(Cr. 987 - TA)
Overview of the Proiect Comwletion Revort
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The Borrower has provided a comprehensive Project Completion
Report (BPCR) prepared by the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank
(CRDB). 1 I 'While the report is generally straightforward, care is
advisable in reading it as the boundaries between the activities financed
by the Association and those of a concurrent USAID-financed project are not
clarified; as it turned out, USAID did a very substantial amount of the
work originally included under Cr. 987-TA. Additionally, the project
history suggests a certain frustration with the project on the part of both
the Tanzanians and the Association.
2.       This Project Performance Overview Memorandum is intended to
supplement the BPCR by:
- summarizing the project objectives and results;
*                      - discussing the reasons the project developed as it did,
including the role of USAID;
- assessing the project's weaknesses and strengths; and
*                      - providing a general commentary on the course of the project.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
3.       Since its creation in 1971, the Tanzania Rural Development Bank
hbe been involved in ten IDA-funded agricultural projects, usually in the
role of credit channel. With the demonstrated weaknesses in the economy
and the growing difficulties with agricultural credit, in 1978 the
Association, which had given the Government advice when TRDB was first
organized, raised with Government the possibility of a rural development
credit operation to improve TRDB's institutional capability and providing
credit to rural sector projects, over the period 1981-83. It was
considered a pilot project, and consequently, the amount of the Credit ($10
million), of which $5 million was earmarked for rural credit, was kept
relatively small.
4.       The individual project components and their disposition were as
follows:
(a) Staff Training
Improving sub-project appraisal capacity was deemed essential.
To establlish an in-housa training unit for this purpose, the
Credit provided financing for three internally recruited
posts: Chief Training Officer;
________________
1 1 Formerly the Tanzanian Rural Development Bank (TRDB). the Beneficiary
and executing agent of the Project. For simplicity, the acronym TRDB
is used throughout the following pages.



Agricultural and Farm Management Speciqlist; and Agricultural
Economist. As it turned out, none of these positions were
financed by the IDA Credit.  Instead, they were sibsumed
under and financed by the USAID project as discussed in
para 13. The Borrower felt that the USAID Consultants moved
away from the agreed training focus on project appraisal and
concentrated efforts on credit managemetzt. Although this
criticism has some substance, the Association felt USAID had
done an adequate job and had been responsive to the changing
needs of TRDB.
(b) Village Training
Six 2-man mobile units were to be established for travel to
centrally located villages, on a nationwide basis, to give
advice on the use of credit, including training in record and
bookkeeping. This component proved successful, allowing
officials to visit the locaJes of prospective sub-projects
either for training purposes or for sub-project appraisal.
(c) Strengthening of Organizational Structure
This component provided for the installation of a computer
to computerize accounts, the establishment of an information
system, the creation of an organization and methods
system, and the establishment of a monitoring, evaluation and
research division, including the financing of a computer
specialist, and an organization and methods consultant. The
computer was installed, training of TRDB staff was provided,
and the accounting systems were coaputerized successfully.
TRDB considered this component the outstanding accomplishment
of the project.  Although the planned Organization and
Methods Division Study was not made, a division for this
purpose was established by TRDB.
(d) Input Distribution Study
TRDB had inherited responsibility for the distribution of
farm inputs financed by its rural credits. This task, which
had been handled primarily by farm cooperatives before they
were disbaned, was both unwelcome and inadvisable for a
rural development bank. This was recognized by all parties
involved and accordingly the project provided funds for an
Input Distribution Study of the alternatives. The study,
bowever, was never made. Government itself investigated the
possibilities for input distribution in the light of its
decision in 1981 to reconstitute the cooperatives. By the
end of the project, input distribution was in the hands of
farm district level or other farm-related organizations
(e.g., the Tanzania Farmers Association), and TRDB was no
longer responsible for this function.



- 3 -
(e) Infrastructure and Vehicles
The Credit provided assistance for needed office facilities
for TRnR and vehicles for reglonal officers, field credit
supervisors, and for the mohile units. These were generallv
provided.
(f) Rural Credit
The rural credit component of TMS5 million failed to get off
the ground during the original prolect period. TTSS3 million
of Cr.987-TA was cancelled on May 31, 1084, thereby reducing
the allocation for rural credit to 92 million. However,
during the late stages of the extended prolect veriod, large
purchases (e.g., spare parts under a tractor rehabilitation
program, thousands of ox-ploughs, and large auantities of
agricultural chemicals) were financed by TRDR and
necessitated moving TS91.6 million hack into this categorv
from unallocated and utilized categories within the Credit.
At the very end of the protect period, the credit financed
the contlnuation of ITSAIDs consulting services for a
soecified period of time (oara 13).
5.        The Association viewed the strengthening of TRPR through policy
changes as equallv imnortant to the institu;ional support.  In supoort of
this objective, an interest rate covenant was Included In the Project
Agreement.  It recuired TRnR to charge Interest rates of (a) 7.5% ner annut
on medium-term loans made to villages and cooperatives; (b) 8.5% on
short-term loans made to villages and corporations; (c) 9% on loans made to
Parastatals and district development corporations; and (d) 10% on loans
made to Individuals, partnerships, companies and associations engaged In
rural development. Although the interest rate covenant was undated, TRDA
made continual adjustments during the project period and all the interest
rate targets set in the covenant were met and/or exceeded.
6.        During vrolect implementation, at the Association's suggestion,
the Borrower agreed to the appointment of a Regional Directorate Read. The
Directora.e Bead position, which was filled, was essential for coordination
of regional operational activities and assumed an added importance as the
position of General Manager had been vacant for a long time.  A General
Manager was eventually appointed In 1983, following continued Association
representations.
7.        TRDB also agreed to take action to recover the unpaid principal
and interest owed by the cooperatives unions which had been dissolved. In
1983, the Government paid TRnR the amount of the cooperatives debt (the
equlvalent of USS7 million); and in 1985 substantially repaid TRDB for the
amounts it had lent to the tea and tobacco parastatals.
Disbursements
8.        After two extensions of the original Closing Date of December 31,
1983, the Credit was to have finally closed December 31, 1Q85.  Uowever,
very late in the day, it was agreed to keep onlv one category of the Credit
open until necember 31, 1986 in order to disburse against the cost of the



- 4 -
expatriate TRDB Chief Accountant, who was the only full time consultant to
have been financed by the Association. As of August 31, 1986, $6.25
million of the revised Credlt amount of $7.0 million had been disbursed.
It ls expected thut eventually $6.6 million will have been disbursed and
another US$400,000 cancelled. These are the estimates used In the Basic
Data Sheet (page ii).
9.        Toward the end of 1985, $1.6 million of the Credit was
reallocated to Category 5 of the Development Credit Agreement, from which
S3 million had been removed when that amount of the Credit was cancelled.
As of August 31, 1986, approximately $4.0 million had been disbursed from
this category, the Association agreelng that commitments made with

Examination of the tabulation of disbursements by year in the Basic Data
Sheet (page 11) shows the extent to which disbursements were concentrated
in the later stages of the project, almost entirely after the original
closing date. Disbursements were suspended by the Assoclation on country
grounds in 1982 and 1985, for substantial periods.  In the 1982 instance,
TRDB complained to the Association that suspension had forced termination
of the staff training program because specialist consultants to be financed
under the Credit could not be recruited for the task.  Although this
suspension only lasted three months, future uncertainties over
disbursements led to the training program being totally carried out by the
USAID consultant team.
III. BACKGROUND OF EVENTS
11.       The Bank-Group had previously involved TRDB in the execution of
its agriculture projects but this project marked the first time the
Association had sought to directly improve the institutional structure and
policies of TRDB.



- 5 -
12.       The World Bank appraisai of the project focused on the future
training of TRDB staff in rural sub-project appraisal work through the
setting up of a TRDB training unit. At the start of implementation, TRDB
was beset with the nearly impossible task of input distribution, including
the problem of dealing with village level authorities. Appointments and
actions which were necesssry for the Project to go ahead were delayed and,
although this may be viewed as a lackt of conviction or disinterest in the
project, it probably reflects an overriding focus on problems relating to
the input distribution system and restoration of village cooperatives.
Some progress was made, especially with regard to computerization, but
training and credit languished.
13.       During 1980-82, a USAID-financed project, Resources for Village
Production and Income (RVPI), was prepared. It was considerably larger
than Cr.987 and had similar objectives, including provision of technical
assistance. The Association first heard of a possible USAID operation at
the late'stages of processing. To avoid duplication of effort, in August
1983, the Government, the Association and USAID agreed to a proposal which
had been under discussion since February 1983, whereby USAID would amend
its technical assistance contract with an American Consulting firm (ACDI).
This consultant team, consisting of an Operations and Banking Specialist,
an Organization and Methods Specialist, a Training and Management
Specialist, a Systems Analyst/Programmer and a short term planning
consultant (8 months) would carr; out those activities envisaged by the
Association for its training and O&M consulting components.  At the
conclusion of the USAID project in August 1985, TRDB and the Association
agreed to extend the ACDI technical assistance team for an additional nine
months, and this cost was paid for by the Credit.
14.       When the dimensions of the USAID project became apparent to Bank
staff, it was believed by some that this project would have a preemptive
effect, fulfilling the purpose of the Credit and thereby obviating its
need. Thus there was some feeling that the Credit should be cancelled. In
any case, the Association had become dubious about the project's rate of
progress and realized that it would be necessary to reevaluate and redesign
the project. Early in 1982, it made extension of the Credit beyond
December 31, 1983 conditional on the Borrower fulfiiling certain
obligations and taking certain actions. It was largely within this context
that in April of 1984, the Association cancelled US$3 million of the Credit
and extended the Closing Date to December 31, 1984. The Association
continued to involve itself actively in the project and supervision
continued at the same rate.
15.       Early in the project, TRDB had appeared distressed by the
Association's refusal to finance village godowns for grain storage on the
grounds that these should be financed on purely commercial terms. For the
same reasons, the financing of tractors was refused as well, and the
impression is that TRDB did not know what to propose for sub-project
lending. Eventually, in 1984-1985, rural credit assumed a major place in
project implementation. The termination of TRDB's responsibility for input
distribution and the long delayed appointment in 1983 of a General Manager
helped initiate, and then maintain, rural suh-project lending. However, it
was the sudden demand of the cooperatives for goods that provided the main
impetus. Although officially reinstated in 1981 (pars 4 (d)), the



cooperatives did not progress to the point where they could actually
function until 14R5 (the coffee and cotton cooperatives In 1985, and other
cooperatives in 1986). In the space of months, TR)R orocessed the hulk of
the S4 milllon lent and disbursed (nara 4(f)).
16.       During the original project implementation  period, 1981-83,
TRJ)R's total volume of lending trailed off, attributable, inter alia, to
the very weak economy in Tanzania during this period. The recovery of
loans was bielow expectations as well (RPCR, para 5.0-5.2). Overall, its
financial Performance was rather static; the improvement anticipated at
appraisal did not materialize (although In 1985 and 1986, loan recovery
statistics showed some lmprovement as the result of Government payment of
quasi-Government debt). TRRD doubled its staff, from 366 in 19RO to 700 in
1985, and computerized Its accounts (RPCR, para 4 (c)). After the
cooperatives were reinstituted in 19R2, TRnR was restructured into the
Cooperative and Rural flevelovment Bank (CRDR), with an additional mandate
to Provide credit to cooperatives and undertake commercial banking. TRDB
organized itself to provide the new services but it took several vears for
lthe cooerntlyves to iecome functional d.ara 15), ad commercial banking has
thonly  recently  teen initiated.
IV.  COM*1NTARY
17.       According to Rank agricultural staff, the policy environment In
Tanzania in recent years has not been conducive to the implementation of
rural development Proiects. Projects have had to depend on an undulv heavy
emphasis on Government planning and control as a substitute for adequate
farmer incentives. It is evident that Policy actions of the Government
have impeded TRDB's development and have had a negative effect on its
viabilitv. The dissolution of the cooperatives is a case in point.
18.       Turing this period of severe economic difficulties, the strained
nature of the Association's relations with Government and its institutions
pervaded implementation activity and may provide a partial explanation for
the continual oroject uncertainties. The Government and TRDR appeared
sometimes to be on the defensive, a situation that occasionally hecame
acrimonious. TRDB on occasion complained about the Association's tendency
to make credlt extension contingent upon certain TPRnB actions and then at a
later point to change the conditions. A couple of times the Association
did appear to have lost track of what the original conditions were, and
there is some Justification for the Borrower's criticism. But these
instances reflected as much the prevailing relations as they did the
incidents themselves.
19.       The financial data available to the appraisal mission was
inconclusive and unverifiable. As a result, TRDB proved to he less viable
than indicated by aporaisal estimates.' The ratio of bad debts to loans
disbursed was a good deal worse than had heen estimated and the assumed RX
ratio turned out to be inaccurate. As the project progressed, TRDR's
accounts were found to he unreliable, and the Association suggested to TRDR
that consultants be recruited to re-examine the accounts, especially in
view of the auditors' strong and extensive qualification of annual
statements. Consultants were subseouently financed by the Credit; their
examination disclosed major errors and inconsistencies in the loan



-7 -
information and lndlcated that the TRDB accounts and financial statement
reported in 1983 could not have reflected either its financial or loan
positions. This evaluation exercise was useful not only in detecting
errors but also In serving as a catalyst for TRDB st ff to properly
Identify, label and transfer field data to the accounts. The accounts were
cleared up and since then the audits have not been qualified.
20.       However, despite Improvements in lnputting and transferring loan
data, ACDI's quarterly report of January 1986 (para 13) reported that the
credit functions of TRDB still need improvement. The consultants
recommended that TRDB's credit operations should be consolidated into one
department Instead of the three departments currently in place, and
proposed an organizational plan and job functions suited to the purpose.

' INTRODUCTION AND HIGHLIGHTS
1.1 hr~e  development  of  the  'ural  Sector  has  rece,ited  priority
attention from  the Tanzanian Government wAhich has undertaken a
comprehensive  program  to  support   the  development  of  the
agricultural Sector, in conjuction with efforts to achieve
balanced   regional   growth   and   more   equitable    income
distribution. As part of the government efforts Credit 987 TA
was  acquired  from  the  World  Bank  {or   the   porpose   of
strengthening the operational capability of TRDB in delivering
Credit and technical  assistance  to promote the development of
the rural Sector: The specific objectives of Credit 987 TA were
to:-
(a) Improve the tratning of new and existing Staff and to
establish Six Mobile Units for the training of Vit;age
administrators
(b) Strenthen TROB's organisational structure by:
i) Establishing a management information Centre with a small
Computer  suitable  for   TRDB'S   operations   and   the
employment of consultants to implement the Computer
System.
ii) Establish an Organisation and Methods Division and the
employment of Consultants to develop worK routines,
controls and procedures manual.
iii) Enlarge the Research Division to include monitoring and
evaluation of TRDB's activities.
iv) Establish a
Regional Directorate" at head office to coordinate and
supervtse the activities of the regional offices."
(c)  Strenthen  TRDBS's  infrastructure  by   improving   office
accomodation and transport facilities.
(d) Employ Consultants to assist government in resolving the
input distribution problem
(e) Include a Credit Component to beef up TRDB's lending
program.
1.2 Credit 987-TA became effective in April 1981. In 1982 the
Cooperatives were re-established. In order to meet tho banking
and Credit needs of the Cooperatives TRDB was restructured into
Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (CRDB with mandate to
undertake   all  commercial  banking  activities  as  well   as
development finance for rural and cooperative development.)
The authorised capital stock of the bank was increased from
Shs.300  million  to Shs.1,200 million.  The  shareholders  are



- 12 -
government 51% and the Cooperatives 49/. In the meantime,
because Cooperatives are still financially weak the Cooperative
shares are split between Cooperatives (3Q0 and the Bank o*
Tanzania (19/.). As at 31st March 1986, Tshs.280 million were
paid up while Tshs.311 million were  collable.   The  BanK  was
also relieved from the task of distributing inputs.
1.3 The CRD8 Project Credit 987 TA was implemented concurrently with
the Resource for Village Production and Income Project financed
by USAID. The Resources for Village Production and Income was
put together with the full knowledge and details of Credit 987
TA. A lot of efforts were given to making the resource for
Village Production and Income Complimentary to Credit 9a7-TA.
1.4 It was expected that the Bank would start operating from its
spacious  offices  along  Azikiwe  Street at the  beginning  of
Project Implementation. However, the burning of BOT offices in
May 1984 forced the government to allow BOT use CRD0 offices
for some time as their temporary headquarters. The majority of
CRD8 staff could not therefore move into the new offices until
early 1986.
1.5 For the first time in 4 years, the Bank 1984/85 Accounts obtained
a clean certificate from the Auditors.
2. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 In 1978 the TRDB Management met with a World BanK Supervision
Mission and discussed among other things the possibility of
TROB  being  considered  for  a  general  line  of  credit   to
compliment the specific lines of Credit from the World Bank for
such areas as tobacco, tea and livestock production. The World
Bank Mission was enthusiastic about the idea and provided brief
guidelines on how the request for such general line of credit
should  be  prepared.   The  guidelines  included  the  maximum
ceiling of USS 10 million as the amount that could be given by
IDA to TRDB for the first time.
2.2 The TRDB management mobilised its staff to plan, develop and
prepare the project as a basis for requesting the general line
of Credit. The work of preparing the project was completed by
CRD8 staff in 1978. The request for a general line of Credit
amounting to  USS  10  million was submitted to the IDA through
the governmen\ in 1978.
2.3 Several IDA supervisiorn mission  on  their visits to Tanzania for



- 13 -
supervising other projects held discussions with the TROB
Management on the proposed general line of credit.   It was not
until 1980 when the Sta+f Appraisal Report on the project was
produced.   Development  Credit  Agreement  was  completed   in
October, 1980.
2.4 Originally the effective date on which the mplementation of the
project could start was set for January 1781. However, several
conditions had to be fulfilled by the government before IOA
could allow implementation to begin. The first condition was
the appointment of a General Manager. The government, while
agreeing on the need to have tne vacancy filled, wanted to do
it cautiously in order to have the right candidate. The second
issue was on the interest rates. IDA HAD WANTED INTEREST RATES
CHARGED BY TROB to  be  raised  to 12 1/t2  to take into account
TRDB huge losses resulting from default and high admintstrative
Costs. The government's position was that interest rates could
not be considered in isolation except as a part of the nattonal
public finance and monetary-policy. the third issue concerned
Cooperative loans which worsened the financial position of
TROB. IDA urged the government to pay for these loans since
there was no other insitution TRDB could hold responsible.
Although the government had agreed in principle to pay for the
Cooperative loans, they wanted authentication of the indebtness
by the liquidators of the various Unions. This process took
time. As a result of delays in implementing agreed  conditions
by the borrower the credit became effective in April,  981.
3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.1 STAFF TRAINING
The project would enhance the capability of the bank in
undertaking inhouse training programmes in project appraisal.
Participants would be exposed to the use of case studies from
actual projects financed by TRDB in order to illustrte the
correct methodology as well as to provide maximum scope for
problem solving.  A number of employees would be  sent to study
overseas in specialised fields. The training unit of the bank
would be strengthened by recruiting internationally three sta+f
to fill the  posts  of  (a)  Chief  Training  Officer who would
advise  the  training  Manager  (b) the agricultural  and  farm
management specialist and (c) the agricultural economist.
3.2 VILLAGE TRAINING
Six two-man mobile training teams would be established under
the project and they would travel to rural areas to provide
crydit education including the meaning of Credit, and the
borrowers responsibility in the proper use of caredit and
repayment.

3.4 STRENGTHENING TRDS'S INFRASTRUCTURE
Funds   would  be  provide  sor  procuring  additional   office
furniture and equipment3 landrovers and motor-cycles.
3.5 INPUT DISTRIBUTION
The  project  provided  funds   for  employing  consultants  to
undertake a study on how to improve the input Distribution
System and to re!ieve TRDB of this task.
3.6 CREDIT
The project provided a Credit Component of US $ 5 to be million
used by TRDB to extend loans to borrowers in five regions which
had already a well established demand for credit and where TRDB
expected to expand  its  activities  at  a  faster  rate.   The
facilty was expected to support import requirements of TRDB
for loan -tems.
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 START UP PROBLEMS
In order to have a smooth take off of the project it was
decided to have a +irm employed by CRD0 to perform activities
involved in Para 3.1 to 3.5. However, by the time of the take
off the bank was already implementing a USAID financed,
OResources for Village Production and Income" Project, using
ACDI with three long term expatriates. Employing yet another
firm with three expatriates would have brought to 6 the number
of expatriates working with TRDB. This realisation necessitated
a review of the two projects to establish how they could be
dovetailed for maximum efficiency.   This  definitely  involved
time and was one of the major causes for the delay in start
up. Another reason for the delay was late or non-fulfilment of
some conditions precedent to disbursement like the issue of



- 15 -
interest rate and payment of Cooperative loans.
. 2 PROJECT REVISION
rhe  review  of the rIlat,onship of tne tw.o pro.jects: 'Te  LCIA
General 1 Irne of Credit anrd the Resources *or UYI'.'"ge Produc  lon
and Income Project durtng implementati'on led to some changes.
(a) trhe Scrapping of the idea of employing a new +frm to supply
contract services for the Credit 987-TA Project. Instead the
functions of the Chief Training Expert who was to be employed
under  Credit  987-TA  Project  were  invested,  first  in  the
Decentralisatton and Training Specialist under the Resosurces
for Village Production and Income and  later  in  the  Training
Specialist. The original objective of the three IDA 4unded
specialists  were  to  improve   training  sKills  of  tra,ning
personnel, produce improved training materials anc project
appraisal modules to 4acilitate faster decision maKKing. The
activities of the three specialists would also have been geared
to bringing closer coordination between trainings monitoring,
evaluation and research. The result of phasing out the Farm
Management Specialist and the Agricultural Economist as well as
transferir.g only a part of the functions of the chief Training
Expert to the Decentralisation and Training Advisor constrained
the attainment of the followings
a) Steps to strengthen the training department were delayed;
b) Emphasis in training was placed on-the job training and on
Credit management and administration;
c) Teaching materials and project appraisal modules were not
prepared;
d) Steps to bring closer coordination between training on the
one hand and monitoring, evaluation and research on the
other were not taken.
The delay in begining the implementation of the project led IDA
to cut down the Credit Component from US$ 5 million to US$ 2
million in the belief that the delays reflected poor absorptive
and  utilisation  capacity  of  the  TRD8's  clients  and  TRDB
respectively. With a smaller credit amount, TRbB (with IDA
concurence) decided to use it to import loan items that were in
critical shortage in Tanzania.

It was agreed  that  audited  iccounts  of  TRDB  and  .alisi rors
reports would be submittod to IDA within  six months of the enC
of  TROB's  fiscal  year.   TROB  would  also  submit  to   the
Association quarterlv  financial  statements  together  mi.uth  a.
progress  report  within  three  months  of  the  end  of  each
quarter.  6.Within s1:. months of  the  end of the project pe-'od,
-RDB s management would  prepare  a  project completion report.
At tre beginning of the project implementation the submiss:on
of the reports was late and irregular because of the monumental
task of converting from manual to electronic data processing.
Towards   1982/83  the  submission  of  the  required   reports
improved.
4.5 PROCUREMENT
f++shore commodities for the project were to be procured
through   international   competetive  bidding   while   inland
commodities for the project were to be procured  through  local
competetive bidding.  Draft tender  documents for all contracts
expected to cost in excess of USs 50,000 were to be sumitted to
the  Bank  for approval before invitations  were  issued.   Bid
analrsis and recommendations for award were to be submitted to
the  Bank  for  comment  before  contracts  were awarded.   All
procurement except one case, were undertaken in accordance with
the Bank/IDA procurement procedures. The one case concerns the
procurement of  office  furniture.   The  appratsal  report had
stated  that,  orders  for   furniture  office  equipment,  and
computer materials would be bulked to the maximum extent
possible  and  procured  through  local  competative   bidding.
However, when the bid for furniture was issued 4n the basis of
local competetive bidding an outside firm appealed to the Bank
to be allowed to participate.
In recruiting consultancy to study TRDB's accounting and
management in formation system and support computer programming
and installation, selected firms were invited to bid and on the
basis of technical competence and price (secondary), the best
one was given the job. Consultants for routines and procedures
were not hired as the work was reassigned to the long term
advisors working with the Resurces for Village Production and
Income Project. Consultants for the input distribution study
were not hired because the issue had already been resolved by
the government.

4.7 Performance of Technical Assistance
The project envisaged technical assistance to undertake input
d;% v  wu%wil       I  .*%vmsylytten research,  undertake  computer
study and the organisation and methods of the Bank. The input
distribution study was shelved because the government had
already decided to relieve TRDB  of  the  job.   Activities  on
research  were  not  considered  when  amalgamating   technical
assistance under the General line of Credit with that of the
Resources for Village Production and Income. The Planning
Advisor under the Resources for Village Production and Income
Project   assumed   the  work  of  Organisation   and   Methods
Specialist.  He  tried  very  hard  to  handle  the  tasks   of
developing and revising the  policies  and  procedures but with
little success as he was not experienced in the job. The
Decentralisation and Training Advisor under the Resources for
Village Production and Income Project assumed part of the  work
of the Chief Training Expert who  was  to  be  recruited  under
Credit  987-TA  Project.  However,  the  Decentralisation   and
Training  Advisor  worked   with   the   Director  of  Regional
Supervision and h.is priority concern was on training field
staff on practical ways of handling files of loanees and
personnel.   The  training Specialist on Staff  training  under
Credit 987 TA reported for duty in September 1985 and he has
been working with the  training  Mana_ir.  He  has  helped  the
training  Manager  strengthen  the  training  division  through
expansion  of  training  capability   and  establishment  of  a
training centre. He found a training Manager who is hard
working and well trained and motivated and who was willing to



- 21 -
Aorh  wkith  him.   The  Computer specialist position  has  been
filled by vartous experts since !978. Between 1978 and 1985 the
-omputer  specialists  were  funded  under  the  Resources  for
Yi 1 ige Production and Income Project. Since September 19S5 rhe
Computer  Specialist  has  been   funded  uncler  Credit  987-TA
Project. Each  Computer  expert  has in one way or other helped
greatly the Computerisation of TRDB. Since 1982 Credit 987 TA
Project has funded the position of Chief Accountant in TRDB.
The Chief Accountant has acted in a line position doing the job
as well as training the subordinates. He has done an excellent
j cb.
The experience with advisors in CRD6 dates back to 1971.
Throughout the  period  the  Bank  has  had  uarious  types  of
advisors.   Some  of  them,  even  if  they  were  employed  as
advisors, were so committed that they got to doing the job,
were ready for the consequence of doing it and as a resul t were
more e+fective in influencing those they worked  with.   It  is
easier to follow a doer than to follow one who merely says, Udo
this'" Some of the advisors would sit on the fence and "ell
their Counterparts to do as they tell them. CRDIB's experience
has shown that advisors who actually do the job are much more
e++ective in imparting the skills as well as working norms to
the people they work with.
4.8 Overall Assessment
On the whole the Credit 987-TA should be judged as a success
especially in the area of institutional building. It enabled
CRD6 to procure a computer, computerise its accounts and
because of this CRD6 can now produce up todate financial
information. Through training the competence of CRD8 sta++, in
Accounting, Computer and Operations section has increased.
Further more the project strengthened CRDBS's infrastructure by
supplying  office   furniture,   of+ice   equipment,  vehicles,
motorcycles and spares. Through the project Credit component,
CRD6 will be able to provide to the rural Sector about 500
diesel  engines  and  thousands   of  oxploughs.   The  project
equipped CRD6 with incomparable capability of reaching the
rural people though the Mobile Units which are also being used
for mobile bank services.
5. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The project envisaged that planned lending would grow from Tshs.
287 million in the first years to Tshs. 299 million in the second
year and to Tshs. 313 million in tF.e third year. However, actual
performance shows that lending gre from Tshs. 263 million in the
first year, to Tshs. 207 in the second Year and to Tshs. 144
million in the third year.
5.2 The project's planned loan recovery was Tshs. 290 million in
the first year, Tshs. 314 million in the second year and Tshs.
350 million in the third year. The actual performance shows
that repayment was Tshs. 143 million in the first year, Tshs.



- 22 -
181 million in  the  second  year  and Tns5s  194 mitli'on in the
third Y'ear.
5.3 The reason *or under  performince  was the poor economic state
oi affairs which nas  gripped  Tanzania  since  19 9.   ack  ci
4oreign currency constrained the country from importing basic
agricultural tndustrial and transport goods which are needed by
our borrowers.

Production and Income" Project and the General Line of Credit
financed by the  World  Bank.  The  unwillingness  of  staff  to
participate in the computerisation of CRDB operations was
overcome through repeated seminars.   The  Regional  Directorate
had some rough beginning as the regional managers in the field
were not accustomed to close supervision implied bY the creation
of the office of zonal Managers. But after repeated seminars and
briefing,   regional   Managers  saw  the  importance   of   the
directorate in coordinating the regional operations with those
of the head office, extending help to the regional staff and
promptly bringing to the attention of top management, the
problems affecting regional and district offices.
6.4 COMtERCIAL BQNKING:
Commercial  banking  operations  which   started  in  July  1964
necessistated the creation of the directorate of Commercial
banking, thus widening the scope and volume of CRDB activities.
At the same time more powers were decentralised in order to
speed up decision mAking on loan applications.
6.5 CORPORATE PLANNIN8s
It was felt during the implementation of credit 987 TA Project
that major questions about Corporate Planning and Strategic
Management as well as manpower planning and development needed
urgent attention of top Management of CRDB. Accordingly the CR09
top management arranged a workshop on Corporate Planning and
Strategic  Management   for  the  head  office  top  and  senior
management as well as for  the  regional and branch managers and
developed a Corporate Plan for the period 1984-1990. Accordingly
each unit develops annual objectives and relevant strategies for
achieving those objectives. In this aspect Credit 987 TA has
greatly helped CRD8 in tho exercise. In manpower planning and

.development,  CRD8  appotnted a compeeent training  Manager  and
strengthened the traintng division and establ ished and equipped
*a  training  centre  for e#*ective  imp.lementation  of  trp..ni,ng
programmes.  More staff were reerui ted in order  to  ranCle  et,e
fast expanding business of CROB. The n'jmber of  t.        sacreas.ed
'-rom 366 in 1980 to 700 in 1q85. CRDS rece-.ecd the ak  lccat on of
gradsuates from the  High  Level Manpower Committee in accorance
1itt th its needs.  Recruitment problems were experienced in caares
of secretaries accountants and computer Senior Staff while CROB
recruited   easily   Cadres   like   clerKs,   drivers,   credit
Supervisors,  typists  a.nd  economists.   It  was  difficult  to
recruit  some  cadres  of  staff because other  parastatals  and
private Companies offer equal or beter pay and fringe benefits.
CR08 has experienced staff turnover ranging from 5%  for  Senior
and middle management to 20r for drivers and secretaries.
i. 6 IMPROVED MANGEMENT OF CRDS OPERATIONSs
Mlajor improvements have been implemented in areas of financial
analysis, record keeping Management information System and
budgetary Controls. In the efforts to improve the management of
CRD8 operations various Consultants were used. Consultants and
advisors were used in the determination of an appropriate
computer configuration for CRDB, its acquisition, installation
and applications. Consultants and advisors were also used in
the field of planning,  training, commercial banKing operations,
organisation and systens,  accounting,  financial  analysis  and
Performance Planning and Measurement. Studies were conducted by
advisors and consultants in areas of Computer, accounting, loan
repayment  and  regional  operations.   These  studies  produced
practical recommendations which were implemented by CR08.
.7 ., LOAN REPAYMENT:
It was envisaged that improved management of CRD8 operations
would result in better loan repayment so that by the end of the
project repayment rate would average about 92% . This assumption
was based on he hope that the economic conditions as prevailed
ouring the appraisal period would have prevailed during the
implementation   period   of   the   project.    However,    the
deterioration of the economy of the country with consequantial
problems of foreign exchange caused a severe problem to CRD0 and
its clients.  Because of the shortage of inputs, raw  materials,
spares, fuels, transport etc.   many  clients  failed to realise
reasonable income levels and therefore, failed to repay their
loans. newpage

7.1 RELEVA*NCE OF THE PROJECTs
The project as conceived was very relevant to the circumstances
which were obtaining in Tanzania and in CRDB in the late 1970's.



- 30 -
Its attention to the management improvement of CRD9 operat ions
was particularl v relek.ant as b0  the time CR0B9 'mas having severe
problems as a result oX outdated ac:ounting equipment, lack of
p.r.onnel   with  azequate  Computer   Ci ence   and   accounting
NAckgroundsc overcentrJ, 1ised decision maidngg  lack  of  planning
a nnd financIal analysis and 1 c. o# mobC I  ty *or iuper't'i on  kned
loan recovery visits. Tne credit component was to be used for
lending to CR?9 traditional sectors in regions with good historx
of using the bank's loans.  Looking bacK six years from the time
the project klocument was completed one real ises the val Idity  of
the original empmas,s.
7.1. SIZE, SCHEDULING AND COMPLEXITY OF THE PROJECTs
The project oi US 5 10 million wA.as  given  to  CR0B  on  a Dllot
basis since the bank nad no previous experience with IDA general
line of Credit. It hau experience only with specific sector
financing.   The   US  $10  million  was  split  equally  betwen
institutional building and Credit, and was to be implemented in
three years.  The size of the  project  was  quite  appropriate.
However, the scheduling was too optimistic that the ccnditions
for  project  effectiveness   would   be  met  by  the  Tanzania
government timely. This was unrealistic and the project took
off after a delay of over a year. The project was not complex
at all.
7.3 FROJECT ORIGINL DESIGN.
The  project  design  was  well  conceived  in   the   area   of
institutional  building.   In  t;.e  area of Credit  the  project
design did not bother to identify tho existence of adequate
absorptive capacity of its credit for the various sectors that
were to be financed.
7.4 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
CRDS needs for technical assistance were taKen into account  and
the projet  allocated  US $ 5 million, half of the total general
line of Credit for institutional building  of  which  US  $  2.8
million  were  for  technical   assistance.    However,   during
implementation a need arose for bringing  the  general  line  of
credit and the Resources for Village, Production and Income
Project closer.  In this exercise two  posts  in  the  technical
assistance  component   of  the  general  line  of  Credit  were
omitted. These positions were for the Agricultural Economist
and the Farm Managenient Specialist. These two people would have
been responsible for building up monitoring and evaluation
activities in the research Divisions and in providing basic
assistance to the training Division in the preparation of
technical manuals and farm models.
7.5 GOERNMENT POLICY AND THE PROJECT



-31 -
Aldhough  the  government   was   keen  about  the  project  the
conditions for project e+fectiveness did go someway against
jouernment policies,  hence delays in project start up occurred.
The policy changes measures that were called for by the project
depended partyly on CRDB and partiy onthe government actions.
7 .6 IDA REVIEW MISSIONS
P           The IDA Review M5issions were for the purpose  of supervising the
implementation of the  project.   Those missions were helpful to
CRDB and government in that opportunity was taken to iron out
problems  and  di++erences  wmhich  might  have  occurred in  the
implementation of any of the actaivities in the  project.   CRDS
was usually informed well ahead when the IDA  Review rlission was
due and could communicaate to IDA on the appropriateness of the
timing. The frequency of the mission was just right.
7.7 MAJOR ACHI EVMBENTS OF THE PROJECT
*          In summary form the major achievement of the Project include:-
7.7.1 Computer acqusition and its applications for accounting
and non  accounting areas has improved timely availability of
financial ano other types of information needed for decision
making.
7.7.2 Increased mobility of CRDB staff vehicles and motorcycles
acquired through the project has raised CRDB's capability for
visits to project sites for appraisals, supervision and loan
recovery.
7.7.3 Acquisition of office furniture and equipment has given
CRDB  a  better  working  environment which is  spacious  and
comfortatle. This is a morale booster which we hope will
raise Productivity.
7.7.4  Training  of  56  officers  of  CRDB in areas of  project
appraisal, computer  accounting  and  agricultural management
has  increased  CRD6  competence  in the processing  of  loan
applications and in the management of Credit operations.
7.7.5 Corporate Planning and  Strategic Management Seminars held
for Top and Senior Management from head office and regional
and branch managers fron field offices helped CROB concretise
the bank's mission and its objectives which will be the basis
for drawing a revised Corporate Plan for 1987-1990.
