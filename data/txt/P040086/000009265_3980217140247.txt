Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
Improve the quality of life of poor rural indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities by providing improved access
to land resources and financing for investment subprojects, which are planned and in most cases implemented by
local membership organizations and communities in accordance with existing cultural values, vision of development
and capacity for self-management.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

This component would strengthen second and third tier indigenous and afro-   goods,
ecuadorian membership organizations in the following areas: (i) subproject   equipment,
participatory planning, preparation, implementation, and maintenance; (ii) financial    incr.
management and administration; (iii) cultural patrimony and (iv) human resources  operating
development, including basic legal training. In addition, the component includes  costs,
specific activities focusing on seven small ethnic groups in danger of extinction. The   training
project would finance: training of technical and administrative staff of local
membership organizations, technical assistance, goods and equipment for financial
management and administration, and incremental operating costs of professional staff
on a declining scale. Implementation of this component would enable indigenous and
afro-ecuadorian communities and their organizations to take the process of
development in their own hands in accordance with their cultural norms.
Support to the Regularization of Land and Water Rights                      consulting    US$5.5   11%
This component would include: (i) titling and regularization of land tenure rights in    services,  million
selected productive, forestry and protected areas; (ii) land purchasel; (iii) diagnosis    goods,
and elaboration of an action plan for community-owned irrigation systems; and (iv)    equipment,
support to a program of selected legal reforms. In addition, participating public sector  land,
agencies like INDA and INEFAN would be strengthened in accordance with terms and  training
conditions of inter-institutional agreements between these organizations and
CONPLADE-IN. The project would finance training, technical assistance, goods and
equipment, and the purchase of land. Implementation of this component would
contribute to improved and better secured access of the target population to land and
water resources.
Rural Investments                                                           works,       US$26.7   53%

subprojects, including: (i) natural resources management; (ii) community-based  equipment,
economic infrastructure; (iii) social infrastructure; (iv) training; (v) technical  consulting
assistance, including pre-investment studies; (vi) economic projects and (vii) micro-    services
enterprises. Financing of subprojects (i)-(v) would be on a grant basis matched by
community labor and municipal funds. Financing of subprojects (vi)-(vii) would be
through a saving and credit program (financed by IFAD). Implementation of this
component would increase access of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities to
services and markets and would diversify and/or intensify rural production.
Financed by IFAD and GOE. IFAD would finance land purchases only as a means of mitigating potential conflicts that
might arise among communities during land titling activities.

3. Benefits and target population:
* The project will increase the income and quality of life of about 81 5,000 poor indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
peoples.
*  The project will concentrate its activities in 288 parroquias out of a total of 966 parroquias. These 288 parroquias
have been identified as predominantly indigenous or afro-ecuadorian, based on an Indigenous Poverty Map prepared
by the Secretaria Tecnica del Frente Social.
* Besides its focus on poverty alleviation, the project will generate economic benefits associated with the
implementation of subprojects and more secured access to land resources.
* The project will create institutional capacity in indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations to identify, prepare and
implement subprojects and services to their member communities, thereby reducing the need for direct interventions
by state entities.
* The project will help rescue and strengthen the cultural patrimony of indigenous and black peoples.
* The project will be instrumental in maintaining peace and stability, thereby indirectly contributing to a favorable
environment for private sector investments in Ecuador.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project aims to build on existing institutional capacity in both the public and private sector for project
implementation through specific inter-institutional cooperation agreements (convenios) and contracts. Specific project
activities and procurement of works, goods, and services would be agreed upon in Annual Operating Plans by November
15 each year.
Executing agencies:
a) Institutional Strengthening of Local Membership Organizations:
* CONPLADE-IN would employ consultants, NGOs, etc. which meet pre-determined eligibility criteria.
b) Support to the Regularization of Land Rights:
*  CONPLADE-IN would enter into convenios with the Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Agrario (INDA); and the
Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal de Areas Naturales y Vida Silvestre (INEFAN);
* INDA and INEFAN for lands in their respective jurisdictions will contract eligible contractors for specific tasks.
* Indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations assist through legal assistants.
c) Rural Investments Subprojects:
*  Subprojects to be financed on a matching grant basis would be included in Local Development Plans elaborated by
second and third tier indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations following a participatory planning

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: R97-38; March 25,1997
The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): Progress Report for Ecuador, as discussed
by the Board on March 25, 1997, which identifies poverty alleviation as a key objective of the Bank's assistance in
Ecuador. The CAS recommends an effort to strengthen the assets of the poor and support for a strong and stable demand
for labor. These recommendations are based on the 1995 Poverty Report which notes that sustained labor-intensive
growth is the single most important condition for poverty reduction because it creates employment opportunities and
higher incomes for the poor while providing the public sector with much needed resources to support social programs
and targeted interventions. The Poverty Report also indicates that poverty is higher in rural areas where two out of three
people live and poverty among the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples is much higher than the non-indigenous
population. By focusing on the rural indigenous and afro-ecuadorian population, the proposed project is expected to
make an important contribution to achieving the Bank's objective of poverty alleviation.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Thirty-five percent of Ecuador's population lives in poverty with another seventeen percent highly vulnerable to poverty.
Overall, the relationship between poverty, household characteristics, and social indicators varies considerably across, and
even within, regions and areas. Whereas, urban poverty is associated with low educational achievement, informal sector
employment, rented (not owned) housing, and low rates of women's participation in the labor force, rural poverty is
associated with lack of education, little access to land, a low degree of market integration, and lack of employment in the
vibrant off-farm rural sector. However, in both rural and urban areas, poverty and ethnicity are closely related:
households in which an indigenous language is spoken are more likely to be poor than are Spanish-speaking households;
and strongly indigenous and afro-ecuadorian cantons are worse off with respect to a wide variety of social and service
variables, such as education level, malnutrition rate, and water connections. In parroquias where indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian peoples represent a majority of the population, the incidence of poverty is approximately 85% taking into
account the consumption based poverty line of US$12 per capita per fortnight, which is respectively 14 and 32
percentage points above the rural and national average.

The diversity in the causes of poverty among the regions and sectors has led to a Goverment strategy relying upon a
multitude of social programs to address poverty. These programs are usually overly centralized and, because of the lack
of coordination, often duplicate rather than complement each other. The biggest poverty oriented program, providing
subsidies for electricity and cooking gas (LPG), account for about 2 percent of the GDP but reach less than a quarter of
the poor. Government social sector expenditures, equivalent to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1990, are low by LAC standards.
Scarcity of public funds to adequately finance the whole range of social programs has led to outlays on education, health,
water and sanitation, and rural development that lag behind others in Latin America. Moreover, public programs
generally have not significantly affected the overall welfare or opportunities of the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
population. To address this a government Secretariat specifically dedicated to the needs of the indigenous was formed in
1994 but it had a very modest program and virtually no impact. Recently, this Secretariat has been replaced by a Council
to pursue similar goals but with indigenous leadership at the helm.
State policy regarding indigenous peoples has not yet been clearly defined and has numerous ambiguities, but certain
general trends may be distinguished. First, since the creation of Ecuador in 1830 following its separation from Gran
Colombia, attempts have been made to integrate indigenous peoples into the general society by promoting acculturation;
but on various occasions types of social exclusion have been maintained, such as limitations on collective indigenous
private property, the exercise of their right to citizenship (for example, by not allowing illiterate persons to vote or be
elected) and of their rights to own land and maintain their own forms of government. Since the 1980s, there has been a
gradual change towards a gradual openness to the interests and demands of indigenous peoples. The National
Constitution has accepted the fact that Ecuador is a pluri-cultural country, and much progress has been made in
acknowledging indigenous rights to land, although agrarian legislation has many gaps. Bilingual education has been
legitimized, with autonomous management by indigenous organizations. Opportunities have been created for the training
and legal recognition of second- and third-tier organizations, from community associations to provincial federations and
regional and national organizations. Moreover, processes have definitely begun that will allow the inclusion of
indigenous peoples in national society, within the context of cultural diversity.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed project targets ethnicity: a dimension of poverty that spans the whole country. It articulates a new vision,
sometimes called ethno-development, which challenges the conventional approach to the misconceived Latin American
"Indian problem". This vision builds on the positive qualities of indigenous cultures and societies, including a sense of
ethriic identity, close attachments to ancestral land, and the capacity to mobilize labor, capital, and other resources to
promote local employment and growth. The willingness of the Ecuadorian government and the society to follow this
vision offers an opportunity to address sectoral issues of overly centralized programs, lack of indigenous assets includinlg
land, and lack of labor intensive growth among the poorest.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Support for an agricultural project covering indigenous communities is rejected because it would not develop the
indigenous peoples' access to the vibrant off-farm rural sector nor fully utilize and develop the indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian organizations. A full-fledged land project or a fiscal decentralization effort to address broad-based rural
growth is considered premature given the present institutional structure and government's inability to undertake
sweeping changes.
The idea of a Technical Assistance project, consisting of supporting the elaboration of a selected program of legal
reforms and institutional strengthening activities aimed at indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations, was considered.
However, taking into account the poor performance record of TA projects in general and given the insistence of the
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations on self-management as a principal element of the notion of ethno-
development, this idea was rejected. Consequently, the project has been designed as an investment operation with
substantial institutional strengthening activities, allowing indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations to fully
participate in all stages of the sub-project cycle.

At first, when the interest that th e project would awaken among indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples was still
unknown, the possibility of working only with several organizations was considered. However, it was always thought
that CONAIE's participation (the most powerful national indigenous organization), or at least its non-opposition, was
vital. Fortunately, all national indigenous organizations, grouped in the Comiti del Decenio, formally decided to
cooperate with the project.
As an alternative to strengthening public institutions, consideration was given to the possibility of focusing solely on the
issue of state policies dealing with indigenous peoples, through which existing policy trends would be studied in greater
depth and recommendations would be made on the types of policies to be followed in the future. Nevertheless, the
creation of CONPLADE-IN, in response to demands by indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples, and assigning it the
duties of state policy formulation, planning, coordination and execution of development activities, has allowed the
component to expand, including support to CONPLADE-IN. Moreover, the alternative of not supporting other state
agencies is not a viable one because their collaboration is needed for the execution of other project components. In any
case, strengthening is carried out only for specific issues and insofar as these institutions support the achievement of
project goals and objectives.
9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned).
Early Bank-financed interventions to tackle poverty were agriculture related, for example, in livestock development,
fisheries, seeds improvement, agricultural credit, and irrigation. In the 1980s, area-based integrated rural development
projects (with land titling and economic infrastructure components) were added to the portfolio of interventions. The
ongoing Rural Development Project (Loan 3390-EC) is a project of this type with some coverage of indigenous
communities. IDB's projects continue to address agricultural sectoral issues particularly in irrigation management. In
land management, USAID had financed a small land cadastre pilot which has not been followed up due to high costs per
hectare. To meet the social infrastructure needs of the poor, the Bank with IDB assisted with financing and technic.al
assistance in the creation of FISE, a social fund which has been replenished with IDB and CAF funds recently. In
addition, Bank-financed ongoing projects, First Social Development Project and FASBASE, addresses basic education
including bilingual education (in the urban areas), and basic health services to the poor. IDB also has an ongoing basic
education project (in the rural areas), PROMECEB. IFAD strategy in Ecuador addresses rural poverty by directly
targeting the economic situation specific to each social stratum of rural poor. Early IFAD projects in Ecuador identified three
programme areas of intervention according to the different assets and income sources of the rural famnilies: (i) fann
activities for households with sufficient land; (ii) non-farm income generating activities for households with insufficient land
based on rural linkages; and (iii) land reform and titling.
This strategy has been implemented in the two IFAD projects funded so far: (i) Upper Basin of the Caniar River Rural
Development Project; and (ii) the Saraguro-Yacuambi Rural Development Project. These projects have had in common
the active participation of stakeholders in the design and implementation of the project; the provision of rural financial
services; the promotion and consolidation of peasant organizations to ensure the efficient provision of social and
production support services, and the provision of innovative technological packages in order to promote and raise the
productive development of rural holdings while maintaining local cultural traditions.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Policy Framework. Experience in Ecuador and elsewhere indicates that rural development projects have greater
opportunities for success when they incorporate components addressing the need to improve the policy environment, to
strengthen social organizations and to improve their access to assets and services. Policies regarding indigenous peo)les
rights are to be encouraged because traditionally in Latin America there have been legal and institutional barriers for
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples.
Institutional Strengthening. Building social capital is a basic condition of socioeconomic development in general. The
adoption of change requires education and training as well as mechanisms for mass diffusion, and the participation of

social organizations is essential for the spread of innovations. Although indigenous peoples in Ecuador have achieved a
relatively high degree of organization, their technical capacity needs to be developed, particularly their ability to design,
implement and evaluate community development projects. Strengthening of public organizations will be restricted to
three key institutions, i.e. CONPLADE-IN, INDA, and INEFAN consisting of technical assistance and training, support
for the maintenance of data bases and some equipment. Because increased bureaucracy is resisted not only by the Bank
but by indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations as well, the increase in staff in public institutions would be minimal.
Support to Land and Water Regularization. Land and water rights are an immensely political matter. When a program
involves some redistribution of rights, political opposition is likely to be intense unless compensation to those
relinquishing those rights is considerable. The complexity of the land titling process has often been underestimated.
Efforts in this field require considerable resources to institutional development so there are sufficient technical and
human capacities available for efficient project implementation.
Rural Investments. Besides an adequate policy framework and a good base of social capital, poor people need to have
access to the factors of production, including the physical means (land and water) as well as financial and technical
resources. Therefore, the project includes a component of rural investments oriented primarily to improve small farmer
and artisans production, processing and marketing. Investments with a predominantly public goods character would be
financed through matching grants, while investments with a predominantly private goods character would be financed
through credit, thereby enabling the project to respond to a wide range of demands.
Matching Grants, Bank's regional experience in demand-driven investments stresses the following lessons. First,
encouraging the active involvement of community groups, subprojects are much more likely to meet the community's
needs than if they were chosen to reflect the priorities of a government agency. Second, once the communities developed
a sense of ownership of a subproject, they are more willing and interested in sharing its costs and ensuring its
maintenance. Third, once a community is given responsibility for implementing a subproject that it helped to choose and
prepare, it has a great interest in ensuring that the private contractor executing the project does it wvell and honestly.
Demand-driven subprojects could have potentially conflicting objectives. These are: (i) poverty targeting versus
economic imperatives; (ii) demand-driven subprojects versus feasibility and sustainability; and (iii) efficiency and
accountability versus poverty targeting. The project design and corresponding Operating Manual reflect these lessons in
the following manner: (i) subprojects would be identified through a participatory planning process conducted at the local
level, based on the methodology developed during the pilot project phase; (ii) indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
organizations as well as officials of CONPLADE-IN would be trained in relevant subject matter, incltudinig proctiieiment
and have to meet minimum institutional eligibility criteria; (iii) subprojects have to comply with minimum economlic
eligibility criteria, while financial ceilings per family, ha or any other relevant unit should avoid the financing of
overdimensioned subprojects; (iv) a widely disseminated publicity campaign should ensure transparency and proper
knowledge of the program's objectives and rules of the game by all stakeholders; and (v) technical assistance would be
available to accompany implementation of subprojects.
Savings and Credit. This subcomponent will be entirely financed and supervised by IFAD; its performance will not be
included in the Bank's rating system for loan supervision. The proposed project is consistent with IFAD rural poverty
alleviation strategy and micro-finance Plan of Action which states that "under a variety of conditions, the poor are indeed
'bankable,' even in the face of great adversity." Credit and deposit services properly managed to protect participants can
contribute to their economic and social advancement. Building on IFAD best practice on rural financial services, the
proposed project would attempt to effectively and efficiently: (i) assess costs and risks; (ii) emphasize responsive service
structures by placing a strong emphasis on client demand and beneficiary participation during project planning and
implementation; (iii) protect client's interests; (iv) improve borrower screening and loan appraisal; and (v) build on
existing institutional potential. The credit component is used as a mechanism to develop human and social capital bv
creating awareness among the target population about the benefits of using credit, obtained under market conditions, as a
tool for community development. The proposed project recognizes that lack of access to credit and savings services is
only one of the multi handicaps suffered by small and poor producers, and financial services in isolation are not enough
in themselves to advance the development of the rural poor who have a wide range of other needs that are
complementary. Therefore, the project would provide links to wholesale financial services, improve the competitive

resources), technical training, transportation networks and raw materials, as well as an enabling regulatory environment.
Objectives, procedures and eligibility criteria of the credit subcomponent will be reflected in a separate Operational
Manual.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
In response to fruitful dialogues with indigenous leaders, the Government through Presidential Decree created a
Ministerial-level council (CONPLADE-IN) to oversee indigenous and afro-ecuadorian development whose leadership
would come from the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities. In the Ecuadorian society, in general, the need for
targeted efforts to address indigenous and afro-ecuadorian development has been acknowledged. The commitment of the
current Government is demonstrated, among other, by its willingness to borrow resources (PPF) to finance project
preparation. Besides commitment from the borrower, it is also important to note that the participatory preparation
process has created a great sense of ownership among the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations. They consider
the project as theirs rather than a government project for indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples.
12. Value added of Bank support:
As the principal institution engaged in a sustained, long-term partnership with the Ecuadorian Government to address
poverty issues, the Bank is particularly well placed to support this innovative approach of tackling poverty through the
ethnicity dimension. The Bank has been able to establish trust with both the Government and the indigenous
communities and their organizations. Subsequently, by bringing in its international experience of land issues, funds for
economic activities, and institutional development, the Bank would ensure the highest quality of project implementation,
and impact on poverty reduction.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments
13. Economic Assessment (see        [  Cost-Benefit Analysis:           [X] Cost          [   Other
Annex 4):                               NPV=US$ 47.5 million;                Effectiveness     [Specify]
ERR=38.5% for subprojects           Analysis
Financial and Economic analyses have been finalized for the Rural Investments component (53 percent of project costs).
Essentially the soundness of the overall analysis is based on the principle of community demand determining priorities:
the beneficiaries know best how to use scarce resources to satisfy their needs. To elicit community demand properly
which will limit narrow and vested self-interests, a participatory planning exercise will be used (a complete description of
the participatory planning exercise is available in the annex on the Rural Investments component). Given the importance
of this participatory planning exercise, a pilot was carried out in seven provinces, involving 22 OSGs, and the results
were used to prepare a detailed financial and economic analyses of selected subprojects. The analyses, conducted by the
Food and Agriculture Organization-Cooperative Program (FAO-CP)3, evaluated models of 28 subprojects which the
communities had chosen during the pilot participatory planning exercise. The models, which are differentiated by
ecological region, have helped to define investment parameters of sound subprojects. The results of the analyses show a
wide range of economic and financial rates of return, ranging from 13 to 152 percent. It appears that the beneficiaries do
not prioritize by rate of return alone, but take also other factors, such as equity and institutional sustainability, into
consideration. The analyses of the 28 models were combined resulting in the following weighted averages: Economic
Rate of Return (ERR): 38.5 percent; Financial Rate of Return: 34.8 percent.

development program to help the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian poor even after any conceivable regulatory or
pricing policy changes. Moreover, because of the poverty focus, public provision of the project would actually
improve the overall quality of the public investment program. Furthermnore, assuming the distortionary cost from
taxation to be in the twenty to thirty percent range, we estimate the project to have a positive net present value mainly
because so little has been invested in these communities and because the beneficiaries are identifying the
opportunities themselves.
During implementation GOE would contribute US$6.0 million of which US$1.9 million would be covered through
recuperation of income and sales taxes. At completion, the project is expected to generate annual incremental
recurrent costs, totaling approximately US$500,000 per year.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)
* Advances of the loan funds will be deposited in a special account at the Central Bank of Ecuador or a commercial
bank4. Upon approval by the Project Management Unit, disbursements are made to public agencies for goods,
services and works as specified in the corresponding cooperation agreements and to consultants, contractors, NGOs,
and second and third tier indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations for purposes specified in management
services contracts within the overall context of the Annual Operating Plan. Disbursements for community
subprojects financed though matching grants and costing less than US$25,000 would be approved by CONPLADE-
IN's Regional Offices.
* The disbursement mechanism for the credit component (financed by IFAD) will be as follows: advances of the loan
funds will be deposited by the financiers of the project in the Central Bank of Ecuador. GOE will transfer these funds
to second-tier or wholesale, private sector financial intermediary institutions. These institutions will on-lend to first-
tier institutions, and through the first-tier institutions, credit will be granted to the project's target population. The
second-tier institutions will be responsible for: administering the funds; qualifying and categorizing the first-tier,
retail financial intermediaries; analyzing the level of institutional development and preparedness of the first-tier
institutions in order to establish appropriate lines of credit; providing institutional strengthening and training to the
first-tier institutions where necessary; coordinating the periodic evaluations, including annual external audits, of tle
operations and financial status of these retail institutions.
15. Technical Assessment:
* A detailed indigenous poverty map, elaborated by the Technical Secretariat of the Frente Social forms the basis of
the project's beneficiary targeting mechanism.
*  The methodology of the participatory planning process to identify and prioritize subprojects reflecting the needs of
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities was developed and verified in a pilot project which was implemented
during the project preparation process.
*  Detailed farm models confirm the feasibility of typical subprojects to be financed under the project.
* Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and the use of unit costs simplifies subproject preparation
and evaluation, and facilitates the procurement of goods and works.
* Training activities aimed at institutional strengthening of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations were
identified, developed, and identified in a pilot project.
* The methodology for land regularization activities to be financed under the project builds on innovative and proven
approaches developed by several NGOs in the recent past.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: CONPLADE-IN is a ministerial level public institution, ascribed to the Presidency of the
Republic. It is ruled by a Council headed by the Secretario General de la Administraci6n, where indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian representatives are the majority. Its functions are to formulate policies, plan, coordinate and implement the
development of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples. Although CONPLADE-IN was created by Presidential Decree
on March 13, 1997, replacing two former competing entities ofthe government, its perfornance to date is positive as

demonstrated by the agility with which it has processed existing project preparation funds and implemented the IDF
capacity building program. The project will mostly be executed by CONPLADE-IN, which will enter into cooperation
agreements with other governmental and nongovermental organizations whenever necessary as mentioned in paragraph 4.
b. Project management: Under agreement with the main indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations of the country,
CONPLADE-IN has formed a Management Committee (Conitg de Gesti6n) and a Technical Unit, which are expected to
merge into a Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU will be in charge of day to day project operations, including
finances, contracting, procurement, field monitoring and supervision. The project implementation arrangements at the
subregional level contemplate the creation of subregional offices of CONPLADE-IN, which, with representatives of
second-tier indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations, will set priorities and prepare annual operating plans and to
approve subprojects for community investments to be carried out.
c. Indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations: The indigenous population of Ecuador is highly organized. At
community level, 2,325 grassroots organizations have been formed (communes, centers and cooperatives). These in turn
have formed 160 second-tier organizations (OSGs) that have various names (association, union, federation) and are
frequently affiliated with provincial, regional and national organizations, culminating in a coordinating organizations
such as the Comite del Decenio and Consejo de Nacionalidades Indigenas. The communities are formally recognized
under the Ley de Organizaci6n y Regimen Comunal, and entered in a Register managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Alternatively, organizations can obtain juridical status by registering themselves in the Direcci6n de Asesoria Juridica of
the Ministry of Social Welfare. With organization has come a great ability for social mobilization. As a result,
indigenous - and to a lesser extent afro-ecuadorian - peoples can no longer be relegated as they once were and are being
taken into consideration in matters of public decision-making. Moreover, their participation in politics has allowed them
to achieve positions of representation in several local and regional governments, in the National Congress and in several
Executive-branch agencies, as in the case of CONPLADE-IN.
d. NGOs: The term NGO is most commonly used to refer to developmental intermediary organizations that worlk with
and channel resources to the poor, but do not represent them. They include voluntary organizations with a charitable
focus as well as research and advocacy organizations. Various sources estimate their number between 500 and 600,
although no complete lists of surveys of intermediary NGOs in Ecuador exist. They have become increasingly important
actors in basic service provision and poverty alleviation in Ecuador. Where indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership
organizations lack institutional capacity, NGOs could act as sponsoring agencies for the identification, preparation, and
implementation of rural community investments. In order to ensure learning-by doing the project would stimulate the
formation of partnerships between NGOs and indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations in such cases.
Under the project, NGOs might also play an important role in the implementation of land regularization activities.
Furthermore, CONPLADE-IN would contract eligible NGOs to carry out institutional strengthening activities of
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations.
17. Social Assessment:
Social assessment has consisted in the identification of stakeholders both at the institutional level (governmental and
nongovernmental organizations) and at the level of social organizations (indians, afro-ecuadorians and other rural social
actors). During the design process, it has promoted stakeholder participation at all levels, especially of the beneficiaries.
Thus, it has held innumerable consultation meetings with indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples organizations,
including field visits, and three national level workshops with the participation of representatives of beneficiary
organizations as well as of governmental and non-governmental organizations. In addition, it has carried out two key
pilot activities: (i) a participatory planning program, with 22 OSGs and 7 NGOs, by which beneficiary demands have
been gathered in 141 project profiles and 51 full proposals, and (ii) a participatory training program, with 70 OSGs, and 3
NGOs, which have trained 80 representatives of beneficiary organizations in 12 teaching modules. Based on studies
carried out by consultants and workshops to disseminate and validate findings, it has made a detailed assessment of the
beneficiary or target population, which is estimated to be 815,000 people in areas where indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
people predominate. Possible social impacts have also been analyzed and special efforts made to reduce adverse ones
(for instance paternalistic tendencies and excessive centralization) and to enhance positive ones (for instance, community
self reliance and solidarity). The design of the project ensures that subproject implementation and the implementation of

20. Sustainability:
*  The sustainability of this project is assured, first, by the fact that it responds to issues that have been for a long time a
priority on the agenda of development of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples of Ecuador. Project design reflects
their demands. Second, as a consequence of the previous point, the project has been largely appropriated by the
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian beneficiaries and by the government, since the former are highly represented in the
latter. Finally, its long term duration is covered by the focus on an enabling policy environment and building local
peoples capacity for development based on their own perspectives and relying on their own resources.
*  Factors favoringthie sustainability of subprojects financed under the project include: (i) high degree of participation
by communities in identification, preparation, contracting, and implementation; and (ii) required counterpart
contribution by beneficiaries.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
*  The project targeting mechanism, with its focus on indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples, might create some
controversies with other groups which are excluded. However, by concentrating project activities in parroquias
which are predominantly indigenous or afro-ecuadorian and by executing project activities through local membership
organizations, the potential impact of these controversies is likely to be minimal.
*  The joint decision making participatory model of the project would not necessarily be acceptable to the next
Government, which will be elected in 1998. The potential impact of reversing the approach could be significant as
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations would not easily accept changes as the model is the outcome of a long
negotiation process.

ECUADOR: INDIGENOUS AND AFRO-ECUADORIAN PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Project Component I - Strengthening of Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian Peoples Organizations
US$8.1 million (total cost of component)
1. Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian Peoples
Target population
The project is focused on approximately 815,000 persons of indigenous and afio-ecuadorian origin
settled in rural areas of Ecuador. The definition of the termn "indigenous" is based upon self-identification, a
person's membership in a specific community or grassroots level organizations acknowledged as indigenous, and
his acceptance as such by members of that sociocultural unit. The definition of the term "afro-ecuadorian" is
based upon self-identification and a person's membership in a community acknowledged as afro-ecuadorian.
The indigenous and afro-ecuadorian population of Ecuador is concentrated in 48 cantons, which in turn
contain 288 rural parroquias (226 indigenous and 58 afro-ecuadorian), representing 29 percent of the counltry's
total rural parroquias. However, in nearly all cases, indigenous and afro-ecuadorian people live in areas where
there is also a mestizo and white population; therefore, the percentages of the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
population in these parroquias vary. The population of these groups is greater than 50 percent in 150 parroquias
(of which  11 are indigenous and 39 are afro-ecuadorian).
The target population exhibits great cultural diversity, especially among indigenous peoples. Tlue ieosi
numerous people are the Runa, Quichua speakers, in the Sierra which may be subdivided by areas of ethnic
predominance, thus including in the north the Otavalo, Carangui, Cayambi and Quito; and in the central-south
region the Panzaleo, Puruha, Caflari, Salasaca and Saraguro. Next in numbers of population are the peoples of
the Amazon region, which includes the Shuar, Achuar, Runa, Quichua speakers of the lowlands, Huaorani, Cofin
and Siona-Secoya. Finally, in the Costa are found the Awa, Embera, Tsachila, Chachi and peoples who have lost
their language but retain strong indigenous cultural features such as the Huancavilca, Manteffo and Puna.
Distinctive features of indigenous peoples, besides language, include solidarity and social unity, which
are evidenced in strong forms of social organization, a relatively defined geographical concentration, as well as a
rich cultural patrimony and the practice of uses and customs that distinguish them from a national society whose
cultural patterns bear a strong western influence.

Social Organization
The indigenous population of Ecuador is highly organized. Organizations formed along ethnic lines lhave
their origins in the original peoples who inhabited this territory even before it was incorporated into the Inca
Empire, where they were certainly recognized. During colonial times, after some initial attempts to atomize and
destroy them, ethnic-community based organizations were in fact used by the Spaniards as vehicles for the
extraction of taxes and labor. Since Ecuador's independence, these organizations were known either as senorios,
capitanias orparcialidades indigenas. They were formally recognized and called comunas in 1937 with the
approval of the Ley de Organizaci6n y Regimen Comunal. The application of the Ley de Reforma Agraria in
1964 and subsequent reforms in 1973 pronounced the presence of comunas in the Ecuadorian society. Originally
comunas managed jointly held land resources but in recent years there is a tendency for individualization.
However, labor contributions for community enterprises, especially small infrastructure works are still common
(mingas).
At community level, 2,325 grassroots organizations have been formed (communes, centers and
cooperatives). These in turn have formed 160 second-tier organizations (OSGs) that have various names
(association, union, federation) and are frequently affiliated with provincial, regional and national organizations.
Grassroots indigenous organizations are distinguished by a set of features: their members' sense of
belonging to a community, communal territoriality, their own system of government and the practice of
solidarity through collective works, joint celebrations and communal calendars, among other things.

Country: Ecuador                                        Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project
The afro-ecuadorian population has a lesser degree of organization than that of indigenous peoples. Its
main organization is a community or grassroots one (commune, compound, cooperative, committee, union) and
it has recently begun to form more complex organizations. The main features of afro-ecuadorian grassroots
organizations are: a sense of belonging, a recognizable territoriality, certain forms of self-government and
calendars of celebrations. More than community societies, afro-ecuadorian grassroots organizations are real or
ascribed family networks.
The beneficiaries of this project are members of grassroots community organizations which in turn have
associated themselves with OSGs. This project will work mainly with communities, OSGs, and apex
organizations, including the Consejo de Nacionalidades Indigenas and Comite del Decenio. The community is
considered the basic form of social organization whose legal capacity is recognized by the state, and as the
nucleus of cultural and social reproduction for indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples. At the operational level,
work with the OSG is favored because: (i) it brings grassroots organizations together; (ii) it brings together the
political and technical class of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples with significant experience and
management capacity for development; (iii) it works on a microregional scope, a broader field than the
community one but at the same time suited to the organizations' institutional capacity, and allows for social
coordination; and (iv) it has demonstrated the ability to work not only on political but also economic aspects
which are generally faced by third-tier organizations.
Moreover, work with the apex organizations is favored because they facilitate the participation of
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations, negotiations with the government and other social organizations,
the overall design of the project and the adoption of general strategies.
Potential and Limitations
In characterizing the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian population, one should not only mention the
limitations or problems that need to be addressed so that these peoples can achieve better living standards, but
also the existing potential that will contribute to the project's success; among these is the fact that indigenous and
afro-ecuadorian peoples, despite their very diversity, constitute one of the country's relatively more homogenous
sectors; the existence of significant natural resources in their respective territories (land, water, forests, etc.); and
their great organizational capacity and social capital, especially that of indigenous peoples. Additional key
elements could include: the decision to assume the challenges of development, especially of improving their
management capacity; traditional knowledge; their capacity for negotiation and reaching agreement; and the
collective culture and identity of both indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples.
The development potential of these peoples is very high. At individual and family level, there is a great
potential for improving the quality of life and developing human capital; at the level of social organizations and
networks, there is a great potential for management and organizational culture; and on a broader level, there is a
great potential for reconfiguring the civic/social scope and changing social norms. However, it is also true that in
socioeconomic terms indigenous and afro-ecuadorian populations have suffered the consequences of social
exclusion and are at disadvantage in Ecuadorian society. Thus, in 1994, 83 percent of the rural indigenous
population lived in indigenous villages, and 81 percent of afro-ecuadorians who lived in predominantly afro-
ecuadorian areas were below the poverty line (per capita consumption less than S/45,466). In terms of unmet
basic needs, both the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian populations had higher rates than the rest of the population,
in at least 6 of the 10 indicators selected, particularly with respect to lack of electricity, sewage disposal and
availability of bathrooms and sanitary services.

2. Basic Characteristics of Development with Identity
The view of development among the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples of Ecuador has been
formulated by taking theoretical elements from the Latin American school of ethno-development and as a result
of their own experience in the context of national society. Until around 1990, the indigenous perspective
revolved around four fundamental ethno-development propositions: (i) strengthening of one's own culture, (ii)
identity as a people, (iii) self-determination and territoriality, and (iv) self-management.
In recent years, however, this perspective has been revisited on the following terms:
a) Inter-culturalism: Stemming from the need to strengthen one's own culture in order to have a clear identity
as a people, it is considered necessary to "build a bridge of communication with mnestizo culture."
b) Political economy and co-management: The principle of self-determination of peoples and territoriality has
progressed to one of political autonomy, understood as being synonymous with decentralization in public
administration and resource management, and to indigenous representation at national level.
c) A "viable" development model: While insistence was previously made on the need for a suitable
development model, there now exists the possibility of assuming elements of exogenous models, including
project management and evaluation, new technologies and socioeconomic growth objectives, and the
participation of multiple actors in the process.
d) Generation of coordinated state policies: Confrontation has gradually given way to coordination, and short-
term measures have given way to the adoption of long-term policies. One example is the case of bilingual
education which has four general features: (i) the state delegates the management of education to indigenous
organizations; (ii) the government provides the operating funds; (iii) it has a long-term period of effectiveness;
and (iv) teaching in native languages, as well as bilingualism and inter-culturalism, are institutionalized so as to
ensure communication with society in general.
e) Prposal on a national scope: The new indigenous and afro-ecuadorian proposals are relevant for society as
a whole as well as for the state. This change stems from the realization by indigenous and afro-ecuador ian
organizations that changes in favor of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples are not possible without
coordination with non-indigenous peoples and that indigenous and afro-ecuadorian proposals may be beneficial
for non-indigenous societies provided they contribute to the construction of an alternative, civilizing proposal.
f) Redefinition of identity: The original proposal defining the term "indigenous" as an individual's
membership in a specific ethnic group has led to a more flexible approach that keeps the idea of one's
membership in an ethnic group but also defines Indian-ness in terms of an indigenous-peasant continuum and
acknowledges the existence of indigenous persons who do not belong to a specific ethnic group and do not
exhibit ancestral symbols of identity.
3. Description of Project Activities
The objective of the project component is to strengthen the capacity of second and third tier
organizations to participate in the formulation of state policies, participate actively in development projects
focused on the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian sectors of the population, and carry out their specific functions,
especially the promotion of inter-culturalism, representation in external agencies, technical assistance to
grassroots organizations, and provision of services.
Technical assistance and support to the functioning of key organizations and communities
Support for the organizational process will include activities aimed at legal recognition of the types of
organization of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples and the concerted search for appropriate institutional
schemes aimed at self-managed development. Technical assistance to OSGs will cbntinue the activities started
under the Pilot Project for Participatory Planning, and one of its objectives will be to create and/or strengthen
liaisons between OSGs and communities, and between communities and local NGOs. This activity will also
involve timely support for the operation of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations that collaborate with

Country: Ecuador                                        Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadonan Peoples Development Project
specific aspects and help to comply with project objectives; for example, the preparation of Local Development
Plans, preparation of project proposals (pre-investment), and the execution of community development projects
(investment). The organizations contemplated are second-tier organizations (OSGs), regional organizations, and
the highest coordinating bodies created by indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations. The types of support
will meet the demand identified for participatory planning and project needs; but there will also be financial
resources available for the creation or strengthening of technical units through the purchase of computers and
basic office equipment and assistance for hiring of technical staff.
Revitalization of peoples at risk
Support will also be included for the revitalization of at-risk indigenous peoples, defined as those who,
due to their small numbers and disadvantaged status, are in danger of extinction; among these are the Huaorani,
Siona-Secoya, Cofan, Chachi, Tsachila, Embera and Awa. This program will be of a comprehensive nature,
since it is believed necessary to not only support the organizational process for development in terms of its initial
operation and compliance with activities allowing them to become consolidated as representative agencies
dealing with service and ethnic demands. Specifically, there will be a tendency toward validating existing data in
the field and formulating, with the full participation of interested peoples and the aid of specialized staff, an
emerging service plan that covers organizational aspects, defense of the land, cultural demands, natural resource
management and basic services, followed by implementation of such plans.
Education and training
Education/technical training will be carried out using traditional methodologies as well as workshops,
short courses and seminars, and through the methodology of distance education and with the participation of
specialized educational agencies. The first of these will be based on existing methodological experiences,
especially from training projects recently carried out with World Bank support. Training issues will be
established based upon demand expressed in pilot training and participatory planning projects.
There will be two types of education: a high school equivalency program, taught by specialized agencies,
for persons selected by OSGs participating in the project, and a college degree program in community
management and development, aimed at persons selected by regional organizations to support the process of
community-level project preparation and management.
Prior to the formalization of contracts with educational institutions that may eventually be selected,
agreement will be reached on the teaching modules that are of direct interest to the project; for example, the
project cycle, participatory management in community development, and specific technical aspects stemming
from the demand for investment activities (microenterprises, natural resource management, etc.).
As a complement to the above activities, support will be given to selected regional organizations and
OSGs so that they can form technical units. They will receive on-the-job training, based on the system of
"hands-on learning," to complement theoretical training through field practice of issues studied, particularly the
management of community development projects. Finally, this activity will also establish relationships of
cooperation with other local and international agencies interested in the formation of human and social capital
among indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples.
To support the implementation of the land regularization program and other components, the project
would finance training of legal assistants (paralegales), who will subsequently work with indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian organizations. The training program would include: (i) land tenure issues; (ii) community
management; (iii) environmental issues; (iv) biodiversity; (v) ecotourism etc. Eligibility criteria for training
participants include: (i) academic criteria: able to read and write in spanish; (ii) community involvement: active
in community based organizations from the area; and (iii) personal skills and motivation. Training modules
would follow the methodology established by CARE-Ecuador.

Cultural Patrimony
In accordance to the strategy of development with identity, there will be a series of activities designed to rescue
and strengthen the rich cultural patrimony of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples of Ecuador. They include
the identification and promotion of archeological and ritual sites, support for indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
peoples festivities, the preparation of audiovisual documents with ethnographic materials, contests to strengthen
living heritage and traditions (including traditional arts, handicrafts, cooking, games, etc.) events to discuss the
topic of development with identity, inter-cultural fairs; and publications of works produced by indigenous and
afro-ecuadorian authors. For the successful implementation of this subcomponent, the project will require the
full involvement of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples in all project sites and the collaboration of
governmental organizations such as the National Institute of Cultural Patrimony, the Casa de la Cultura
Ecuatoriana, key provincial and municipal governments as well as NGOs and the private sector. Selection and
implementation of this component will follow procedures included in the Operational Manual.
Expected results
The component is expected to have the following results after four years of implementation:
*  A coordinating agency, three regional organizations, five sub-regional organizations and 48 OSGs operating
efficiently.
*  Seven at-risk ethnic groups whose identity, organization and territorial protection and management have
been strengthened.
*  Persons from 150 OSGs trained in the participatory planning, design and execution of productive projects.
-  178 Local development plans elaborated.
-  90 Management and development graduates committed to OSGs to promote local development and assist
organizations in the preparation of final project designs.
* 240 OSG leaders and promoters obtain their high-school equivalency, aimed at development, and are
committed to community work and assist community organizations in the preparation of project outlines and
designs.
*  Leaders of regional organizations receive training in the preparation of projects, programs, proposals for new
laws, state policies and practices for the development of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples.
*  Seven archeological and ritual sites are identified and revitalized.
*  Traditional festivities of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples supported in seven intercultural areas (four
per area). Preference given to participation in on-going activities and to the promotion of cultural events that
do not have negative effects on people's health and well being.
*  Audiovisual documenting 13 indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples and 7 themes of key importance to the
beneficiaries.
*  Traditional cultural manifestations of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples incentivated by promoting
1 00 contests in areas such as poetry, music, dance, cooking, and games.
*  The concept of development with identity has discussed and further elaborated in 10 special events.
*  Pluricultural fairs organized in two occasions, promoting greater tolerance of cultural diversity in the
country.
*  After organizing 4 contests, the written works of indigenous and/or afro-ecuadorian peoples are published by
the project.

4. Institutional Arrangements for Implementing the Component
CONPLADE-IN will implement this component in close coordination with indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian organizations. Legal and technical support to the organizations will be provided through a team of
consultants hired, based on consultations with the project's beneficiary organizations and key government
agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Social Welfare, will seek the most appropriate
mechanisms to achieve the legal recognition of those organizations and communities which lack it or which want
to change their legal status.
Support for participatory planning and the creation/strengthening of technical staff, preferably in regional
organizations, will be provided through regional organizations having an ethnic focus: ECUARUNARI in the
Sierra, CONFENIAE in the Amazon region, and COISE in the Costa. These organizations will lead the process
and, for matters of timely action, will hire the technical assistance of individual consultants or NGOs with proven
experience in working with these peoples and which are accepted by the beneficiaries.
Training will also be conducted by NGOs with experience in participatory training processes. The
modules developed both by the Indigenous Training Program for Community Development, financed by a World
Bank IDF grant, and by the Pilot Training Program carried out by the Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian Peoples
Development Project, will serve as the basis for preparing this activity. The main emphasis of training will be
the management of development from the viewpoint of Ecuador's indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples.
Formal, compensatory, distance education, both at high school and university level, will be carried out
through contracts with suitable secondary and higher educational institutions, some of which have already been
identified and contacted by the local project preparation team.
Cultural Patrimony activities will be carried out through contracts with indigenous and afro-ecuador ian
organizations and/or collaborative agreements with specialized government agencies or NGOs, taking into
consideration the need to involve specific ethnic groups as well as the legal functions and comparative advantage
of the agencies.

US$5.5 million (total cost of component)
Land Distribution
Ecuador has a very unequal distribution of land ownership. In the Sierra region, farmns consisting of 0-5
ha include 80.2% of all farms, occupying 14.1 % of total lands. In contrast, the 1.6% farms over 100 ha include a
total of 42.9% of all lands. A similar pattern is found is in the Costa region, where the Gini coefficient for land
owned is 0.89; which equals the corresponding figure for the Sierra region. Access to land is closely linked to
living standards in rural Ecuador. Households with lower per capita landholdings are at high risk of poverty and
are highly represented among the extreme poor.
The evolution of Ecuador's agrarian structure has taken place in three distinguished periods: (i) prior to
the 1960s, landownership was concentrated in haciendas, depending on labor provided by workers in exchange
for small portions of land for their own subsistence (huasipungo); (ii) from 1964-79, the State, through the
Instituto Ecuatoriano de Reforma Agraria y Colonizaci6n (IERAC) under two Agrarian Reform Laws (1964,
1973) directly intervened in order to eliminate the existing pre-capitalist mode of production, including
precarious forms of land tenure, and the excesses of the huasipungo system; and (iii) from the 1980s onwards, a
gradual shift towards a market-based mechanism for the allocation of land resources and an increasingly
narrowly defined role for direct State intervention within the legal framework of the Ley de Fomento y
Desarrollo Agropecuario (1979) and the Ley de Desarrollo Agrario in 1994.
Until its disappearance in 1994, IERAC has adjudicated approximately 6.7 million ha. Most of these
(53%) have been global adjudications to indigenous groups in the Amazon region, or titling of lands to settlers in
frontier regions (34%). In terms of transferring lands from the latifundio to the smallholder sector, the impact of
the state-led administrative land reform program, like in so many other countries, has been modest.

Indigenous Perspective
Attachment to the land is one of the most important determinants of the indigenous cultural identity.
Land is not seen as commodity which can be bought and sold in impersonal markets. Rather, in indigenous
cultures, the land contains sacred meanings and can not be separated from social relationships and individual
identity. The same holds true for trees, plants, animals, water and fish which are integral elements of the social
and spiritual, life as well. Despite this fundamental importance of land for indigenous cultures, indigenous
peoples face serious problems in obtaining official recognition of their customary land and territorial rights. At
the same time efforts of indigenous organizations have helped making some progress in this field in the 1960s
and 1970s. Indigenous organizations played an important role in the promulgation of the Agrarian Reforrn Laws
of 1964 which increased access of indigenous peoples to land through the expropriation of haciendas. Under
these laws, the huasipungo or feudal service tenure system, which obliged indigenous peoples to provide free
labor to hacienda owners in exchange for a piece of land to cover subsistence needs, was also progressively
abandoned. Indigenous organizations have also played an important role in off-setting the threat of massive

colonization of the agricultural frontier in the Amazon region. Their efforts have led to the granting of
communal land titles, which have protected existing indigenous territories from massive invasion. The most
visible example in this case has been the granting of a communal land title of 1,771,870 hectares to the Huaorani
people in 1990.
Indigenous organizations have successfully resisted attempts to completely phase-out active
interventions in the distribution of land by the State on behalf of disadvantaged groups. The latest attempt to
completely abandon state-led agrarian reform was in 1994. However, enormous pressure of the indigenous
movement forced the Government to amend the already approved Ley de Desarrollo Agrario and include a
clause which opens the possibility to expropriate agrarian properties in areas of high demographic pressure. The
agreed amendment also explicitly requires that the Government allocates resources to finance these
expropriations. Despite these provisions, the promulgation of the Ley de Fomento y Desarrollo Agropecuario in
1979 and the Ley de Desarrollo Agrario in 1994 signify a gradual shift towards a market-based mechanism for
the allocation of land resources and an increasingly narrowly defined role for state intervention.
It is against this background that indigenous organizations continue pursuing their land rights agenda,
which consist among other of the following elements:
* There is strong pressure to resolve second-generation land conflicts caused by earlier land reform efforts.
* There is a high demand for the titling and demarcation of indigenous territories to ensure property rights. As
part of a general interest to promote respect of cultural, historical, and social values of the different ethnic
groups involved in agricultural activities, there is a specific interest to avoid privatization of communal
lands.
* As indigenous territories often include protected areas, which are under the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian
Institute for Forests and Natural and Wildlife Areas (Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales y
de Vida Silvestre, INEFAN), indigenous organizations claim ownership of these areas or delegation of the
management of these areas to their member communities.
Land Market
There are indications that existing land market constraints hamper access of small farmers to land. These
include supply, demand, and transaction constraints. Regarding supply constraints, there is a strong pattern of
land market segmentation by both class and ethnicity, particularly in the Sierra. This pattern continued in the
market after the break-up of the haciendas. The growth of commercial agriculture and medium-size producers
also signifies increased competition for land between these two segments of the rural population. Although the
shift from grazing to cultivation in the high altitude areas is an option allowing smallholders to accumulate
necessary land, it comes at a high cost to the maintenance of the watershed. In contrast to the decreasing supply
of land available for smallholders, demand is increasing due to population growth and degradation of the existing
land base. Land pressure is resulting in further sub-divisions of existing holdings, more land rentals, and
cultivation of fragile humid lowlands and paramos. Lack of access to credit by smallholders, and indications that
land prices have moved beyond the productive capacity due to land speculation are other demand constraints
faced by smallholders. In terms of transaction constraints, the existence of both formal and customary property
systems is of importance. Only 50% of the properties have been included in the property register, while the
means to provide clear and unambiguous identification of holdings through a geo-referenced multi-purpose
cadastre do not exist. The customary property system, whether indigenous in origin or community-based,
operates under a different set of rules and logic to give legimitacy and security to land transfers within the
community. Given the high transaction costs in both time and money (notary costs, registry fees, traveling to
cantonal offices, land transfer taxes etc.) smallholders have little personal benefit to legalize land transfers in the
formal system.

Land Regularization
Legal Framework. The main laws applicable to land regularization are: (i) Agrarian Development Law,
Law No. 54 published in the Registro Oficial on June 14, 1994, as amended on August 15, 1994 (hereinafter AD
Law); (ii) Law of the Organization and Regime of the Agricultural Communities (coniunas campesinas), Law
000, published in the Registro Oficial on October 5, 1976 (hereinafter Coniunas Law); (iii) Law of Unoccupied
Lands (tierras baldias) and Colonization, Supreme Decree No. 2172 published in the Registro Oficial on
September 28, 1964 (hereinafter Tierras Baldias Law); and (iv) Forestry law and law for the conservation of
natural areas and wildlife, Law No. 74 published in the Registro Oficial on August 24, 1981 (FL) and Regulations
applicable to forest and natural and wildlife areas conservation, Executive Decree No. 1529 published in the
Registro Oficial on February 22, 1983 (FR).
Agrarian Development Institute. The Agrarian Development Institute (Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo
Agrario, INDA), established by article 23 of the AD Law, to replace the priory existing IERAC, is the institute
authorized to adjudicate State lands (mostly vacant or expropriated lands or those in possession of farmers for a
specified period of time). The AD Law authorizes INDA to issue titles under three different procedures, one
(article 36, Legalization) exclusively applicable to the indigenous communities and the other two applicable to
all citizens, including indigenous peoples (Articles 37, Adjudication, and Article 38, Other Adjudication). As to
the characteristics of the title issued/to be issued: (i) there is no limitation in the law as to the size of the plot by
areas, type of land or otherwise. It is restricted only to the size of the area being exploited; (ii) the title is subject
to all the usually required restrictions of agrarian reform titles such as continued exploitation in accordance with
the agreed work plan and such restrictions are also applicable to subsequent owners. On the other hand, under the
AD Law, the State guarantees the right to land ownership as recognized by the Ecuadorian Constitution. The
:Constitution recognizes the right to property (in general terms under article 63) provided that such property
fulfills a social function (funci6n social) and the right to land for productive purposes (article 66), further stating
that the policy of the State as to the structure of rural property will be geared to economic development, the
raising of the standard of living, and the redistribution of wealth and income; and (iii) the title could be
individual or communal. The Constitution does not contain specific provisions for communal property, but
contains a provision (under Section III Property) that the communal and cooperative production will be
promoted. The Comzmas Law provides under Article 17 that the use and work of the land can be done in any of
the following forms: individual, by family, cooperative, association, commune or company, provided thefimcion
social is achieved. The communal land allocated to communities legally established under the Comnunas Law
can be divided (in whole or in part) among its members by a resolution adopted in a two-thirds majority by the
General Assembly of the community (Article 22 of the AD Law). Requests for such partition are quite unusual.
The lands that INDA is authorized to adjudicate are vacant lands (tierras baldias) under the Tierras Baldias Law.
Pursuant to Article I of such law, vacant lands, and therefore as a matter of law, INDA's lands, are: (i) all lands
within the territory that are not owned by someone else; (ii) lands that revert to ownership by the State, (iii) lands
that remain uncultivated for 10 years (The AD Law, however, authorizes INDA to grant title to land to the
possessors/producers of lands after 5 years, as it is described below). INDA does not own the State's natural
areas within the jurisdiction of INEFAN. The legal division of responsibilities between both institutions is,
however, not well defined. An interinstitutional arrangement was reached between INDA and INEFAN
(Resoluci6n 001 described below) and will be improved for project purposes.
The procedures for the adjudication of lands are:
Legalization of indigenous lands (Article 36): Pursuant to the provisions of article 36 the State is to protect
INDA's lands which will be allocated for the development of the montubias (coastal peasants), indigenous
and afro-ecuadorian peoples and such lands will be granted through adjudication, free of charge, to the
communities and ethnic groups that have been in their ancestral possession. Stich adjudication can be done
subject to the conditions that: (i) the traditions, cultural life, and social organization of such peoples are
followed; and (ii) incorporating, in addition, under INDA's responsibilities, measures aimed at improving
their production systems, the ancestral technologies, recovering and diversifying the seeds and developing

other elements that would enable the indigenous groups to raise their standard of living. All the applicable
procedures and instruments to achieve the above, are to preserve the environment. The above described is
one of the few provisions in the national legislation where specific rights of the indigenous and other ethnic
groups to their ancestral lands and traditions are recognized.
*  Under Article 37 of the AD Lawv, INDA is authorized to grant title to lands to those in possession of the land
for an uninterrupted period of a minimum of 5 years, after payment of the applicable assessment price. The
exploitation of these lands also need to follow the approved work plan. This type of title cannot be granted
by INDA in respect of State forest or natural areas or in lands otherwise owned by INEFAN. It could be
applicable to lands expropriated by INDA from owners that were not utilizing the land in a manner that
would show that the social function was achieved. Article 17 of the AD Law states that the social function is
achieved when the land is in production and exploitation and the renewable natural resources are being
adequately preserved, the ecosystem is protected, and food for all Ecuadorians is guaranteed and excess is
generated for exports.
* Under Article 38 of the AD Law, INDA is authorized to issue titles to other land that INDA may own to
juridical persons, cooperatives, enterprises, indigenous communities, associations and organizations, for an
efficient production with a work plan that will not become a threat to the environment or the ecosystem. No
prior possession is required, it does not relate to ancestral rights, and a price is to be paid in cash for the land
so granted. Farmers, indigenous peoples, montubias and afro-ecuadorians are, however, granted a 10 year
period (with 2 years of grace) to repay.
Ecuadorian Institute for Forests and Natural and Wildlife Areas. Ecuadorian Institute for Forests and
Natural and Wildlife Areas (Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestaly de Areas Naturales y de Vida Silvestre (INEFAN)
created by Law No. 8 of September 14, 1992 (the INEFAN Law) owns, under Article 12 (a) (c) and (d) of the
INEFAN Law, the national forest patrimonium (Patrimonio Forestal del Estado) and the protected areas
(Patrimonio de Areas Naturales). The Patrimonio Forestal del Estado is constituted by the forested lands that
according to law are owned by the State, and the natural forests, and the flora and fauna therein. Forest lands that
are acquired, or revert to the ownership of the State would also be included (FL, art. 1). The Patrimonia de Areas
Naturales are wilderness areas with a scientific, educational, scenic, touristic or educational value, already
designated by law or to be designated in the future by INEFAN by resolution. National parks, ecological reserves,
wildlife refuges, and biological reserves are among such protected areas (FL, articles 69/70). These areas are
inalienable and imprescriptible and no real property rights could be vested on such areas (FL, art. 71). Private lands
and the natural resources existing therein at the time the areas were declared protected are to be expropriated to
revert to the State (FL, art. 73).
INEFAN is authorized to grant title to lands included in the Patrimonio Forestal del Estado:
* to legally established national timber companies in cases of national interest, through a public auction, and
provided a satisfactory management plan is implemented (FR, art. 65). The contract is rescinded if such
management plan is not implemented (FR, art. 82);
*  to rural organizations (cooperatives and other legally established agricultural associations), the main activity of
which is a forestry activity. Demarcations/adjudications are to the cooperative or other organization as such and
the title cannot be subdivided and/or disposed of to third parties (FR, articles 86/87). The adjudication
resolution sets forth the price and payment conditions for the land adjudicated and the. "communal" use of the
forestry resources, the prohibition of sale and the obligation to maintain the resource (FR, art. 95). All costs
associated with the demarcation/adjudication are to be borne by the beneficiary. If the cooperative/organization
is dissolved, such lands revert to the State without any compensation (FR, articles 99/100);
* to indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities, INEFAN will, free of charge, set the boundaries of the lands in
their ownership or possession and such lands will not be subject to any possession or adjudication to third
parties. Such lands should have an area sufficient to enable the maintenance of an adequate standard of living
according to their ethnic, customary, religious and other values to allow for development of such communities
(FR, articles 102/103).

Country: Ecuador                                       Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Deveopment Project
Issues and Challenges. Given the existing legal and institutional land regularization framework there are a
series of specific problems and challenges the project aims to address. These include the following:
* There are no specific provisions dealing with the titling/adjudication of lands by INEFAN in the Patrinionio
Forestal del Estado, only demarcation thereof. During the prior administration, however, INEFAN issued
Resolution 001 published in the Registro Oficial of June 27, 1996 for the adjudication of such lands in
cooperation with INDA. In essence the resolution called for the demarcation by INEFAN and the titling by
INDA of the indigenous communal lands.
* No title can be given to indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities under the provisions of the existing law in
the Patrimonio de Areas Naturales. A proposal to amend the Forestry Law with provisions to acknowledge
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples ownership is being considered. There would be a need to identify
ways to secure better rights in respect of the community lands such as contractual arrangements under the Civil
Code that would grant possession/usufruct rights to the lands for a long period of time. Such arrangements
would also require the preparation and implementation of management plans.
* There is an urgent need to define more precisely: (i) the notion of ancestral possession (as it stands now
along the lines of pacific, unopposed possession by three generations); (ii) the evidence required to prove
that the land is being exploited; and (iii) the work plan and other necessary procedures to be followed to meet
the requirements of Article 36 of the AD Law.
* INDA currently lacks the resources and personnel to undertake application of Article 36 of the AD Law.
Currently, INDA's titling activities are restricted to finalizing agrarian reform titles in process when INDA
replaced IERAC. There is a back-log of 2,326 requests for the adjudication of lands, 3,000 expropriation
requests and a large number of unresolved land conflicts (285 in 1994-96 only). It is estimated that 50% of
all land owners do not have proper titles; a legal cadastre to ensure clear and unambiguous identification of
holdings does not exist in the country.
* Innumerable, complicated and costly requirements for legalizing lands that have beeni in contilntuous
possession for over five years or for carrying out land expropriations on the bases established in the Law
(environmental degradation or demographic pressure). There is a need to issue regulations and procedures
for the areas covered above and build on the experiences of various NGOs (CARE, FEPP) which have
designed simple and participatory approaches for land titling and land conflict resolution. Such procedures
will be adopted by INDA/INEFAN before disbursement of the component expenditures for land titling
activities.
*  There is a strong lack of understanding in INDA and INEFAN of the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
situation, especially on types of traditional management of their lands. CONPLADE-IN will train
INDA/INEFAN personnel to address indigenous and afro-ecuadorian issues.
Water Rights Regularization
Legal Framework. The main laws applicable to water rights are: (i) Water Law: Law No. 369, published
in the Registro Oficial No. 69 of May 30, 1992 (WL); (ii) Regulations to the Water Law: Supreme Decree No. 40
published in the Registro Oficial on January 26, 1973 (WLR); and (iii) Organization of the Water Institutional
Regime: Executive Decree No. 2224 published in the Registro Oficial No. 558 of October 28,1994 (Decree No.
2224). (Institutional Decree)
Institutional Framework. Pursuant to the Institutional Decree, policy formulation and regulatory functions
are vested in the National Council for Water Resources, (Consejo Nacional de Recursos Hidricos - CNRH (art. 1),
powers to grant water use concessions are vested in CNRH's agencies, and powers to carry out, or engage/supervise
the carrying out of, infrastructure water works (major or complicated irrigation schemes), to be owned in prilciple
by the State are vested in the regional corporations (art. 8).
Water Use Concessions for Irrigation. All waters are deemed to be national property of public use and not
subject to trade, and the State dominion/ownership is inalienable and imprescriptible and not subject to possession
or other formns of appropriation by others (WL art. 2). Those that had "property" rights to the waters prior to such

Country: Ecuador                                        Project Tile: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project
law, are by law converted into "use" rights. Some recent efforts to privatize the waters have not yet prospered.
Irrigation systems can be constructed and owned by individuals, communities or the State. The water
concessionaire is obligated to build the works to receive, measure, use and control the water rights granted. If
constructed by the state the water fee will recover such costs. Riglhts to use (public) water for irrigation are granted
through concessions only for a fixed term. All water use rights must be registered with CNRH and, are subject to
cancellation or suspension or change when used for ineligible purposes or inefficiently. The water concessions are
granted by the 12 water agencies under the jurisdiction of the CNRH geographically located in Quito, Guayaquil,
Ambato, Cuencas, Riobamba, Ibarra, Loja, Machala, Portoviejo, Guaranda, Esmeraldas, and Tulcan (WLR, art. 14).
Each such agency is headed by a waterjudge empowered to resolve conflicts. The waterjudge's decision can be
appealed to the CNRH, and thereafter, the national administrative courts. Necessary rights-of-way (servitudes) are
also petitioned to, and granted by, CNRH.
The petition for a water use concession should contain the following (WL, art. 84):
*  identification of the river or source and geographic/administrative location;
*  the amount, and capture location;
*  the known users' names and addresses;
*  the purpose, works and installations proposed;
*  the timeframe for construction of the works identified; and
i  the required technical studies (as deternined by the regulations).
Water tariffs are contemplated in Title VI of the WLR, are to be paid to the water agencies and in the case
of cooperatives or communes the tariffs of all the individual users are charged jointly to the President and Treasurer
of such cooperatives of communes.
Water Users Associations. In all concessions where more than five users will have the riglht to use the
waters from a common source, the law requires that a Water Board (Directorio de Aguas) be established to manage
the use of such waters. To structure such board, the CNRH or the interested parties call for a meeting of all users, to
appoint a water council to manage the entity for one year (WL, art. 28) - Where the users are capturing waters from
aqueduct in a river or other source, such council is not required. Such councils must ensure that CNHR resolutions
and the applicable laws are complied with, set up turns in the use of water, plan and manage the operation and
maintenance of the water systems, and prepare the investments foreseen by the budget. The attendance to the-jmta
meetings called by the council are compulsory to all users and subject to fines if not complied (WL, art. 43 (a)). '1he
lands benefiting from irrigation and drainage systems financed by the State may be administered by Irrigation and
Drainage Commissions. Governmental approval of such commissions is subject to the review ofjustification
provided from a technical and financial point of view, as well as of the need for its creation. All water management
and distribution plans of the irrigation and drainage commissions are subject to approval and monitoring by CNRH.
Issues and Challenges. Given the existing legal and institutional regularization framework there are a series
of specific issues and challenges the project would aim to address through studies. These include the following:
*  There is no recognition whatsoever concerning ancestral rights of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples to
water resources; small farmers have only access to 13% of all water resources in the country, while medium
and large producers disproportionally benefit from subsidies (only 4% of cost recovery in public sector
irrigation projects).
*  Although water is an increasingly scarce resource in the Sierra region, with most indigenous peoples living
in the catchment areas, regulations on watershed conservation and watershed management plans regulating
water use among competing needs of different actors do not exist.
*  the exclusion of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian communities from agencies that manage water resources.

Project Activities
There remain approximately 2,500,000 hectares to be titled in Ecuador, of which 30% are in areas which
fall under the jurisdiction of INEFAN. Although the long-term objective would be to cover all of these areas, the
project aims to initiate some concrete activities in a few selected areas through: (i) a small program of legal reforms
related to land issues; (ii) implementation of a land regularization program for lands in ancestral possession of
indigenous peoples; and (iii) a land purchase fund (to be financed by IFAD and GOE). In addition, the project will
finance a diagnostic study focusing on the availability of water resources and related water rights in the project area
and, based on the results thereof, elaboration of an action plan for community-based irrigation systems.
Legal Technical Assistance. The project would finance technical assistance to assist in the preparation of
the following legal reforms:
(a) Revisions to Resolution 001 of April 24, 1996 with the aim to agree on a procedure to adjudicate lands in forest
lands (patrimonio forestal del estado) while ensuring adequate management of natural resources.
(b) Revisions to Resolution 005 of INDA published on July 1, 1997, conceming the content of management plans
and the definition of ancestral possession which should not only have a time and space dimension but should include
natural resource management requirements as well.
(c) Bring INDA's and INEFAN's requirements for management plans in line with each other in a single format, as
part of the respective procedures.
(d) Include provisions in the Ley Forestal y de Areas Naturales Protegidas, Vida Silvestre y Biodiversidad,
currently under preparation, allowing adequate recognition of land property rights of indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian communities in protected areas.
Land Regularization Activities. The project will finance regularization of: (i) lands claimed by indigenous
and afro-ecuadorian peoples with rights of ancestral possession; (ii) other lands claimed by indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian peoples for which payment of the land adjudicated is required; (iii) rights of indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian peoples declared national forestry patrimonium (patrimonioforestal del estados) within the jurisdiction
of INEFAN; and (iv) lands claimed by indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples in protected areas (patirimonio de
areas naturales) declared by law or resolution of INEFAN. The titling activities contemplated under (ii) will be
financed by IFAD or by counterpart funds, as these involve payment of the land. The activities under (iii) will be
subject to the revisions of Resolution 001 of April 24, 1996 and 005 as mentioned above. Likewise, the activities
contemplated under (iv) will be subject to the of the enactment of the new Ley Forestal y de Areas Naturales
Protegidas, Vida Silvestre y Biodiversidad or any other legal or administrative arrangement authorizing indigenous
and afro-ecuadorian peoples ownership of lands in protected areas.
Following the requirements indicated in the Ley de Desarrollo Agrario, the project will specifically finance
the following regularization activities of lands within INDA's jurisdiction: (i) technical assistance to allow
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations and communities to obtain legal status, if needed; (ii) elaboration of
the inspection report; (iii) demarcation activities; (iv) elaboration of management plans; (v) technical-assistance to
obtain the certificate that the lands are not in INEFAN's jurisdiction; (v) technical assistance to obtain the certificate
of the Direcci6n General de la Marina Mercante, if needed; (vi) inscription in the Property Registry; and (vii)
elaboration of the socio-historic study to prove ancestral possession. Following the requirements indicated in the
Ley Forestal y de Areas Naturales, the project will specifically finance the following regularization activities of
lands within INEFAN'sjurisdiction: (i) redemarcate lands declared national forestry patrimonium (patrimonio
forestal del estados) or protected areas (patrimonio de areas naturales), if necessary; (ii) technical assistance to
allow indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations obtain legal status, if needed; (iii) demarcation of lands; (iv)
elaboration of management plans; (v) elaboration of usufruct and management agreements in protected areas,

including the preparation of a socio-historic study concerning ancestral possession, a socio-economic census, and a
management plan.
Based on demand for land regularization activities, presence of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian population,
and environmental considerations, the project wvould initially focus its land regularization activities in the following
areas: (i) Esmeraldas; (ii) Sucumbios; (iii) Napo; y (iv) Pastaza.
Implementation of the land regularization activities would be governed by two implementation agreements
between CONPLADE-IN, INDA or INEFAN (depending on the jurisdiction of the lands) and contractors (including
NGOs).
Land Purchase Fund. Using IFAD and counterpart funds, the project would finance the purchase of land in
selected areas within the context of conflict resolution. For this purpose CONPLADE-IN contract FEPP, an NGO
with considerable experience and a long established program in this field. Taking into account the incidence of land
conflicts, the project will focus land purchase in the following counties (cantones): Ibarra, Cotacachi, Otavalo,
Saquisili, Pujuli, Latacunga and Guaranda.
Water Rights. The project would finance the implementation of a diagnostic study and the elaboration of an
action plan for the approximately 2,000 community-owned irrigation systems in the country. The diagnosis would
include an inventory of water resources, conflicts, water rights, water distribution, schemes, implementing agencies
etc.

Project Component 3 - Rural Investments
US$26.7 million (total cost of component)
Rural Investments Component
1.     The Rural Investments Component would finance demand-driven rural investments, or subprojects. This
component would be divided in two subcomponents, according to two types of subproject: (i) the
public/community investments subcomponent, which would finance subprojects with a public/community good
nature; and (ii) the private/individual investments subcomponent, which would finance subprojects with a
private/individual nature. The public/community investments subcomponent would finance subprojects though
matching-grants, while the private/individual investments subcomponent would finance subprojects through
loans that the final beneficiaries would reimburse to financial intermediaries. The private/individual investments
subcomponent would be financed exclusively by IFAD. Examples of subprojects with public/community good
nature are: (i) natural resources management; (ii) community-based productive infrastructure; (iii) social
infrastructure; (iv) technical assistance; and (v) training and institutional development. Examples of subprojects
with private\individual good nature are (vi) farm or livestock inputs; and (vii) micro-enterprises. An indicative
subproject classification is available in Table 3. According to the results of the participatory planning activities
already carried out during a pilot phase, productive subprojects are more demanded than social subprojects,
because the objective of sustainable rural poverty alleviation and income generation is a priority compared to
service availability.
2.     The objectives of this component are to: (i) respond to a demand felt by indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
communities; (ii) involve beneficiaries into implementation, increasing their sense of ownership; (iii) diversify
and/or intensify rural production; and (iv) improve beneficiaries access to services and markets.
3.     Two Operational Manuals (Reglamentos Operativos) detail the rules which manage the Rural Investment
Component: the Operational Manual for public/community investments and the Operational Manual for
private/individual investments. As only IFAD is financing credit subprojects, IFAD will be responsible to
supervise the private/individual investments. Adoption of the final Operational Manual - acceptable to the World
Bank - for public/community investments would constitute a condition of effectiveness (as part of the Project
Manual).
4.     The next four sections describes: (i) eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, implementing institutions, and
subprojects; (ii) organization and management at local and central levels; (iii) operational arrangements; and
(iv) risks and mitigation measures.
Eligibility Criteria
5.     Eligibility criteria for beneficiaries. Indigenous and afro-ecuadorian legally established communities
living in rural areas are the target group of the Rural Investment Component. This important factor guarantees
high poverty targeting and good level of organization of the beneficiaries. Non indigenous or afro-ecuadorian
peoples living in the surrounding areas could also partially benefit from this component.
6.     Eligibility criteria for subprojects are based on the following principles: (i) focus on a specific
geographical area (see Table 1) and target group, as above defined; (ii) selection through participatory demand-
driven mechanisms; (iii) possibility to be managed by beneficiaries or the designated Sponsoring Agencies
(SAs); and (iv) technical, economic, social, and environmental feasibility and sustainability.

7.     The project would finance up to a maximum of US$90,000 per subproject. With an equity objective, an
annual limit of US$800 per beneficiary would be enforced, subject to review over time considering overall
expenditure of the component. The subprojects would be selected and prioritized according to participatory
demand-driven mechanisms carried out atparroquia, level. Subprojects would be approved by the Project
Regional Offices (PRUs), with no-objection of the PMU for subproject costing more than US$25,000. To reduce
the risk of pulverization, or lack of impact of small-scale investments, subprojects would respond to a strategy at
local level, as defined in the Local Development Plan, covering the area of influence of the OSG, according to
pre-set budgetary limits. Detailed budgetary allocations byparroquia are still under evaluation; once agreed and
finalized, they will be notified in the Operational Manual, which is subject to World Bank approval. The
allocations are based on two criteria: (i) indigenous and afro-ecuadorian population; and (ii) poverty indicators.
In the second year of activity, an indicator of implementation capacity would be added. Allocations are being
calculated at the parroquia level because this is the smallest administrative unit for which statistical information-
such as population and poverty-is available. However, participatory planning and prioritization would be carried
out by second-tier organizations (Organizaci6n de Segundo Grado, OSG) in the Costa and Sierra, and by third-
tier organizations (Organizaci6n de Tercer Grado, OTG) in the Amazonia. These organizations cover an average
of two parroquias. It would therefore be necessary to add the allocation of the parroquias covered by the same
OSG to obtain the allocation per OSG.

8.    A measure characteristically used to ensure ownership is beneficiaries' participation in subproject finance
which they can contribute in labor, cash or kind, between 10 and 30 percent of the subproject costs (see Table 2).
These differences in cofinancing contributions have been designed as an incentive for institutional strengthening,
technical assistance, and environmental subprojects.

9.     Eligibility criteria for Sponsoring Agencies (SAs). The project would have the possibility to channel
financial resources through SAs, such as OSGs, OTGs, NGOs, cooperatives, farmer associations, and, in case of
need, Government agencies. The SA must meet the eligibility criteria detailed in the Operational Manual which
include technical and financial capabilities and experience with the beneficiary community and region. The SA
can be a public or private institution, with legal status, capable of implementing investment subprojects. The SA
would accompany local communities through the Participatory Planning process, and from project
conceptualization to implementation (see below). SAs would help the communities identify and rank investimeit
needs, formulate Local Development Plans and present the investment needs to the appropriate funding agencies
for consideration. SAs would possibly be the same OSGs (OTGs in the Amazonia). In those cases when the
OSGs do not fulfill the requirements, an agreement with a local NGOs would be necessary. If the OSG does not
have previous experience in subproject implementation, the size of the first subproject would be limited to
US$25,000.
Organization and Management
10.   The Project Management Unit (PMU) and seven deconcentrated6 Project Regional Units (PRUs) would
be involved with different levels of responsibility in subproject selection, appraisal, approval, implementation,
disbursement, technical follow-up, monitoring, and evaluation. However, given the demand-driven characteristic
of this component, beneficiaries will be the primary responsible for the quality of subprojects. Beneficiaries will
be guided through a participatory planning exercise during which they will be helped to utilize their knowledge
to achieve quality subprojects (see paragraph on participatory planning)
11.   The responsibility to evaluate whether subproject proposals respects the principles set in the Operational
Manuals would be deconcentrated at the maximum extent. Given the modest experience at local level, the
evaluation of subproject costing more than US$25,000 would be revised by the PMU, who will verify that the
evaluation done by the PRUs is sound. The operational management of this component would be shared by the
PMU and PRUs, which would be responsible for the funds' overall operation. Three specialists--a specialist in
natural resources, an engineer, and a specialist in credit--would be hired for the day-to-day operations, and they

offices.

Country: Ecuador                                      Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadonan Peoples Development Project
would be responsible for the overall administration and operation of this component. The Operational Manual
would distinguish functions and responsibilities between the central and regional levels.
Participatory Planning
12.    This is a process designed to seek the active participation of the rural population in planning, design,
negotiation, execution and supervision of rural investments. Participatory Planning is designed to facilitate
community and grassroots organizations to be effective players in their own development. The objectives of this
planning process are to: (i) contribute to the decentralization of decision-making; (ii) stimulate grassroots
participation in local planning and demand generation; (iii) help rural communities formulate development
strategies and investment plans; and (iv) increase investment sustainability by intensifying stakeholders'
commitment in the execution and supervision of rural investments.
13.   The Participatory Planning methodology has been developed drawing on the practical experiences in
various countries, and has benefited from the procedures developed by the Nicaraguan Rural Municipalities
Project, the Bolivian Fondo de Desarrollo Campesino, the Latin American Faculty for Social Sciences, and the
GTZ's Goal-Oriented Project Planning (GOPP). It consists of the organization of community and district
workshops over the course of several weeks. At the workshops, project field promoters and Sponsoring
Agencies (SAs) help the communities formulate a development strategy, by applying methods of groups
dynamics. Workshop participants are community delegates, representatives from development organizations,
and interested individuals. After each workshop, time is allotted for the community delegates to return and
inform the community of the workshops proceedings, and receive community feedback. As some communities
decisions are taken by consensus, this process can be lengthy. The duration and cost of this process are variable
and depend on: (i) maturity of the local organizations; (ii) homogeneity of the rural communities; (iii) time
availability of community members, which is a function of interest, cropping seasons and employment patterns;
and (iv) SA capabilities and commitment.
14.   The Participatory Planning would be carried out in the area of influence of the OSG, in average two
parroquias, and has seven stages:
(a) Preparatr p2ha. PMU staff would participate in the selection and, eventually, training of NGOs and other
SA to explain the programs and procedures detailed in the Operational Manual;
(b) Prornotion. The NGOs would disseminate project's purposes and methodology and in particular: (i) the
eligibility criteria for subprojects; (ii) the processing steps for eligible subprojects identified in their
corresponding Local Development Plans, including sample documentation and approximate times of processing;
and (iii) execution and supervision mechanisms;
(c) Self diagnostic. To help the communities better perceive their economic and social strengths and weaknesses
with a view to formulating achievable socio-economic goals. Participatory rural appraisal techniques-such as
participatory mapping and seasonal calendars-would be used to assist the community in the identification of
constraints, causes and solutions;
(d) Preparation of a Local Development Plan (LDP). A LDP is a ranked list of subproject ideas screened
according to development strategy, requirements, technical feasibility, and funds availability or potential
suitability for funding (from this project or other sources). In the Costa and Sierra each OSG would prepare the
Local Development Plan for its area of influence. Given the fact that OSG are very small in the Amazonia, in this
region Local Development Plans would be prepared by OTGs;
(e) Plan adjjustment; and
(f) Subproject formulation to transform subproject ideas into financiable proposals.
15.   The participatory rural appraisal techniques and tools would include, among others: (i) interviews,
whose flexible agendas permit the participants guided discussion topics; (ii) participatory mapping exercises,
which positions socio-economic information on a map, creates consensus and facilitates communications;

(iii) seasonal calendar, showing rainfall patterns, crop sequencing, seasonal labor demand and availability;
(iv) historical profiles and time trends, concerning changes in social organization, income opportunities and
natural resource use; and (v) short, simple questionnaires, concerning socio-economic situation to be completed
by the whole community before the following workshop.
16.    The subproject preparation consists of three stages:
(a) SubproJect Profile/Idea. This is a first description of the subproject, its rationale and an approximation of its
cost;
(b) Subproject Proposal. It is an economic, social, environmental, and financial evaluation of the subproject,
with a detailed estimation of its costs. The format of the proposal is suitable for presentation to funding agencies,
and prepared according to various formats available in the Operational Manual; and
(c) Subproject Design. It is a detailed technical description of the subproject. The design is necessary only for
technically complex subprojects, such as agroindustries or irrigation systems.
The preparation of subproject profiles begins in parallel with the preparation of the Local Development
Plan, as the ranking process requires an approximation of the costs and feasibility of various subproject options.
The final development contains aprofile for every proposed subproject.
17.    The Subproject Cycle. In parallel with the development of Local Development Plan (LDP), the
processing procedures for subprojects would start. The processing can divided in the following nine phases:
(a) Tdentification. the project would process subprojects originating from: (i) Local Development Plans; and
(ii) eligible SA. All proposals should demonstrate community participation and consensus in the prioritization
and identification of the subprojects.
(b) Formulation. The primary responsibility for subproject formulation lies with the SA. The SA would not be
asked to enter into a priori framework agreement with the PMU, or sign any letter of intentions. This is to le.t the
demand develop autonomously, on the basis of the incentive that matching-grants would be approved only if the
requirements of the Operative Manual are met. The preparation process may take one of three possible courses:
(i) the subproject profile is duly prepared according to requirements and guidelines and requires no further work
prior to appraisal; (ii) the subproject profile complies with general eligibility criteria but requires a detailed
design; this design would be financed as a technical assistance subproject; and (iii) the subproject profile does
not meet eligibility criteria, requiring the SA to redesign it with guidance from PRU or PMU.
(c) Appraisal. The PMU or PRUs appraise the subproject, including discrepancies between proposed unit costs
and standard costs by project category. Subproject appraisal takes into account the subproject's prioritization
process, cost-effectiveness, poverty focus, and sustainability. In addition, the institutional capacity of the SA and
the significance of the counterpart contribution are evaluated. Approval criteria includes analysis of alternatives,
social impact and multiplier effect. Some subprojects require an environmental analysis (see below). The PMU
or PRUs could, if necessary, be supported by external specialists. A subproject may be rejected only if it did not
respect the requirements defined in the Operative Manuals.
(d) Approval. Subprojects are approved by the Project Regional Unit. Subproject costing more than US$25,000
would be reviewed by the PMU, who will verify that the evaluation done by the PRUs is sound. Approved
subprojects are then included in the project annual operating plan.
(e) Executiin. The responsibility for subproject implementation is divided between the SA and the community.
Subproject implementation rules include: (i) the PMU signs a tri-partite contract with the SA and the
participating community. In the contract, among other, the SA and the community commit itself to follow
project procurement procedures; (ii) the target community approves the hiring of external consultants/sub-
contractors by the SA; (iii) for those subprojects which require a contractor (such as most infrastructure
subprojects), the tri-partite contract would also involve the contractor or supplier of goods or services; and (iv)
the SA would ensure proper subproject supervision as per its contractual obligations
(f) Disbursement, Disbursements would be made against the tri-partite contract signed between the PMU, the
SA, and the community. Under the provisions of this contract, disbursements would be based on a disbursement

plan--which is part of the tri-partite contract--with a maximum advance of three months. The maximum
implementation period of a subproject is one year.
(g) Subproject supervision and technical follow-up. Responsibilities for these activities are divided among
beneficiaries and PRU. Participatory supervision and social monitoring are the pillar of the project approach.
However, given the difficult technical aspects in some subprojects (e.g. irrigation), the involvement of
technically prepared professionals would be essential. In these cases, the coordination with existing government
agencies would be sought. In few cases, additional contracts between an independent supervisor and the PMU
might be required.
(h) Monitoring. The monitoring of the subproject is shared by the SA, the target community, and the project
(PMU and PRU), in a pre-determined written arrangement. All three parties issue an approval and formal
certification of due and proper project subproject performance. The PMU has a planning, monitoring, and
evaluation system detailing the specific instruments and the responsibilities. The long term objective of the
project is to emphasize ex-post monitoring, though at the beginning a more intense follow up would be
necessary. A list of monitoring indicators was agreed upon during Negotations.
(i) Operation. Maintenance and Ex-post Evaluation. The target community holds the primary responsibility for
subproject operation. However, the SA would maintain a presence throughout this phase to ensure due and
proper subproject operation, the provision of technical assistance services if required, maintenance and ex-post
evaluation. In addition. CONPLADE-IN would contract external auditors to evaluate the success of investments
financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject objectives, and the quality,
efficiency, and sustainability of the subprojects.

Risks and Mitigation Measures
18.    The following are the specific risks of the rural investments component: (i) low subproject quality;
(ii) political interference in operational decisions; (iii) excessive emphasis in private\individual investments;
(iv) generation of negative environmental impact; and (v) given that the SA would not be asked to enter into a
priori framework agreement with the PMU, or sign any letter of intentions, the SA will have no legal obligations
until the tri-partite agreement is signed. Several measures have been incorporated in the project design to
mitigate this risks: (i) investments would be accompanied by several forms of technical assistance, such as the
institutional strengthening component, and the requirement that each subproject is required to have specific
technical assistance. Furthermore, the participatory planning would combine beneficiaries knowledge to the

technical appraisal of the project units; (ii) political interference would be reduced by the transparency and
dissemination of the set of rules defined in the Operational Manuals. Among these rules, an important one would
be the impartial allocation of resources by parroquias; (iii) it is expected that the strict requirements for approval
of private\individual investments, such as detailed economic and financial analysis, would discourage an
excssjye-demand. In case initial implementation would demonstrate that these strict requirements are not
sufficient as obstacle, stricter requirements would be introduced; (iv) the next paragraphs and tables provide
some example of environmental impact and mitigation measures; and (v) the subproject appraisal will not only
be result based, as the process would be an important element of evaluation. Therefore the SA wvould have no
benefit if it does not follow the rules set in the Operational Manual.
19.   Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures. The project would contribute to the implementation
of various kinds of subprojects, some with possible negative impact on the environment and others with clear
positive impact. The rehabilitation of rural infrastructure such as access roads, small scale irrigation works,
processing and market facilities, etc. could create localized environmental problems. Subprojects of integrated
watershed management, reforestation, soil improvement, pasture management, etc., would generate a positive
environmental impact.
20.    Environmental aspects of all subprojects would be reviewed during feasibility studies and, when
appropriate, mitigating measures would be designed for implementation. EAs would prepare an environmental
description of every infrastructure and production support subproject. This information would be reviewed by
the PMU, which would be responsible for the screening and which would assign the subproject to one of the
following categories: (i) full environment assessment required; (ii).specific environment assessment required;
(iii) although an environment assessment is not required, environmental analysis is suggested; and (iv) no
environment assessment or environmental analysis required. Besides, subproject identification and preparation
through the participatory community-planning process would help avert negative impact on hulman and social
environment, including involuntary resettlement.
21.    Access Road Rehabilitation. The project would finance only rehabilitation and spot improvement of
existing roads. A simplified environmental analysis would be carried out for each subproject of this kind,
because the roads are already in existence. This analysis would take into account not only the disturbance to
natural environment caused by soil erosion, changes to stream and underground water, interference with animal
life, deforestation on the road blade, but also the increases in agricultural production. These consequences are
inherent with agricultural growth and intensification. Access roads would not be rehabilitated in forest wesei'ves
and other environmentally sensitive areas or where they would encourage new settlement.

significant environmental impact. However, some problems, such as water quality degradation because of
chemicals used in the more intensive irrigated agriculture, might occur at the local level. In Table 5 the
likelihood of occurrence and eventual mitigation measures are highlighted.

mainly health and sanitation related: water supply, refuse collection, sewerage, and clean-up facilities. Poor
hygiene and lack of water supply can turn out into food contamination and health hazards. Some kind of
processing, such as cheese processing, could produce polluting sewerage, while others, such as brick production,
might cause borrow-pits. In all these cases, appropriate mitigation measures would be a condition of financing
the project.

Savings and Credit Subcomponent7 - Economic Sub-projects
General Aspects of the Credit Funds
The credit funds will be composed of IFAD resources and the moneys derived from loan recovery, other
financial transactions, and the own funds of intermediary financial institutions' (IFIs) involved in the Project.
The Project will contract one or more Banks or other IFIs under the supervision of the Superintendency of Banks
(SB). These IFIs will act as second-tier financial structures of the proposed credit system. The IFIs will deliver
loans to first-tier financial intermediaries that will also deliver credit directly to project clients. It is not forbidden
to IFIs to directly deliver loans to individuals.
Regulations to Operate the Credit Funds
The operating mechanism will be as follows:
* IFAD's credit funds will be deposited in the Central Bank of Ecuador. The account will be in US dollars and
in the name of the Project.
* The CONPLADE-IN will sign "subsidiary loan agreements for the transfer of funds, rights and obligations"
with one or more financial institutions supervised by the SB.
* After signing the subsidiary loan agreements, CONPLADE-IN will open a credit line for the signatories of the
agreement. These IFIs will manage the discounted funds according to the provisions of the credit by-laws
previously agreed upon between the CONPLADE-IN and IFAD.
* Adoption of the final Operational Manual (credit by-laws) for private/individual iivestment iiwill be a
condition for disbursement of IFAD loan.
Some of the main provisions of the Private/Individual Investment Operational Manual will be as follows:
*  Banks and/or IFIs interested in operating with project resources will have to share the risk of ciredit operatiolns
by contributing with their own resources in installments at least greater than the rate of the arreais portfolio
which each bank has as part of its credit operations.
* Banks' - IFIs clients will be informal financial institutions and/or indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
communities (first-tier financial institutions).
* First-tier financial institutions will be savings and loans cooperatives, communal banks, Solidarity Funds
("Cajas Solidarias") or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with experience in managing rural credit. The
supervised banks or IFIs --second-tier institutions-- will control and will be responsible for the operations of the
first-tier ones.
* Second-tier institutions will share operating risks with first-tier IFIs. The latter will receive guarantees from
their own clients.
*  Co-participation of risks mechanisms could include bidding for resources, compulsory guarantee rescves and
financial ceilings for the organizations involved. Those responsible for credit coordination will negotiate the
corresponding procedures with banks and first-tier IFIs.
This subcomponent is entirely financed by IFAD.

* Direct clients who obtain credit for productive investments should belong to the project target group. At the
same time, the Operational Manual (which include Credit-by-Laws) will establish regulations regarding purpose
of loans and maximum amount by family.
* The project will transfer funds to second-tier financial institutions at an interest rate that will assure the
purchasing power stability of the revolving fund. This interest rate could be established according to (i) the level
of market passive rates, (ii) the devaluation of the Sucre vis-a-vis hard currencies or (iii) the inflation rate.
* Second-tier banks will transfer their operating costs through the interest rate charged to their clients.
Contracting more than one bank will facilitate competition, contributing to better service and reducing costs.
* First-tier banks will transfer operating costs to the interest rate charged by the second-tier banks. First-tier
IFIs have a reduced volume of operations and each operation involves a small amount, therefore, this has a
strong effect on fixed costs. Also, they lack trained staff, efficient operating procedures and enough equipment.
* The project has an institutional strengthening component for first-tier institutions. This component will be
used as an incentive to improve management techniques, and reduce intermediation spreads so as to reduce
interest rates which is in line with project goals. These incentives will be subject to reducing the cost of money
for project clients.
Participating Institutions
Participating financial institutions are classified as follows:
*  Savings and loans banks and cooperatives supervised by the Bank Superintendency. They could operate as
first- and second-tier institutions. Some of them, such as Finagro, Banco Solidario and Banco de Pichincha,
have already been contacted and have shown their interest in participating in the project.
- NGOs with experience in rural credit and proven efficient methodologies. Among the most important ones
are: FEPP, ECLOF, CRS and FINCA. These institutions will work as first-tier banks and will have to agree on
financing lines with second-tier institutions. Each one has its own specific experience, clientele and operating
procedures. The project will act as a facilitator and promoter of businesses.
* Loan and savings cooperatives. They are more heterogeneous, less willing to work in rural areas and with
greater supervision difficulties. However, they could be very important in certain areas. A survey of these
institutions is currently underway in order to have a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
*  Solidarity Funds ("Cajas Solidarias"). The project will promote the creation of Solidarity Funds in order to
encourage the creation of savings and micro-credit institutions at the local level. Their main mandate is to reach
out to women groups or to establish seed experiences in isolated locations where there are no financial
institutions. These funds will be made up of local savings and non-reimbursable allocations from the Project and
financed by IFAD.
The appraisal mission has agreed on the main guidelines for the Private/Individual Operational Manual
as follows:
*  Solidarity Funds need to submit statutes showing the creation of the fund, credit by-laws, established
authorities, and member lists.
* Members should have a minimum limit of obligatory savings.
* The project will contribute with seed capital twice the amount of the saved portion by the members.
* The funds should show --for example every six months-- information about their portfolio and financial
statements.

* The project will provide financial management, accounting, record keeping and portfolio management
training.
* FINCA, FEEP and CRS, among others, will be requested to submit infonnation on their statutes and by-laws
as samples to be used by the project.
* The second-level and third-level peasant organizations (non-financial institutions) interested in acting as first-
tier IFIs will have to establish similar regulations as proposed for the Solidarity Funds ("Cajas Solidarias").
Finally, the project will establish a credit coordination mechanism that will have a normative, planning,
evaluating role and it would serve as a promoter of financial institution participation, it will seek to level off
interferences and take advantage of business opportunities in accordance with project objectives.
Non-specifically Allocated Funds
Non-specifically allocated funds will be available to support or strengthen future fornal financial
initiatives that facilitate the expansion and improvement of rural financial services, particularly, those that
provide services to the indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian rural populations.
Among the initiatives that are being elaborated and that could be eligible for these funds are:
-  Support to the creation of an indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples fund.
*  Support to the purchase or creation of a savings and loan cooperative controlled by the Superintendency of
Banks. This initiative is being considered by eleven NGOs with ample experience in rural credit in the country.
*  Support to the restructuring and strengthening of the Credit Retro-Guarantee Corporation (Fondo ANacioinal
de Retrogarantias Crediticias).

Project Component 4 - Institutional Strengthening of CONPLADE-IN
US$9.7 million (total cost of component)
1. State Policy Relating to Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian Peoples
Historical perspective
State policy regarding indigenous peoples has not yet been clearly defined and has numerous
ambiguities, but certain general trends may be distinguished. First, since the creation of Ecuador in 1830
following its separation from Gran Colombia, attempts have been made to integrate indigenous peoples into the
general society by promoting their acculturation; but on various occasions types of social exclusion have been
maintained, such as limitations on collective indigenous private property, the exercise of their right to citizenship
(for example, by not allowing illiterate persons to vote or be elected) and of their rights to own land and maintain
their own forms of government.
The constant pressure of dominant groups over the resources of indigenous peoples has made the former
predominant in urban centers and the more fertile valleys, displacing the latter to the slopes of the cordillera or
tropical lowlands and, in general, to disadvantaged geographical areas with sloping land and difficult access to
irrigation.
Advanced forms of social organization were practically destroyed by the process of domination that
began with the Spanish conquest; however, remnants of indigenous self-government remained with chieftanships
and parcialidades, some of which were ruled by an indigenous council (cabildo). In 1937, after over one
hundred years of independence, the Law on Communal Organization and Regulations formally recognized the
right of parcialidades to adopt a form of social organization, the commune or cabildo, which, being of Spanisi
origin, had been adopted by indigenous peoples since the colonial period. Later, in 1946, indigenous
governments were established among the Tsachilas and Chachis, recognizing, albeit to a limited extent, the
peoples' right to have extra-community types of government. In recent decades, other legally recognized options
for social organizations have been created, such as cooperatives, centers (as an altemative to community
organization), etc., and these grassroots social organizations have proliferated.
Current Legal Context
Like said before, Ecuador's legal context has been based on a constitutional norm favoring principles
aimed at disintegration of the indigenous culture and the adoption of policies favoring the integration of the
4"marginal" indigenous population in mainstream society. The principles of the Constitution are based on the
notion that all citizens are equal, implying that by growing out of poverty indigenous peoples will gradually
acculturate. State policies and existing legislation have not been able to respond to the recovery of the
indigenous cultural identity and associated demands, but have merely attempted to deal with these on an
individual basis or as demands of marginal groups.
More recently, since the 1980s, there has been a change from a predominantly exclusive policy to one of
gradual openness to the interests and demands of indigenous peoples. The National Constitution has accepted
the fact that Ecuador is a pluri-cultural country, and much progress has been made in acknowledging indigenous
rights to land, although agrarian legislation has many gaps. Bilingual education has been legitimized, with
autonomous management by indigenous organizations. Opportunities have been created for the training and
legal recognition of second- and third-tier organizations, from community associations to provincial federations
and regional and national organizations. Moreover, processes have definitely begun that will allow the inclusion
of indigenous people in national society, within the context of cultural diversity.

With regard to access to resources, goods and services for development, the most important expressions
of state policy toward the rural-peasant sector have been made through the Agrarian Reform Program of the
Ecuadorian Institute of Agrarian Reform and Colonization (IERAC), the Rural Development Fund for the
Marginalized (FODERUMA) of the Central Bank of Ecuador, the Integrated Agricultural Development Programs
(PIDA). of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Integrated Rural Development Programs of the Sub-Secretariat of
Rural Development (SEDRI) of the Ministry of Social Welfare. Although these projects were specifically
conceived or executed for indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples, their target population is rural, agricultural
peoples, largely comprising the above-mentioned peoples. These programs' efforts are aimed especially at
means of production, but they also incorporate the provision of basic social infrastructure (classrooms, health
posts), support for social organization, support to women and children through daycare centers, etc. Ambiguities
in policy continue, however. Therefore, recent structural adjustment policies have favored the govemment
economic sector and jeopardized the social sector. Social investment has dropped to 4.2 percent of the gross
domestic product, one of the lowest in Latin America. The predominantly rural indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
population has also been affected by the low level of agricultural investments, decreased credit, interruption of
agrarian reform, and relative inaction with regard to irrigation policy. In summary, the state policy regarding
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples has lacked an integrating focus aimed at recognizing and protecting the
basic rights of these peoples, mainly the right to development from their own viewpoint.
CONPLADE-IN
The creation of CONPLADE-IN on April 13, 1997, with the direct representation of the majority of
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples' organizations, constitutes a milestone in the development of state policy
on this sector. It is a dream come true for indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples to have an agency which
recognizes the national organizations that represent these peoples, and which is in charge of generating state
policies in their benefit, executing programs and projects, and coordinating efforts with other state agencies,
according to their own viewpoints and types of management. CONPLADE-IN's main types of work are: (i)
intercultural development in Ecuadorian society, (ii) political, legal and administrative reform of the State, (iii)
comprehensive and sustainable development, and (iv) affirmation of bilingual and intercultural identity, culture
and education.
2. Description of Project Activities
The objective of this component is to strengthen CONPLADE-IN in the following areas: (i) suppolri fbi
the institutionalization in terms of improved information systems; (ii) assistance to elaborate a system of project
planing, monitoring and evaluation, including the formulation of an indicative national plan for indigenous and
afro-ecuadorian development; (iii) assistance to formulate a program of selected legal reforms and public
policies, in a concerted effort with indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples, focusing on preparation of the
indigenous peoples development law and its regulations, the new communes law and its regulations, the law for
the recognition of indigenous health systems and the law on indigenous peoples cultures; (iv) establishment of a
Project Management Unit in Quito and implementing offices in up to seven subregions; and (v) development of
capacity to review legal reforms from an indigenous viewpoint. The main activities to be carried out are
included in the areas of technical assistance and training, creation/maintenance of data bases and minimum
equipment.
Technical assistance and training will be aimed at the adoption of efficient administrative and financial
systems for project execution. The preparation of the most suitable legal and institutional framework will be
sought, taking into account limitations in terms of time and existing resources, in order to facilitate the
development of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples in the context of cultural diversity.

3. Institutional Arrangements for Implementing the Component
CONPLADE-IN will implement this component. In order to carry out activities aimed at its institutional
strengthening, local or foreign consultants with experience in the specific fields to be dealt with will be hired. A
strong legal assistance component is expected for the study of the situation and the fonrmulation of bills
considered necessary by indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples and by CONPLADE-IN as mentioned in the
previous paragraph.

Financial and Economic analyses were carried out for the Rural Investments component (53 percent of project
costs). Essentially the soundness of the overall analysis is based on the principle of community demand determining
priorities: the beneficiaries know best how to use scarce resources to satisfy their needs. To elicit community demand
properly which will limit narrow and vested self-interests, a participatory planning exercise will be used (a complete
description of the participatory planning exercise is available in the annex on the Rural Investments component). Given
the importance of this participatory planning exercise, a pilot was carried out in seven provinces, involving 14 OSGs, and
the results were used to prepare a detailed financial and economic analyses of selected subprojects. The analyses,
conducted by Food and Agriculture Organization-Cooperative Program (FAO-CP)10, evaluated models of 28 subprojects
which the communities had chosen during the pilot participatory planning exercise. The models, which are differentiated
by ecological region, have helped to define investment parameters of sound subprojects. The results of the analyses
show a wide range of economic and financial rates of return, ranging from 13 to 152 percent. It appears that the
beneficiaries do not prioritize by rate of return alone, but take also other factors, such as equity and institutional
sustainability, into consideration. The table on the next page summarizes the results of the analyses of the 28 subprojects.
The analyses of the 28 models were combined resulting in the weighted average of Net Benefits and Internal Rate of
Return (IRR) which is shown in the table above.
Main Assumptions:
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, fiscal distortions are insignificant in all agricultural inputs and
products (a few exceptions, such as chicken meat, do not influence the selected subproject portfolio). With the exception
of labor, shadow prices were equivalent to 100 percent of costs. In the case of labor, a conversion factor of 80%. was
estimated. The use of this shadow price caused the difference between financial and economic analyses.
A discount rate of 12% was used to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV). The frequency factor was estimated
on the basis of the demand during the pilot phase. The resulting weighted average is an estimation of the whole project
portfolio.
9 Separated benefits and costs are not available because the flows of the 28 subprojects were added as net flows.

Al prices were estimated at the farm gate, in May 1997. Estimations were done during participatory subproject
assessment exercises. During these exercises, the prices published by the Market Prices and News Service unit of the
Ministry of Agriculture were compared with the prices provided by the same beneficiaries. Similarly, yields and
productivity were estimated comparing data of the National Institute of Agricultural Research (Instituto Nacional de
Investigaci6n.4gropecuaria, INIAP) with the information provided by beneficiaries and local technical staff. Minor
difficulties were caused by different measurement units, which have been converted into the metrical system in the FAOQ
CP report.

Country: Ecuador                                    Project rdle: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadonan Peoples Development Proje
The Bank would finance: (i) rural community subprojects consisting of works, goods and equipment
technical assistance, and agricultural inputs, (ii) goods and equipment for CONPLADE-IN, INDA, INEFAN,
and financial intermediaries (financed by IFAD); (iii) consulting services; (iv) training; and (iv) non-salary
incremental operating costs. Procurement would be carried out by CONPLADE-IN and eligible sponsoring
agencies under the guidance of CONPLADE-IN. For this purpose CONPLADE-IN would be strengthened by a
procurement specialist and administrative officers in each of the regional offices, who, among other, would train
executing agencies in purchasing goods, equipment and agricultural inputs for rural community investments
through shopping.
Works: Only small works (all estimated to be below US$ 30,000 per contract) are expected to be
financed under the loan. These would be procured under lump sum, fixed price, contracts awarded on the basis
of quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors.
Rural community investments. Procurement for community based projects would be done by eligible
sponsoring agencies (including contractors and NGOs) with support from CONPLADE-IN and in accordance
with the guidelines specified in the Operational Manual. Financing of rural community investments would be
limited to US$90,000 per subproject. Therefore, all works would be procured under lump sum, fixed price
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified contractors in response to a written
invitation. Similarly, goods, equipment, and agricultural inputs needed for the implementation and operation of
the investment would be procured through national shopping. Due to the small size and isolated nature of sub-
projects national shopping procedures may not be feasible in many cases. Therefore, for sub-projects below
US$25,000 procurement of goods, works and services for subprojects would be done through a system of direct
contracting, up to an aggregate amount of US$ 10,600,000
Goods and equipment. CONPLADE-IN would purchase vehicles, motorcycles and computer equipmenlt
for an amount of US$2,400,000 equivalent, including goods and equipment for INDA, INEFAN, and financial
intermediaries (financed by IFAD) as specified in corresponding Cooperation Agreements. The purchase of
vehicles would be packaged and done through Limited International Competitive Bidding. Procurement of all
other goods and equipment, not exceeding US$50,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$ 1.2 million
would be done through international or national shopping among suppliers with established service and
maintenance facilities in Ecuador. Contracts for all other goods and equipment would be procured tliougli NCB.
Consulting Services. The services consist of: (i) consulting assignments for individuals providing direct
technical assistance to CONPLADE-IN, INDA, INEFAN, and indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership
organizations for, inter alia, project implementation, monitoring, evaluation, land and water regularization
activities, preparation of legal reforms; and (ii) technical assistance and studies by eligible executing agencies
(firms, NGOs) under contracts specifying concrete outputs, inter alia for the implementation of a diagnostic
study on community-managed irrigation systems, and preparation and implementation of subprojects under the
Rural Investments Component of the project. Consulting services would be procured in accordance with the
1997 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Training. Training consists of workshops, study tours, and (degree) courses, including the cost of the
trainers' and trainees fees and scholarships, rental of training facilities, per diem of trainees or scholarships and
materials required for the training activities. The services would be procured in accordance with the 1997 Bank
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Management Services Contracts. The services consist of: (i) land titling and demarcation activities in
productive, forested, and protected lands by eligible executing agencies (including contractors, NGOs); and (ii)
organization of cultural events within the context of the cultural heritage program financed under the project.
The services would be procured in accordance with the 1997 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.

Table B summarizes the Thresholds for Procurement Methods and Prior Review. Prior review
arrangements have been minimized in favor of post-review efforts which would be incorporated in the project
auditing arrangements. The Bank would include a prior review of: (i) the first two contracts of works for rural
community investments exceeding US$25,000;(ii) each contract for vehicles; (iii) the first two contracts for other
goods and equipment costing procured through (inter)national shopping; (iv) all contracts for other goods and
equipment procured through NCB; (v) consultant selection documentation (terms of reference, shortlists,
selection, draft contract, etc.) for services with an estimated contract amount of US$1 00,000 or more for firns
and US$50,000 or more for individuals; (vi) terms of reference for all consulting services contracts; and (vii) all
consultants contracts based on a single source or of a critical nature. The Bank would carry out a post-review of
procurement by eligible indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations on a sample basis during supervision.
CONPLADE-IN would recruit auditors who would not only examine financial implementation but also
procurement procedures and physical implementation in the field. These auditors would carry-out annual audits
on the basis of a sample not lower than 50% of the Bank-financed investments in the first two project years and
40% in the remaining years.

Consulting services include contracts to carry out: (i) training; (ii) support to land regularization
activities; (iii) preparation of legal reforms; (iv) pre-investments studies; (v) support to subproject
implementation; (vi) monitoring and evaluation; (vi) accounting, control, and management information studies;
and (vii) project coordination. Training, consisting of workshops, study tours, and (degree) courses, includes the
cost of the trainers' and trainees fees and scholarships, rental of training facilities, per diem of trainees or
scholarships and materials required for the training activities. Grants for community subprojects would include
civil works, goods, equipment, and agricultural inputs for eligible beneficiaries. Goods and equipment under
grants for community subprojects include, inter alia, basic construction goods, tools, spare parts, basic machinery
and furniture. Incremental operating expenditures include expenditures for travel, office rental, office materials
and supplies, utilities, office and equipment maintenance, field materials and per diems. The term agricultural
inputs means seeds, fertilizers and a positive list of chemicals to be included in the Operational Manual.
Once a grant for a community subproject is approved, a tri-partite contract would be signed between
CONPLADE-IN, the sponsoring agency (including contractors, NGOs) and the participating communities. The
contract would specify the works, goods, equipment, inputs to be purchased as well as the contribution of the
communities to the investment. After signing of the tri-partite contract, CONPLADE-IN would disburse a first
payment under the provisions of the tri-partite contract based on the agreed disbursement schedule into a
subproject account of the sponsoring agency. The community contribution would be computed as part of
counterpart finance of the project. Simple, standard records, whose format would be included in the Operational
Manual, would be completed by a designated community representative. They would be used to record cash
contributions, materials and labor inputs and would be subject to project and audit procedures.
Disbursements would be made on the basis of full documentation for all expenditures made under
contracts requiring prior Bank review as indicated in Table B, and amendments to contracts raising the value of
such contracts above the prior review limits. For all other expenditures (goods, works and individual consulting
services with a contract value below US$50,000, and consulting services provided by firms/NGOs/Universities,
with a contract value below US$100,000) disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure
(SOE) for which supporting documents would be maintained by CONPLADE-IN and would be available for
Bank staff review. Special efforts would be made for the selective review of SOE documentation by visiting
Bank missions and auditors.
A Special Account in US dollars would be opened at the Central Bank of Ecuador or a commercial bank
acceptable to the IBRD. The Special Account would have an authorized allocation of US$2.5 million. The
authorized allocation would be limited to US$1 million until the withdrawals have reached US$ 5 million. The
Bank would replenish the Special Account for the amount of withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at
the request of the Borrower on a monthly basis.
The disbursement mechanism for the credit component (financed by IFAD) will be as follows: (i)
IFAD's credit funds will be deposited in the Central Bank of Ecuador or a commercial bank acceptable to the
Administrator. The account will be in US dollars and in the name of the Project; (ii) CONPLADE-IN will sign
"subsidiary loan agreements for the transfer of funds, rights and obligations" with one or more financial
institutions supervised by the SB; and (iii) after signing the subsidiary loan agreements, CONPLADE-IN will
open a credit line for the signatories of the agreement. These IFIs will manage the discounted funds according to
the provisions of the credit by-laws previously agreed upon between the CONPLADE-IN and IFAD.
The advance for 2 project preparation advances (PPF) in the aggregate amount of US 1,450,000 would be
refinanced from the proceeds of the loan. Retroactive financing of up to US$2.5 million would be permitted for
eligible expenditures made in accordance with procurement procedures agreed under the project from September
1, 1997, provided that the loan is signed not later than September 1, 1998. If the loan is signed at a later date, the
initial date for eligibility of expenditures for retroactive financing would be modified so that the period covered
by retroactive financing would be no more than one year. Retroactive financing is recommended to ensure that

participatory planning efforts and institutional strengthening activities of implementing agencies both from the
public and private sector can go ahead for project effectiveness.
Financial Management
Organization. A small administrative unit, consisting of a project administrator and treasurer, has
already been operating in a satisfactory manner since the early stages of project preparation. Under the project,
the Project Management Unit would include a sub-unit which will be responsible for all financial management
aspects of the project. The sub-unit would be headed by a coordinator whose qualifications will be in line with
requirements of the Contraloria General del Estado and who will be selected following a competitive process.
In addition, the sub-unit would include an accountant, a treasurer and a budget person. Each regional office of
CONPLADE-IN would employ one administrator/accountant who would be responsible for administrative
aspects at the regional level under the guidance of the project central office in Quito and the regional project
coordinator. Detailed TORs of all positions related to the financial management aspects of the project have been
included in the Operational Manual.
Budgeting. It was agreed during Negotiations that CONPLADE-IN would present by November 15 of
each year an Annual Operating Plan for the subsequent year to the Bank for review and approval. The Annual
Operating Plan would include an annual budget specified according to project components, expenditure
categories and disbursement accounts, including counterpart funds. The budgeting process would be essentially
bottom-up. Based on progress achieved and in collaboration with the Comites Consultivos Regionales,
CONPLADE-IN's regional offices would submit budget proposals to the Project Management Unit in Quito.
The PMU would consolidate the proposals in a single Plan to be presented and discussed with the Comite
Consultivo Nacional. The Project Cost Tables would be used as a point of reference in the budgeting process.
Accounts, CONPLADE-IN will establish and maintain project accounts to record all project transactions
from the commencement of project execution. The accounts shall be maintained in accordance with
internationally and locally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank. The
accounting system will be divided by project component, expenditure category, and disbursement account and
will consolidate these accounts to prepare financial reports. CONPLADE-IN would also maintain a register of
assets purchased with project funds. The supporting documentation will be kept by CONPLADE-IN for at least
one year after the last disbursement of funds for the project and until it has been examined by the project's
auditors. The information will be available at any time for review by the Government, World Bank Missions
and/or independent auditors.
CONPLADE-IN has already built up an accounting system on a modified accrual basis for the
administration of two PPFs and one Japanese Grant during the project preparation process. A recently performed
audit by the Contraloria General del Estado following Ecuadorian norms, which are comparable to the norms
recommended by the International Federation of Accountants, gave an unqualified opinion regarding financial
statements, Special Accounts, and SOEs as well as the standards of record keeping and internal controls.
However, the present accounting system needs to be upgraded to cover the expanded scope of activities
contemplated under the project. For this reason it was agreed during Negotiations that CONPLADE-IN before
January 1, 1998, with resources from the on-going PPF, would contract an accounting firm or consultant to
review, recommend and start implementing design changes of the processes and system of management of funds
using a decentralized structure which is able to monitor project progress based on agreed indicators and
disbursements following project components, expenditure categories, sources of financing and any other
requirements. These changes would include steps to further computerize the current accounting system. Once
the project would be effective, CONPLADE-IN would contract an independent private auditor under a multiple
year contract acceptable to the Bank, which would assist the institution in further bringing the systems and
processes in line with the required Bank standards and subsequently perform the external audit under terms of
reference agreed with the Bank.

Intemnal contrIol The internal controls which are already in place under project preparation have proven
to be adequate. These include among other: (i) a clear separation of functions between the project coordinator
and the administrative subunit and among the personnel within the administrative subunit; (ii) detailed
specification of required documentation to authorize payments; (iii) verification of budget allocation and
availability of funds before payment authorization; (iii) the functioning of a procurement committee; and (iv) a
reduced number of persons authorized to sign checks. The internal control already in place will be consolidated
under the project. As the scale of operations under the project expands so will the number of administrative
personnel, allowing for an even more refined division of responsibilities than was the case during project
preparation. As part of the annual reporting requirements, CONPLADE-IN would also conduct a physical
counting of assets on hand and comparing these with the accounting records. The establishment of Comite
Consultivos at the regional and national level, consisting of representatives of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
organizations, provides for an important social control mechanism within the project.
Reporting. It was agreed during Negotiations that CONPLADE-IN would prepare a mid-year and annual
report by July 31 and January 31 during the project period. The reports would provide a clear linkage between
financial accounting information and the project monitoring indicators included in the Supplemental Letter to the
Loan Agreement. Financial accounting information included in the reports would indicate source and application
of funds during the current financial year and cumulatively since the start of the project. Comparisons of actual
expenditures would be shown against budgets agreed upon in Annual Operating Plans at the beginning of each
fiscal year and explanations would be provided for significant variations.
Aud.its CONPLADE-IN would hire independent private auditors satisfactory to the Bank under a
multiple year contract to audit on an annual basis the financial statements, the Special Account and SOEs. In
addition, the auditors would prepare a (long-forn) report on project management. The audit reports would
convey the auditor's opinion and comment as necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the
SOEs, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for financing in terms of the project's
legal agreements and standards of record keeping and internal controls related to the foregoing. Copies of the
audit reports would be provided to the Bank within four months of the end of each state fiscal year. The final
version of the Operational Manual will include detailed terms of reference for the auditors, following the
guidelines included in the World Bank's Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook.
In addition, CONPLADE-IN would contract external auditors to evaluate the success of investments
financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject objectives, and the quality,
efficiency, and sustainability of the investments. For each subproject in the sample, the audits would focus on
the following points: (i) the adequacy of the physical design in relation to the subproject's objective; (ii) the
quality and cost of subproject execution; (iii) the efficiency of procurement procedures used, including the
transparency of the process and the quality of the documentation to complete SOEs; and (iv) the targeting of
project beneficiaries. The physical performance review would provide an indication of the effectiveness of
community-based procurement, compliance with and/or needed adjustments to cost indicators, physical/financial
indicators and to the formats included in the operational manuals, and the quality of project investments and the
profile of distribution of project benefits. The annual physical performance review would be conducted annually
on the basis of TORs agreed with the Bank and included in the Operational Manual.

ECUADOR: INDIGENOUS AND AFRO-ECUADORIAN PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT
Project Preparation and Implementation Arrangements
A. Project Preparation
Project preparation formally started in FY95 following a request from the Ecuadorian Government for a
loan which would specifically benefit the poor indigenous and afro-ecuadorian population of the country. The
first year of project preparation was mainly characterized by working out the terms, conditions, and institutional
arrangements under which the GOE and indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations would work together to
prepare the project. After a long negotiation process, in which the Bank played an important intermediary role, a
Government-Indigenous Project Management Committee was established (Comite de Gesti6n). Based on the
participatory model ofjoint decision-making, this Committee has been fully responsible for the strategic and
operational aspects of the project preparation process. Project preparation really started in FY96 with the
implementation of a series of studies and the launching of a pilot project, reflecting the proposed activities to be
carried out under the project.
During the project preparation process, the institutional framework has undergone major changes. These
changes themselves have prolonged the project preparation process. Initially, overall coordination for project
preparation was the responsibility of the Secretaria Nacional de Asuntos Indigenas y Minorias Etnicas
(SENAIN). Under the Duran Ballan Government, SENAIN was located in the Office of the President. It was
never fully recognized by the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian grassroots organizations. The Bucaram
Government created the Ministerio Etnico Cultural (MEC). Although SENAIN remained responsible for
coordinating project preparation, it mainly focused to define its role vis-A-vis MEC during this period, thereby
slowing down project preparation. The establishment of the current interim Government with the help of the
indigenous leaders in Congress paved the way for the creation of the Consejo Nacional de Planifi caci6n de
Desarrollo Indigenay Negro (CONPLADE-IN). Building on the institutional structure of the Comitd de Gesti6n,
CONPLADE-IN is governed by a joint Government-Indigenous Directorate under the Presidency of the
Secretario Nacional de Administraci6n. At the operational level CONPLADE-IN is managed by a Secretario
Ejecutivo, appointed after nomination by the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations. CONPLADE-IN is
fully recognized by the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations and has the full support of the current
government.

C. Project Implementation
The implementation of the project includes the following organizations: (a) indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian membership organizations; (b) the National Planning Council for Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian
Development (Consejo Nacional de Planiflcaci6n y Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas y Negros,
CONPLADE-IN); (c) the National Institute for Agrarian Development (Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo
Agrario, INDA); (d) the Ecuadorian Institute for Forests and Natural and Wildlife Areas (Instituto Ecuatoriano
Forestaly de Areas Naturalesy de Vida Silvestre, INEFAN). In addition, the project provides for the contracting
of NGOs and Universities to assist in project implementation.
Indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations. These organizations which operate at the
local, regional and national level are the legitimate representatives of the beneficiaries of the project. There exist
2,325 grassroots organizations at the community level, 160 second-tier organizations and 6 national
organizations of which the Confederacion de Nacionalidades Indigenas de Ecuador (CONAIE) is the most
powerful one. Without loosing their independence, national organizations have formed an umbrella organization
called the Comite del Decenio. Indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations can obtain juridical status through
registration in the Registro de Comunas, managed by the Ministry of Agriculture or in the Registro de

Country: Ecuador                                      Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadonan Peoples Development Project
Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil, managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare. The project will only benefit
and cooperate with organizations organized into legally-constituted entities. The project will provide technical
assistance to legally register indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations which do not have juridical status
Under the Ley de Organizaciony Re'gimen de las Comunas ( published in the Registro Oficial No. 558 on
August 6, 1937), the leadership of community-based organizations consists of the Executive body (Cabildo), and
the General Assembly (Asamblea General). The Cabildo comprises the President, Vice-President, Secretary,
Treasurer, Sindico, and the Coordinators of any special working groups within the community. These officials
get elected by the Asamblea General for a period of one year. The Cabildo legally represents the community in
all official acts and has the authority to sign contracts on behalf of the community. It meets on a monthly basis
and in case important decisions have to be taken, matters will be discussed in the Asamblea General.
Alternatively, community-based organizations can register themselves in the Ministry of Social Welfare as
Centros with a similar characteristics and provisions as described above. However, since the procedure to obtain
legal status as a Centro is relatively straightforward, a large number of indigenous communities, particularly
among the Shuar, have obtained juridical status as Centros.
Second and third tier indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations usually obtain juridical status by
registering themselves in the Registro de Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil of the Ministry of Social Welfare.
The leadership of these organizations consists of the Congreso, the Asamblea de Delegados and the Comite
ejecutivo. The Congreso has the highest authority in the organization and consists of two delegates and two
alternates of all affiliated associations. The Asamblea de Delegados consists of one principal delegate and one
substitute. The Comite Ejecutivo is elected by the Congreso for a period of two years and consists of the
President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretario de actas y comunicaciones, Secretario de conflictos, Secretario
de Organizaci6n, Secretario de deportes, Secretario de prensa y propaganda, and the Secretario de auxilio y
socorro.
Given their existing institutional capacity, experience and orientation, the project would particularly
cooperate with second-tier organizations as sponsoring agencies for sub-project identification, preparation and
implementation. These organizations would be responsible to organize a participatory planning process among
their member communities to formulate and prioritize ideas and submit sub-project proposals to the Regional
Project Committee of CONPLADE-IN for approval. The Cabildos, after having consulted with their respective
Asambleas Generales, should sign off on these proposals, thereby indicating the commitment of the communities
to provide the required counterpart contribution of the sub-project. Once a sub-project has been approved, a tri-
partite contract would be signed between the second-tier organizations, the participating Cabildos and
CONPLADE-IN. Subsequently, the funds to implement the sub-project are passed to the second-tier
organization, which would be responsible for all procurement and record-keeping during the implementation of
the sub-project. The contract also binds the cabildos and/or second-tier organizations to provide the necessary
counterpart contribution to implement the sub-project and the future operation and maintenance of the sub-
project.
In order to assume the above described responsibilities, the second-tier organizations should meet
specified minimum institutional eligibility criteria. Organizations which do not meet these requirements could
team up with an NGO which does meet them. Second-tier organizations lacking institutional capacity also
qualify for institutional strengthening efforts financed under the project.
Given their orientation, the project would particularly work with the third-tier organizations, organized in
the Comite de Decenio, in the areas of policy and legal reforrns. For this purpose, CONPLADE-IN would enter
into contracts with these organizations. The contracts would specify expected outputs and the participatory
process to be followed to reach consensus on selected policy and legal reforms.
National Council for Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian Development (CONPLADE-IN). CONPLADE-IN
was created by Presidential Decree of March 13, 1997 (CONPLADE-IN Decree) as the successor to the National

Country: Ecuador                                      Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project
Secretariat of Indigenous Affairs and Ethnic Minorities (the Ministry of Cultural and Ethnic Affairs that had a very
limited "life" was disestablished on February 28, 1997). CONPLADE-IN was granted juridical personality and is
formed by the General Secretary of Public Administration (who will preside it) and a representative each of the
indigenous and afro-ecuadorian national organizations. There are six national indigenous organizations and a
smaller number (not yet clear) of afro-ecuadorian organizations. The Executive National Secretary has ministerial
rank and legally represents CONPLADE-IN. CONPLADE-IN's powers are defined in article 4 of the
CONPLADE-IN Decree and include among others, in respect of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian peoples of
Ecuador: (a) policy formulation; (b) execution of development programs; (c) coordination of projects and
programs; (d) ensuring the participation of other sectors and institutions in their development; and (e) related
promotion, studies and projects.
CONPLADE-IN's principal tasks under the project will include: (i) project planning and coordination at
the national level through the preparation of the Annual Operating Plan; (ii) promotion of the project and
encouraging participation of the indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations; (iii) preparation of project
implementation reports, following organization of monitoring and evaluation exercises; (iv) ensuring timely and
adequate provision of loan and state counterpart funds; (v) appraising and approving subproject proposals; (vi)
entering into sub-project contracts with sponsoring agencies and cabildos; (vii) entering into cooperation
agreements with INDA and INEFAN, to implement the project's land regularization activities; (viii) overseeing all
monitoring and supervision activities under the project to gauge compliance with project guidelines and to improve
the quality of sub-projects and project interventions, ensuring that environmental guidelines are followed; (ix)
preparing statements of expenditures (SOEs) and applications for reimbursement; and (x) ensuring that the Bank's
requirements concerning procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures are followed.
Under the project CONPLADE-IN would be strengthened to carry out these tasks. For this purpose a
Project Management Unit would be established, consisting of four sub-units reflecting the four main components of
the project and a project administration unit. Up to seven regional offices of CONPLADE-IN would be
strengthened to assist in the implementation of the Institutional Strengthening of Local Membership Organizations
Component and the Rural Investments Component. Each regional office would have a project coordinator,
administrative officer, procurement specialist and a mobile team, consisting of 4-6 professionals, responsible for
sub-project implementation assistance, monitoring and evaluation. A Comite Consultivo Regional will be created in
each region to facilitate close interaction with regional indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations. In addition,
training in specific areas will be organized for staff of CONPLADE-IN under the Institutional Development
Component of the project. To guide the project at the strategic level, CONPLADE-IN will create a Comite
Consultivo Nacional del Proyecto which consists of a representative of CONPLADE-IN and one of all indigenous
and afro-ecuadorian organizations operating at the national level. The Comite Consultivo will meet once every
trimester. It will provide strategic input in the elaboration of the Annual Operating Plans and give recommendations
to follow-up on the findings of Monitoring Reports. The representatives of the national indigenous and afro-
ecuadorian organizations in the Comite Consultivo will inform their membership organizations about project
progress.
National Agrarian Development Institute (INDA). INDA, established by article 23 of the Agrarian
Development Law, to replace the priory existing IERAC, is the institute authorized, among other, to adjudicate
State lands (mostly vacant or expropriated lands or those in possession of farmers for a specified period of time).
The AD Law authorizes INDA to issue titles under three different procedures, one (article 36, Legalization)
exclusively applicable to the indigenous communities and the other two applicable to all citizens, including
indigenous peoples (Articles 37, Adjudication, and Article 38, Other Adjudication). Article 9 of the Reglamento
Orgdnico y Funcional del INDA (Resoluci6n No. 2 RO/745 of July 25, 1995) provides a detailed description of
all the functions of the Institute.
The institutional structure of INDA is made up of the following bodies: (i) Board of Directors (Consejo
Superior); (ii) Executive Directorate; (iii) four functional Directorates; (iv) four Support Units; and (v) three line
Directorates. The Board of Directors includes representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of

Industries, the National Council for Development, Banco Nacional de Fomento, Federaciones Nacionales de
Cdmaras de Agriculturay de Ganaderos del Ecuador, and national indigenous, afro-ecuadorian or
organizations. The line Directorates include: (i) the Directorate for Land Regularization; (ii) the Directorate for
Registration and Property Information; and (iii) Regional Directorates in four regions: Central, Occidental,
Centro Oriental, and Austral. In addition to the four Regional Directorates, INDA comprises 16 Provincial
Offices. In reality, INDA currently lacks the personnel and the resources to carry out its mandate established by
the Agrarian Development Law of 1994. There is a serious back-log in the adjudication of lands. In order to
attend the most pressing cases, ONGs like CARE and FEPP have stepped in with their own resources to perform
functions of INDA.
Under the project CONPLADE-In would enter into specific implementation agreements with INDA for
the carrying-out of land regularization activities in selected areas. The implementation agreement, inter alia,
specifies final outputs, intermediary products, and the methodology (adopted before or at the time of the
agreement) to be followed. Field activities of the land regularization program would be carried out by selected
contractors (i.e surveyors) or NGOs under contract with CONPLADE-IN. INDA would be responsible to
monitor the implementation of these contracts and based on the defined intermediary products advise
CONPLADE-IN on payment of installments specified in the contracts with these NGOs. To allow INDA to
carry-out these monitoring and evaluation activities some selected provincial offices would be strengthened and a
small unit of staff would be established in INDA's head office.
Ecuadorian Institute for Forests and Natural and Wildlife Areas (INEFAN). Ecuadorian Institute for
Forests and Natural and Wildlife Areas (Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales y de Vida Silvestre
(INEFAN) created by Law No. 8 of September 14, 1992 (the INEFAN Law) owns, under Article 12 (a) (c) and
(d) of the INEFAN Law, the national forest patrimonium (Patrimonio Forestal del Estado) and the protected
areas (Parrimonio de Areas Naturales). INEFAN is authorized to demarcate lands included in the Patrimonio
Forestal del Estado for indigenous peoples.
INEFAN is an autonomous institution linked to the recently created Ministry of Environment. Its
sources of funding are the national treasury and revenues it receives from park entrance fees, tariffs from tourism
operators, and fines for illegal logging and hunting. The INEFAN Law allows it to keep these revenues and to
use them in the operation and maintenance of the reserve areas system. As an autonomous entity, INEFAN has
the faculty to sign contracts with other entities and/or individuals to carry out its mandate. Organizational units
at headquarters include: (i) the Executive Directorate; (ii) three line Directorates: Forestry, Wildlife and
Protected Areas; and Training and Research; (iii) three functional Directorates: Planning, Legal, and Budget and
Management; and (iv) administrative support units. The Board of Directors is composed of five ministers
(Environment, Agriculture, Energy and Mines, Tourism and Defense) and two private sector representatives
(from timber industry and NGOs). An Advisory Board to the Board of Directors is made up of representatives
from indigenous communities, small industries, and national biology and forestry associations. In addition,
INEFAN has seven regional offices which are allowed to make every day decisions. Each district coordinates
the management of forestry activities and of protected areas within its jurisdiction. It also oversees, identifies
and implements conservation, development and recuperation programs for natural resources within its
boundaries. Districts also provide technical assistance to local communities and collect monitoring data for
projects within its jurisdiction. The organization structure of each district includes: a district chief, and advisory
board, a technical coordination board, a project's technical unit, and a legal and administrative support unit. The
advisory board is a coordination unit which includes representatives from provinces' governors, indigenous
communities, army, education directorates, agriculture centers and timber industry.
Under the project CONPLADE-IN would enter into specific implementation agreements with INEFAN
for the preparation and implementation of participatory management plans in forestry and protected areas. The
cooperation agreement, inter alia, specifies final outputs, interrnediary products, and the methodology to be
followed. Implementation of cooperation agreement would be the responsibility of INEFAN, which for this
purpose would be strengthened in selected regional offices and at headquarters.

Country: Ecuador                                      Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project
NGOs. The term NGO is most commonly used to refer to developmental intermediary organizations that
work with and channel resources to the poor, but do not represent them. They include voluntary organizations
with a charitable focus as well as research and advocacy organizations. Various sources estimate their number
between 500 and 600, although no complete lists of surveys of intermediary NGOs in Ecuador exist. They have
become increasingly important actors in basic service provision and poverty alleviation in Ecuador.
The relationships of NGOs with the State in Ecuador can best be described as "coexisting"; the attitude
of NGOs towards Government has been critical but seldom antagonistic. There appear to exist two modes of
operation: (i) partial substitution in which NGOs attend to the needs of certain social groups not covered by
government programs; and (ii) complementing regular government services in which NGOs have been
contracted by state agencies to perform certain functions. In general, these NGO-State relationships are still
characterized by a certain degree of distrust. State agencies want NGOs for specific short-termn implementation
tasks while NGOs generally seek longer-term more complete involvement in projects, including identification,
design and monitoring. Governments are reluctant to pay for NGO overheads or administrative costs.
The overall implementation capacity of NGOs varies greatly and remains largely untested. The
demonstrated strengths of NGOs in Ecuador include: (i) use of participatory approaches to and beneficiary
involvement in implementation; (ii) knowledge of local context and willingness to experiment with alternative
technologies which can be ecologically sustainable; (iii) orientation to poor and specific vulnerable groups; and
(iv) the demand-driven orientation and concern for good governance. These strengths tend to be tempered with
shortcomings in the areas limited coverage, lack of efficiency in economies of scale, little or no impact on wider
policy issues, spotty monitoring and evaluation procedures, and in many instances, weak management and
administrative procedures, NGOs generally do not evaluate and learn from their projects and often remain
unaccountable to their beneficiaries. They have difficulties in developing longer-range institutional goals and
plans.
Where indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations lack institutional capacity, NGOs
could act as sponsoring agencies for the identification, preparation, and implementation of rural community
investments. In order to ensure learning-by doing the project would stimulate the forrnation of partnerships
between NGOs and indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations in such cases. Under the project,
NGOs will also play an important role in the implementation of land regularization activities. For this purpose
they would enter into contracts with CONPLADE-IN, while implementation of these contracts would be
monitored by INDA. Furthermore, CONPLADE-IN would contract eligible NGOs to carry out institutional
strengthening activities of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian membership organizations.
D. Project Monitoring and Evaluation
The demand-driven character of most project activities makes the ex-ante determination of key
parameters difficult, thereby increasing the need for effective ex-post control. The objectives of the project
monitoring system are to: (i) provide information regarding the progress of the project and the status of the
subproject cycle in its different stages (subproject approval, procurement, implementation and disbursement; and
(ii) verify that project activities are consistent with the guidelines included in the operational manuals.
The project would set-up an in-house monitoring and evaluation system, which would collect data
concerning: (i) physical and financial information for each subproject; (ii) financial management, allowing the
generation of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs); and (iii) project management, allowing the generation of
project reports specified according to expenditure category, component, source of financing, and geographical
region. The system would work as a network to facilitate deconcentrated operation and use.

Country: Ecuador                                        Project Title: Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples Development Project
The monitoring indicators would be divided into: (i) input indicators to track project activity progress;
(ii) output indicators; (iii) effect indicators; and (iv) impact indicators, following the model presented in section
E. below.
The information input in the system would come from various sources including: (i) a subproject data
sheet containing basic information from the subproject proposal and the tri-partite contract; (ii) a supervision
data sheet verifying information on the subproject data sheet, identifying implementation problems and possible
mitigating measures and reporting relevant effects; and (iii) implementation progress of contracts and
cooperation agreements concerning institutional strengthening activities of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian
organizations and support to land and water regularization activities. The system will provide the basis to
improve project implementation and provide information facilitating the elaboration of Annual Operating Plans.
In order to evaluate project effects and impacts, CONPLADE-IN would be responsible to carry out the
following activities. First, CONPLADE-IN would contract external auditors to evaluate the success of
investments financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject objectives, and the
quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the investments. For each subproject in the sample, the audits would
focus on the following points: (i) the adequacy of the physical design in relation to the subproject's objective;
(ii) the quality and cost of subproject execution; (iii) the efficiency of procurement procedures used, including
the transparency of the process and the quality of the documentation to complete SOEs; and (iv) the targeting of
project beneficiaries. The physical performance review would provide an indication of the effectiveness of
community-based procurement, compliance with and/or needed adjustments to cost indicators, physical/financial
indicators and to the formats included in the operational manuals, and the quality of project investments and the
profile of distribution of project benefits. The annual physical performance review would be conducted annually
on the basis of TORs agreed with the Bank and included in the operational manual. Second, CONPLADE-IN
would contract eligible NGOs to conduct participatory evaluation through focus group discussions concerning
the implementation of local development plans. These will be provide qualitative data on the effect of
participatory planning activities executed under the project. Third, CONPLADE-IN would enter into an
agreement with the Secretaria Tecnica del Frente Social to ensure that the project area is adequately covered by
future poverty studies, which will enable to measure the poverty alleviation impact of the project.

F. Project Supervision
Responsibilities and Reporting.   Three types of reports would be generated and presented to the
Bank: (i) status of project implementation following the indicators mentioned in section E and an updated list of
subprojects with their physical, procurement, and disbursement status, provided on a monthly basis; (ii) a mid-
year project progress report, using standard formats agreed with the Bank including disbursements per category
of expenditure, component, source of financing and region, to be presented by July 31 of each year of project
implementation; and (iii) an annual report to be presented by January 31 of each year of project implementation,
using standard fonnats from the mid-year report but also a comprehensive review of project output, effect, and
impact indicators as mentioned in section E above.
World Bank Supervision. The Bank will carry out at least two regular supervision missions per year.
Regular supervision will entail: (i) review of mid-year and annual reports; (ii) a discussion of project
implementation problems identified by CONPLADE-IN; (iii) field visits to a random sample of community
subprojects, land and water regularization activities and local membership organizations included in the project's
institutional strengthening component; and (iv) review of project administration, management of accounts, SOEs,
procurement documentation, and disbursements request. In view of the diversity of community sub-projects,
consultants of different expertise would be contracted to provide occasional input and advice to bank missions.
Two full supervision reports would be issued annually. The schedule of project supervision is as
follows:
*  by July 31 and January 31 of each year, presentation of mid-year and annual reports from CONPLADE-IN to
the Bank;
-  by August and February I of each year, full Bank supervision missions completed; and
= by November 15 of each year, presentation of Annual Operating Plan for the subsequent year to the Bank for
review and approval.
Two years after effectiveness, the Bank would carry out a mid-term Review to evaluate the performance
of the project. Two months before such review would take place, the Government and the Bank would agree on
detailed terms of reference and staffing of the mid-termn Review team. In addition to the items included in the
TORs of regular supervision missions as mentioned above, the mid-term review team would particularly look at
the management capabilities of indigenous and afro-ecuadorian organizations and CONPLADE-IN for the
implementation of the project and identify any changes that might be required.
