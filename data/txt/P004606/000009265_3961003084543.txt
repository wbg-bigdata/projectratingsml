Mount:                US$200 million
Ta:                   20 yeas, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable intrest
rate
DulrJnogn:             ETh , roposed program supports the consolidaton of a suitable medium-term
frmework in which structural reform, coupled with debt and de1' service
can be implemented in a growth-orented manner. Ihe program
addresses those areas which are considered essnial for integrg  all regions
of the Philippine economy with the rest of the world. These include: (i)
maroconomic management through improvement of Central Bank finances
and appropriate energ pricing policies; Qi) promotion of investment through
implementation of a new  foreigp  investment act, privazation and
encourgemet of private participation in   fastructure project; (iii)
ratonalizadon of the tariff regime and remova of quantitative restrictions on
imports; (iv) introducton of greatsr competiton into land and sea wanport;
ad (v) removal of retictions on foeig  exchange ansactons on both the
curr   and capital accou. The loan would finance general imports of
goods at a time when freign resves are being reduced by the needs of the
debt and debt sevice reduction opao  and an inciient investment
reovery.
ad Rift:       The mai benefit from the loan will derive from the Support it wll give to the
Governments efforts to achieve a more compeotive economy. The indicatrs
of success would be (i) a substial increase in private foreign and domestic
investmnt; (ii) a more efficiet allocation of resources thanks to trade reform,
coupled with more effective domestic import-sbstiton brought about by
more competve internal transport; ad (iii) greater macecnmic stability
in te face of exnal shocks. Ihe main risk relate to possible delays or
inadequate impleaon of refori, if instability in the forep exchage
mart canot be managed through noal            mic means, especially
if fiscal balances deteiore. However, there is a high level of Government
comunitment to the refrm  and many pd,ro actions have already been tak



ihe proposed loan would be disbursed in two tranches, of US$120 million and
US$80 million equivalent respectively. The first tranche would be available
upo  ffcdveness of the loan and the second tranche would be released upon
completion of agreed acstons, expected to be In the third quarter o; 1993.

PR) ws distrbd on Februy 20, 1992. The Presidens Report on the Second Vocaional Tranig
Project (Repor;. Ilo. P 5732-PH), which was distributed on May 11, 1992, also contDas an update on
reo    economic develpments and on the Bank's asiste strteg. A briefig note on the recently
nded  debt and debt servke reduetion (DDSR) agreement with commecal bans was diributed to
the Board on September 25, 1992.
2.         Following a peaceful and democratic trasion of power for the first time in m    than
twenty yeas, the new AdIIstatio of Prident Ramos has sought to develop a growth-oriend
adjutmn prom focsn  on world competveness in producton and people empome
domldlRy. The first stVp in is program has been the successfu conclusin of a comprehive
8_COCM tD restrctue   medium  nd long term extra debt held by cmmerild banks (see Bridefing
Not, SaM-lZ73). t is neoked that the full beb of this W         would only be adcived if
paralll ac   no are tn on a             stabiliaon prgm and alo on strut  mesures to
Integrate th Phipineconomy more closely widt the         economy. ITe Government, aided
by the Bank through its poliqy diaogue, has deloped a broad program of reom to complement Is debt
reducto program, building on the policis put In place by the Aquino Adminion. The main
ecoomic develop_ent ismes undelying the Govmen's policy agenda, and the BankWs strateg and
suppt for ti program, are smumarized beow.
B. Poic         in the 19ft
S.         Alowugh the Philippine econmy grew strongy in the 1970s, by around 6.5 prcet per
ye, the n    for strca  adjusmt was evident by dhe end of the decade. Externa debt had rapidly
to 53 perct of GDP by 1980 and the heavy inven    ir      t o geerate growth
had produced unsustainable curmret accou  deficb of over 8 percen  The public corpoate sector was
epning rapidly into high risk, capital intensive projects. Foreig capital was beig    iated into
piate           through public financial         without adequat supervision or 
of projt di. And industri sr  growth was incrasingly ring on cotucdon in tie nontaded
goods soeor, rathr ta on fier              growth. Tbes defects in the growth proces were
appr  In tbe  lure to ahieve asubstantia t s ationIntructure of employmen towwads the
fbra we earing sector, and In the abce of dgnificant progrs In reducing poverty. The



-2-
Identfied problem, theW, was to raise the efficiency of Ivetnt trough displined demand
and through a mediumterm adjustm  program targeted at reructuring of the industria
sectr, finanial irdiation and energ pricing.
4.         The Philippin has progressed significanty in implementing this adjusn program. Since
1983, and particaly since the mge in Government In 1986, the authorities have made concerted
efts to correct a wide array of structua problems. Reforms in agricultura pricing and marketing,
theofinan    sector, privadzaon, trade and tariff liberadization, direct and indirect taxes and invesment
incenives he been undetakn, along with procedumes to set priorMies for public Investments. Sugar
and coconut mowpolies hav been disbanded, interest rates are now determined by market forces, the
bias twards capi ntensity in investment incentives has been effectively removed, the Board of
lyonve_ has steamlined procedur  and taken on a more promotional role, a value added tax and
Imved income tax measures have been  iplemented reducing tax disbrtions, and trade reorm has
been pursued. Taken together, these measures have subnll opened the economy to competiton and
correctd majr policy-induced intenal distortions.
5.         The reform effort of the Philippines has received substanil support from the intermational
cmmqunity. The Bank has provided broad support for the implementation of structura reforms with a
sies of policy4ased structural and sectotal adjustment loans, and the IMP has supported the
Govemmept with program In place on an uninterupted basis since 1985. Official donors have provided
sgnificn new resource flows through the mechanism of the Philippines Assistance Program/Multil*eru
A.htme Initiative, commit  about US$8 bilion over the last three years. At the same tdme, the
pWiippins has sgt to reduce its external debt sernce burden through a seres of rescheduling
_greemm with the Paris Club and private cotmercial banis. In addition, a combination of debt
re on, Intate - including a debt buybacL in 1990 supported by officia donors - have led to a total
cmmerci debt reduction of over US$3.3 billion as of the end of 1991.

6.        Depitsuccesses in strcturd reforms and an initrecovery of growth between 1986"89,
the twin goals of stabilization and sustainable growth have eluded the Govemment. Slippage in fiscal and
monetay policy in late 1989, together with the Gulf crisis and an unprented s&des of natural
disste_,undermined econmic perfmance. The fiscal and current account deficits worened in the
second part of 1989, and these woisome developments coninuedduing 1990, result  in a slowdown
of growth to 2 percen
7.         Ihe worening of fiscal balances in 1990 has been the most important cause of the poor
econamic perfman. The deficit of the consolidat public sector increased from 4.2 percent of GDP
in 1989 to 5.3 percen In 1990. The delay in adjustng domestic oil prices to changes in the exchange
at and ntaona pries led t a large deficit in the Oil Price Stabilizaion Fund (OPSF), compounded
by gowg domestic Interest rates as the Governmet sought to protect the deficit by mainining an
ovaled eoxha    rate. The fiscal imbalances were therefore also reflected in the deterioration of the
&ten  ban  - the current account defict increased from 2.5 to over 5 percent of GDP.
8.        The 1990 developments upset the Government's macroeconomic program, supported by an
Exteded Pund Facility agreed with the IMF in March 1989 and subseently revised in November 1989.
In NOvmber and Decenmber 1990, the Goveme  took corrective measures, and frmuted a
stabin  progm focusing on tightr fiscal and monetay policy that won the support of an BE
Staod-By Arngement in March 1991. A Budget Summit was held between the Execuive and the

Lgaw brandhes, rdlng In an Wreemen to llmit th 1991 budget at the same nominal lvd as
1990; domsdc oil prices wer brought In line with intern *nal prices; an import surcharge of 9 pecn
was IntoduOd as an additioa temporary reveaue measure; the exchange rae was allowed to diprecat
by abot 25 percent; and rSeve reqiemet On commercia bak deposits wee rise from 21 to 25
percen.
9.         Overl, the Government has made considerable progress in achieving iS stabilizadon goas,
even              within the original targes major expenditures for disaster relief The deceeati
of economic activity and  e effts of th irport surchargv - together wi the decline In itaiona
oil pices and Iest rates - have led to a subntial Improvement in extel b  s and allowed a
lWe increase in interna teserves by about US$2.5 billion in 1991. Ihe decline In domesdc nomina
Interest tes, following a mar  exchange rate deprecialon in late 1990, and the hap reductin in
capial    etsin te fir half of 1991 have led to a large improvement in the National Gownment
(NM  deficit  he deficit of t!s OPSF has also been mfmd  Ito a modest surplus, allowing for a
rcduon of domestic oil prices of about 14 percent in Augu  1991, again In December 1991 and most
reety In May 1992. All told, the consolidated public sector deficit for 1991 was 2.7 percent of GNP,
coompard with a program target of 3.5 percent of GNP, a significant accomplishnt, and an important
bads for the proposed operation.
10.        Achievement of the stabilization targets has not been easy, because of the need to sterlize
lrge amout of forei  capital that have retned to the country. Sterzaion of these inflows bas
created an   asin in the supply of public domestic debt which, in tmn, has slowed the decline In
Inere  rtes. In addimon,    deficit of the Cental Bank of the Phippines (CBp) in 1991 has been
fnance through isng debt; but the reldng itest dcarges create e tations of future CBp deficits
ad an associated tra of inflationary money creadon. These factors are minting expected real
trstates in the Phlpines at levels which, at around 11 percent, are high compaed to i aionad
re. Bringi  down intre  ates is, therefore, seen as one of the key elements in the recovery of
pha-t investment
11.        The sharply contactonary monetary and fiscal stance has been successfully sustaind by
the Governent. through 1991 and 1992, creatig an emerging track record of decidsve m c
which, albeit at a high shorttem cost in tem  of foene growth, has   pired fresh
confidnce. Reuning flight capital, atrcted by high peso interest rates, has allowed the Cea  Bank
to puase over US$3 billion since 1991 In freign excha   markets, causg unacomed problems
with stiliztn and an appreciating crn. GDP has however delied in 1991, by I percent, and
has bee fat In th fist half of 1992, when an incipient recovery was choked off by competven
losses and sers enegy sh ges have reslted in duption of productve activi acros all sectors.
Howver, as emergqcy measures taken by the Govetnment to stem the energ crsis ar  mplemented
and as price stabiity is restored, the economy is expected to resume growth.
12.       In spite of substatl ptogress on fiscal consolidation - the public sector deficit ha been
reduced to a projected level of less dtan 2 percen of GNP in 1992 - moneaty mamgement problems,
read to the szeable exasion of foreig excag resves, led to a delay of the second review of the
IMP Stad-By Arrangemet, origily sedled fo April but actually completed in October. In the
contet of this rview, the Stsnd-BY has been extended through March 31, 1993.

13.        Despite the stcuctl tefom  Intied In the 1980s and he progress tn maco mic
stabato, the economy has yet to attan an efficin sustainable growth path. T1ree principal fator
hav consained progress. Fist, the recrd on Implemeatn  as been mied. The abity of the
Govetment to sustn a stable          c    nviraoment has been complicad, as tn many other
nwuls, by political presse and by the presence of high exten  debt. Teo debt burden has
prevened te consolided public sector dfick (incun the Cnta Bank) from being further reduced
in the absence of reseduling of ine    obligato. In addiio, high external debt obligations have
been  pnasble for large recrent deficis of the CBP, and the continued suscepiility of CBP net
Income -A  balance d     to excage rate movement has hurt the effectiveaess of monetary
14.        Second, economic pefomace has been csained by the high degree of uncraity
regrig the future course of policies. To some extent, his has resmted from political diffrences
bewe  the Govermet and 1he Leslate, but the station also owes in part to continued high
exten  debt obliaons. Ivmesto  in the Phipines face the prospect   fui   exteMnad transaons
may be dirupted by resictimpbsed oan trade or sapital flows. A history of such intventine exists;
in 1983 te Govment rolled back trade refos and Imposed quantiave restricto  on imports and
a complex import licensing scheme. In 1991, an acrosste-boa tariff surhg of 9 pecen was
imposed on hImrt. Feas of such actons tag place in the fuue persis -  Wgered by balance of
paynoo pressur  tha coud result ther from increases in global inest rates or from a faiure to
reach a raeduling acord wth creditor banks. Similarly, investors face the prspect tha domestc
poitic  preses could tier unilateral action lmiing exten  debt sevice and force a cosdy
mn_o wit- 1 ; h foe comm_           bobs.
15.        Thr, trad and inetm  refm have been more tentatve tan neesary, at leas in pat
becas of the foreig  excag presses t   have continuously resufaced whever growth has
recovered. As a result, the eo=nomy remains parialy protcted, unable to benit fully fom inegraton
withe rest of the world.

1991, to alow for highe proporo  oforeif equity ownership in most companies and to expand the
sect  where fg investment can fredy flow. As part of this exmsion, the Government has a

17.       In adton, th Govnmen has receny removed, In July 1992, most of the remlai
eroicto  (Qs) on. imprs, completing a process of tarifficatlon which was sated with
the first SAL in 1980. One of the key components of is procs, the liberaizaon of commril

by interat   htnal makets. It will be complemented by measures to roeuce the regulatory

had been removed. Thus, the Philppine Goverent has successfy reormed the forei  exchanp

I      d r    lst  ifparldy through borrowing to defend the peso in the ealUy 1980s and pardy truwgh the
prvisof foward cover to public corporations at nadeque price. The opeating deficits of the CBP
e nOW so larg as tO affect sgnIfntly Its cAaty to carry out an Indqedet monetary policy.
Indeed, if the CBP losses wer fuly monetized, nmfation would accelerate and the peso would depredate
shaply in nominal tems; In addtio, without leducng CBD  deficits, the proposed liberization of the
exchae rat coud not be sstained.
20.        As an essent  first step towards a cowprehensve soludo to the CDP finaci condiion,
US$960 milion of foreig  currency swas, entered wih domestic commercial ba    in 1983 and
subsquaey olled ov, have been uwoA  exiWngui             a costy foreign, crny lbit. In
addiion, the Treasmy plan to help finane the CDP dect by placing deposits with it at zero inteast,
by Isuing it a speW seies of htest beaing bonds and by budgetig for_. increae in CBP capital.
ians           needs to be follwed up by a aoe resucturing of ase  and liabilites of
th CBP - both domesdc and foreign - and an adequate hcra   in authrized CBP capital, as discussed
in detail in the Bas, 'CiU   Market SW   (Report No.10053-PH). Sepaate disci    are
procedi  with the CBP along dtese lines in collaboraton wih the ID.
21.        The Goveament refom program is supported by a program for the reducion of commaeal
bank extenal debt and debt service. Agreement on a ce rtcgt    of public restructured
extnal commercil bank debt wreached In outine in Augcat 1991, and it is being implmented in
stages: in Febrary, 19  the term st was issued; in May, 19  a cah buyback was concluded; in
July the agreement to restuctur remainig dets Into debt exchag bonds was signed; and in October,
1992 the deal was fially closed.

22.        Ibis debt staegy Is ecsary to allow thke Goveament to pursue a broadening and
deepg of the reform process with a consitet mediuterm financing plan in place, benefitting the
fisa siwution directly, by a reduction in eal interest servce, and indirecty, by a reduction in
domestc  est rt that should follow the opeaton, If the experience of otier countries following debt
retuction is any guide. Just as the debt agreement is crucial to allow the implementation and
sustainablity of the Goverament refbrm program, the ful benefits of the comprehensive debt agreement
reached with comnercial crditors will only be achieved if the operation proceeds in parallel with an
adequate ma;roeconomic stailization program and with strucural measures to itegrate the Philippine
eoomy more closely witi the itenational economy.
23.       (3overnmer acknowledgement of these priies for adion is based on the successes and
failur  of past policy expermes. Its commitment to action is rooted in the emergence of a window
of oppormity provided by the unprecedtd level of foreign exchange reserves built up over the past
year trougb efctive stabilization policies (although these have been reduced from a peak of US$5.4
billion reached in March to US$4 billion in September as a result of the reqirements for financing the
cash buyback, unwinding of Central Bank swaps and provision of collateral for debt exchange bonds) and
by the willinns of commacial banis to entertain a comprehensive debt setlement.
24.        Ihe current proposal for Bank assistance builds on these developments, and is based on three
pillars: firs, actions already undertaken by the Government, including several Iey legislative initves,
where the Bank has been actively enging the Goverme  through its policy dWogue; second, the
conclusion of the ageement between the Government and its commercial bank creditors, resolving
medum and long term commercial bank debt; and third, addtional actions by the Government to deepen
the reform effort

25.        The Governmt, aided by the Bank through Its poicy dWogue, has developed a broad
program of reform to complement its debt reduction program The reform agenda of the Aquino
Administration was spelled out in a medium-term program, *33m Philpine Agenda for Sued Qmoh
eomet, presented to and endorsed by the Consultative Group at its meeting in July 1989;
piogress reports on this agenda were presnted to and endorsed by CG meetngs in February 1991 and
1992. The new Adm     n    has expressed i desire to build on thi agenda and this is reflected In
is Letter of Development Policy (Arne U). Key deti ar  mmarized below. 1
26.        EgWim             3b Foieign IML       iI Act of June 1991 has subtantily libetalized
the environment for foreig investment. The passage of this legslation is a considerable step forward
in two important respects. Frst, it allows entry into all bar a few specified sectors on a short 'negative
i. he shift to a negative Hst makes the legiation tasparent and is accompanied by removal of the
requiremeot tht forein investonrs obtai authorizatio  from the Board of Investment. Second, 100
percent foreign equity is to be allowed in all bar a few sectors. Resticted areas Indclude public works
construco, natural resouce extraction, retai trade and a few selected professional activities. While
cert  manuf     n acdvities may be eligible for inclusion on the negative list ater a transitional period
of three years, the intent is to ensure that the list wil continue to be short by specifing crieia in a
transparent fashion in the Implementing Rules and Regulations.
' Reform in most of these areas has been supported by the Bank in the context of its
ongoing policy dialogue and discussions related to preparation of the Economic Inegration Program. Key
items are underined. They are so  dicatd in the Policy Mat  in Annex 3.

27.        The proposed Bank loan supports these foreign Investmen developmes and provides a
monitor of thek Inme Rides n     Regleadons falthis Act. e criteria under which sectors could
be addi to he negaive list for foreign investunet at a later date, once the transitional three year open
window i over, have beean 6fined in a supplementary appendix (issued in April 1992), wbich provides
for a more taparent system, but still leaves room for intpreto  and thus must be carefully
moniored. The policy hite, however, is to keep the negative list as short as possible, pardicularly in
manufacturig. In the futre, areas not covered by the Act, such as baking and tnsport, may also be
covered under secomr specific legislation. Other complementay measures to encourage foreign investment
relte to the fll and immediate repatration of dividends, profits and capital from all registered foreign
invesutm   embodied in the foreign exchange liberalization measures, and streamlining of procedures for
obtain work pemts for foreignps.
28.        & d elSsfekMMd        = Schemes. Mesures included inthe proposed loan would also
ennce private secor paticipation in BOT schemes. Pision of infastructre via BOT schemes is one
ara where sniicant foreign invest  is anticipated, and has been made possible by passage of an aI
S XBO   and by periodic approval of a listing of projects and sectors eligible for BOT. Pardy
becaus of low  maan  and investment by cash-strapped public enteprises, infrastructure has
emerged as a significant bottleneck to growth, with periodic breakdowns in power, water and transport
systems, and private participation in this sector will be crucial.
29.        The proposed loan includes the review of the gudelines for private sector access to ODA
on market terms. The domestic pvate sector is also expected to patcipate acdvely In BOT, espciay
In power and teleconicatins, but currently faces financa constraints. The local utC::3 companies
hav          the domestic baking ystem, and because of country risk, are cumntly unable to tap
financig sources. Meanwhile, foreign ODA is available for iatrucre projects but
canot be easly mobilized for private sector uses. The Government has consequently ised a set of
Impeing liRules and Regulations idicat how ODA may be cnnelled into private sector
infrructure projects on market, not concsonal, terms, and is discussing with the Bank altnative
for catalyzing private sector financing for i c ure.
30.        Prival. The Government has achieved consdrable success in is program of
pdvaaon of state corporans. Ihe World Bank's Govwtment Corporations Reform Program had
sported pivzation by reqiring that at least 50 percent of assets should be offered for sale before
second tranche release. The Government has progressed weU beyond this. It has etended the life of
th.e AM Pg irziaonTms -a key instition for managing privatization - unt December 1993, and
acieved a sales taret of 68 percent of public corporate assets. Several other big ticket items are being
preped for sale, including the Naon  Steel Corporatiand te Manila Hotel.  he Govnment is
also exploring pdvazan into further areas such as energ generaion, water boards and ports. The
proposed loan woud enend the support for privadzati  bond the tem   of the Government
Corpotions Reform Pogram, to ensure that the pace of priaization is maiained in a quatitave
Sea.
31.         i refornm. In August 1991, a new Tariff Code MO 470) was introduced with the
objecdve of euragng export-oriented growth by lowering nominal and efective protection, b.in:ulating
invement by reducing tariffs on capital goods, and simplifying CUstoms administration by reducing tariff
dispron and toe nmber of tariff band. Ihe program of tariff reform and trade liberalizaton -
inited in 1980 wih the first Philipine SAL - bas gone trough several stages. In 1980-82 and again
In 198649,   d          reductions of adminisave restctions on imports were accomplished, but, in
the inrm, extn  pyents cises were responsible for periodi intuptions of the implementation

of the tra  lbeaI atIon progra   Passage of the 1991 Tariff Code ra mJor adJustmet In
au. The averg  s mport-weigbted tarlff, which has been brougt down fiom 43 prcent in 1980 to
20 paeen currently, will be Arthr reduced to 14 prcet by July 1995, and with te elInatIon of most
quantative restriions tarlfs wi become the princpal source of protection for almost all domestically
prode tadable goods. Ih  mamnmum taff wi  be 30 percent (with a few eacepdons largly In
grdcultu  where a 50 perceat rate will apply), and thae would be just four tariff bands, considerably
reducin the ahnst   complexty of implementing the tariff code. In genal, raw materials and
capa goods Impt wll carry lower tarffs than consumer goods, but both the level and dispersion of
efectv prtectio rat  would also be brought down; the level of efective poction is scheduled to
fal fom 35 pecn to 28 peret in manuf     for  ample. Ihe phasing in of  iff reductions is
necess  to avoid hap losses in reveumo in the near term, and allows protected Industrie tim to adjust
tOD the nw regime, theeby secuing a broad political coalition In favor of refom. The pace of tariff
Wjusti,_    has been alrated with the removal of dt  etUraory acrosshboad import srcag
May 1992, and the reducto of intra-ASEAN trffs on a n uber of key products.
32.        Ihe 1991 Tariff Code did not cover some tems whee importation was previously govened
by qutiative restictons. Thus, the Government has Inrduced new taiff acording to the Code In
order to make opertonad both its eadlier decision to remove QRs on some 208 Iems and its recet
deciso to liberalize 68 addItional item. The Governent has aopted two principles in setting tarffs
on these Ims:  ) the transitional tariff rate is no more than double the sttory tariff rate that wil
pival afterJuly 1995 (with the sole exceptionof corn); and (i) these tariffs are to be phased outby July
1995.
33.        The reduction of tariff dispersion under the new Tariff Code and the removal of remaning
I--l WM'- restrcton on imports will simpfy considerably customs diniogmandive
efficie    of resourcal   on. This is to be firaer reinforced by meaures tan custms
i I I - -1   to strmline procedur, reduce smuggling and strengthen revenue collecon. The
Govermen has signed an          for a comprehensie imort s 4ulaneLshm   building on a
succesfu pflot project undertaken by a prvate firm, the Societe Generate de Surveillance. Furher
_uawW         will occur as the Govermet moves from Home Conumpton Value as the basis for impt
valation to a system of Fair Maket Value which is more widely used across the world. The Bank, in
claboration with tIhe MP, is also workng on additional measures to improve customs administation
wiho te objecie of raiing tadff collections towards their potential levels. Through the tariff rvision,
the Govm     has reted its policy of dc-emaing the role of tariffs in indusi and trade
prmoton. Th effectie tax on epore  associaed with tarffs should be reduced throu  te operatn
of newly e lied o-atop ahops for streamlining tax and duty drawbacks for exporters.
34.        Qr                .  Ihe Goverment I about to complete a significant program of
replaci  quanttaive restctons on imports with tariffs. Although in the beginng of 1992 the
PhilIppines no logr  had widespread QRs on imports, these still existed in a few selected are. Mm
has made a policy docision to remove ORs fFom 276 im= t  iems, ilu            a broad range
of consumer elecroc and agrcultal products, corn, commercial vehicles and related spare parts. The
liminaton of Qts on the importation of commercial vehicles is an Important stp towards reducing cost
in the tansport sector, and has broad likg  tioughout the economy. Similady, liberalizaton of corn
Is an impo_  meu  for the frter growth of the livestock industry. Following recut
nuKoiDmostQB& Inmuachg quantiatve restrictiom  wil remain on only a few Items, coverig
arund 2.5% of import items. In most of these cases (69 items, luding drugs,    i   and
frearms), resction rflect health and safety concers. In other cases, they are the result of legiaton
qpeificaly reated to certain products (agricultural goods) where the Goverment has undaken to

preet  legilaton to Cogres for th  removal of QR-based prowco   Last, there ar a set of
restrictions on products In sectors which hoe price regulatons, including coad and petroleum products.
In theso latter cases, the Govemmet hu preented a timound acton program for removal of QRs in
tndem wit a broader derelaton of these sector.
35.        With the  ages on tarnf   d themva of QRs suppoted by the prwposed loan, the
Phippines w ll be       one of the most open counries in the region. Ihe  i, however, a cost in ter

reves be replaced.
36.         l. LTbraiza    Ihe Government I redefining its role in the aportctor
thro   a thre-ronged strategy. Fist, the pe  system of heavy regulation is beng refed to
inroduce grtr elements of market-deteed competiionL In the past, entry and exit in the ransport
sevices indutry was higy  gulated, resfting in a costly and hnfficie  transp  industry. High
transport costs are an importat reaon why domestic competition remains weak, why internd marks
stay fi_  and why the bis bowar  economic activity ocated in Metro Maila remains stong.
M2 Govnmen has recntoly issued a anew  olicy direcive which viws entry into and exit fom the

37.        Te second prong of the tasport se     is to involve the private sector to a much greter
dgee in t  management and opation of transport infra   .In the case of lipphin Airlies,
for example - privaized in Januy 1992 - the Govenment has witdrw  from the direct prision of

by the oil companies, or from which the of copane are reimbursd, whenev  the cost of the product
computed by the ERB differ fom the wholesale price. There is, however, an asymmey In price
- reductionscan be made automatically, while iwres are subject to public heaings.
Cosequently, the OPSF has periodically run into deficit, cai fiscal problems and creati  large
suddn caes in domestic ofl pices. It also creates a diron through crossies to mainta
relaive  y  prices tited towards specific  m. Thebjective of the energ priing reforms, whih
wil be Implemented a part of te EL, is to depoliticize the system, elimiate hidden cross-subsdies and
resit  e ac           gais or losses of the OPSF to lovds which would not have s a

39.        At present, the OPSF i in suplus by anund PS bllion as a resultof weaker tban epected
Inenaton oil prices and a stronger an exped pesoldola exchane rat. Lgiadon is in Congre
to allocate a porto of this surplus to the capializatioD  and investment needs of the National Power

40.        Although the longterm objective for oil pricing i totl dergation, the Govement is
concemed that is may not lead to a more efficient outom giv  the cartelised gructure of the industy,
couped with low refining capacy and high cost of enty. Acordingly, the Ewh Secor Plan which
i bein preaed with  sistae from the World Bank and whose adopdon is included in the EIL, would
explo two altenatives, In addion to full dereli, to impove the fimctioning of the current system:
(a) le_sli tomandaw auomatic changes in the WSP when the OPSF balance reaches a minimum or
maximum level; and (b) an indexation of the WSP to chaniges in the SingWore prices (or other
inenanl bendcmk) for simlr products, converted into pesos.
41.        Foreign Egix    Drgdathm. Until recendy, fore  exchange tading in the Philippines
was resicted to a few registered dealers, exportes surrendered all foreign exchange eanigs and certain
transctions hincluding capital account uansactions, were largely prohibited. These rules were, however,
bard to enfrce in an open economy, especialy one which relied on attractig large amounts of
_mktam from abroad, and in which an infonnal grey market operated with a small premium on the
official e  ge rate.
42.         he fist sificant steps towards foreign exchange reform were ten in early 1992. DS
ntion  rtio for eMo         was nreased to 40%  reducing transaction Cm. Pull and immedit

roeig exchange recets and fe use of foreig exchange funds purchased in the market. The off-fioor
Utr       market has also been broadened and daily tsctLor volumes are almost ten times as high as
prior to e efm. The end point of the proces is almost completely open capital and current accounts
and a more mark-tend and depoliticized exchange rate, which should provide clear, immediate
sigals as tD the adequcy of the Governmen's macnic program.
44.           P net income immovme   For several years, the CBP has suffered annual losses of
over 2 percent of GNP, primaiy as a result of serving commercial enal debt obligations. Becase
thee losses have been financed by money creation or, in the short tem, by issue of CBP Bils, their
presece has served to reduce the ability of the CBP to pursue a tight monetary policy. Reducing the
CBP deficit, by mean of the DDSR operation, will help reduce the consolidated fiscal deficit and will
allow for me Indepeence of the CBP from the NG, increasing it credibility as an inflaion fighting
ton.  bepresent m          mic stuadon provides a favotable context in which to deal with the
CBP prblem, with puibUc sector ddicits now below 2% of GNP, annualized inflation rumning at single
digt levels for the past three months, and foreign exchange reserves at adequate levels. In this
environment the indicated structural refrms in fin  exchange and CBP net income support shoud
have the desrd effect of bringing down domestic re  Interest rates to single digi levels, a key
preqisite for raising private sector investment and growth.

45.        Mm proposed loan would support the first of two planned steps towards a fid resolution of
the CBP problem in the medium terma. In this frst step, several measures have been tak  to impwve
the CBP deficit by over PS billion In 1992 and P8 billon on an annualized basis. First, &Ignfl=
amounts of CBP extra  bt and debt service have been eliminated tirough the buyback and the debt
the Nationdl Government has issued al new money and debt excage bonds
assoiated with the Brady operatd   Second, the NG has increased its non-inters bef  deosits In
t  CM   Third, the NG has issued special Treasur bills and notes to the CBP. yielding annual interest
nme of over P3 billion. Fourth, the CMP has unwound its foreign    e    san gbligtions A4
4QmestccggorciL baslcs. These swaps, amounting to a fce value of almost US$1 billion, had been
toied over sine 1983 although their origina duraton was three monts. Subsani frig excne
losses on thse WapS have been incumed but not paid and, Including accumuted Ineest, they now
amount to an additional US$1 billion. By widing down the swaps, the CBP will save co erable
interest e ditures (estimated at P2.3 bilion per year) and will also protect itslom  furter foreig
eKchmge loe that could arie from ex  e rate moements. Last, under the term of the prwposed
loan, the Govenment will prove for the payment of agready approved CBP capital in a budget
submission to Congress.
46.        Othet I=. In addion to progressing on the policy fro, the Goverment Is commitd
to addr        moe deep rooted Issues which conine to constain short-run growth and the sustability
of the growth proces. In acknowledging that the private seCtor must play a lead role in the gowth
statw , the Government Is also cogizat of the fact tat uncerinty over political and economic
dVe1vlpment has hampered private investment. The strategy to deal with Ut u Cetainty Is tO build a
track recOrd of maCrOeConOmiC discipline and ctuimty in adjustment, and to renforce ths with
meaures to dea with the extern  deb   At the same dime, by addressing long term Issues such as
population growth, natural resource degradaton and land distibudon, the sustainability of the growth
prces is buntessed.
47.        When implemented, the most recent round of reforms In freign investment, trade, tansport
and fo     exchange wfll largely complete the structural adjustment effort, leaving the Philipines with
a business enviroment which would compare favorably to many of its neighbors and other reforming
counties. This may not have been achieved as smoothly and quickly as might have been desired and
further consolidadon of reforms is required in a mumber of areas, notably tax collection, but the
remanig problems are viewed more as a matter of improving imple  on   ctivene. than as a
matter for addiona policy chage. Viewed from the perspectve of a decade of effort, significant
backliig has been avoided and the speed and depth of policy refdrm have been sinficant Cable 1).

A. EmnncBW
48.        After a decade of trerm effort, the Phlippines Is now In a positiont resume growth on
a sustand pat. Wme ongoing stabiiatio program bas successfuly reduced fis  pressures, curren
account deficis and inflaton. The debt resucturing operation agreed with conmercial bank crdis
ad curetly In progess mt only addes the Isue of cmmercial bank debt In a compr ne
manner, but also provides an opporunity to reduce the burden of foreigl debt sevice on extenal
payms and n fi    baWces. Finally, gmss inteatonal reseves of the Cental Bank ar now at
adequate levds, although they have been depleted by the demaids for resources posed by the closing
of the debt resuctrng opeao
49.        T he Philippines can rlistcdly aim for a target growt of GDP of around 5.5 peren per
yea. Afer a decine of 1 percent in GDP in 1991 and a fat fi  six months of 1992, growth momentum
expected to buld in the latter balf of 1992 when the success of fiscal and monetary policies In bringing
down hinai  and Incrasing reseves is reflected In lower iner  rates and improved private sector
nc   in macronomic sbt. Given the widesped  oms already insttuted, growth should
aspont quickly to impoved macroeco omic condions, and bufld into a full-fledged recovery by 1993
which can be sustaned thereafter. Given important demographic changes, with population growth now
projected at 1.8 perce  per year over the next decade, this represents a sigdificant inaease i income
per capita, and is exp     to lead to a rse in both per capita private conumpon nd avings.
50.        Ihe growth sceario presntd below is blkt around an expansion of public nd private
invstment, which would stmlte the labor-intensive construction idustry, and around a steady increase
in c iveess tough red exchange re movemenu which should give a marked boost to the rura
ecoomy. Although It is bard to project the new emnloyment at would be created, beaus of
uncertahWo over how wages wil react in the Phipine conte - where insttdIon  factors rate 
ma    forcplay a bey role in formal sector wage  minaion - it is safe to say that a sIgifIcant
dent would be made in unemlot and underemployment. Thus, the projected sceario shd prove
to be socialy accptabMe.
Si.        Ie GlobaA  Uen       . From the point of view of the Philippine economy, the prospecX
for the global envronment ae not very encouraging, although some uptun from the weak prfomae
of the last two yeas i forest. he patter of the global oudook is mila to that of the las ten years:
a declins in the relative imporunce of prinary commodities, but a positive environment for mautured
export growth. On the positve side, the growth rate of world trade in volume tems shodud pick up to
about 6 percen after two years of low 4 percent growth. At the same dme, given the significant Inteet
in BuildpeatTransfer projects, over US$1 billion of direct foreg investment per year could be
attated to the lippines. On the negative side, the outook for aggegat OBCD growth and for the
major pimay commodity exports is not encouraging, nd LIBOR is forecast to rise from preset ows.
Fixed itert pvisions in the debt restucturing package would however provide a valuable cushion
against the lotte.
52.        te 2Domestic lenrmn t. The public setor has the oporniy to iniae a recovey by
Increasing gvowth-Inducing sedn in Iructur and maintence. Ihe primayI bstment of this

ncase will, tefo  be thde st  otepis sector, padtcully public utilites. Boes of the negec
of ctpSbl wesum   In the past, die o  n f'  reqWromem for infrastructur spending ae enormous, and
wil condtime to be costined both by cumrt funding availability and by limited institution  capacity
in the ageces responsible fo the  impl  n of the investment program. For is rise in invesent
to occur, it  asumed da stat enterprise maintain user fees at sufficienty high levels that at least 25
peret of thek investmen can be finanta by intenal cash generation.
53.        Significantparticipatio of the private sector, both forei  and domestic, particularly in the
eer  sector, is eviagd toug Build-Ope Transfer schmes. Importan invesme  in other
secr wil aso nvolve both public and priva funing. Teleommcations is largely private, as are
certain ubors I tanspot where deglaton could be acmpanied by the mode         of the fleet
of ships, tucs and plan. Public investme wil focus on power, waw and sanitation, urban tasport,
roads, bddges ad pos.
54.        End Policv. Tbe incease in infrauctr requirements will require a reallocation by the
National Government of          towrds mane   and investment. In the short tm, any
increase in te deficit must be limitd  by rapid impl ion of aleady identified measures to raie
revenues and control . In the longer run the National Government must move towards a
balance, or evea  a surplus positn, in order to bring down the overall public sector debt.
5S.        The chaUenge for the Natona Government will be to contai its deficit while either on-
le   aftor  _oeing bforeign assisutc to other agencis for investmt. The tax effort must refore
be the focal point of fl  policy. Overall, the scenario assumes tha taxe can be raised by o-af of
oneercen of GDP each yea over the next four years. This is, however, a net figure. Revenue losses
from the curet program of reducion in customs tarifs ad from the windi  down of the privatfzation
program in the medium tem - aftker h  pn of remaining big-ick  items - wil need to be
replaced. Ihe actual     l tax eff, therefore, is much higher than 0.5 percen of GDP per year;
in fact, it is over one percentge point of GDP per year. A small part of this would come simply from
gowth, give the renewed buoyncy of the tax system, but all the remaider must be collected throug
a concted effort to broaden the tax base and increase collection efficiency.
56.        Acordin to the Bank's medium term pojectim, tho consolidated public sector deficit
(excuding surplus. of social securt Instiuto  and prfts of goverment financal instutons) could
rie to over 3 percent of GDP In te short run, largely becauso of growing deficts in state enterprises.
The qualt of      deficits, however, driven by hi    capital invesm   in    ructur, differeates
tm  frm past deficits which had revived iftionary fears in 1989190. Financing of thWe  deicits
would Involve a baance between domestic and foreign borrowing. In order to reduce crowding-o  of
privatesment, total domestic public debt should stabili at around current levels of 28 percent of
GDP in the near term, before declining in the medium tn  Because of the long maturities deired for
finning Infrtu         project, the pattern of the past eight years of subsiun domestc for foreigp
borrowing cannot be continued. As a percent of GDP, foreig debt can now be stabflized at present
levels.
S7.        M. TMe gowth stamtegy is predicated on a recovery of private invesment,
both fori  and domesdc. A stable finaal enviomet is a prqisie for this to occur. bIflation
in the Consumer Price Index sould be kept to a level of around 7 perce. is wll require maintenance
of a policy of tight domestic crt, especlly as inflaonary pressures may build in the early stages of

S8.        OnCe a recovey in hports star to be felt, pressur ao the peso to depeciate wil Increase.
_ a real depreciatin of the peso of about 4 percen per year over the medium term would
be necesr to offsat th real appreciation that has occurred since the beginning of 1991. A significant
imprvement In copetvene Is requird to keep te balcof payme  manageable. An investment-
led rovery, with high Imortd capi  goods componen for power gation and telecommunicatons
equimnt, wil place sigificat pressur on the balac of paymet even if It is paty offset by higher
inflows of frig Inesm    as DOT conacts are undertaken Tbus, the remainder of the trade balance,
paticlarly nuacturd exports, must be in a position to respond quickly.
59.        M                       A summary of he mediumterm outcomes Is shown In Annex
L Detal are dce in the trecen Basic Economic Repr on the PhYppines (Report No. 11061-PH),
which has Just been sew to the Govenmnt Despite a global oudook that is not vey encouraging, real
GDP growth of aund 5.5 peet would be possie, driven by investment and muuhmred exports.
iblly, both the pubc and privae sector would participate in the inves    drive. In the medium
term, it would be the prvat sector that would sustain the montum of growth while the public sector
-ed back iuctur8 speWnding.
60.        The recovery projected fbr the      three years difer from the boom enjoyed In 1986-89
in many impont ways, maig this recwvery sustainable where the previou one was not. First, the
expansion nreal public consumptin, associated wih Increases in real wages for public sector employees,
hat accompanied the 1986-89 recovery is to be avoided, and the projected increases in public
a      _nsumpto  actvity need to be concentae  on at insatr  mucture   rather than on wages.
Seond, te cur   account defict sod b allowed to widen, as direct fog hvestm    and portflio

61.        ThIrd, the tax effort Is higr and pic sector debt lower      in the past. However, the
siz of the deficit does not quikldy decine in the projecton  as public inv et is maintained at levels
compaible with sustainable growth. Fmally, with a diffent exage rte and trade policy, the
explon in imports that accompanied th  1986-89 recovery should be avoided. Imrts are still
expeed to rie ar a GDP growth, but to danger of exces   import pressres should be avoided
nOw, with greater cretibility in fisa and monetary policy, with phaed tar reductons secured, with
ex    e convertibi  assured, nd with the potental to speculae on peso movments in fiana assets
removing the hi ot to speculate through inventory   ato
62.        The projectd inc   in investment - 6.5 percent  poins of GDP higher than In 1992 -
- despite the renewed itrest of foreign investors in th Philippines, will requie a  icrease

In domestc savingsp. Ipojece dth less than 2.5 perceag points would binanced thgh highet
foreg svings, Us the reaIoning 4 points must be financed though domestic savings.
63.        IMEsdc          Most of the increase  svings wil be fom the private sector. Over the
past two yeas of suggh grwth, private savings have been nr  down to maintain consumption. As the
teovoy materiizes, pive  savings sould increase. f measr  to reduce the taxation on finanidal
in are iodc4  and with a deepening of the governm  securides market to favor small,
non-competive bid  he tedcqy for pivae  sving to rise In the upswing of the boom can be
and sustaned. Even with these measures, the senario conservatively esmates a recovery
of private uvt  to levels below historical ones. Ihe reovery of public sector savig will req
consist"_dkft by the Natinal Goverment and stte enterprises to ince    revenues and hold
ep  UtLin check. The redction in domestic inte    rates and exa  interest payments -
ollowig the DDSR oeation - would allow for additional savings to be generated.
64.          P.  Ihe need to continue to rely heavly on foreig savings implies tatdthe
Ppn  is still far from a full recovery from its debt crisis. The reference scenario shown in Table
4, Awn  I, indicates that e Phippines' total gross financial requirements for 1993-97 would amount
to US$27.9 billion.  is figure has been significantly lowered by the gross svin  associated with the
commrcial debt sacurng operation curny in progress. Ths opation is a voluntay, mu;tl-option
package, covern aU medium and long term  cmmeil bank credis under pubLic sector rtrucing
_pemub and aU 1985 'New Money", for a total amount of US$4.6 biSlion. Under the terms of this
opeaton, hoes of digible debt may choose between the following opdtos: new money bonds,
temporay intera reducton bonds, prinpa collateralized bonds, and buybacs. On the basis of the
commrcia bak cma   to date, this DDSR operation wil yield to interest sving of US$1.5
bmion and derd princpal saig of US$1.8 bilion over the period 1993-97. Details on the operation
ae reprted in the bdefg not (SecM92-1273) presented to the Board on September 25, 1992.
65.        Even after te Implementation of this DDSR operation, large amortization payments are
projected, totag more thad US$2 bilion per year over the period. Thus, with debt service obligations,
the reor gap and foreig exchange reserve wcumulaion to be financed, the Philippines must mobilize
mg - n 11- lyUS$5 billion in gross alpitat inflows - or redins - per year t meet te projected
66.         me projected level of fincig is achievable, provided that the Philippines pursues its

raised by the puWc sector borrowing.

yer.  n orde for this to contine st levels at least as higl, the disburement rate on Official

In 1992 and 1993,      finaning gaps, averaging US$1.3-1.7 billion per year, would start to arie

be intrWupted or reversed in response to adverse developments, either economic or political. Give the
disapointng grwth perfmance of the past two yeas, there is a concer tha the private invesment
resos to the Govenment program wDI not be as rapid as projected. The sevening of refoms is
being manaed carely to build confidence and to avoid the ocence of isability, which could lead
to policy reversals and thus to diminised credbility and effectiveness of the program. This is
particularly important for the foreig exchange liberalzadon, which has been designed to accompany the

trade reform poc. If trade reforms wer not implmented, or if they were reved and the economy
brought back to a protcted state, th  lberalization of frg  nesment and of the foreig exchang
matet could be damaging.  he progrm therefore emphasizes removal of al remainn quantitative

to have fiscal nd credit polcy under contol. Unlike In othr high debt ountries, the consoHdated fisca
deficit in the Piippines Is low, at 2.7 pecent and a projected 1.9 pece  of GNP deficit in 1991 and
1992 respectively. Annualid core infao appears to be within single digit levels. Thus, conditions
are vey different from those in severa Latin America comtries, where prouacted peiods of vey high
domestic rea interest rates to squex out high in on have led to large cpital inflows and an
le ap   aton in the exchage rate. Because of the significant mounts of debt relief from
the Pai Club and commerial bank creditos, and the reliano on dis     fm the muliat
Istitow and bilateral donors coordinated thrugh the CO meeting, the new Goverment has signifi-
cant incenie to remain in compliance with the agreed upon mc   program

ateton I being devoted to Impoving the siuati    Foremost among the problems in tihe Philippines
l the lack of whedroom' - the Inability of the Governet to alocate uicient enditures under Its
stabilizatnprogram to accommodate all of the investment needs in the various sedora programs. This
has affected projects implemented by Govenment departme  more than those Implemented by
govemen corpoatios, since the latter rely on inte    cash generation for the most part. Even if a
project Is Included in the annual expendture program, there are still at tmes difficulties for the
Goverment in maklng the acual cah releases on a month-to-month basis as the annual limt are being
stictly maintained. In any given sector, several exteral donors are involved in providing support
(usually through separte projes, but in some cases through joint cfning arrangeme). The
Dks aroach has been to look at the expendite issue in the macroeconomic context and also at the
oeall needs for the sector. Also, there have been additional expenditue pressures caused by the seres
of unexpected natural disasters in 1990-91, (e.g. Pinatubo) which has necessitated adjustme   in 1992.
93.        At the September 1992 Country Imple on Reviews (CIR), the Government and the
Bank reviewed the B/I DA portfolio and the various issues affecting project imple n (these
ranged fiom the headroom" and counterpart funds issues, to issuss of audit compliance, prouement
ad consultaxt seection). As documented in the Tranche Release Memandum on the Debt Management
LoA  (192-50, dated March 26, 1992), there his been significanprogress made in refining pocument
and consultant selection procedures. Regardirig audits, the Commission on Audit (COA) still retains an
over-achn role that tends to stile IndepenentJ and timely actions/decisions by project entity officials.
The Bank continues to hihl    i issue, recognizing that COA is independent of the Executive Branch
and its agcies.
94.        Given the consaints to eedre allocations and cunterpart fumding, the central
economic ageies in the Government (the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), the
Dqmrtment of Budget and Management (DBM) and the Deprment of Finance (DOF)) have been
refining a raking system for priortizig projects across sectors and across donors. While this can help
to sorout prorites in te short term, it is taa subsi e to formution of a Core Investmet Progam,
which the Governmnt hopes to do in the coming year, and which would be protected againt acss-te
board budget cuts.  here is a direct ief  between the Government's eforts to revist the priorities
of projects and the Banks own CIR. In fact, the Se  1992 CIR resulted in an underIg that
the Bank would reexmin its portfolio to atain vwhich of the projects could benefit from modification
and restuctuing and which could proceed as planned. Once the Bank has completed its analysis of
portfolio resuuing needs and potential, it plans to discuss these with the Govenment and thereafter
to share the analysis with other donors in order to see if there are generic Issues, the solutions to which
old be helpful to the other multeral and bilatea donors instrumet in providing ODA assistance
to the Phiippines. The next CO meedng will likely consider this issue in some depth, with a view to
making the utilization of aid in the Philippines more effective generally (para 120).

strategy to meet current priorities and challenges. In essence, the   nc strategy gives highest
priorty to supporti  efforts to make the economy more competitive and to put it on a plane with the
fstrowing Asian economies. The Bank's assistance program revolves around the following five

Pilippines and esewhere have established a strong link   between infrastructure creation
and    m      t  i-vestment - the rionale should be to provide the neceary
underp     for growth in the priva  sector;
(c)  private sector deveopment and financial sector deqaug, in cojunction with IFC, to

98.        The Bank's earlier empasis on agricultural development has become a broader strategy
for sw ab   rural deveopmet.  Liberlizaton prgam  bha  removed many bias  agint
agicue, and the Gree Revolution has already been completed in tihe Phiippines, yet susthud
agricural proucdvity growth remains crucial to the overall national prospects, as wel as poverty
aeviaion.   nproveme   In Irigation, research and eation, the rral fnai  markets, and
agricltural marketing contne as high priorities, though with a focus on only the most efficient means.
Similarly, nurl transport and power are porly developed, yet important In gen tin off-hfm ra
employneeL A dsft of budgetary resouces from nua sbsidies to uran public investnt b needed,
which thel Bak plam to assist The Govermment has also developed an excellent poiey famework for
promotingVconsation of natu  resources, but will need frther extna asistance In   le  g
progrm  to protec and manage forest and cora rees, minimize soil erosion, and ultmaely rer
productiviy to denuded lands.
99.        Regrdng  In_rasuctue, there is a pardcular need for major expansion   elen ldty
gamatim  and distribuon. The scale of this epansion, however, must be considered from three
perspectives. At the naiona level, enery supply and demand calculations show what is desiable: about
700 meawatts per year plus associate trasmission and distrbuton works, costing around $1.3 bil
per year for geneaton, transmission and dbution, Includig invesunt  by the prvate sector. Thi
would c ns  for previos years, when lnvestme  have been too low, resuling in a seious eergy
crs. Anher pepectve comes from estimates of what the principal energ instiuons and the pirivate
sector can reaonably finae given debt and self-financing cotaints.  his gives a lower figure for
spding abt. Last, the Institutional capacity for expansion must be considered. Th key spendn
decions in power must be made cosistent with a reasonable fincing plan and prgm f  effidciency
Improvements in the Natona Power Corporation (NPC) and other instuion in th power sector.
100.      In the traspt sectr, the road netwrk has suffered from a lack of       _
_e,endb        and spending needs to be more than doubled. Rual and prvia roads have baen
paticulady neglected.  A road reLabitation program, linked to instudon  reorms fr road
managemen, needs inased financing. With liberliaton of land and sea traiport policy, resces
needed to upgrade the nats fleet of tcks and ships are expected to be provided by the private sector.
The prvat sector coud also pla a more sinica  role In the fiamcg opation and management of

common usr ports If refom  In the  ippine Port Audhor  were adopted to reduce the confict of
intere preaent I ts role as owner, orator, rguator and fimancier on behalf of th public sector.
101.      In the urban secor, Infhstructure sevies - transport, water, sanitation and solid wasft
disposa - need        I invesmet. Water shortag, In pardcular, could develop into crises over the
medium term with  swift action. l each of these areas, significant resource mobilation from user
fees Is nee y and should provid the bulk of operating epenses. Istuional constaints, in the form
of sector institutions besieged by deep-rooted financial problems, condtiue however to limit investment
in the sector.
102.      As a development strategy t  applies to agricuture, Iustry, energy, tel catons,
and tion, the Govenment connues to attach the highest importance to priVate sector
developumnt, and private sector development work will be at the center of the Bank's asce strategy.
The Bank, together with IFC, is undertaking a Private Sector Asessment Study, which wi assess private
sector actviies, idntify constaint to private sector development, and make recom n   for their
remwvL  Emphasi will be on selected       m      subsecoors, on the enery sector and on
telecm nications. At the same dme, the Bk wil continue to follow a multi-faceted approach
deigned to improve the rgatory and operating environment for the private sector, critcal to which will
be contied movement toward further economic derlation.
103.      Good progress has been made in the area of privatization where the Goverment exceeded
the targes set muder the Refirm of Govenment Cotporations (GCs) LoA  (SecM92-99 of Januay 23,
1992 regarding release of the hird Tranche). As of August 31, 1992, the Government has offered for
sale 84 companes whose asset value represented 62 percent of ttal GC assets. Recnty, the
Govenment sold its majority stae in Philippine Airlines (PAL) and is progressing with the sale of hie
Nationa Steel Corporion. With regard to public sector effiienCy, systematic moniorig is being done
in the case of some 30 public enterprses through use of a Performance Evaluadon and Incentive System
and the Bank intends to continue assit  in the review of these findings, as documented in the February
1992 Country Ecnmic Report
104. The Bank will contne to follow a multi-fceted approach deigned to improve the regulatory and
opeating environment for the private sector. Citical to private sector performance will be contnued
movement by the new Government toward further economic derelaton. There has been major progress
toward d_erlation and dmplification of proaedures in many sectors, including agriculture, finan,
tade, power geneaion and teleonins wit  the frameworks established under a series of
Bank-suported pgrams. However, there remains considerable scope for further action in the critical
area of transport (both road and martime).
105.       In order to provide the private sector with an environment conducive to Investing in new
plant and eipmnt nd expadg or rehablitatg esting plants, the infizstructre    (electricky,
waer spply, roads and telecommunications facies) needs to be brought up to standard. Projects in
geotherml energy development, expansion of water supply and improved systems for diposa of solid
waste are planned Again, the need to obtain efficiency improvements in the public sector will continue
to guide the assistance strategy. Attention wil be given to improving the level, content, and process for
allocatng public investment and expditus. Studies undtaken under the Debt Management Loan will
help to provide the analytical basis for future action on operations and maitance expeditur.
Regrding the financing of energy and infrastructreprojects, the Bank welcomes the Goverunent's thrust



-29 -
to seek         private seor niatives, such as through Build-Ope;tand-Transfr (B), Build-
Otera*md-Own (BOO), and  id-Trafer-ad-Opere (BTO) shemes on a concesn basis. Ibe
Pbipphs already has had succeU e ience with gas bie power gneraton projec that wer
designed on a BOT basis. Congress passed the BOTrBOO legiaton in July 1990, and the Governmt
is developing an Infrtrcture Fund to allow the prvate seor access to ODA fnds for suitable privat
sectr projecs.
106.       Uhe Bans role in aist  the pivate sector wil be geared towards provding a catalytic
role, and not as a sWbtt for commrcal sources of finance, lf the possiblity exists of obainig such
finanig. Specifically in the past, pratios tsupport private sector development hve been channeled
thugh Govaunowned fan     tma              ; wher thee resources are desinated for inv_estm

in        the justifi*caion for speciflc projects, the evolving mat prospects for the Phippines In
rdeion to Investmen noeeds and sources wll be closely reviewed.
107.      In the health sector, the    _     to p     health care and preventv meaures and
the pasge of the geeic drug law to control the cost of health cae provon have consuted impornt
gains, which shod be preserved and reinforced at the Local Goverment level where many of the
allocative deciions in health wi now be made. Other programs, such as famiy planning need to be
taken up a prior   by the nation  and local governmen. Major spending decsions need to be made
conacning hospital-based services, where intemal efficiency gains canbe comideable from a rationalized
sym   As dtere is a den         willigness-opay for health sevices, and the private health system
is often prerrd tD the public system, the scope for mobizng other resources, icuding private
employerprvision and NGOs is consdable. The Bank has an active program in urban healt systems
and is ptr ing a Women's Realth and Safe Moherhood project, together with biteral donors. In
general, imp qrving aces of the poor to adequate preventv care is a key element in the poverty
alleviatin strateg.
108.      In oducaon, the principal thrust towards prima  education needs to be reinforced, and
a closer look should be en at seconday and higher education. In hi  education, unit costs can be
brougt down though a process of consolidation of smal sized scdools. Secodary education costs in
tho public sector are also above those in th private sector with no videt quality diffences, and the
reative roles of tee must be  cnidered to justify epio n of public sendary schooling budges.
In primary educadon, greatr focus needs to be placed on ipoving quality and thereby reducin drop-
out and reptton, especlly for hose from poorer households. Conpos   shifts indexpes
fom tace salaies to tetbo   and oter ipu  can benefit this. The Bank has a broad program of

October 16, 1992
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
President
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Res Economc litegration Loan
Dear Wr. Prelsdent:
The Phl1ippin6 Gornt    implmenting a package of wide-ranging
reforms in order to restore the economy to a sustainable growth path. We
have been working with your staff towards World Bank upport for critical
new initiatives in the areas of -4vestmaent, trade policy, energy policy,
transportation policy, foreign exchange management and the strengthening of
the financial position of the Central Bank. We have also concluded an
agreement with our commercial bank creditors to restructure the remaining
eligible public sector medium torm external debt, according to terms agreed
to in February 1992. This letter provides an overview of the Government's
reform prgroam, indicates the measures already taken and outlines the
direction of future policies.
Although the Phillppines was one of the first countries to receive a
World lank Structural Adjustment Loan in 1980, the early efforts at
adjustment were derailed by a severe acroeconomic crisis triggered by the
cut-off of comnercial bank foreign credits towards the end of 1983. Atten-
tion turned to stabilization, whlch was successful in lowering inflation and
the current account deficit. But in 1986, When the Auino administration
took office, tho economy was moribund, having contracted by a cumulative
15.5 (at constant 1985 prices) percent in 1984 and 1985, and it was weighted
down by a highly inefficient incentive system, a grossly overextended public
sector, and a net of political instltutions which have not been conducive to
private sector initLative, Since thea, as underlined below, with the help
of the foreign donor community, we have launched a strong program of reforms
to remove policy-induced dLitortions in incentives, reduce the size of the
public sector, and develop democratic structures and regulatory procedures
that are both equitable and transparent.
At thls stage, our objectives are to create a world competitive econo-
my, led by a dynamic private sector, capable of exploiting the opportunities
for development provLded by world trade and financial links. in order to
achieve these goals, we are hlghlighting programs which will integrate our
economy with the rest of the world and which wlll encourage dmestic Ond
foreign investments in the Philippines. This involvess rmoving remaun,&ng
distortions in the real economy; relying on market-determined prices to
guide resource allocation; providing the necessary infrastructure support;
and improving our institutional capability to manage the economy. We are
translatLng these concepts into speclfic programs for: improving the
investment climate, by creating a supportive policy envLrorment, reducing



- 39 -                                ANNEX 11
cumbegsome bureaucratic red-tape and accolerating privatlation; reducing
the anti-export bias, which has ben responsible for the slow development
and low -fficiency of agriculture and manufacturlng, and launchinq a aa-
tionwide program to promote exports; reducing the cost penalties faced by
domestic private producers an a result of inefficient transprt and infra-
structure services; and ensuring a more streamlined lmplementatlon of
Government policies In a number of key areas.
The reform agenda laid out below epresents the continuation of ef-
forts initiated by the AquLno adminlstration. We have made considerable
progress but much remain to be done to establish, in a credible and irre-
versible fashion, the new directions we have taken. Coupled with the first
peaceful transfer of power in decades, we are confident that we can convince
domestic and foreign private investors that we are finally on the path of
rapid, sustainable.development that our neighbors have taken with so much
success.
Iven as the financial savings generated by debt and debt service
reduction are substantial, the Government recognizes that the greater
benefit from the debt agreement stems from reduced uncertainty and greater
Investor confidence that is expected to arise from completion of the deal.
To further these, a stable macroeconomic environment is necessary. We can
point with some pride to the macroeconomlc achievements of the last
twenty-one months during which time we have kept to our objectives, despite
major natural disasters, an unprecedented reflow of foreogn capltal, a weak
domestic economy and election pressures. We fully lntend to build on this
track record of good macroeconomic implementation and reinforce the'trends
towards responsible fLical and monetary policy that have been established.
:n this endeavor, we will hold preliminary discussLons in November with the
IMP towards defining a medium term macroeonomic framework in the context of
a successor program to the current standby arrangement xpiring on March 31,
1993. it is our expectation that well in advance of the expiration of our
current IN? program, both the IM  and the Bank would have provided augmented
rsources to help finanoc our commercial bank debt package which we Intend
to close by end October 1992.
Medium-Term Economig Framework
The Government is fully aware of the need to conduct its policies and
programs within a consistent medium-term framework. it considers the
attainment of strong and sustainable economic growth as its major macroeco-
nomic objective in the medium-term. In the pursuLt of these objectives, the
government is committed to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and
continued implementation of structural reforms. Macroeconomic stability
essentially reqpires maintaining low and stable fiscal and external
deficits, single digit inflation, adeqate international reserves, and a
debt burden that does not compromise the goal of stable and sustained eco-
nomic growth. Progress in structural transformation requirts continued
movement towards an economic system that'is capable of generating more
employment and can better alleviate poverty. We believe the best way to
achieve our economic objectives is to redouble our efforts to make the
economy more market-oriented, to remov remaining policy-induced distortions
and to provide an environment Ln which the prlvate sector can flourish. The

Government has adopted and La acting upon a medium-te  progrm in whlch
strategles to pursue these objectlves, as quantlfied and wlth aropriate
mechanlsms, are deflne for achievlng our targets.
Naeroeconomic Proshe and Objectlve.
after a dlfflcult year of negative growth in 1991, we are optimistlc
that a recovery of at least 2.0 percent growth wlll take place in 1992 and
accelerate thereafter to attaLn an annual average of about 7 per cent growth
in the medium term. On the demand side, growth should be led by investment
and exports. Following the completion of our commerclal bank debt agreement
and the peaceful transfer of power through democratic processes, the climate
for lnvestment has improved noticeably. Continued pursuit of our structural
reform agenda will ensure that these lnvestments are allocated in an
efficient manner. Important new lnvestments are antlclpated in the power
and telecommunications sector, wlth public corporations, domestlc investors
and forelgn investors all contributing9 Investment rates of about 25
percent of GNP should be achievable over the medlum term.
gxports will also be a leading growth sector and we lntend to Lnculcate
export promotion lnto every level of Government. We have achieved some
success iA restructurlng our exports, and manufactures now account for
three-quarters of total export earnLngs. However, because of low value
added in manufactured exports, this accomplLshment has not been suffLcient
to prevent recurrent balance of payments crises and we need to pursue a more
effectlve export promotLoan strategy. Recent structural reforms (see below)
and exchange rate policies have made major lnroads ln reducang the
anti-export incentive bias of the economy and we are confident that, in
oonjunction wlth other promotional actLvltLes ln flnance, marketing, tech-
nical assistance and instLtutional strengthenLng, our exports could expand
by at least 15 Wercent over the next three years.
In order to flnance thli growth, we must mobllize all avallable doms-
tlc and foreign resources. Domestically, we have set a target of 15.4
percent of ONP for our 1992 tax effort, and we are commltted to substantLal
further improveents durLng the next plan period. Under the growth scenario
above-mentLoned, the tax effort is targeted to rise in 1998 by 1.75
percentage polnts above the 1992 levels assuming the existLng tax system and
by at least 295 percentage points with the implementation of new tax
measures and removal of distortLon-LnducLng taxes. Private domestLc savings
had fallen considerably ln the recessLon of 1991, but are expected to
recover as incomes rise. Market-determined lnterest rates offer posLtive
real returns to savers and, with a restoration of confldence in the econaomy,
we expect savLngs whlch are currently kept abroad to return. We have also
successfully mobliLzed record levels of foreign remittances since last year
through improvements ln domestLc bankLng services.
In the short-term, before export momentum is created and before pri-
vate savings recover with lncome growth, we antlclpate a defLclt on our
current account of 3-4 percent of GNP. Addlng to our needs, we must
replenLsh our foreign exchange reserves whleh were depleted by completlng

the comercial bank debt excharge and buyback and unwlnding swap obligattons-
of the:Central lank. We hope to fill much of these needs thiough non-debt
finan4ng, especially prlvate capital lnflows and dixect investments which
are being encouraged through our debt/equlty swap mechanism ad through
Increased reliance on Buuld-Operate-Transfer type hebmes involving private
sector participation iA Infrastructure Lavestment. Nowever, we still
urgently need support from the international financial community at this
time.
We are confident that with the provision of new financial assistance,
the objectives outlined above ares achievable. We recognLze that the chal-
lenge will not be easily met, but we are optimLstic that the set of measures
that we have introduced to improve macroeconomic management and to broaden
and deepen our structural reforms will prove effective.
Ixtrn,al, Debt 8trap eor
Debt service by the Phtlippines peaked at 38 percent of exports of
goods and services ln 1982. Since then lt has been reduced to about 21
percent ln 1991 as a result of a debt strategy focused on cash flow relLif
for the balance of payments. We rescheduled Paris Club debts in 1984, 1986,
1989 and most recently in 1991. This last rescheduling covered some US$1.S
billion in Lnterest and principal falling due ln July 1991 to December 1992.
Commercial bank debt has also been rescheduled: a 1985 agreement rescheduled
about USS6 billion in repayments and arrears due between 1983-86 and ln
1987, seme US$9 billion of payments due over the 1987-92 period were re-
scheduled.
Sinee the introduction of the Brady initiative, the focus of the debt
strategy has shifted to include debt and debt service reduction, within a
context of voluntary, market oriented transactions. Thls orientation has
cme about in order to reduce the debt overhang and to return the Philip-
pines to creditworthiness in as short a period as possible. It has proven
necessary because of the recognition that the chronic fiscal deficits in the
country have been a prime source of balance of payments difficultLes and
that the DDSR can assLst in resolving this aspect of the problem.
In 1990, we concluded the first phase of the new DDSR strategy with a
buyback of US$1.3 billion in commercial bank debt, supported by the World
Bank's Debt Xanagement Program Loan. This program also provided waivers for
further debt reductions, including debt/equlty swaps. This has been
significant: 42 percent of net foreign investment in 1991 came Lato the
country through this channel. As of June 1992, total debt reduction of
OS$5.9 billion had been achieved through a combination of measures.
The most recent agreement with the commercial banks covers about USS
4.55 billlon, after nettlng out most recent pre-termination of debt on
account of various debt converslon modalitles (debt for debt, debt for
equity, debt for high social impact projects). On May 14, we concluded a
buyback of US$ 1.26 billion at an average price of 52 cents per dollar of
face value. As of September 30, 1992, commltments to restructure an

additional USS 3.17 billion have been secured. Total debt b6ight back and
tende:ed for debt conversion represents 97.4 percent of totai eligible debt.'
We are'pursuing subscriptions of the remaining banks to further increase
participation. We antLcipate that this agreesmet will yLeld cashflow rellef
of about US$1.7 blllion over 1992-97; it reflects an effective debt
rzduction estimated at about USS.2 bl1lion.
MamrkegonmLc Manaaement
The outcome of our stablization efforts since February 1991 has been
favorable. Forelgn exchange reserves strengthened to a peak level of US$S.S
billion in Aprll 1992, inflation has been reduced to single digit levels and
the consolldated public sector deficit has been brought under control at 1.7
percent of GNP in 1991 and will be kept well wLthin the prograumed ceiling
of 2.7 percent of GNP in 1992. But stabiliLation has also brought with it
unanticipated problems in macroeconomic managemptnt. Tight monetary pollcy
introduced to flght inflation has helped attrect large inflows of capital
from abroad. Combined with weak domestlc demand for imports, this has
caused an apprecLatLon of the peso by over 20 percent in real terms between
1990 and April 1992 relative to the level prevailing at the end of 1990 and
thi is adversely affecting our exports and our growth. At the same time,
we have been forced to sterillze the ir flows to avoid excessive monetary
growth and a rekindling of Lnflation, )ut ln so doing the domestic debt of
the Govermnent and the Central Bank has expanded. Because of the thinness
of the domestLc capital market, the increase ln public domestic debt has
kept our interest rates high, dampening private investment.
We have taken several steps to improv the effectLveness of our macr-
oeconomlc management. rn order to improve the allocative efficiency of the
domestLc economy, enhaftce the competLtiveness of Philippine enterprLses and
to attract for*ign investments, we have liberalized our foreign exchange
regulations. In the latest Ca Lssuance, commodity and service exporters are
now allowed to retain 100 percent of thelr foreign exchange earnings and to
have free use of these resources. This considerably reduces the
transactions costs faced by exporters who require slgniflcant amounts of
foreign exchange to finance Lntermediate inputs and capltal equipment.
Second, we have allowed exporters to access loans from Forelgn Currency
Deposit Unit. (FCDU) funds of up to 100 percent of the values of thelr
letters of credits, purchase order or sales contract. Thls has reduced the
demand for peso loans and helped brlng down interest rates. Thlrd, we have
sought to broaden the domestic market for government debt through increasLng
the opportunltLes for gmall investors and pension funds to participate ln
the market. Already we are seeLng posLtive slgns from these developments.
The exchange rate has stabilized and depreclated somewhat in nominal
terms from Aprll to September 1992  Domestic interest rates have also been
steadily fallLng both in nominal and real terms. We are increasingly
confident that as our foreign exchange and domestic money markets become
deeper and more competitive, macroeconomic policy management will become
more effectlve and we will be able to achieve our medium term goals of
moderate, single digit inflation and a crapetitive exchange rate at the same



43                                  ANNEX II
time.
Cixr most pressing COnce.ta continues to be the consolidated public
sector deficit. Although we have reduced the deficit to manageable levels,
this has been achiled ia a nwuber of growth-reducinky ways. Because of out
lnabillty to generate sufficlent revenues, public investment has bee
reduced substantially giving rlse to some of the infrastructure bottlenecks
presently being experlenced. We remain committed to a program of increasin
tax revenues with all possible speed. We have approved a met of recom-
mendatlons developed jointly by the 2MF and World Bank for improving tax
collection efficLency by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the BSurau of
Customs, and we are making strong efforts to achleve the required legisla-
tive approval to implement our agenda for ralsing revenues, ineluding, where
warranted, the introduction of revenue measures designed to broaden the tax
base. Legislation, already submitted to Congress and which are at various -
stages of deliberation and approval lnclude bills whichs (a) increases
penalties for tax evasion, imposing mandatory jall sentences in certain
cases, (b) prescribes specific venues for filing and payment of large
taxpayers, (c) eliminates the 10 percent physical lnspectlon requirement for
customs to facilitate clearing, (d) strengthening the anti-smuggling
provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code, and (e) refinements in the VAT.
Bills increasing taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, imposing taxes on
affluent consumption, such as yachts and sports club memberships, and
increases ln tax on non-essentials from 10 percent to 20 percent are being
finalized for submission to Congress shortly. Additionally, the executlve
is set to implement admainstrative measures such as: increasing fees and
charges, and reclassifyLng cortain positions ln the tax collection agencies-
by provlding higher compensation in exchange for security of tenure in order
to achieve greater accountability.
We are also aware of the fact that the public sector defLcit is stlll
vulnerable to the effects of Lnternational price shocks and foreign exchange
maovments, particularly in so far as these are translated Lato inereased
subsidies to publLe corporations, changes in the Oil Price Stabilization
Fund and payments due on our external debt. We are continuing efforts to
reduce thls vulnerability through privatization, quicker responsiveness Ln
domostic oil and energy pricing, and debt relief.
At the same time, we have put in place mechanisms to ensure expenditure
controls. IxpendLtures are being rationalized by reducing the net flow of
resources from the Natlonal Government to public enterprises, by putting as
many public servLces as practical on an unsubsidized basis, by downsizing
the publlc sector and avolding wage adjustments, and by more effective debt
management. The monthly programming of cash by an lnter- agency group was
an important ingredient in our success in meeting flical targets ln 1991 and
1992 and wlll be continued. Publlc investment programming procedures are
beLng modified into a two track system. The first track, consisting of
firmed up projects in the pipellne will receive close attention as to
negotLation schedules, readiness for implementation, and immedLately
avaLlable and allocable publ$c resources. The second track will consLst of
a longer tem schedule of projects based more on sectoral program/project
prototypes which will be allowed to evolve Lato speclfie projects in a cycle

coordinated with foreign donors.
TO complemnt the medium-term fiscal, monetary and exchange rate stance
described above, the Government intends to continue managing internal and
external public debt with a view to avoiding macroeconomic instability. The
chief risk is related to interest rates and the ability of the publlc sector
to refinance maturing debts in volatile domestic and international finaniUal
markets. While domestic and foreign interest rates are comparatively low at
present, the prospect of destabilizing spikes cannot be ignored.
Accordingly, we will continue to monitor the size of public domestic and
external debt so that it can be steadily reduced towards a target of 60
percent of GNP. Recent external debt restructuri4g exercises have
contributed towards this objective. Towards this end, the government is
undertaking tos la) lengthen the maturities on domestic debt and introduce
new instruments that bring down the cost of borrowing, including tapping
small savers; (b) continue to rely on most concessional funding sources for
external financing; (c) develop access to the international capital markets
for government borrowers ln order to reduce reliance on relatively more
expensive and shortor-term domstic debt, as well as for credit-worthy
private firms in order to reduce pressure on domestic interest rates; and
(d) continue various debt conversion programs where these are still
financially advantageous.
Structural Reforms and RKv Proorams. 1986-91
Our overall approach to reform has revolved around three key princi-
ples (i) greater attention to poverty alleviation and, social equity; (ii)
acceleration of growth and increased economic efficiency: (iii) reduced
government involvement in th economy and an emphasis on private initiative.
In the light of these objectives, we have undertaken significant reforms in
agrliulture, investments, trade policy and the financial, public and social
sectors.
In agriculture, reform measures (partly supported through the World
Bank's Agricultural Inputs Loan) have included: the dismantling of the
coconut, sugar, meat and fertilizer monopolies; lifting of the copra export
ban; opening up of wheat and soybean eal importation to the private sector;
and lifting of price controls on riew, corn, other feed grains, poultry and
pork. New legislation expanding agrarian reform to areas other than rice
and corn lands has also been approved, but implementation has been delayed.
However, a total of 1.73 million hectares have been distributed to almost
one million farmer-beneficiaries.
Investment-related reforms included the rationalization of investment
incentives with the passage of the Omnibus Investment Code in July 1987,
simplification of procedures for registering investments and the implemen-
tation of a debt/equity conversion scheme. The 1991 Investment Priorities
Plan was also shortened, enabling the Board of Investments to concentrate
its promotional activities on highly selected areas. The 1992 IPP
consisting of 59 investment areas which is shorter than that for the prior
year, was issued last 30 April 1992.



-45-                            MEX ItI
The trade reform program was launched to promote iatenationally
competitive industries and to provide quality goods at lower prices to
consumers. The Governzent liltiated this program in 1980, but a balance of
payments crisis lnterrupted progress and forced the imposLtion of temporary
quantitative controls. In tandem with renewed efforts since 1986 to lower
effective protection rates, we have gradually removed quantitative re-
strictions on imports, and in sc-. cases replaced thges with tariff based
protection to increase transparency and equalixe protectlon across sectors.
Quantitative restrictions on 1488 item were lifted from April 1986 to Mareh
1991 and these include items liberalized with tariff adjustments.
In the financial sector, the rehabilitation of the Philippine National
Bank and-the Development Bank of the Philippines (DSP) has placed them on a
sound financLal footing, with support from the World Bankts Economic Recov-
ery Loan. The D3P. Ls being transformed primarily into a wholesale bank with
assistance from the World Bank's Financial Sector Loan. This will make the
DSP responsible for raising long-term funds and relending them to retail
financial institutions. To reduce the size of the public sector in banking,
the Government has sold 43 percent of the shares of PBS and intends to offer
for sale an additional 8 percent. Further, of six commercial banks previ-
ously acquired by the Government, four have been fully sold, another one
partially sold, and the remaining bank is up for privatization.
To reduce the presencs of the Government in the economy, a program was
implemented to privatize or close government corporations duplicating
private sector activities, with assistance from the World Bank's Government
Corporate Sector Loan. By August 1992, 88 GOCCs have been offered for sale
representing 68 percent of asset values of oc0Ca for privatization, of which
71 have been privatized/disposed. Some 275 out of 399, or about two-
thirds, of the foreclosed non-performing assets of governenst bank have
also been sold back to the private setor.
Public investment has been substantially refocused, reducing the *ize
of the program and reorienting expenditures to essential infrastructure in
priority areas. To accelerate project development and implementation,
various administrative improvements and institutional support measures were
put in place to improve the capabilities of Implementing agencies. Budge-
tary allocations to education, health, housing and other social services
increased considerably. The delivery of basic social services to the poor
was also expanded, and support services such as credit, farm-to-market roads
and irrigation provided to land reform beneficiaries.
The Current Reform AMenda: 1992 and Beyond
The current reform agenda is aimed at consolidating and extending the
reforms aimed at accelerating growth and increased economic efficiency. We
recognize that in the world economy of today, removal of distortions is not
sufficient to create a competitive edge. With the debt agreement, we have
an opportunity to change both the reality and the perceptions of investors
of the Phllippines as a place for doing busines. We intend to use-this
window to deepen and broaden the reform process, to focus our expenditures

on critical infrastructur, needs, especially power, and to strengthen our
institutions of economic management.  Regadig the reform of the Ineentive
regime. -our rram has five coponents (1) investment  eberalLzation to
welcome foreigners and expand opportunitles for the private sector to
participate in economic development, especlally in the provision of infra-
structure and other hltherto publc servlees; (ii) trade reform to *nsure
*fficLent resource allocation and encourage exports; (iii) transport liber-
alizatlon to encourage domestic and iaternational trade; (iv) foreign
exchange liberalization to achlive greater integration of domestic and
foreign markets, encourage more foreign exchange lnflows, and create a more
market-determlned exchange rate; and (v) development of capital markets,
including financial restructuring and support for the Central Bank to
enhance its credibility as an independent entity responsible for monetary
and exchange rate polley.
Invesltm*ES   Lieaiato 
The objectlve of the investment liberalixatLon component is to increase
competLtLon and efficLent private sector particLpation in the economy.
Building oan the new investment incentives passed in 1987, the agenda now is
to attract more forelgn investors and to broaden the scope of private sector
activity. The following measures have been taken:
A.    The ForeLgn Snvestment Act (RA 7042) was passed last June 1991
and its implementing rules and regulatLons issued on October 28, 1991. An
addendum with definitionse/clarifications of the eriteria to be used for
inclusion of a sector in negative list C of the Regular Forelgn Investment
Negatlve List was issued on Aprll 21, 1992. A 1Lst of industries strategic
to the development of the economy shall be formulated and published by end
December 1992. With this act and streamlining of the lavestment review
procedures of the Board of Investments (301), the Phlilppines is one of the
most open countries In the regLon to foreign Lavestment. Foreign investors
except those desiring to avaLl of incentives no longer have to obtain
authorization frau 30? and can freely enter all sectors except those
speeLfLed in a short negative list which includes firms particLpating in
public works construction, natural resource extractlon, retail trade and a
few selected professional activitles.  Manufacturing is not a restrLeted
area except for products wlth LmplicstLons on publLc health and safety e.g.
drugs and explosives. Nowever, as required by law the transitory foreign
investment negative list shall be replaced at the end of the transitional
period of three years by a fLrst regular negative list. The intent and
splrit of the law and its lmplementLng rules, however, ls to ensure that the
negatlve list continues to be kept short and barrLers to entry are reduced
by simplifying regulatory procedures.
B.    To further ease the regulations for foreign natLonals Lnvesting
ln the country to conduct business domestically, a Memorandum of Agreement
among flve concerned agencies on employment of foreign natLonals, providing
for streamlLning of procedures to obtaLn Alien Employment Permits has been
adopted. An Executlve Order simplifying procedures for the conversLon of
vlsa status of cortain foreign nationals was also signed by President Aquino



-47-                              ANNEX II
on January 8, 1992.
Co.   On September 9, 1992, the Central Bank proposed to the
President for submission to Congress under PresLdintial certification# draft
legislation intended to liberalize the rules governing the entry of foreign
banks through the establishment of branch/branches in the Philippines with
full banking authority.
D     The Government is seeking to encourage private participation in
infrastructure investments through a number of measures.
(i)   Enactment of the Build-Operate-Transfer Law last July 9,
1990 (RA 6957), and the issuance of Implementing Rules on April 3,
1991. Already 6 BOT contracts in the energy sector have been sLgned,
more than in.any other -otatitry.
(iL) Approval by the BEDA Board of the GuidelLnes for Private
Sector Access to ODA last octobor 9, 1991.
(iii) On-lending of O0A, through Gcvernment fLnancial and
similar institutions for infrastructure projects. Over the past three.
years, US$293.72 mllion has been provLded through such mechanisms.
(Lv)   increase in the Single Borrower Limit for banks,
irncluding DSP, from 1S percent to 25 percent, which would facllitate
syndications.
We recognize that although our emphasLs L on prlvate sector particL-
pation in infrastructure, the prlvate sector may not be able to mobilLsi
sufficLent finances for the large infrastructure roeuirements of the next
few years, given country risk perceptions of commurclal external creditors.
Accordingly, we will consider on a case-by-case basis, other modalities for
channeling officLal ODA into socially desirable infrastructure projocts
through alternative uechanlsms such as coursing financing through government
non-bank financial institutions (such as Phllguarantee where the sLagle
borrower limit does not apply) and corporations, or encouraging further
syndications to participating private financLal institutions. We will also
monitor progress in implementation of; SOT projects to ensure that potential
procedural delays are quickly identifLed and eliminated.
B.    Pursuant to Executive Order No. 11 Lssued by President Fidel V.
Rames on August 10, 1992, the life of the Asset Privatization Trust (APT)
and the Committee on Privatization (COP) was extended from August 31, 1992
to December 31, 1993. With thts, we are continuing our strategy of focusing
on large tLeket privatization and expect to offer for sale by mid-1993 at
least 95 GOCCs with 75 percent of asset values (see Annex A for the complete
list of 122 corporations together with thelr 1985 valuations). Our largest
privatlzation transaction so far was the sale of 67 percent of Goverment
shares in Phllippine alrlines which resulted in gross proceeds of P9.64
blllion in cash for the National Goverrment. Government shares Ln
PhllippLne National Bank amounting to 43 percent were also sold via public
offering, generating cash proceed of P4.1 billion for the National



-48-                             ANNEX II
covernment. Additionally, the Government is studying options for further
expanding the pr.vatization effort to include ports, power generation,
potable water supply and sewrage faclities,, and idle government lands,
among others. The development of the former Subic naval base (the area of
which La as large as all of Singapore), for which the Bank is providing
technical asistance, is also being approaehed as a privatLzation
undertaking. We *xpect to generate at least P4.0 bilIlon for the public
sector from privatization sales in 1993.
With these measures, we expect to achieve one of the most investor
friendly environments in Asia. We plan to pursue a legLslative agenda to
fine-tune incentives in line with other competitor countries, where war-
ranted, including passage of the Condominiu  Law to provide greater
certainty to foreigners in using land and of net operating loss carry-over
incentives. We are also continuing efforts to transform the Board of
Investment from a regulatory to a promotional body; the Foreign Investments
Act, which removes the need for Sol authorization, is one step towards this
goal.
The trade reform program reflects the Government's determination to
develop efficient market mechanisms to allocate resources and to align the
trade regime with sectoral liberalization programs. To this end, we are
committed to avoiding prlce or quantity controls on trade flows and we are
moving towards the full dismantling of marketing monopolies and cartols. We
have approved the removal of quantitative restrictLons on commerc&lI
vehicles, as a necessary component of improving the efficiency of the
transport sector. We have institutionalized support for trade reform
through a process of extensive public hearings, "ad we are sooeking to
accelerate and deepen the process through agreaments reached with other
ASIA countries on freer trade. The level and dispersion of protection
afforded through tariffs is now governed by a time-bound schedule of tariff
reductions which will make the Philippines an open economy, comparable to
our neighbors.
The following measures have bee-h adopteds
A.    Tariff adjustments, as provided for in E0 470, issued In 1991,
are being phased in over a five year period to reduce the overall level and
the dispersal of tariff protection. The average import-weighted tariff,
which has been brought down from 43 percent in 1980 to 16 percent currently,
will be further reduced to 14 percent by July 1995. At this time, all
surcharges with a few exceptions, will also have been eliminated. The
maximum tariff will, in general be 30 percent and there will be just four
tariff bands, considerably reducing the administrative complexity of
implementing the tarlff code. In addition, a policy to further accelerate
the reduction of tariff level to 3 and 10 percent on selected capital
equipment, subject to revenue limitations, is under study by the 30!. The
temporary import levy, introduced as an mergency fiscal measure in Pebruary
1991, was removd in May 1912    In line with our thrust to improve customs



-49-                              ANNEX II
efficiency, we have impleamted a Clobalied Comprehensive Import Surveil-
lance.15ystem. A contract with Societe Generals de Surveillance to implment
this "stem became effectlve March 16, 1992. Our experience with a pilot
program was that pre-shipmat inspectlons have reduced technical umuggling
and contrLbuted towards hlgher revenue collection. As another step towards
greater customs transparency, a revlew of the proposal to shLft the basis of
customs valuation from Home Consumption Value to lair Market Value (Brussels
definition) is now underway.
B     As of April 1991, there were 414 Ltems (out of a total of over
C,000 tariff lines) covered by quantitative restrlctLons. Of these, a total
of 139 items were liberalLied without tariff adjustment or at reduced rates
of duty under Central Bank Circular Nos. 1337 and 1347 dated 27 April and 27
July 1992, respectively. These include consumer electronic products and
their spare parts, fertilizers, brand new dump trucks, used vessels, anti-
biotics, breeding 'animals and other Ltems. Another 125 ltems were
liberalized with temporary tariff adjustments under CB Circular No. 1356
issued on September 25, 1992 and E.O. No. 8. Included among these are other
trucks and buses Ltems, consumer durables, meat, fLsh, animal effects, and
sugar. An additional 15 ltems are to be liberalized at the latest by
December 1992, barring legislative action. In the case of corn, however,
while the removal of quantitative restriLtions will be undertaken, the
timlng is contingent on the implementation of certain other complementary
measures. Another 18 items consisting of coal and coal derLvatives and
refined petroleum products are to be liberalized ln conjunction wlth general
programs to reform these subsectors. Still another 13 items have been
approved for liberalization but require Congressional action before this can
become effectlve, and we lntend to submlt such legislatLon to Congress by
the end of this calendar year. Finally, we have decided to retaln
restrictions on 104 items, of whieh 35 relate to items covered under the
ratLonaLizatLon and development programs 33 for cars, motorcycles and other
vehicles,and 2 ltems for antibLotics, and 69 are being retained for health,
safety and national defense purposes.
C.    Export promotion is one of our top prLoritLes. In addition to
reforms on the exchange rate, trade credits and tarlffs, we Latend to
strengthen institutional support to exporters. We have established, and are
working to reLnforce, an Export and DevAhlopment Council, with private
sector particLpatLon. The One-Stop-Shop inter-Agency Center for Tax Credlts
and Duty Drawbacks, as embodied in Administrative Order No. 226 (February 7,
1992), has commenced operation on 4 May 1992 at Department of Finance. The
Center Ls envisLoned to achLve an orderly and expeditious processing of tax
credits and duty drawback applications while safeguarding the system from
the occurrence of undue claims. For the convenience of exporters in the
provinces, the system was already instLtuted outide. of Metro Xanlla.
Although the Center is not physically present in the region, an arrangement
was made to use the five BOX Extension Offices ln the procesaLng/evaluatLon
of applications for tax credits/duty drawbacks. In addltLon, we are also
studying some measures to lmprove the transferability of tax credits.
The TOR of the study for indirect exporters has been prepared by the

exporter which will allow their access to tax and duty free importation of
inputsjtax credits, and finaneing as extended to direct exporters.
D.   Problemt related to the energy sector continue to be a major
obstacle to economic growth, both through interruptions in the supply of
electricity and through the financial costs to the budget stemmLng from
implmentation of the currant system of energy price determination. over
the past few years, the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSP) has generated
large deficits and surpluses as a result of slow adjustment of domestlc oil
prices. and the National Power Corporation has required cash lnfusions from
the budget and continues to face difficulties in raising counterpart funds
to finance needed expansions in capacity. Other problems in the sector
inelude sector coordination, environmental and other approval and implemen-
tation procedures, equipment maintenance, generation and distribution
effLciencies including system losses (particularly pilferage), geothermal
royalties, and prolotion of energy conservation. In order to correct these
problems, we have initiated work on an Energy Sector Plan (ESP) focusing on
the critical issues, which is expected to be completed by the middle of
November 1992. This would detail how to establish a deregulated, maelet-
oriented energy sector, and would make recommendations in terms of: reform
of the policy rgime; institutional strengthening; and investment priori-
ties. This aotion plan will consider the findings of several studies On
energy pricing policies that are currently underway, including one financed
by the World Bank. It will also take into consideration the implications of
oil import prices and foreign exchange rates on domestic oil prices and on
electricity tariffs. Xt will be carried out under the supervision of the
Office of the Energy affalrs and will be discussed by donors at the next
Consultative Group meeting for the Philippines.
We expect to submit to Congress legislation reforming the energy
pricir.Z system as a priority act, shortly after reviewing the recommenda-
tions contained in the ZSP. Various options could be considered to meet our
obj ctlves of a liberalized, depoliticized oil price system, which would
eliminate cross-subsidies (except through explicit fiscal means), restrict
the accumulated gaLns or losses of the OPSP, and align domestic and
internatlonal energy prices. These include proposals to implement automatli
adjustments to prices as international conditions change and/or the OPS?
crosses specified financial thresholdst possible proposals to regulate the
industry through a rate of return criterion, rather than through control
over specific product pricing; and transferring some P2.0 billion of the
OPSF balances to fund additional capital requirements of NPC, now being
discussed in Congress.
In the short run, we must ensure that existing mechanlims governing
oil pricing operate effectively, especially in reflecting current interna-
tional prices and foreign exchange rates. Corollary to this, we have
instituted an automatic pricing formula for electricity, which should change
tariffs in proportion to fuel prices, but should endeavor to maintain
existing tariffs until at least an 8 percent return on rate base is achieved
by UPC and an internal cash generation of at least 20 percent of the
investment program is ensured.

Trananert Liberalization
The Government has given high priority to the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of a transport infrastructure system. In addition to main-
tenance activities, whLeh are to play a wore promLnent role, the government
Ls redefLning its responsibilities through a three-pronged approach. FIrst,
we have initiated a program designed to improve the present regulatory
transport framework through a more market oriented system whlle at the same
tim. strengthening standards to ensure safety, the welfare of the public,
and protectlon of the envlronment. second, we are Lncreasingly lnvolving
the private sector in the management and operation of transport
infrastructure and, as in the case of Phllippine Airlines, we are withdraw-
Lng from the direct prevision of transport services. Third, we are de-
volving substantLal parts of the centrally adminLstered road aetwork to
local authorities in concert with the general thrust of politLcal and
administratlve decentralization.
The Department of Transport and Communications has issued Department
Order (DO) No. 92-587 (30 March 1992) defining the policy framework on the
regulation of transport services. ThLs DO simplifies, reduces and abolishes
procedural and administrative barriers to competitLon wlthin the existing
legal framework. It eases entry into and exit from transport markets by
remov:ng or modifying a number of administrative practiees and requiring a
minimum of two franchise holders in major routes to avoLd a monopoly
situation. It allows for market-determined fares and rates around a guiding
rate, except for mandatory rates on routes monopolized by a single operator.
It states that the Government will refrain from subsidizing transport
operations, except in cases where no services are offered under market terms
and a minimum service level is deemed necessary. Special financing and
incentive programs, ineluding direct subsLdies for fleet acquisLtion and
expansion, will be phased out. Detailed rules and procedures for
implementing this DO will be issued by the middle of October 1992 by the two
responsible regulatory boards (the Land Transportation Franchising and
Regulatory Board, and the Maritime Industry AuthorLty).
Our intention is to lnstitutLonalize these policy changes by seekLag
necessary legal adjustments and we intend to submLt a Bill to Congress
accordLngly. We are also working on specific measures regarding safety and
envLronaental protection for land, sea and air transport. We have estab-
lished standards for a new motor vehicle inspection system, with two
statLons operational ln Metro Manila, two more established elsewhere in
Luzon, and still another two to be set up in Cebu and Davao, for a total of
six. Thli system will be expanded countrywLde, and will include prlvate
sector inspections stations authorlzed by the Government for these purposes.
This system should signlflcantly reduce air pollution from vehicle emLssLons
in high densLty urban areas   in maritime transport, the Government requlres
that all Phillppine registered ships of more than 500 tons conform to the
safety standards of an internatLonally recognized classLficatLon soeLety.
We have also issued guLdelines on the operation of oil tankers in national
waters requiring, inter alia, compulsory oll pollution cover. We are
rehabilitatLag air navlgation facilitLes and commissioning crash-tire-rescue
vehicles to improve air safety. However, we recognize that more still needs

ForEaLSMENShane &QWealLzatIon
Until recently, foreign exchange trading in the Philippines was re-
stricted to a few regLstered dealers. Exporters had to surrender almost all
forelgn exchange earnings and certain transactions, including capltal
account transactions were largely restricted. As a result, the system
contaLned an inherent bLas against exporters, both by inereasiag transac-
tions costs for those relyLag on imported inteimaediates and by reducing the
effect of market forces on the level of the oxchange rate.
These rules however were hard to enforce La an open economy, and were
increasingly incondistent with our objectives of promotLig foreign invest-
ment and exports. Accordingly, the Central Bank has embarked on a major
program to 1Lberalize foreign exchange transactions, with the objective of
achieving full deregulation by the *nd of 1992.
As an in$tial step in this process, significant liberalization meas-
ures have been implemented that increase currency convertibility in both the
current and capltal accounts of the balance of payments. Among these
measures are the expanded access to foreign currency loans of exporters and
substantial increase in their dollar retention rate to 40 percent, as
provided for in CB Circular No. 1317 issued December 11, 1991 and No. 1319
lisued January 3, 1992. CB Ctrcular No. 1334 Lssued April 1, 1992 provided
for free use of retained amounts by the exporter for any purpose. These
measures are expected to reduce the transactions costs of exporters
sininficantly, and to provide for a more comeitive export industry.
The provlslons of CB Circular No. 1318 issued January 3, 1992 reducing
restrictions on exchange transactions took effect January 20, 1992. The
major changes include:
(l)   Limitation of mandatory surrender of foreign exchange
receipts to only 15 types of business operations;
'te
($L) Higher coilings f2r travel, education and medical expendi-
tures among others;
(lii)   Allowance of indlvidual and corporate forelgn exchange
deposLts for operatLonal necessity upon approval bv the Central bank;
(iv)   Full and immediate repatriatLon and remlttance privileges
for all types of investments, whether as direct equity or in lLsted
shares or seocurities, without prlor CB approval; and
(v)   Expanslon  of eligLble deposlts under the foreign currency
deposLt system to include foreign exchange not required for surrender.
A number of important reforms in the foreign exchangs market have also



53                                  ANNEX I1
been implemented to deepen the market and improve the mechanim for ex-
change. rtat  determination.  In April 1992, a standard approach ws adoptd
egarding the computation of the foreign exchange position of co_relal .
banks under Circular gol. 1327 dated January 30, 1992. Specifically, banks
can now maintain an overbought or oversold position of up to 25 percent or
15 percent, respectively, of thelx unimpalred capital. Additionally, off-
floor interbank trading has bee  reopened since April 28, 1992. 'Te lItting
of restrictions on off-floor Interbank trading as contained ln the
Memorandum to All Banks No. 9 dated July 30, 1992 bas spurred the develop-
ment of the Philippine Dealing System which became fully operational on
August 3, 1992. The system allows authorized dealers of subsecrber banks to
deal on the spot and forward exchahge markets through an ejectronle
screen-based network for sharing Lnformation and undertaking transactions.
Banking transactions of Offshore Banking Units (08Us) and FCDWU have
been expanded. ODVs can now negotiate inward (export) L/Cs through their
worldwide network of branches and correspondents subject to certain limita-
tionsa while FCDUs are now alloeied to Invest ln foreign currency denominted
instruments.
The Central Bank is also taking steps towards simplifying the report-
ing requirements for foreign exchange use. The frequency of reports on ICDU
loans to domestic producers and export-oriented firms has been reduced from
weekly to monthly as per Circular Letter of April 30, 1992.
on June 19, 1992, the Monetary Board approved for implementation a
unified and codLfied set of regulations liberalizing foreign trade transac-
tions (CO circular 1348, July 28, 1992). The reform contained in the
Circular are meant to improve the allocative efficlency of the domstic
economy and enhance the competitiveness of Philippine enterprises.
The major change in import regulations include the streamlining of
the classification of import commodities; sore liberal arraage_ent for
payment of imports; and the simplification and delisting from prior CB
approval of several import transactions and procedures.
Reforms deregulating export rules consist of expanding the authorized
modes of payment for exports, lengthening the inward remlttance period for
export proceeds to 180 days, and further simplifying and/or reLaxing rules
governing certain export transactions.
The Central BanXi has reviewed, during July 1992, the regulatory polLcy
framework for foreign exchange transactions. Based on criteria including
foreign exchange reserve adequacy and the smooth functioning of the off-
floor trading system, we have submitted an action plan for further foreign
exchange liberalization for consideration of the Monetary Board. In line
with this, the Board lisued a Circular on August 24, 1992 allowing full
1lberalization of foreign exchaeg reguatLons covering current transactions
which included lifting of the mandatory surrender reqpirement of foreign
exchange imposed on iS types of business operatlons and allowing AMB to
sell forelgn exchange for all types of invlsible payments without prior CS
approval. With these changes, we will be able to slmplify reporting

requireMets, streamlne procedures and institute a simplified system within
the Central Bank for monLtorLng of foreign exchang transaction.
Central fapk incom  8Sort
The Central lank has been runni  anual dsf icits of over P20 biUlion
for the last thre years largely oan account of debts incurred in the
performance of quasL-ftscal actLvitLes such as the large forward cover
arrangemnts with pubUL¢ sector corporations: swap arrangement with
commercLal banks} commercial banksi assumption of forelgn obligations of the
public sector, provl bsn of subsidLizd credit to priority sectors ineluding
the National Oovernment 'and non-performing loans and advances to failed
finacial instithtions. This defieLt problem has severely constrained the
conduct of monetary polLcy, At the same time, because of its exposure to
exchange losses, CS managment of the exchange rate is impaired. To remedy
the situation, we are embarkiag on a plan to reduce the deficit of the
Central Bank with the objectlve of realizing savings of over P10 blllion
ovor a twelve month perlod.
A. Delivery of Outstanding Swap Contracts
A major source of past and potential CB losses is the outstanding
stock of swap contracts that the Central Bank entered into with commercial
banks in 1983 and whlch have been rolled over since then. Between April ana
July 1992, all outstanding deliverable waps wlth commercial banks amounting
to $965 illion were umnwund. The unwlndLng operatLon eliminated not peso
differentials payable to banks amounting to 311.9 billLion, and facliLtated
the surrender to CB of P4.8 bllion in CB notes and bonds used to socurLtLze
a portion of the blocked lnterest on said peso differentials. Moreover, the
swap unwindLng would elLmlnate future interest payments on the peso
differentials and on the CB securltles, and avert further Lncurrence of
forelgn exchange losses. The resulting net reductlon in the CB deficit is
estimated to amount to around U4 bllLn annually.
The swap unwlnding complemented earlier actions taken by the CB,
namely, the payment of current interest on blocked peso differentials
starting October 1990, and pay"mnt of,blocked interest payabl. to commercial
banks as of end-1990 ln cash or Centeal Bank bonds/notes over a ten year
Wrlid.
3. Financial Assistance from the National Government
Sn a joint Memorandum of Agreement of 17 January 1992, the National
Government agreed to undertake immediate measures to arrest the problem of
CB deficits. One of those measures is the Lisuance of Special Series
Treasury bills and the deposLt of the pAoceeds therofrom in a non-interest
bearing account wlth CS Ln an amount that would generate lnterest savings to
the CB of about 33.5 billion on an annual basis.
To complement the above measure, the National Government has iLsued
Treasury notes to the Central Bank with a face value of 312.S bllion,



-55-                                    ANNEX II
Lnterest rate of 20 percent and three year maturity, with proceeds added to'.
the non-interest pso deposit. This will yield an additional 12 billion
interest savings anually.  The National Governmet intends to regularie a
portion of these deosits through submitting a reuest to Congress for full
payment of the remaining P9.99 bllion in authoried*, unpaid Central Bank
capital, or in alternative legislative authorlsations with eqLvalent
effect.
C.    Central Bank Savings from the Debt Package
The National ovrnment is to.'issue all new bonds assoecated with the
debt agreement with caomercial banks. The CB should benefLt nevertheless
from the buyback and interest savings. The expected gain to the Contral
Dank is estimated at around 11.S billion annually, but in addition, the
agrement will lead to more predictable debt servLicg for the CB.
In the long run, we intend to make a strong repr"entation with
Congres for the rehabilitation of the Central Dank, to be effected by way
of a major financial restructuring Lnvolving the transfer of certain Central
Bank assets and liabilLties to the National Government and a substantial
recapitalization of the CB. Thli will have the effect of the fiscal sector
absorbing the costs of the Central Bank defielts, by way of tax and other
government revenues.. Through such a transfer, we intend to restore the CS
to a viable flnancLal position which would, at the same time, leave the CB.
protected against exchange losses. Among the assets to be transferred are
certain Central Bank real estate assets previously identifLed. For its
part, the Central Bank will continue to try to minlmise its losses throughs
iL) Organizational streamlinLag and cost control measures;
(iL) Suspension of addLtLonal medium and long term foreign bor-
rowing and the attainment and subsequent maintenance of a positive net
foreLgn asset position; and
(iLL) Maintenance of market-orLented londing policies.
A permanent solutLon to the problem of Central Bank deficits needs to
be addressed through legilative cha4ges to the Central Bank Act. We are
actively pursuLng such changes in co&junction with technical and possible
financLal assistance from the World Dank and International Monetary lund.
As a complement to this, we are committed to developing domestic capital
markets in other areas, including a proposed unification of the Manila and
the MakatL Stock exchanges; deepening of the Government Securities market;
and strengthening the role of pension funds in the provision of long-term
finaces to industry.
In light of the Government's strong commLtment to macroeconomic
stability, its signlfLcant undertakings in structural reforms and the
importance of the recently completed debt agreement with commercLal bank



-56-
ANNAX II
creditors, the GovMent would appreclate favorable cweiderition b  given'
to it~Irrevst for a US$200 mllUoan conomio Iutegration Loan. The
Government of the   iwl  continue its close consultation with the
World Bank throughobt the program and will imlement, to the best of its
abity, the measures Indicated In this letter.
We believe'that the reform program we are undertaking and the debt and
debt servLce reduction operation will contribute substantially to our
contLiued efforts to bring about material improveents in the ecomcLe
conditions of the Phlippies and the living standards of Lts people.
