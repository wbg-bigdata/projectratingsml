                   quired."
      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:

      documents."
      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56  of the Guidelines are deleted.

commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded

advertising and tendering procedures followed and such other informa-
tion as the Bank shall reasonably request.

3 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to
the submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal
of funds from the Loan Account in respect thereof, such documentation
