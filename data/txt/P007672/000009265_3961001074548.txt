MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A MINING SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) for the equivalent of US$200 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by the
United Mexican States, would have a term of 17 years, including five years of
grace, with interest at the standard variable rate. The loan would help
finance a mining sector restructuring project.
2.   Background.  Mexico is a country with vast mining potential.  Its
comparative advantage as a mineral producer includess a) polymetallic ores of
high quality and high precious metal content, b) a wide range of exportable
non-metallic minerals, c) a low wage structure, d) a broad base of experienced
mine workers and professionals, and e) a strategic location next to its most
important market, the United States, plus access to both oceans. This
comparative advantage is so significant, that although exploration efforts to
date have been relatively modest, Mexico is a major mineral producer and
exporter.
3.   Notwithstanding the above, mining is today a relatively small and
declining see,-.r within the Mexican economy.  Over the past 50 years mining
output has decreased from 4.02 to 1.52 of GDP. Stringent policy barriers to
entry to domestic and foreign investors, as well as a complex and
discretionary regulatory framework, have impeded the realization of the
sector's full potential by restricting private participation (e.g. 502 of the
12 million hectares of discovered mineral land are currently reserved for the
State). This regulatory framework also resulted in a very bureaucratic and
inefficient administrative structure in the public agencies that deal with the
sector.
4. The Bank shares thr view of the Government that Mexico's mining sector
has significant growth pi-.ential.  Total annual exploration investment in the
recent past is estimated at US$40 million; however, based on statistics from
other countries, exploration investment could reach 8 to 102 of output value
or about US$200 million a year, i.e. five times the current level. A
comprehensive 1989 Bank study entitled Republic of Mexico-Hinins Sector Review
(Report No.7379-ME), identified an inadequate regulatory and institutional
f-amework as the major constraint to increased private investment and further
growth. More specifically, the report states that increased access to land
and mineral rights, reduced foreign ownership limitations, a revision of
mining tax legislation, a restructuring of the existing institutional set up,
and stabilization of the macroeconomic environment are the basic requirements
to enable Mexico to more fully exploit its comparative advantage in the mining
sector. The Government agreed with tne report's findings, began to implement
key recommendations and requested Bank support in achieving a full
transformation of the mining sector.
5.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In the more developed countries venture
capital plays a major role in financing mining exploration and thereby sector



- 2 -
growth. In Mexico no such market exists for small and medium scale mining
enterprises (SMMs). The Bank has partially filled this gap through two
operations, the First Small and Medium Scale Mining Project (Loan 1820-ME) for
US$40 million in 1980 and the Second Small and Medium Scale Mining Project
(Loan 2546-ME) for US$105 million in 1985. These projects made available
almost US$145 million in term credit facilities to the sector, which provided
SdMs with access to otherwise unavailable long term investment financing.
6.   Mexico's financial sector is undergoing a major reform.  It has become
essentially market oriented, with the Government phasing out subsidized
interest rates and first-tier lending by development banks and trust funds.
Moreover, initial actions to privatize the commercial banks have been taken, a
process that is expected to be completed in about two years. During that
period and for sometime afterwards the newly privatized commercial banks are
likely to be reluctant to engage in lending to sectors with a limited track
record to assess risks, in particular to a sector like mining, which is itself
undergoing major policy reforms. This situation justifies the proposed Bank
loan, that would provide credit to the mining sector during the transitional
period until commercial banks become actively engaged in funding mining
operations. In line with present Bank policy on directed credit, this loan is
expected to be the last line of credit operation for mining to Mexico.
7.   Project Obiectives.  The proposed project would help transform mining
Into a modern and dynamic sector of the Mexican economy. The main objectives
of the proposed project are to: a) support the Government's program to
deregulate the mining sector and stimulate private domestic and foreign
investment, through the establishment of an appropriate policy and
institutional framework; b) build broader financial market support to the
mining industry; and c) help finance the surge in demand for investment
funding that is expected to result from the improved policy and institutional
setting for mining operations.
8.   Prolect Descrigtion.  To accomplish its objectives the proposed project,
in addition to providing financing for SMVs, would support the following
policy changes and institutional reforms in the mining sector: (i)
liberalizing private sector access to land with mineral potential and
releasing state-held mining reserves; (ii) reducing barriers to foreign
investment in mining enterprises; (iii) implementing a mineral rights policy
that is conducive to an improved allocation of resources; (iv) reforming the
system of mining concessions; (v) phasing out state ownership of enterprises
in the sector; (vi) modernizing the government agencies providing support to
small and medium scale mining enterprises; (vii) establishing environmental
standards for the mining sector; and (viii) phasing out direct Government
financing of mining activities.
9.   The proposed project has a significant technical assistance component
that would help improve the capabilities of DGM, CFM and CRM to perform their
new roles more effectively. Activities to be carried out under this component
include: a) the, modernization of DGM's system of mining administration and
control; b) two studies, one to evaluate the results from the recently
introduced changes to mining regulations and the other to explore the
possibility for further policy adjustments; c) the establishment of industry-
specific environmental standards for mining; d) the training of CFM personnel
to improve their project evaluation and supervision skills, and to increase



their environmental knowledge and expertise; and e) the upgrading of CRM'8
capability to generate, process and divulge geological information.
10. Proiect Cost. Financinx and Implementation. The proceeds from the Bank
loan would help SMMs finance investments in metallic and non-metallic mining
subprojects f'or an estimated total amount of US$436.5 million equivalent,
including project related technical assistance in the amount of US$11 million.
The proposed Bank loan would finance 462 of total project costs, the remainder
would be covered by the beneficiaries (34%), CF4 (15%) and the PFIs (5%). The
proposed project would provide financing for: (i) a credit component of
US$191.5 million, to help fund subloans to SMMs for the acquisition of fixed
assets (including pollution control equipment), permanent working capital and
the development of existing mineral reserves; and (ii) technical assistance of
US$8.5 million, mainly to help fund institutional strengthening programs for
DGM and CRM.
11. NAFIN (the Borrower) would relend the proceeds of the loan to the
Guarantor and CRM. The Guarantor would further unlend to FFM the amount
allocated to the credit component, which would be relent through the PFe1 to
SMMs. CFM would act as project coordinator and would therefore be the main
interlocutor with the Bank on project implementation. Retroactive financing
of eligible expenditures incurred since September 10, 1990 (the date of
project appraisal), up to a maximum amount of US$20 million is recommended.
The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement of goods and works, as well as the engagement of consultants would
follow Bank guidelines. The procurement method and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank and IFC operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.
12.  Main Actions Taken and Aareed Upon.   The Government has issued a new
"Reglamento" (implementing regulations) to the Mining Law which, inter alia,
liberalizes private sector access to land and provides for the release of
state-held mining reserves, permits majority foreign investment in mining
enterprises and establishes a modern mineral rights policy. Any material
change to the "Reglamento" that could adversely affect achievement of the
project's objectives or any occurrence that would prevent its implementation
would be an event of default.
13. Agreement was reached during loan negotiations with the Government,
NAFIN, CFM and CRM1, inter alia, on: (i) undertaking two studies to evaluate
the effectiveness of the new regulatory framework and to provide the
analytical basis for any further policy adjustments in the future; (ii)
implementing a comprehensive five-year business plan for CFM, that includes a
policy statement, a five-year financial plan, a business plan for its
beneficiation plants, a program to deal with its problem portfolio and a
commitment to progressively reduce the scope of CFMEs first-tier lending;
(iii) implementing a suitable five-year business plan for CRM, that includes a
policy statement, and programs for aerial reconnaissance, the modernization of
laboratory services and for the establishment of a computerized information
network; (iv) undertaking a program to attract commercial banks to financing
mining projects, particularly in the metallic subsector, and requiring
commercial banks to contribute an increasing share of their own resources to
finance eligible subprojects: rising to at least 202 by July 1, 1994; (v)



-4
providing the Bank an environmental impact statement for every subproject
before any subloan is approved, strengthening CFM's environmental capability
and establishing satisfactory environmental standards for the mining industry
by June 30, 1992; (vi) the technical assistance component of the project;
(vii) the applicable relending term and conditions; and (viii) conducting a
joint annual review with the Bank to exchange views on the progress of the
project and assess the need for further measures to achieve its objectives. A
condition of effectiveness would be that contractual arrangements for the
transfer of loan proceeds between RAFIN, the Guarantor, PFM and CRM, which are
satisfactory to the Bank, have been signed and are legally binding.
14. Benefits. The proposed project would help develop Mexico's mining
sector, which is believed to have strong growth potential, in an
environmentally sound manner. The recent changes in the regulatory framework
providing for increased private sector access to land and mineral rights, and
for the streamlining of concession procedures and majority foreign ownership
of mining firms, should result in higher investment by private domestic and
foreign companies. Furthermore, the reorientation of the sector's policies
and public institutions in favor of activities that directly support private
mining exploration and exploitation, and the increase in commercial bank
lending for mining operations that would be expected to be initiated by the
project, should also lead to higher investment in the sector. Increased
investment would in turn result over time in higher mining output, exports and
employment. Moreover, the establishment of environmental standards for the
mining industry should help ensure that the sector's development is
sustainable.
15. Risks. Policy reversals, which would be the main concern to private
investors, seem unlikely given Mexico's impressive and sustained efforts to
open up and deregulate its economy. Hence, the main project risks relate to
issues that could adversely affect loan disbursements: a) continued low
international metal prices; b) an overvalued exchange rate; and c) lot-or than
expected commercial bank participation in lending to mining, particularly
during the coming years when these bunks are to be privatized. The potential
negative impact of these risks is, however, ameliorated by the fact that
Mexico is a low cost mineral producer, the Government has export promotion as
a key objective of its economic policy, and CFM/FPM has been succesful in the
past in attracting commercial banks to finance non-metallic mining operations.
Moreover, the proposed loan amount is based on a conservative demand estimate
for financial resources. In this context, the risks faced by the project are
considered acceptable.
16. Recommendation. I sm satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

CM2Nmfift. The participating institutions (CRM and DGM) would have the
responsibility for ensuring the competitiveness, in price and qualitv, of the
items procured and their suitability for the purpose inteaded. Consultant
services financed with loan proceeds would be open to international
recruitment, and corresponding Bank guidelines would be applied. Goods and
works estimated to cost per contract: (i) less than US$50,000 would be
procured under local shopping, provided, however, that the aggregate amount
for wotk. does not exceed US$250,000, (ii) between US$50,000 and US$250,000,
would be procured under local competitive bidding; and (iii) more than
US$250,000, would be procured under international competitive bidding
according to Bank guidelines.
2     Procurement of Goods and Works under the Line of Credit Coonent.
Contracts estimated to cost US$5 million or more vould be procured under ICB
procedures, in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts estimated to cost
between US$1.5 million and US$5 million equivalent, would be procured through
shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank, requiring at least three
responsive price quotations from eligible suppliers. For contracts costing
less than US$1.5 million, procurement would be done under established
commercial procurement practices acceptable to the Bank. In all cases, a
preference margin of 151 or the applicable duty, whichever is lower, may be
granted to local producers under ICB contracts for goods, in accordance with
Bank guidelines.
3     Prior Review of Procurement Decisions. Procurement documentation for
all ICB contracts for goods and works would be subject to the Bank's prior
review. In addition, the procurement documentation for the first three
contracts for goods and works under the line of credit component, estimated to
cost US$1.5 million or more but less than US$5 million equivalent, and the
first three LCB contracts under the technical assistance component, would also
be subject to the Bank's prior review.
4     Disbursement.  In order to facilitate project execution, a Special
Account would be opened and maintained in US dollars, with an initial deposit
of US$20.0 million. NAFIN, as financial agent of the Government, would manage
withdrawals under the Loan, including the Special Account. Withdrawal
applications would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures for
contracta costing less than US$1 million. NAFIN would ensure that all
supporting documentation is adequately maintained and made available for
review upon the Bank's request. NAFIN would be required to submit to the Bank
a monthly statement of the transactions of the Special Account, it would also
be responsible for compliance with the corresponding audit requirements.
