REPORT AND RECCXMJENDATICN OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPCSED LQAN
AIND A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
BOTH TO THE MALAGASY REPUBLIC
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation   on a proposed loan
and a proposed credit for the equivalent of US$15.0 million each, to the
Malagasy Republic, to help finance a Third Highway Project. The loan would
have a term of 25 years, including ten years of grace, with interest at
7-1/4% per annum. The credit would be on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE 0ONCMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Recent Economic Position and Prospects
of the Malagasy Republic" (Report No.AE-11a) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on January 27, 1971. A major report on the economy will be preDared
by an economic mission which has been in Madagascar during November 1972.
Annex I presents updated basic country data collected and generated by this
mission.
3.        The large area of the country and its comparatively small population
significantly affect its economic development problems, opportunities and
prospects. Whilst the country is sparsely populated (7.4 inillion people on
a land area of 590,000 square kilometers - i.e. 13 inhabitants per square
kilometer), there is intense population pressure on resources in certain
areas, particularly the central highlands and the south. This gives rise
to important migrations of a seasonal, semi-permanent and permanent character.
In particular migration to the west of the country where underutilized land
is still plentiful is recurring on some scale. The geographical pattern
of investment clearly must take account of this movement.
4.        The Malagasy economy remains heavily dependent on France, for both
financial and technical assistance. There are some 34,000 Frenchmen living
on the island, playing a significant role in the economy, in education as
well as industry, agriculture, and trade. Madagascar is also a member of
the Franc Zone, thereby benefiting from free convertibility of its intra-
zone export earnings and from overdraft facilities with the French Treasury.
Madagascar's trade with countries outside the Franc Zone has been generally
in balance, primarily because of coffee and vanilla exports to the U.S.
5.        Madagascar's GNP in 1970 was estimated at approxim2tely $880 million,
and the per capita income was about $125. The economy is basically agricultural.
More than 80% of the population is rural, and agriculture accounts for
roughly 30% of total GNP. About half of this production is, however,
consumed on the farm; monetary income from agricultural pursuits is approximately



- 2 -
20% of total monetized income. The main prccuct for local consurmtion
is rice.  The main export- products are coffee, cloves, vanilla and animal
products (mostly meat).
6.        Between 1966 and 1971 real GON? rew at about 5%, representirg an
annual increase in per capita GNP of slightly over 2% a year.   In recen;
years, the Government has made a strong effort to increase public secto:'
investment and to create conditions for the expanston of private nvestmX .
Gross fixed capital formation rose from F1S 22 billion in 196i to 36 bil-. Lo.
in 1970. While detailed inormation for 1971 is not yet available, and is
particularly scarce respecting private investment, there are indicatio;-.s <.
there has been a continued increase in inves-;ment.  The proporti,on of ui;
devoted to investment increased from 13% in 1966 to more thar. 16% in 1970.
During the past few years, about one half of pLblic sector investment, w:ic.
represents, on average, 40% of total gross capital formation, has been
financed by recurrent budget surpluses and thne rest by foreign ca-pital :-a ;.
The European Development Fuind (FED) has been the major so-urce of external
capital (about one half of the total) while others, principally France anca
the Bank Group have provided the rest.
7.        The Government has been cautious in its overall fiscal policy.
Current Government revenue increased faster than monetized GDP, at an am-uai
rate of 11%, in the period 1966-71. Total tax revenue now represents about
25% of monetized GDP. Likewise Central Government savings have increased
continuously from 1966; in 1971, 27% of Central Government revenue was saved
and covered close to the total of Government investment expenditures. There
has been an overall cash surplus in the budget in four of the last eight
years, and in 1970 and 1971 the surpluses were substantial. Deficits have
never been large.  Some deterioration is expected in 1972 and 1973 because o:
the abolition of the head tax and of the cattle tax which had been recorner-ded.
as a phased policy by an I1T' tax mission.  These together had produced about
80% of the tax revenue of the provinces, and 12% of total tax revenue ofL the
country. Accordingly, it is expected that transfers from the Central
Government to the provinces will need to be increased. The a&r_rnistration
is preparing several measures to reduce routine budget expernditures and
increase revenues, such as abolishing free housing Lor civil servants and
ixmproving the collection of direct taxes. These measures to restrain routine
expenditure will be in keeping with previous Goverrment policies which have
kept the real incomes of Governrrent e=rl,yee-- virtually unchangied over the
last 5-6 years.  The increase in the Gov-zrrnmnt's outlay on salaries has
resulted from a doubling of employment in education between 1966 and 1971
and a 2.-5 per annun increase in other Central Government employment.
8.        Ecternal finances have reflectec the cautious fiscal policy.   In
1970, export earnings increased by 40% while imports lagged behind and the
country's foreign exchange reserves almost doubled.   In lg9l, imports irncreased
by 25%, while exports stagnated; hoTever, foreign exchange reserves declired
only slightly.  They now amoAnt to $65 million, corresponding to three-and-a
-half months' imports.



Xadagascarts first Five-Year Plan oeriod ended in 1968.   It was
.ollowed by an interim Plan for 1969-70 and by the preparation of a new
Plan, the official adoption of which has, however, been delayed though
its main outlines have been followed. The development strategy since the
and of the lcst Plan aims at: (i) self-sufficiency in rice; (ii) diversification
of expct s tirough stimulation of new exoorts (livestock, cotton, forest
products) and the expansion of mining; and (iii) improvement in transport,
pi-t-cularly roads and ports.  There has been progress with regard to each
of these objectives.
30.       At the end of 1971, Miadagascarts external public debt, outstanding
and disbursed, amounted to $110.7 million equivalent.   France was the major
creditor, accounting for 61% of the total, while debt to the Bank Group
accounted for 15%. Debt service payments in 1971 amounted to $8.9 million
or 3.9,% of estimated foreign exchange earnings. Although debt service
is relatively low and the country is creditworthy for further lending on
Bank terms, it is desirable, in view of the country's poverty and the still
limited prospects for its exports, that the major proportion of external
aid continue to be provided on concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO MADAGASCAR
Ii.       Since the newly independent Ylalagasy Republic became a member of
the Bank and IDA in September 1963, Miadagascar has received five DA credits
totalling $44.4 million and three Bank loans totalling $11.1 million. Four
of the projects representing 50,% of the total amount have been in transport;
three projects, representing about 42% of total lending, were in agriculture;
tle balance is accounted for by a loan for an education project.   Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits and notes on the
execution of on-going projects. Project execution is generally satisfactory.
Administrative delays in the preparation. of withdrawal applications, which
occurred in the earlier projects, have been largely overcome.
12.       The priority which the Bank Group in its lending is giving to the
improvement of transport and agriculture conforms to Madagascar's development
requirements and objectives. Our past and future programs in the transport
ector have been geared to: (i) the provision of links between the main
urban centers; (ii) the construction of penetration roads in the promising
agricultural areas; (iii) the improvement of port facilities; and (iv) the
strengthening of the railroad which provides a more economic means for
transportation in certain areas and for certain commodities. The Tamatave
port project, currently in execution, will soon provide an improved outlet
for exports. Bank Group financed road construction in the central and
northern regions has helped to increase all-weather land connections within
the island and will with this proposed project continue to do so in the
central and western regions. I expect to be able to submit to you early
in FY 1974 a proposal for a railway loan.



13.        In agriculture Madagascar's development policy is to keep the
country self-sufficient in rice by expand-Lng production, and to diversify
and increase the production of export crops;the Bank Group is as3isting
the Government in the implementation of this policy with the three projects
for which assistance has been provided, including the Morondava irrigation
project which you approved in June. Several additional projects for genera_
agricultural development, forestry, livestock and rice productior a.e at
various stages of prepara-ion and should result in Bank Group financing
operations over the next two fiscal years.   Also under consideration is a
second project in education and a development finance company uroject.
PART III - TRANSPORT IN MiADAGASCAR
14.        The lack of efficient means of communication has hindered MadagascarK-
economic development.  Despi-e investments in recent years the transport
system is still at an early stage of development and cannot yet fully serve
Madagascar's needs.   The northern and part of the western regio-ns have no
all-weather land connections with the rest of the island; the links wit;^
the southern region are largely trails.   The size of the country, the rugLe&-
ness of its terrain, the dearth of road building materials and the fact thal
the relatively light population tends to cluster in dense but relatively
small and isolated pockets exacerbates transport problems and makes their
solution very expensive.   It now takes from four to six weeks to transport by la;.c
goods from Tananarive, the capital, and most irnportant economic center, to
Diego Suarez, the main port in the north, a distance of 1,200 km.
With an all-weather road of modest standards, this travelling time could
easily be reduced to a few days.
15.        The state-owned railway system comprises about 900 kon,   and is
operated by the Reseau National des Chemins de Fer Malgaches. under the
supervision of the Ministere de l'Am6nagement du Territoire. Most of the
system was built prior to 1920, and does not permit speeds above 35 Ion an
hour. Since the railways have enjoyed preferential treatment they have
been able to show successful financial results (See paragraph 25). Technically,
they are well managed, but due to organizational problems, the uneconomic tariff
structure, and the lack of financial and commercial flexibility, they are
ill-equipped to face increasing road competition.   The railways are presently
contemplating a large renewal and exDansion program for which the Bank's
assistance has been requested.   In this connection, a railway appraisal
mission has been scheduled for early 1973.
16.        Madagascar has a fairly extensive .ir transport network.    Of its
63 airfields, 17 are built to all-weather standards. The rest have unpaved
runways which may be closed during bad weather.   Only the airports at
Tananarive and Majunga can handle international jet aircraft.   This network
does however compensate to some extent the absence of adequate land transport.



17.        Inland water transport is limited by the lack of navigable waterways.
Coastal navigation is important as the only means of transport between many
areas; this traffic amounted to about 300,000 tons in 1970. Recognising the
importance of water transport in the country's transport system, the Bank
Grolup through an IDA credit of $9.6 million made in June 1970 (Credit _No. 200-MAG)
is participating in finahringThitension wok inVthe Port of'Tamiatave - the
country's largest port - and provides technical assistance for management
personnel and for training.
18.        The highway network comprises about 32,000 km of roads consisting
of a primary network of 8,500 kIn, 19,000 km of secondary roads and about
4,500 km of other roads. Road density is relatively low and is not uniform;
large regions like Diego Suarez, Morondava and Fort Dauphin are not yet
connected with the rest of the island by all-weather roads. With the exception
of about 1,500 km of asphalt-paved primary roads constructed since 1964, road
standards are generally low with alignments bad, pavements narrow and weak,
and structures often obsolete. Through two past loan/credit operations res-
pectively in 1966 and 1968, the Bank Group has contributed to constructing
some 300 km of roads and three major bridges (see Annex II). Annual traffic
growth, based on fuel consumption records, suggests an average rate of 8% per
annum, about the same as the growth of the vehicle fleet.
19.        The Ministere de l'Am6nagement du Territoire (Ministry) administers
national roads - about 27% of the total network - and provides assistance
(including personnel and equipment) to provincial and local authorities for
other roads. The Government intends, within the next 18 months, to define a
secondary road network and to establish a program to transfer gradually the
full responsibility for the' upkeep of this'network to the- Ministry.  -
20.        Administration of the national highway system is generally well
organized. Within the Ministry the Public Works Directorate is responsible
for planning construction and maintenance of roads and relies heavily on
expatriate staff; currently it has about 60 experts supplied by the French
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation. The Government, in accord with its policy
to reduce gradually dependence on expatriates, is taking measures to train
nationals to fill positions currently occupied by foreigners. The Bank is
assisting in this respect through an education project (Loan 510-MAG) which
provides for expansion of a technical lycee to train middle-level personnel
in engineering, and in road and building construction.
21.        in general priority has been given by the Government to new roads
serving areas with good agricultural development potential in preference
to upgrading inadequate roads or building new ones which would compete with
other modes of transport. Using these criteria, a highway master plan was
drawn up in 1961 by the Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les Equipements d'Outre-
Mer (BCEOM, France) in close cooperation with the Commissariat du Plan and
the former Ministry of Public Works, called the "Plan of the Year 2000".
The first phase of this plan was the period 1964-1973, during which 3,000 km of



the primary road network and 6,000 kom of the secondary roads we:e vo be
reconstructed to modern paved standards.  Although Ltplementat_in oG thi.-
first phase of the plan has fallen short of its ambitious objec-`ves, the wo--
completed has provided some of the key links in the island's transpo v&t-
work. Following the recent political changes, the Governmient is con.sider_.i
revision of the highway investment program.
22.        External financing for highways is proviaed largely oy t`c-e
Development Fund (FED) and to a lesser extent by thca Bank Group. There :war
also been some participation boy the, Governmernts of Italy and the Federal
Republic of Germany who are currently helping to finance projec-s costing
approximately US$8.8 million and US$16 million respectively.
23.        Road construction is carried out largely by convract. The sin m-a:
road contractors are subsidiaries of French firms and many of th-e s;malier
contractors are also foreign.  The local contracting industry has not devc-
oped due to the scarcity of capital, the urnavailability of cre_i- fazii `zs
and the scarcity of professional skills.  The Government is consid erin  .:s
to encourage development of the local contracting industry0  The Dpossibil-ly
of executing road projects with more labor intensive methods is also receIxv
attention.
24.        Expenditures on road maintenance are ins-ufficient; many iCoads
poorly maintained and maintenance equipment remains under-utilized.        i;g
negotiations, the Government provided assurances tha-t sufficient funds wil.l
be allocated annually to permit adecuate road maint'enance. The Governnlen-
has also agreed to review maintenance needs and the adequacy of budgetary
allocations annually with the Bank.
25.        Road transport has not been permitted to compete effectively wt-i
rail transport in the important Tananarive-Tamatave corridor.  This has noon
achieved by administrative restrictions on vehicle weight, and by deferring
improvements of the road.  As a result, the railways have adopted tariffs
that yield a substantial financial surplus, but disregard economic consider-
ations.  The cost to the economy of this policy has not been qun-cified,
but could be high; for instance excessive depcndence on the railways has
at times caused congestion and delay.  The Government's position on this
question, however, is changing and consultants under Credit 90-HAG are
currently investigating the feasibility of improving:. the road between
Tananarive and Tamative with due consideratior to modal coordination.  Also,
during negotiations, the Governmenat agreed to take steps towards ratio-
nalizing resource allocations in the transport sector to ensure souid
development and efficient use of all transport modes, including t-he lifting
of uneconomic restrictive tranisport measures.
PART DT - THE PROJECT
26.        A report entitled "Appraisal of a T'hird Highway Pro`ect - Malagasy
Republic" (No. 23-MAG) is beinig distributed to the Executive Directors separately7
A Loan/Credit and Project Sumnary is provided in Annex III.



-7-
~27.       The project was appraised in November 1971 and an updating missior
visited Madagascar in September/October 1972. The project is intended to
support the development of Madagascar's transport system by the detailed
engineering and construction of selected priority road sections. Negotiations
for the proposed Loan/Credit were held in Washington from October 24 to 27, 1972.
The Malagasy delegation was led by General Andriamahazo, Ministre de l'Am6na-
gement du Territoire, and included His Excellency Henri Raharijaona, Ambassador
of Madagascar to the United States, Mr. Rahalison, Secretary General, Ministere
de l'An6nagement du Territoire, Mr. Andriamavalona, Secretary General, Ministry
of Finance, Mrs. Celine Rabevazaha, Director of Planning, Mr. Ranaivoarivelo,
General Manager, Malagasy Railways, Mr. Rapiera, Director of Post and Tele-
communications and Mr. Randrianasolo, Counselor, Malagasy Embassy.
28.        The project (see map attached) consists of:
(i)   construction of approximately 417 km of primary roads, namely:
Route Nationale 44: Vohidiala-Ambatondrazaka (24 km);
RN-1: ' Arivoniamamo-Analavory (59 km);
RN-34: Antsirabe-Betafo (21 km)
Betafo-Mandoto (81 kin)
Mandoto-Miandrivazo (118 km)
Miandrivazo-Malaimbandy (114 km); and
twelve major bridges on the Miandrivazo-Malaimbandy section.
(ii)   consulting services for:  (a)  supervision of construction under
item (i); (b) detailed engineering of a further 200 km of
primary roads; and (c)  a review of the traffic counting system.
29.        All the road sections proposed for construction pass through areas
of high agricultural and livestock production or potential. The section of
RN-44, currently unpaved, is already carrying heavy traffic from paddy pro-
duction in the Lac Alaotra region. The section of RN-1, west of the capital,
leads to an area with ranching potential in which the Bank Group is already
involved through Loan 585-MAG. The sections on RN-34 include reconstruction,
near Antsirabe, of a section already carrying about 600 vehicles per day and
construction of a new road in the Sakeny River Valley, one of the most
fertile areas of Madagascar where development has been retarded because of
lack of efficient land transportation.
30.        In order to prepare further road projects which may be suitable
for Bank financing, consulting services are included in the project:
(i)   for the detailed engineering of the 200 km road section between
Antisihohi and Ambanja on the Tananarive-Diego Suarez road which
appears justified on the basis of feasibility studies carried out
by French consultants (BCEOM) with FAC financing; and
(ii)   to improve the traffic counting system and thus one of the bases
for rational highway planning.
31.        The Ministere de l'Ame'nagement du Territoire will be responsible
for the execution of the project. The Service Central Technique within the



- U -
Ministry will supervise the relatively shor- stre-ches of constru;-2-'io- on r\-4
and RN-1, supported by the Laboratoire National des Travaux Publics et du
Batiment.  This practice has proved satisfactory unier the First and Seccr~a
Highway Projects. Construction on RN-34, however, is a large undertaking.
and would be beyond the supervision capacity of the Government servtcesi andr
consequently it will be supervised by consultants under terms and cordti-ions
satisfactory to the Bank.
32.        The total cost of the project includirg taxe s of $5S.3 . _ _oA 
estirnated at $43.9 million equivalent, with a for -ign exchange conifonent of .j'
million (66%).  The Bank loan and IDA credit totalling $30.0 million would
finance the total foreign component and approximately US$1 million equlval6t-
of the local currency costs of the project, and would cover 80% of the total
project cost, net of taxes. The Govermnent will finance the remainring local
costs estimated at $13.9 million equivalent from 'oudgetary sources. Disbursemen _
will be made first from the credit account, and then from the Joan. Disbuemerl-7.
from each account will be made against 69% of expenditures on road constructton
and the actual foreign costs of consultants.
33.        The economic rate of return for the project as a whole averages
16% and varies from 15% to 29% for particular road sections. Bene_'i`-s would
arise from savings in operating costs of existing and induced traff-ic, fron
diverted traffic, and from the anticipated increase in agricultural producticr..
There will also be maintenance cost savings on part of the project roads,
although there will also be addi-tional maintenance costs on part of RN-34
where the road at the moment is no more than a simple track.    The e_'fect on
the rate of return of varying parameters has been tested and even under the
most adverse assumptions the investment is still distinctly advantageous.
34.        Construction contracts wirll be awarded on the basLs of internationa_
competitive bidding in accordance with the normal procedures of the Sank Group.
To take advantage of possible econor,.ies of scale through the use of larger
contractors, and at the same time to allow small firms to compete, construction
works will, for contract purposes, be divided int;o two packages of contrac-s,
one including 2 jobs and the other 5 jobs, the first package totalzing
approximately US$8.5 million and the second US$25,4 million.   The eatimated
value of the individual jobs ranges from abou-t U;$1.0 million to $      4.8 million.
The works in each package will be bid concurrently; bids may be submitted
on single jobs, on several, or on entire packages. Contracts will be
awarded on the basis of the lowest overall evaluated bi-ds.  The es-imated
construction period is four years.   Contractors have been prequalified and
the Government intends to award contracts for work to start when thle dry
season begins, i.e. about April.

cormercial education and teacher train-'ng, signed in August 1-st  is
almost com-leted and the loan is expected to be f-llly disbursed by h'--he
Closing Date of June 30, 1973.
Credit No.134-MAG and Loan 570-MAG -  $4.5 mni'lion 2nd $3.5 m-llion
respectively, for road and brid,ge con.str-ction were signed in November
The Project is now virtually complete and the Cred-it which was to be drcwn
before the Loan, has been fully disbursed. Changes in design (due to
une,xpectedly difficult materials prcoblems on one road not revealed 2-uItil
the work was well underway) have, ho-wever, resulted in a 16'O (aboult $2.3
million) increase in the cost of the project over or-iginal est-mate.
The Government has requested EDA to use thle savings expected under Credit
90-YAG to finance part of the overrun, and a promosal to this effect wi'l
shortly be presented to the Executive Directors.
Loan No.585-NAG - $2.8 million to help f:inance the first uhase
of a long tern program of livestock development was signed in February   369.
The Project has encountered a number of" problems, which was not sur-rising
since this is the first experience in ranching in Madagascar.   The majo.r
cause of concern at present is the occurrence of disease among the imported
cattle which the Government is attempt-ng to control.   The Government is
also considering some changes in the Project to intensify operations on
four breeding/fattening ranches instead of establishing two additional ones,
and to develop road transport instead of stock routes.   Government  s also
considering ways of inducing villagers to resettle off the ranches area.
Developments are kept closely umder review.
Credit No.200-MAG - $i.6 million for thae development of the ?ort
of Tamnatave, was s   in June 197'!. Construction works are proceeding
satisfactorily, and as of Octob:er 1'72, contracts la.d been awarded for
:%.2 million eouivplent.  Oi the othe.r hand, the reorganizat-on of port
adirinistration is proceeding more slowly than expected.  In addition,
the new Port Authority is currently experiencing some financialc difficulties
as a result of a substantial decrease (probably of a temporary nature) in
traffic volume, but the Government is providing the bulk of the local
currency required for the Project including that nEart of the Port Authority
share which the latter is at present una.ble to prov-ide.
Credit No.214-KAG - 85 million for irrigation, was signed in
August 1970. Overall progress of construction is satisfactory, although
disbursements were slow because of delays in submitting timely and adequate
recuests for reimbursement to -DA.  Steps are belng taken to improve the
pace of disbursements.  Progress of agricultural development has been slowed

down because completion of the experimental farm has been delayed by about
two years. Corrective measures have been taken, however, and experiments
on double-cropping will begin shortly.
Credit No.322-MAG - $15.3 million for irrigation and rural development,
was signed in June 1972. Some delays have occurred in the fulfillment of
certain conditions of effectiveness, particularly with respect to the employment
of consultants, but action steps are now being taken. The Credit should
therefore become effective in the near future.

Procurement
Arrangements:     Construction contracts wdill be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance writh
Bank Group's normal procedures. To take advantage of
economies of scale through the use of larger contractors,
while at the same time allowing small firms to compete,
construction works, for contract purposes, will be divided
into two packages. A first package will comprise two
contracts (Vohidiala-Ambatondrazaka and Arivonimamo-Analavory)
and is estimated to cost about X,.5 million. A second
package, estimated to cost about $24.4 million, would
include five contracts. Within each package, bidders
wIll be given the opt-on of bidding for individual contracts,
for any combination of works or for the whole package.
Consultants:      Supervision of construction of works included in the first
package would be done by Service Central Technique (SCT),
the Government's entity responsible for the engineering,
bidding and supervision of highway construction projects
in Madagascar. Ccnsuiltants will be retained for the
supervision of corstruction of the remaining works, as
well as to carry out the detailed engineering and the
study to imorove the traffic coumting system.
Rate of Return:   Economic rate of return:  about 16%.
