DEFINUIN
Dependency Ratio:                       The ratio of the economically dependent part
of the population to the productive part,
arbitrarily defined as the ratio of the young
(those under 15 years of age) plus the elderly
(those 65 years of age and over) to the
population in the "working 'ges" (those 15 to
64 years of age).
Infant Mortality Rate:                  The number of deaths of infants under one
yeat old in a given year per 1,000 live births
in that year.
Life Expectancy at Birth:               The average number of years a newborn would
live if current age-specific mortality rate trends
prevailing at the time of birth were to
continue.
Rate of Population Growth:              The rate at which a population is increasing
(or decreasing) in a given year due to natural
increase and net migration expressed as a
percentage of the base population.
Total Fertility Rate:                   The average number of children that would be
born alive to a woman (or group of women)
during her lifetime if during her child-bearing
years she were to bear children at each age in
accordance with prevailing age-specific fertility
rates.
Communes:                               It designates both the smallest territorial
division of the country (there are 145
communes) and its local government which has
an independant legal status and financial
autonomy. The commune is headed by a
Bourgmestr.
Prefectures:                            It designates the administrative structure at the
regional level. Rwanda is administratively
divided into 10 Rrefectures and 22 Msou
grffectures (to serve the communes further
away from the prefectures).

Trms                :      Standard IDA termns, with 40 years maturity
Eroect Description:
Qbjectives:
(a) to improve the food srcurity and social welfare of the poorest popu!ation groups; (b) to
hw,rove the government's capability to monitor living standards of the population; and (c) to
initiate a long-term poverty alleviation strategy. Target groups include- (a) individuals with
insufficient income-earning capabilities, suc.h as landless farmers, poor female-headed
households, AIDS-afflicted families, orphans and others (annual target: 75,000 people); (b)
farmers faced with acute food insecurity (annual target can vary from 0 to 300,000 people);
and (c) farmers with land smaller than 0.2 hectare which will need off-farm employment to
survive (annual target: 25,000 workers and 125,000 dependents). In addition, potential
micro-entrepreneurs will be the target of a micro-enterprise development component.
The Food Aid and Nutrition com,nn1o would aim at reducing food insecurity and
malnutrition through: (i) food aid purchased locally or regionally and targeted at vulnerable
groups (children and pregnant/lactating women from poor families, AIDS-afflicted
households, orphans) in association with a package of nutrition activities (education,
monitoring, micronutrient supplementation); (ii) coordinated emergency food relief to respond
to local acute food insecurity; and (iii) support to the development of a national food policy.
Tbe Labor-Based Works a&BWs) component would increase the purchasing power (and thus
contribute to improving food security) of the population of the 43 poorest communes in the
country through community-based works including: (i) communal road rehabilitation and
maintenance; (ii) anti-erosion and land improvement measures, such as reforestation and
agricultural terracing; and (iii) other public works of public interest. The Micro-enterprise
Promotion and Develm nt would: (i) promote the creation of profitable micro-enterprises in
rural areas as a mean of generating productive off-farm employment; (ii) identify potential
entrepreneurs through a community-based network; and (iii) facilitate the creation of these
micro-enterprises by appraising their viability and assisting entrepreneurs in obtaining
financing from existing financial institutions. Finally, *he Social Surveys component would
aim at strengthening the government's capacities to: (i) monitor the living standards of the
population through socioeconomic surveys and studies; and (ii) elaborate relevant social
policies and strategies.



- iv -
Beniefit and Risks:
The proposed operation would provide rapid support to poor families in need of food and
additional income. In the longer term, the project would contribute to a better monitoring of
the living standards of .      pulation, and overall social policy development. Indirect
benefits will be generat.. tY the LBWs and the micro-enterprise programs which would
contribute to demonstratiL, the efficiency of switching ca;al for labor and the potential for
off-farm employment, respectively. The main risk is that implementadon delays occur
because of inefficient project management. This risk will be addressed by: (a) establishing an
adequate project management structure prior to credit effectiveness; (b) decentralizing the
decision making process; and (c) involving beneficiaries in the monitoring process. Another
significant risk is insufficient budgetary support from the gevermnent. This risk will be
addressed by a close monitoring of the agreed-upon public spending on social sectors.

FOOD SECURITY AND SOCIAL ACTION PROJECT
ETAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.1         Wi4 a GNP per capita estimated at US$300 in 1990, Rwanda belongs to the
group of the world's poorest countries. Rwanda is also one of the smallest African countries
(26,000 km2). The country is confronted with severe development constraints: (a) the
population density is the highest in Africa (280 per km2), which is having a negative impact
on agricultural land availability and the environment; (b) the population growth rate (estimated
at 3.6 percent in 1991) and the population momentuml/ are high and put pressure on the
country's economic growth and investment capabilities; (c) foreign exchange earnings are
excessively dependent upon coffee; and (d) its landlocked situation makes external trade
dependent upon two long and expensive routes from the Indian Ocean. In the 1970s, thanks
to politicai stability, high coffee prices and prudent economic and fiscal management, Rwanda
enjoyed high rates of economic growth (5 percent per year on average) together with budget
surpluses, large external reserves and a low debt service ratio. These were significant
achievements in such a difficult environment. In the early 1980s, the economic situation
started to deteriorate because of unfavorable terms of trade and excessive and inefficient
public spending. This decline was precipitated in 1987 with the fall in world coffee prices.
1.2         In early 1990, the government requested the Bretton Woods institutions'
support in preparing an adjustment program. While in the midst of opening its economy,
Rwanda was invaded in late 1990 by armed opponents to the regime based in Uganda.
Although the invasion was repelled, clashes with these opponents continue to occur. The low
intensity fighting - coupled with depressed world coffee prices - have had a severe impact on
economic activity; the government has increased secu-ity-related annual outlays to about 7.0
percent of GDP, from an annual average of about 2 percent over the past decade.
1.3         To complement economic liberalization and respond to domestic and external
pressure, the government has also initiated a political reform process which has continued and
intensified despite the clashes with the rebels. A new constitution was adopted in June 1991
which opened the way for multi-party politics. The political transition process is under way
and an outspoken press has emerged.
1.4         Rwanda's economic difficulties have a negative impact on the social situation.
Poverty has increased in the past years, as revealed by a recurrent state of acute food
insecirity in the southern and western parts of the country caused by a combination of
insufficient food production and purchasing power of the population. Public funding is
insufficient to respond adequately to the demand for social services. In education, the
government has given high priority to increasing primary education enrollment rates, but
providing the necessary budgetary resources becomes more difficult because of budgetary
I/    The current population is estimated at 7.3 million. Would fertility remain constant,
the population size would reach 16 million by 2010.

providing the necessary budgetary resources becomes more difficult because of budgetary
constraints. In health, the situation has deteriorated with the combination of a worsening
health environment (AIDS epidemic, expanding malaria endemic and increasing malnutrition
rates) and insuffwient budgetary allocations to the public health system. It is only recently
(June 1990) that the government has formally issued a national population policy, therefore
recognizing the need for addressing one of the nation's most critical development constraints.
B. The Economic Situation and the Structural Adjustment Program
1.5          The economic situation of Rwanda has been deteriorating rapidly during the
past five years for three main reasons: (a) world coffee prices have fallen, reducing foreign
exchange availability; (b) agicultural production has Ieclined (agricultural output in 1990 was
9 percent lower than in 1987), mostly because of an increasing disequilibrium between
agricultural land availability and population pressure; and (c) the government has failed to
implement relevant economic policies. Real GDP declined sharply in 1989 (5.8 percent) and
again in 1990 (1.2 percent). These negative trends had already started in the early 1980s
when the government became more interventionist in the economy to try to compensate for
unfavorable terms of tra 4e: price controls were imposed, public expenditures (including civil
servant salaries) were reduced, and local enterprises were protected by import restrictions.
Restrictive import licensing was introduced to respond to foreign exchange scarcity and
caused a slow down in many activities. The government, however, did not correct the highly
overvalued exchange rate (one important cause of the lack of export competitiveness) and did
not attempt to reduce excessive regulation and control over private enterprises. In view of the
continuing deterioration of the situation, the government finally decided in early 1990 to
prepare an adjustment program with the help of the Bank and the IMF.
1.6          The economic reform program described in the 1991-93 Policy Framework
Paper includes: (a) promoting private sector activities and international competitiveness; (b)
improving public resource management; (c) developing human resources; and (d) improving
the management of the country's natural resources. In November 1990, the government
began implementing this program, starting by one of the most politically difficult measures -
the devaluation of the Rwandese franc (67 percent in local currency terms, 40 percent vis-a-
vis the SDR). Thereafter, the government took several measures to promote the private
sector's involvement in the economy by eliminating price controls and certain cumbersome
administrative procedures for enterprise creation. In the agricultural sector, which will
remain the mainstay of the economy for, at least, the next generation, self-safficiency
strategies are being replaced by specialization and production for both external and internal
markets. In parallel with the development of these measures, the government has shown a
concern about the social situation and the effects of the adjustment measures. Starting in
August 1990, the government has worked with Bank staff and UNDP to design a social safety
net aimed at responding to basic needs of the population, particularly the poor.
1.7          Economic Developments in 1991. The economic situation continued to
deteriorate in 1991 (GDP decline of 2.9 percent), mainly because of the war situation. Trade
has been severely affected by the closure of the route from Mombasa through Uganda.
Transport is hindered by security-related traffic restrictions within the country. Private
investments are minimal because of the lack of confidence vis-&-vis the country' s overall
situation, contributing to poor supply response. Tax revenue fell by at least 10 percent
because of the slowdown in economic activities and lower imports. In consequence, the fiscal
deficit rose to 14.8 percent of GDP (grants excluded) and was largely financed by



-3-
accumulating arrears through the domestic banking system. In the external sector, the current
account deficit remained at 13 percent of GDP and the external debt rose to about 31.5
percent of GNP. As noted, the current fiscal imbalance was associated largely with war and
one of the most serious problems was the crowding out of civiliQi expenditures by military
expenditures now accounting for 42 percent of the budget. The Social Safety Net which had
been incorporated in the adjustment program was adversely affected (e.g., spending on
essential drugs was only 25 percent of the budgeted allocations). If these trends continue
(civilian expenditures have decreased in real terms by 33 percent over the past two years), the
social sector situation will further deteriorate In the coming years.
II. POVERTY IN RWANDA AND BANK'S ROLE
A. Povet  in Rwanda
Social Indigators
2.1          Social indicators are strongly determined by the poverty level of a country and
Rwanda's indicators are slightly below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (see basic data,
page (i)). Health indicators are poor: life expectancy has not yet reached 50 years; under-
five mortality rate is still around 200 per 1,000 and the pace of infant mortality reduction is
one of the slowest in Africa. The malnutrition rate among young children is estimated at
about 30 percent using international standards for weight and age. In many cases,
malnutrition starts at birth because of the poor nutritional status of many mothers: about 20
percent of newborns are underweight. Education indicators are about average for Sub-
Saharan Africa but have alrA.ady shown signs of deterioration because of an increasing
discrepancy between the huge increase of school-age population and limited financial
resources. If recent trends were to continue, the primary education enrollment rate would
decline from the current 62 percent to about 50 percent within the coming 10 years.
Povery Profile
2.2          A poverty profile for Rwanda has been prepared/ on the basis of the
national 1983-85 household consumption survey. The premise of the study is that, while
Rwanda is a poor country by international standards, certain groups are poorer than others
and they have a special claim on targeted assistance to raise their income and consumption
possibilities. These groups either do not have the necessary means for adequate physical and
mental survival, or they are at considerable risk of falling below that level of entitlement,
temporarily or for a longer period owing to fluctuations in their income. While the results of
the study are still preliminary, certain interesting elements have already emerged as described
below.
2.3           Total real expenditure per capita has been used as a proxy for the standard of
living of the households. The "poor" have been defined as the bottom 40 percent of the
sample, and the "hard-core poor" as the bottom 20 percent. The incidence of poverty is
much greater in the rural areas than in urban areas as shown by the large gap between urban

Region (Social Policy Division) as an input for a more comprehensive poverty
assessment.



- 4 -
and rural expenditure levels (urban expenditures are 2.4 times higher). The rural areas
represent more than 98 percent of all poverty in Rwanda, with the South Central zone having
the highest incidence of poverty.
2.4          Labor and land are the two most important assets of the poor and their
variations have a strong correlation with the level of poverty. The dependency ratio is 1.14
for poor households and 0.87 for the non-poor, which means that poverty is more common
among large households. In rural areas, the incidence of poverty is greater among female-
headed households but the difference is small (the difference, however, tends to increase with
the depth of poverty). By contrast, in urban areas female-headed households tend to be much
poorer than their male-headed counterparts (but still better off than their rural counterparts).
With regard to land, the association between farm size and poverty is negative (as expected)
in spite of smaller farms having a larger per-hectare productivity.
2.5          Income Pagms. Agricultural production accounts for over 70 percent of the
income 0f poor households and for 52 percent of that of non-poor households. While policies
which strengthen agriculture production will contribute to alleviating poverty, a sizeable
portion of new agricultural employment is likely to be absorbed by the non-poor. This
applies to any employment creation in rural areas. It would be, therefore, necessary to target
employment (through a combination of types of works, level of wages and poverty criteria) in
order to absorb a higher proportion of poor.
2.6          Other important findings include: (a) the piedominance of food produced for
own-consumption; (b) the food crop sales (including banana beer) significantly higher than
cash crop sales; (c) the share of cash crops (including coffee) representing only 7 percent of
agricultural production; and (d) the minor role of purchased inputs. These patterns do not
vary greatly between poor ard non-poor households, but illustrate the difficulties of promoting
cash crop production in Rwanda.
2.7          Expenditure Patterns. The poor (arbitrarily estimated at the bottom 40 percent
of the population as previously mentioned) account for about 25 percent of total expenditures
and, on average, food represents 70 percent of household expenditure. Non-food purchases
are significantly lower for the poor (12 percent) than for the non-poor (26 percent). The
study provides also certain interesting findings with regard to the potential for food subsidy:
(a) there are no 'inferior" foods; (b) there are no foods for which a subsidy would yield
larger benefits for the poor than for the non-poor; and (c) there is no obvious self-targeting
tood subsidy in Rwanda.
2.8          With regard to non-food expenditures, the poor account for 40 percent of
health services (it means that the poor spend as much in bsolute Jms as the non-poor), and
for 28 percent of expenditures on used clothing, school uniforms, tobacco leaves, and
kerosene. These findings have certain implications in the context of adjustment (as related to
devaluation): the main impact for the poor would be higher prices for used clothing, drugs,
and kerosene. In addition, changes in the cost of health services would have a significant
impact on the poor.

pFood Security
2.9          It is useful to analyze the poverty situation from a food security perspective,
since food security is the most pressing concern of poor people. Until 1985, food production
kept pace with population growth. Since then, population growth rates have steadily
increased above those of agricultural production. New land has become scarce and per capita
food production slowed down. In 1989, food production per capita was estimated at 77
percent of its 1979 ,evel and the situation has continued to deteriorate. Cash crops have been
largely insufficient for providing the income necessary to an increasing number of families in
order for them to purchase food. Rwanda has entered into a period of structural food deficits,
not only at the national level, but increasingly so at the level of rural households.
2.10         Food security is mostly a rural problem, since 93 percent of the country's
population is rural. The underlying calise of food insecurity is the fast rising population
density: family holdings are becoming too small for making a living solely out of agriculture.
The government has estimated that one-third of tilF rural population (some 2 million people)
had plots which were too small to cover 100 percent of household needs through agricultural
revenues. This percentage will increase over time. While the new agricultural strategy will
aim to enhance productivity through a number of policies, intensification, specialization and
production for the market, the solution to rural food security will have to be found through
the creation of off-farm employment. In the meantime, special transfer programs will be
necessary to prevent increasing malnutrition and famine.
2.11         Because of the increased population pressure, the agricultural system has
become so vulnerable that even relatively minor shocks such as erratic rainfall, pests, plant
diseases and reduced cash income from coffee have a disproportionately large impact. In
1989, these shocks led to a situation where over 300,000 rural people were estimated to be in
need of assistance. For 1991, an identical number of people have been estimated to be at risk
of acute food insecurity (most of them in the prefectures of Gikongoro, Butare and Kibuye).
Two categories of food insecure have been identified: the chronically food insecure, e.g. the
old and the handicapped, as well as the landless; and the transitory food insecure, suffering
from a lack of food and/or income during the periode de soudure3/. Both categories receive
assistance from certain NGOs (such as CARITAS, an international Catholic NGO specialized
in social programs and active in Rwanda for many years), the government (through occasional
fond aid provided by bilateral donors and the World Food Program (WFP)), and from
relatives, neighbors and friends. However, the latter form of assistance (solidarity-based) is
becoming increasingly difficult because the majority of the population is suffering from the
deteriorating economic situation. In any case, for the foreseeable future, rural Rwanda will
be regularly confronted with the effects of structural food insecurity at the household level,
which will be particularly felt during the eriode de soudure. The threat of famine (and
actual famine if no action is undertaken) is likely to become a regular phenomenon in rural
Rwanda that the government has to address in a systematic way.
2.12         Two new factors increase food insecurity in both rural and urban areas. The
first factor is the increasng number of AIDS-related deaths. Rwanda's AIDS epidemic is one
of the worst in Africa: in Kigali, about 25 percent of adults between the ages of 15 and 45 are
I/    The eriode de soudur is the time between two harvests when food reserves can
become insufficien. at the family level.



seropositive; in rural areas it is estimated that 3 percent of adults in the same age group are
infected. Many families in urban as well as in rural areas are losing income earners killed by
this disease and have difficulties purchasing food. Orphans are becoming numerous and are
at high risk of food insecurity if they are not adopted. It is difficult to assess the overall
economic impact of AIDS on the national economy because of the lack of data. It is likely,
however, that this impact will become increasingly significant because AIDS kills people in
their most productive years and tends to strike better-off families (even in rural areas). The
second factor with a negative effect on food security is the loss of employment caused by the
contracting economy particularly in urban areas where a significant number of small
enterprises are closing down and laying off their employees.
EmPloyment and Labor Market
2.13         With the current population growth rate, the number of new entrants in the
labor market will increase from 130,000 per year in 1990 to 360,000 per year in 2015. It
will be difficult for the Rwandese economy to absorb this workforce because the agricultural
sector is already saturated and the development of off-farm employment will take time. The
industrial sector consists mainly of small-scale agro-industries; its expansion will necessitate
adjustment measures and one cannot expect major job creations in the near future. The
development of small and micro-enterprises is hampered by: (a) excessive government
regulations and insufficient promotion; (b) lack of easy access to credit; and (c) poor domestic
markets. Migrations from rural areas to cities where migrant workers could find
opportunities in the informal sector are made difficult by a law restricting individuals'
mobility. Migrations towards neighboring countries are limited either by political reasons
(Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi) or by the absorptive capability of the neighboring regions (for
example, the southern Kivu region of Zaire is already overpopulated). In 1991, Tanzania
decided to expel about 25,000 Rwandese migrant workers whc had to be relocated hastily by
the government. Similar events could occur repeatedly in the coming years, increasing the
pressure on an already depressed labor market.
2.14         Rwanda has reached a point where a large, and increasing, share of the
abundant labor force is not employed productively. The most recent large scale survey on
employment (1988-89) shows that 72 percent of the labor force work less than 40 hours per
week (the threshold usually used to differentiate part-time from full time employment). In the
traditional agricultural sector (which employs 90 percent of the work force), the percentage of
part-time work reaches 77 percent, a high figure by any standard. The on-going structural
adjustment program should improve the situation by stimulating the creation of new
employment opportunities and increasing average revenues, thus expanding local markets. In
particular, the elimination of restrictive labor regulations is included in the conditions for
second tranche release. But these changes will take time and meanwhile transfer programs
will have to be established to alleviate the effects of this pervasive underemployment. In
addition, the restructuing or closing of inefficient public enterprises will lead to laying off a
limited number of workers who should be taken care of in the context of a social safety net.
Social Program
2.15         The healthsystem provides basic medical coverage to about 60 percent of the
population. The remaining 40 percent are either too far from any health facility for an easy
access or are too poor to afford the cost of drugs and other treatments. Approximately 40
percent of basic services are provided by church-affiliated facilities where the quality of care



-7-
is usually better than in public facilities (higher user charges, however, have a disincentive
effect on the poor). There is no potential for a rapid increase in health coverage because
public funding is insufficient to cover the recurrent cost implications of an expanding health
system. Major public health programs (such as immunizations, AIDS control, and malaria
control) are heavily subsidized by external agencies. The Prima  Education System is
effective (including good female enrollment), but the primary enrollment rate is likely to
decline because of increasing population pressure and insufficient public funding. The poor
are affected by the cost of school uniforms which represent a significant expenditure in small
household budgets. There is neither a social security system nor a national health insurance
system in Rwanda. Civil servants are partially covered by the government for health costs,
disability and pensions. Certain private employers cover employees' health expenses but there
is no specific legislation to this effect. Unemployment is not covered by any program.
2.16         Most welfare services are provided by NGOs (more than one hundred have
been listed), including religious organizations. Their activities are usually small scale and
localized as part of broader development programs (such as intersectoral rural development
projects). CARITAS is an exception, with food aid carried out in numerous communes and
support programs for arphans and AIDS-affected families. A few NGOs (such as IWACU
and ARDI) provide training and technical assistance to other NGOs. There has been some
attempt to coordinate the activities of NGOs (such as the creation of the Conseil des
Qrganismes Dour les Apis aux Initiatives de Base which regroups a dozen NGOs) but most
NGOs prefer to work independently and tend to compete for foreign aid rather than
collaborate.
B. The Government's Social Policies and the Bank's Role
2.17         Early in the process of preparing the structural adjustment program, the
government requested the Bank's assistance to define and prepare a social actior program.
Initially conceived by the government as a broad set of activities aimed at alleviating the
negative social effects of certain adjustment measures, the concept of the program has evolved
towards a comprehensive social policy package with a three-pronged strategy: (a)
establishment of a social safety net including: (i) the strengthening of core programs in
education, health and population of piblic spending on education, health population and a
national social action program (Proframme National d'Action Sociale - PNAS) targeted
towards the poorer segments of the population (this program is supported by the proposed
operation); (b) resource mobilization to ensure adequate funding of this core social
expenditure program from both external aid and domestic budgetary resources (including
counterpart fuinds); and (c) close monitoring of the financial and physical implementation of
the social expenditure program. The government has summarized this approach in a Policy
Statement on human and social development policy which was finalized with IDA during the
negotiations of the proposed operation (para. 7.1) and which wiUl serve as a reference during
project implementation. The social sector strategy implies a close coordination with the
structural adjustment process, particularly with regard to the preparation and monitoring of
the core social expenditure program. The programming process for public expenditures on
the social sectors has been integrated into the Structural Adjustment Program as a part of the
component aimed at improving public sector resource management. This process has two
main elements: (i) a review of the public investment program to eliminate all investwmnts
inconsistent with sectoral policies or economically and financially inefficient; and (ii) adequate
budgetary allocations to cover operating costs of essential development programs, such as the
social safety net. The major constraint to adequate budgetary allocations for social sectors are



- 8 -
the competing requests from other sectors, including the army which has become particularly
expensive due to the recent military conflict. In order to avoid under-funding of social
programs, the annual review of social sector public expenditure programs will be a covenant
of the proposed operation. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
that: (a) the social sector Public Expenditure Program (PEP) for the next three years will be
submitted to IDA for review and approval no later than October 31 of each year of project
implementation (para. 7.1 (a)); quarterly audit reports on actual non-salary spending of the
ministries of health (including spending on population activities), primary and secondary
education and planning (for social expenditures only) will be prepared by independent auditors
and submitted to IDA within four months following the end of each quarter (para. 7.1 (b));
and (c) the implementation review of the Social Sector PEP for the past year will be submitted
to IDA for review and discussion no later than June 30 of each year of project implementation
(para. 7.1 (c)). Preliminary estimates of the 1992-94 public expenditures for the Social Safety
Net are summarized in Table 2.1 below. A more detailed analysis is provided in Annex I.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the government that the approval by IDA of
the 1993-1995 social sector public expenditure program will be a condition of credit
effectiveness (para. 7.2 (a)). The monitoring of physical implementation of the social safety
net will be done at the sectoral level, with the support of the relevant IDA-financed
operations.

2.18         The proposed operation is an integral part of IDA's strategy in ltwanda and
complements not only the Structural Adjustment Credit but also several investment operations,
including: a Population Project (FY91); an Education Sector Project (FY91); and an ongoing
Family Health Project (FY87). In addition to these social sector projects, several other IDA-
supported operations are likely to have a positive impact on the social situation: an Agro-
Industrial Sector adjustment operation tappraised in FY92) which aims at increasing
agricultural revenues and a Financial Sector adjustment eperation (negotiated in FY92). which
will help the creation of private enterprises and increase employment. The proposed
operation has been designed in such a way that it does not duplicate other projects but
complement them and fill the gaps in reaching the poor. IDA will also assist the government
in promoting aid coordination and encouraging co-financing.
m. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Design
3.1          The proposed operation would support the national social action program
iProgramme National d'Action Sociale - PNAS) which is an integral part of the social safety
net established as part of the structural adjustment process. As conceived, the PNAS
combines three essential elements: (a) a comprehensive transfer program aimed at providing
both rapid consumption transfers (mostly food) to the extremely poor and employment
opportunities to those who are able to work; (b) a community-based investment program
aimed at improving the basic infrastructure and the environment in poor rural areas; and (c) a
policy element aimed at improving the development and implementation of poverty alleviation
strategies. The objectives of the PNAS are to: (a) reduce food insecurity, malnutrition, and
other effects of poverty among the poorest population groups of Rwanda; (b) induce policy
changes with regard to the use of the most important asset of the poor, their labor force; and
(c) improve poverty assessments as well as the monitoring of the implementation of the
national social policy. An indirect objective of the PNAS is to improve the developmental
role of the communes and their interactions with the communities.
3.2          The PNAS has three complementary operational components - Food Aid and
Nutrition, Labor-Based Works (LBWs) and Micro-enterprise Promotion and Development -
and a Living Standards and Poverty Monitoring component. Each operational component has
specific target groups. The Food Aid and Nutrition component is aimed at: (a) individuals
and families with no or insufficient income-earning capabilities, such as landless farmers,
poor female-headed households, AIDS-afflicted families, orphans and others (annual target:
75,000 people belonging to this cate!ory); and (b) farmers faced with acute transitory food
insecurity (annual target can vary from 0 to 300,000 people). The LBWs component is aimed
at under-employed or unemployed people in rural areas (such as farmers with land less than
0.2 hectare) who will need off-farm employment to survive (annual target: 25,000 workers
and 125,000 dependents). The Micro-enterprise component is aimed at potential
entrepreneurs who could benefit from small credits and training to start a profitable micro-
enterprise (annual target: 300 entrepreneurs, 1000 workers and 4000 dependents). The
quantitative estimates, while based on cross-checking of various sources (including primary
data collected during field trips), are subject to revision as more data become available. Each
component has specific targeting mechanisms to reach the intended beneficiaries, such as the



- 10-
establishment of a poverty index to identify the priority communes which will benefit from
LBWs. These mechanisms are described in more details for each component.
3.3          They are significant differences among the components in terms of urgency,
scope and degree of public sector involvement. The Food Aid component is designed to
respond to immediate needs of the most vulnerable population groups and this component will
benefit from large amounts of extemal aid. Tbe LBWs component is of a longer-term nature
and addresses the needs of people able and eager to work, with a mix of public sector
involvement (through financing and some technical assistance) and private sector participation
(through the contractors). In addition, this component, while providing cash transfers to the
poor, contributes to basic infrastructure development at the community level. Finally, the
Micro-enterprise component has a long term purpose: its goal is to explore the potential for
profitable and sustainable off-farm employment. The quantitative impact of this component
will be rather limited but it could contribute to the development of an approach to job creation
which would prevent a certain proportion of the entrants in the labor force in rural areas from
falling into poverty.
3.4          The PNAS does not intend (nor has the capacity to) to respond to all social
problems in Rwanda. The PNAS is an important element of the overall social safety net that
the government wants to implement in parallel to the adjustment program. It would
complement in a rational way many other actions that are carried out by line ministries
(Health, Population and Education), ionor-supported rural development projects and certain
NGOs. The PNAS would not replace these actions but would increase the amount of
resources allocated to poverty alleviation activities. The proposed project, in addition to
supporting the PNAS has an important policy dimension: the comprehensive conditionality
linked to the preparation and monitoring of the social sector public expenditure program (the
social safety net) would allow the government to assess on a regular basis the implementation
of the national social policy and make the necessary adjustments.
B. Proiect Description
Food Aid and Nutrition
3.5          Background and Justification. As already indicated (paras. 2.9-12), Rwanda
has entered a period of permanent risk of food insecurity. This has been demonstrated in
1989-90 by the famine situation in the southern part of the country, initially caused by a crop
failure (itself caused by the combination of adverse climatic conditions, pests, plants diseases
and soil acidity). The government estimated the number of people affected by this famine at
300,000. The main cause of this situation was not the absence of food (certain northern
regions have excess production of food crops), but the lack of purchasing power among poor
rural households. One-third of these families have plots that are too small to provide any
cash income. This situation will worsen with the high population growth rate which is
making land ever more scarce. In addition, the prevailing conflict in the northern parts of the
country has greatdy reduced border trade, thereby further increasing the number of people
requiring food aid. As already mentioned, the AIDS epidemic will also have an impact on
food insecurity and malnutrition among urban and rural families as an increasing number of
income earners will die of the disease. The need to reduce food insecurity in Rwanda will
continue until the purchasing power of the population has increased through economic
adjustment and sectoral strategies which will: (a) reduce population pressure; and (b) create
more lucrative off-farm employment. IDA's contribution to this component (which will be



- 11 -
mostly funded by WFP) will consist of technical assistance and operational support aimed at:
(a) improving the targeting and use of food aid; (b) monitoring the social and nutritional
impact of this component; and (c) developing a more effective national food aid policy,
including program food aid.
3.6          Objectives and Scope. The main objectives of this component will be to: (a)
reduce chronic food insecurity among vulnerable groups which include malnourished mothers
and children, orphans and families of AIDS victims; (b) improve the government's ability to
provide assistance to target groups during transitory periods of acute food insecurity; and (c)
contribute to the elaboration and implementation of a food aid policy with a special focus on
program food aid. Several guiding principles will be applieed during the implementation of
this component. First, a large share of food aid will be purchased locally so as to stimulate
agricultural production and avoid gluts which would have a negative impact on the domestic
markets. Second, food aid will be linked to nutrition programs, including nutrition education
and efficient food allocation within families. Third, an exception to the second principle will
be emergency responses to famines or other disasters. Finally, food aid will be part of a
comprehensive food policy in order to allow the government and donors to keep a long term
perspective on key factors influencing the national food security situation.
3.7          Activities. A three-pronged strategy has been identified to reach the above
objectives: (a) targeted food aid and nutrition activities for the reduction of chronic food
insecurity; (b) rapid response to acute food insecurity; and (c) program food aid policy
development. Most activities involved in this strategy already exist in Rwanda. They
require, however, strengthening, rationalization, restructuring, targeting and intensification.
lTe PNAS would contribute to all these operational aspects, as described below.
(a)    Alleviation of chronic food insecurity.
3.8          This sub-component is targeted to the most vulnerable groups (malnourished
mothers and children, AIDS victims and orphans). It has been estimated during project
preparation that a total of approximately 150,000 people were currently in need of permanent
food aid under prevailing conditions in Rwanda. The proposed operation would aim at
reaching about 50 percent of this target group, assuming that the remaining half is and will be
covered by existing programs supported by various external agencies, including NGOs, such
as CARITAS, OXFAM and CARE. This assumption will be reviewed during the mid-term
implementation review of the project and the necessary adjustments will be made in
collaboration with the World Food Program (WFP) which will finance most of this sub-
component. The key elements of the proposed activities are summarized below. A more
detailed description is provided in Annex II.
(i)    Targeted food aid for vulnerable groups. This program will be
supported by WFP which has developed a specific project (accepted
by its Governing Body in December 1991) for this purpose. The
initial duration of the program will be four years and might be
extended for two additional years if necessary. As previously stated,
the target groups eligible for food aid include: malnourished children
in the 0-30 months age group and their families; pregnant and
lactating women; AIDS-afflicted families; and orphans. The first and
second target groups will be reached through the existing network of
nutrition centers; the third and fourth target groups would be reached



- 12 -
through programs and institutions run by CAR1TAS. This project of
US$15.9 million will be partly financed by food aid - wheat (8,000
MI), milk powder (1,400 MT), oil (1,000 MT) and sugar (700 MT)
and partly by a cash contribution of US$7.0 million for local
purchases of food (or purchasing in the region) of maize and sorghum.
The wheat will not be distributed through rations but sold on the
market (private mills) and the funds generated (US$1 million) will also
be used for the purchasing of maize, sorghum and beans on the
domestic or the regional markets. It will be distributed through the
nutrition center network in a phased approach starting with
approximately 60 centers selected on the basis of operational criteria
established by the Ministry of Health (MINISANTE) and poverty
levels of the communities they serve. The program will be
progressively expanded to 160 nutrition centers over a four-year
period.
CARITAS will be responsible for executing the AIDS and orphans
program. Part of the cash generated by the sales of imported food aid
would be used to finance school tuition for children of AIDS-afflicted
families. The PNAS coordinating office (Bureau de coordination du
PNAS - BCP) will ensure the financing and overall monitoring of the
logistics for food aid transportation and distribution. It is expected
that other poverty alleviation activities of the PNAS and economic
improvements induced by the adjustment program will allow
permanent food aid to be strictly limited to individuals with no other
means of survival. A thorough assessment of the food aid impact
would be part of the mid-term review of project implementation.
(ii)   Nutrition activities. The Nutrition Division of the MINISANTE
would be responsible for undertaking a major strengthening of the
national nutrition program, including: (a) definition of a package of
activities to be carried out by each nutrition center, such as: (i) growth
monitoring and diagnostic of malnutrition among children and women;
(ii) nutrition education and promotion of family food production; and
(iii) provision of complementary measures such as dewormization and
supplementation in Vitamin A, iron and iodine (as necessary); (b) the
programming of training and supervision activities that would be
needed to carry out such activities at the periphery; and (c) the
establishment of a monitoring system. Several donors (including IDA
through the on-going Family Health Project) would provide support to
these activities; UNICEF and WHO have agreed to provide the
necessary leadership and guidance at the operational level. Nutrition
centers benefitting from food aid will be the first to participate in this
nutrition program because of the expected increase in attendance.
(b)   Rapid Response to Transitory food insecurity.
3.9          This sub-component will address those households who face acute transitory
food insecurity. Such a situation may occur because of unexpected circumstances (people
displaced by war), natural disasters (hailstorms! landslides, drought) or increasingly because,



- 13 -
in certain areas of the country, the balance between population and land has been jeopardized.
Many farmers are now left with so little land that their precari^lus food security situation can
be rapidly upset by small changes in food production and income. The famine of 1989 in the
southern part of the country is an example of this. The PNAS team has prepared a rapid
response system to the threat of acute food insecurity, as described below.
3.10         Early Warning System. Famine situations can be prevented more easily in
Rwanda than in Sahelian countries because: (a) it is a smal! country with a good
communication system; (b) there are a wide diversity of food crops and at least two harvest
seasons; and (c) regional exchanges can contribute to food security. On this basis, no
sophisticated early warning system is proposed but simply to strengthen data collection carried
out at the commune level by MINAGRI. Data to be collected will include harvest estimates
for all key products, agricultural prices and wage prices (to assess the purchasing power, a
key element for food security). As soon as certain indicators show a potential risk of food
insecurity, MINAGRI will convey the information to a food security task force whose
constitution and role are summarized below.
3.11         The Food Security Task Force. This task force is constituted by two
commissions and the Cellule d'Appui technique a la Gestion des Aides Alimentaires
(CATGA). The first commission (Inter-ministerial Committee on Food Aid) is chaired by
'INIPLAN and is responsible for monitoring program food aid to the country and making
projections. The second commission (Technical Committee of Emergency Food Aid) is
chaired by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MINITRASO) and deals with emergency
requests from communes ("project" food aid). It includes all donors involved in food aid,
under the informal leadership of Canada and WFP. The CATGA has been created with
Canadian support to rationalize food aid. It is responsible for collecting, analyzing and
disseminating all information pertaining to food aid in Rwanda. Its mandate includes food aid
related to balance of payments support (program food aid), specific projects (such as the WFP
project previously described) and emergency food aid. In practice, the CATGA acts as a
technical secretariat to both commissions which meet on a periodic basis or when there is an
emergency situation. Management of food aid logistics and monitoring will be under the
responsibility of the executing unit for the component (see para. 3.17).
3.12         The Reserve Stock. This stock would be constituted of food purchased locally
with the unified counterpart fund (see para. 5.7) and would allow the first rapid response to
the threat of acute food insecurity in a given area, on the basis of reports from the Ministry of
Agriculture (MINAGRI)'s early warning system. The decision to intervene is taken by the
MINIPLAN after a plenary session of the Food Security Task Force. The stock of
approximately 4,000 tons would cover the needs of approximately 60,000 people over a one-
month period. The stocks will be maintained in a few selected storage facilities run by the
national food storage authority (OPROVIA). Food aid transport will be financed by the BCP
(PNAS coordinating office) which will contract out to private companies for the transport of
food to the prefectures. At the prefectures' level, the local authorities will be responsible for
transporting the food to the communes at need (in most cases small private truckers will be
used under BCP financing). At the commune level the distribution of food will be carried out
by the local administration on the basis of well publicized lists of priority needy families.
Communal councils, which include representatives from the churches and other NGOs will
ensure the transparency of this process. Simultaneously, with the use of this food reserve, the
CATGA will request external contributions on the basis of the anticipated gravity and duration
of the food insecurity situation: at the minimum, a donor will be asked to replace the part of



- 14-
the reserve that has been used; if the situation is more severe, a documented request stating
the magnitude of the problem and the specific needs will be prepared by CATGA and
transmitted to the donor community.
3.13         The Emergency Fund. In the event of a severe and durable famine situation,
there might be a gap between the use of the food reserves and the arrival of additional food
aid. The Food Security Task Force could then use an emergency fund of approximately
US$1 million drawn from the unified counterpart fund and centrally managed by BCP. This
fund would be used by WFP to buy food either in food surplus regions of Rwanda. Logistics
are the same as the ones described for the food reserve. When additional food aid becomes
available, the fund is reconstituted through the sale of food on the local markets.
(c)    Food Aid Poliey Development.
3.14         Rationale and Objectives. The need for developing a coherent food aid policy
arises from: (a) the likelihood that food insecurity will increase in the coming years because
of the demographic pressure and the expected slowness of economic recovery; and (b) the
significant risk of negative effects of an unplanned food aid in a country with small markets.
Food aid, if poorly managed, can easily compete with local and/or regional productions and
thus depress further the supply response of an essentially agricultural economy. In addition,
food aid can introduce new and more expensive eating habits in the population that are not
sustainable on the long term. In this perspective, a food aid charter between the government
and key donors would provide some guarantee that food aid would be used in a prudent
fashion.
3.15         The charter would deal with quantities and prices and would stipulate that no
government request would be considered unless a technical annex is appended to the request
with the following elements: effective demand (on the basis of the purchasing power); national
production of the food solicited; national reserves of this food; commercial imports; cross-
border trade; program food aid needs; and specific amounts requested from each donor. The
charter would not be considered as a binding legal document but rather as a planning tool that
all parties involved agree to use.
3.16         Preparation of the Charter and Monitoring. A food aid expert will be
recruited to assist CATGA to prepare the Charter. The draft will be submitted first to the
technical food aid committee for inputs from the donors involved in food aid and then to the
Inter-ministerial Committee for final approval. The monitoring of the use of the Charter will
be done by the CATGA which will periodically report to the Food Security Task Force. The
task force will use these reports to assess overall food aid needs, taking into account other
interventions which contribute to food security (such as LBWs and other investment projects).
Component Coordination and Monitoring
3.17         An executing unit (Bureau Executif du Programme de Securite Alimentaire et
Nutritionnelle. Bureau Executif PSAN) has been created within MINITRASO as part of the
institutional framework of the PNAS (see para. 4.2). This unit will be responsible for
coordinating all actors involved in the component and monitoring progress at the commune
level. It will work in close collaboration with the WFP office for all logistical aspects of food
aid and with the BCP for all financial matters. The executing unit will include a technical
assistant whose specific tasks will be to: (a) assist the WFP office in food distribution



- 15 -
management; (b) establish a monitoring system to assess the impact of food aid associated
with nutrition activities; and (c) follow up on the progress on food aid policy development.
This technical assistant will be part of the overall TA project described in para 4.7.
Labor-Based Works (LBWs) Component
3.18         BackgroWupd and Justification. The long-term goal of this component is to
contribute to the promotion of labor-based methods in public works to take advantage of
Rwanda's large and under-employed work force. The short-term purpose is to provide
income earning opportunities for the poorest segments of the population. Through this four-
year project, over 100,000 families (25,000 each year) will have access to income earning
opporunities. This will provide some relief to the poorest Rwandese until the benefits of the
various economic and sectoral adjustment programs (including the nascent population control
program) reach them. The project will also train and contract work to Rwandese private
sector enterprises and NGOs in labor-based construction. Thus, it expects to be a catalyst in
switching Rwanda's construction sector to labor-based methods more suitable to the country's
situation.
3.19         Labor-based public works (LBWs) in Rwanda have numerous advantages over
equipment intensive works. For example, in the case of communal roads, LBWs: (a) cost
less; (b) create much more employment; (c) reduce import needs significantly; (d) increase
exponditures on local goods and services; and (e) benefit mostly workers from the poorest
households. The above are findings from a study of the pilot special labor-based public
works program (Proiet Special de Travaux Publics a Haute Intensite de Main-d'Oeuvre -
PSTP/HIMO). It was carried out before the 1990 devaluation. The likelihood is that,
following the devaluation, the cost advantage of LBWs over equipment intensive works has
increased significantly. The only significant negative consequence of the LBWs when
compared to equipment intensive works was the loss in tax revenues from imported goods
such as fuel and heavy equipment. The tax system reforms which are part of the structural
adjustment program are expected to reduce the heavy reliance on trade taxes on a few goods
and consequently the revenue loss in switching to LBWs will become less significant.
3.20         The reasons why LBWs have failed to be generalized despite the above
findings include: (a) preference among technical specialists for equipment intensive works on
the grounds of quality despite evidence to the contrary from other densely populated countries
such as China or India; (b) lack of private sector capacity (including NGOs) to implement
LBWs; (c) shortage of the specific management and technical skills required for LBWs; and
(d) lack of involvement of private sector firms in the PSTP/HIMO. Closer examination
revealed that, while stating a verbal preference for LBWs, the Ministry of Public Works
(MINITRAPE) uses bidding documents and procedures that have a built-in bias in favor of
equipment intensive works. For example, by using fairly complex bidding procedures, it
provides an advantage to the larger equipment intensive contractors rather than smaller labor-
based contractors. Furthermore, design and bidding documents were often prepared by
external consultants with training and experience in labor scarce economies who did not adjust
their technical standards to Rwanda's particular situation. In addition, the PSTP/HIMO which



- 16 -
was responsible for implementing the pilot LBWs program, did not make enough effort to
train private enterprises in LBWs and work through them rather than through force account4/.
3.21         Objectives and Scope of the Proposed LBWs Program. The key objectives of
this program are: (a) to finance LBWs in the poorest communes of the country (43 communes
out of a total of 145); (b) to develop local private sector capacity in LBWs; (c) and to
strengthen local government capacity in managing and implementing small-scale infrastructure
investments. Small and medium private enterprises (SMEs) and NGOs expressing an interest
in LBWs will be trained and given the opportunity to execute LBWs contracts. Local
government capacity will be strengthened by supporting communes in preparing three-year
rolling LBWs investment programs (a mini-PIP for communes to be called Progoamm
d'Investissements Communal or PIC) and implementing them mostly through SMEs and
NGOs with financial and technical support from the national LBWs program. To avoid
duplication of efforts, communal roads will not be funded in those communes where the
Communal Roads component of the IDA-financed Transport Sector Project is active and will
use labor-based methods. A detailed description of the program is provided in Annex m1.
3.22         The LBWs component would finance US$18 million ($21 million including
contingencies) of works, 90% to be spent in the 43 poorest communes distributed among the
five poorest prefectures of the southern regions of Rwanda. These communes have been
selected using an index of vulnerability which ranks the communes on the basis of indicators
including per capita caloric availability, number of potentially food insecure people (from
surveys carried out by the Ministry of Interior (MININTER)), land pressure, estimated
surplus labor and number of people receiving food aid. The index does not represent a
ranking of the development level of the commune but rather its needs in terms of poverty
alleviation. Since new data on poverty might become available in the coming years, the list
of communes will be revised during the proposed mid-term project implementation review.
3.23         Contractors (including for profit enterprises and NGOs) interested in executing
LBWs would have to prove their implementation capacity, either by demonstrating reliable
past experience, or by joining a training program which will be initiated before launching
project activities through PSTP/HIMO with technical assistance from the International Labor
Office (ILO). This training program would cover labor management (which is far more
important for LBWs than for equipment intensive works), financial management and technical
skills. Newly trained firms with no previous experience would initially be limited to simpler
works (such as routine road maintenance) and would become eligible for all types of works as
they become competent. Following the training period, newly trained firms will be given sole
source contracts to be executed under close supervision of the trainer. If they successfully
execute the contract, they will be given another contract which would not be supervised as
closely. At the successful conclusion of the second contract, they would be included in the
eligible list of contractors. Details on how works will be supervised are provided in Annex
III. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the government that the training
programs for the LBWs component would have been submitted to IDA for approval prior to
credit effectiveness (para. 7.2 (b)).
_4/    A similar ELO supported project in Ghana trained 32 contractors each capable of
doing 24 km. of rural roads per year.

3.24          Types of Works and Expected Impact. The proposed works will consist of
several sub-components such as communal roads, forestry, soil conservation, rural water
supply, markets and other infrastructure important to rural communes. In addition urban
services are expected to be financed. The roads program will support road rehabilitation,
maintenance and construction of footpaths. The forestry program will include some
reforestation and some maintenance of forests but the major share ,..: go to the rehabilitation
of existing forests which have deteriorated. The soil conservation projects will support a
limited number of agriculture terraces (on a demaonstration basis, jointly with pilot agricultural
projects) as well as other soil conservation activities while the water supply component will
finance gravity based water systems and tapping of springs. The exact nature of urban works
is yet to be defined. The table below summarizes the share of labor in the total cost for each
type of works.

3.25          On the basis of the allocation of funds among the different types of LBWs
used in the preliminary costing, this component would assist approximately 125,000 persons
per year. The proposed flexible system of project selection by communes (see following
paras.) may result in a different allocation of funds among the various types of LBWs even
though the total cost of LBWs is unlikely to change. The impact on employment will be
higher if the proportion of funds going to forestry, terraces, footpaths, markets and urban
services increase and lower if other works increase. The estimated impact on employment
and share of costs going to labor is based on the assumption that the unskilled workers are
paid the minimum wage (120 FRW per day) and that their productivity is similar to that of
unskilled workers in the pilot labor-based works program (PSTP/HIMO). It is possible that
private entrepreneurs, who are expected to execute a large share of the works, may pay their
workers more and that the productivity of their unskilled labor may be higher. If that
happens to be the case, the share of the total cost going to labor (and therefore the level of
revenue transfer) may be higher though the expected impact in employment days would be
lower.

3.26         Program Management and Implementation Plan. The principal objectives for
the organization and implementation of this component are to: (a) strengthen the communal
administrative capacity to plan and monitor the execution of LBWs; (b) use effectively
technical capacities of the prefectures and the Ministries of Interior and Public Works without
slowing down the implementation process; (c) involve as much and as rapidly as possible
private contractors (or N30s) in the execution of the works; and (d) ensure prompt financial
transfers to the workers without interference from the central administration. In order to be
able to implement this component, the existing PSTP/HIMO unit (renamed Cellule HIMO)
will be streizgthened both in terms of institutional capabilities and operational autonomy 5I.
The Cellule HIMO will be part of the overall implementation structure of the PNAS.
Through this structure, the Cellule HIMO will have full power to procure goods and services
with limited control from the central administration. The Cellule HIMO will be constituted of
three technical units (roads, forests and other works) and a financial unit. During
negotiations, agreement has been reached with the govermnent that evidence acceptable to
IDA that the Director and the four unit chiefs of the Cellule HIMO have been appointed will
be a condition of credit effectiveness (paras. 4.6 and 7.2 (c)).
3.27         The selection of works at the commune level would be done by the local
authorities in the form of the three-year rolling communal LBWs investment program with
technical support from long-term consultants recruited by the Cellule HIMO. The consultant
team will work with groups of ten communes at a time, for a period of 3-4 months. The
Cellule will consolidate all the proposals from the communes in annual work programs and
budgets to be submitted to the BCP which, after approving the program, will advance funds
regularly to cover the costs for the next six months of work. Up to December 1992, the
communes, with technical support from the Cellule HIMO, will prepare an exhaustive list of
potential LBWs projects including preliminary cost estimates. Following appropriate
discussions with local representatives of technical ministries particularly MINITRAPE and
MINAGRI, the Communal Councils will establish their priorities among the potential projects
by voting their three-year rolling investment program. The total value of the projects in the
communal investment programs would be constrained by the indicative budgetary allocation
prepared by the Cellule HIMO for the respective communes. These budgetary allocations are
simply indicative to give the communes an order of magnitude of a reasonable level of
investment based on their implementation capabilities. Since priorities may change, the
communes, with technical help from the Cellule HIMO, will annually review their three-year
rolling investment programs and get them approved by the Communal Councils. No project
proposal will be accepted for funding unless they are included in the investment program but
their inclusion in the program does not guarantee funding. The Cellule HIMO will review the
projects proposed by the communes and wi:i select projects to be financed according to
procedures and criteria described in Annex m. Communes that do not submit a sufficient
number of acceptable projects will have their funds transferred to a common pool and used
according to procedures described in Annex Im. Projects and contracts below US$40,000
would be approved by the Chief of the concerned technical unit (roads, forests or other
LBWs) following consultationt with the Director of the Cellule HIMO. Projects and contracts
above US$40,000 would be approved by a committee including the Director, and the chiefs of
all technical units (roads, forests, other works). During the first two years, the committee
S/    The PSTPIHIMO unit is located within MININTER to benefit from its institutional
support at the prefectoral and communal levels. The unit, however, is fairly
independent from the Ministry with regards to operational matters.



- 19 -
will also include the head of the technical assistance team. Approval (or rejection) of all
projects would be based on the selection procedures and criteria described in Annex III.
3.28         The proposed LBWs will be executed using cash-for-work in preference to
food-for-work for the following reasons: (a) payment n'i cash would create a demand for food
and help the development of markets (two objectives of the agricultural strategy); (b) cash
availability would also stimulate cross-border trade, a traditionally important factor for food
security; (c) cash-for-work is easier to manage than food-for-work which requires complex
logistics; and (d) private contractors for the works would find it difficult to remunerate
workers with anything else than cash. Poor workers will be targeted using the communal
authorities' lists of the poor. The program will recommend that preference be given to
women workers whenever possible and will encourage the establishment of on-site child care
arrangements and bonuses to contractors who use women. The Cellule HIMO will be
responsible for paying contractors and supervising technical aspects of their work and for
submitting regular accounting statements on its use of funds to BCP. BCP will also take
responsibility for grouping equipment requirements and purchasing them in large lots.
3.29         Sustainability. The proposed program will help to increase the communes'
general revenues by financing markets and supporting sustainable agro-forestry. The
development impact of the roads and agricultural terracing is also expected to increase
communal revenues. Finally, by requiring specific maintenance programs for roads, markets
and other infrastructures, the project will help increase the economically useful life of these
investments.
3.30         Environmental Issues. This component will have positive environmental
effects through the proposed anti-erosion measures (reforestation, agricultural terracing).
Potential negative effects to the environment are minimal and will be prevented through a set
of measures which have been identified during project preparation. The risks are related to
preserving top-soil, existing natural forests and diversity of tree species. The proposed
actions to avoid environmental risks include reliance to the maximum extent possible on labor-
based construction using medium-sized equipment only when there is no other alternative. No
new roads are planned and only existing roads will be rehabilitated. The agriculture terracing
will be done on existing agriculture land and will be done on a pilot demonstration basis.
Care will be -aken to remove the top-soil first before terracing and then replacing it on the
terraces. In order to ensure a proper technical approach, no terracing will be undertaken
unless an agricultural project has taken the lead. Reforestation will be on treeless hillsides
with little agriculture potential. Native species (instead of exclusive reliance on pines and
eucalyptus) will be included following the recommendations of the National Environment
Plan.
Micro-Enterpdrise Promotion and Development
3.31         Background and Justification. One of the main constraints that Rwanda is
facing is the lack of off-farm employment in rural areas in order to compensate for the
saturation of agricultural activities in most regions of the country. The government has been
aware of this need, but had not been direcdy involved in the promotion of off-farm
employment programs. However, with the structural adjustment program in place, the
government seems willing to tackle this issue in an in-depth manner. Most efforts to
capitalize on local entrepreneurship have come from NGOs, community organizations, and
development projects which are exploring avenues for stimulating off-farm employment. In



- 20 -
most cases, these efforts were successful on a small scale as they were undertaken on a
regional basis (1-2 prefectures). In the rural areas of Rwanda, the notion of obtaining credit
for a productive activity is virtually non-existent. In a 1990 survey undertaken by the
Ministry of Industry, only 10 percent of micro-entrepreneurs had benefitted from a formal
bank loan. The network of decentralized administrations - the 145 communes - could have
played an important role in creating awareness among the population. However, in most
cases, the communal administrations have lacked the technical expertise, knowledge, and
financial resources to adequately promote micro-entrepreneurship. The most extensive and
successfil program has been the ProLjet d'Appui aux Micro-realisations et Micro-entreprises
financed by LUNDP with technical assistance from ILO which began in 1988. Its objective has
been to promote and create rural off-farm employment on a national scale by providing
financing, training, and technical assistance to potential micro-entrepreneurs.
3.32         Objectives and Scope of the Component. This component will provide
support to the Programme d'Appui aux Initiatives de Base (PAIB) which is an expansion and
enhancement of the above mentioned UNDP/ILO project. The objectives of this component
are to: (a) promote the creation of profitable micro-enterprises in rural areas as a mean of
generating productive non-agricultural employment; and (b) facilitate the creation of these
micro-enterprises by appraising their viability and assisting micro-entrepreneurs in obtaining
financing. The proposed activities of the PAIB are operational research-oriented and will
have an impact on a longer term than the other project components: this component will
provide feedback to the government and the development agencies on the lessons to be learned
on the way off-farm employment can be developed in Rwanda. A more detailed description
of the component is provided in Annex IV.
3.33         This program targets dynamic individuals who have the potential for creating
and operating micro-enterprises and need assistance in obtaining credit and management
training. These individuals will be identified through a community-based network and
assisted by NGOs with experience in micro-enterprise development.
3.34         Activities and Imnlementation. The activities of this component will be
demand-driven by the target populations who will be involved in all stages of this process.
This means that the interventions proposed will be tailored to the needs and absorptive
capacity of micro-entrepreneurs. An essential element of this approach is that this program
will build upon existing local NGOs since most field activities will be sub-contracted to them.
The three sets of activities are described below:
(i)    Creation of a Decentralized Network. This network will mainly
consist of dynamic persons from the local communities (traditional
leaders) who will act as "front line" promoters of this program. Their
main responsibilities will be to create awareness among their
community of potentially more lucrative off-farm employment
opportunities through micro-enterprise development. Individuals
willing to seize this opportunity will then be encouraged to transmit
their ideas to the PAIB's agents located at the prefecture level. These
agents will be responsible for processing the collected proposals: pre-
selection, feasibility studies, and selection for credit funding. This
approach will facilitate the interface between creative and ambitious
individuals or groups and their technical and financial requirements.
These network agents will be volunteers, but will receive the



- 21 -
necessary training by PAIB's staff, as well as materials and travel
allowances.
(ii)   project Processing through NGOs. Implementation of the PAIB at the
periphery will be mainly the responsibility of NGOs. The selection of
NGOs will be based on their expertise and capacity to effectively
intervene in the various actions. They will also receive specialized
training in order for them to: (a) carry out adequate feasibility studies
for the proposed micro-enterprises; and (b) provide training and
technical assistance in the fields of management, accounting,
marketing, appropriate technologies, and commercialization. These
services will be sub-contracted by PAIB management to NGOs.
During the pre-implementation stage of this component (April-
December 1992), the institutional capabilities of each NGO joining the
program will be strengthened by the project team. Institutional
strengthening will include: (a) definition of objectives and agreement
on the work programs; (b) training of trainers and supervisors; and (c)
establishment of adequate accounting systems. NGOs' performance
will be monitored by PAIB management.
(iii) Creation of Micro-enterprises. A mechanism will be put in place with
participating NGOs to assist in the financing of potentially profitable micro-
enterprises by: (a) conducting feasibility studies based on the pre-screened
proposals; (b) preparing and presenting proposals for financing; and (c)
negotiating with financial institutions (such as BaMes Popuaires, BWWe
Rwandaise de DdveloDpement and community-based savings and credit
associations) which are willing to expand their services to small rural credits.
PAEB management will be directly responsible for initiating activity (c).
Decentralized PAIB staff (see para. 3.37) will assist NGOs for activities (a)
and (b). In addition to the funds, micro-entrepreneurs will benefit from
training in management, accounting, production techniques and other relevant
skills. Staff from the NGOs involved will also be responsible for regular
follow-up visits.
3.35         By building on existing NGO presence in the six prefectures not covered by
the existing UNDPIILO project, nationwide coverage is expected to be attained by 1995. At
present, the project is intervening in four prefectures; three additional prefectures will be
added every year so as to reach this target by 1995. Based on previous results by the
UNDP/ILO project, it is anticipated that on the average thirty micro-enterprises wiUl be
created and/or assisted in each prefecture annually. The total number of micro-enterprises to
be created throughout the project is expected to be around 1,500.
3.36          ram   Mana        . The proposed management structure of this
component wiUl also build upon the experience acquired from the existing UNDP/ILO
projectf/ while reflecting the enlarged mandate and broader partnership base of the

- 22 -
component (NGOs, community groups, communal administrations). At the central level, the
executing unit (Breau Executif PAIB will be composed of a director, two financial analysts
and the necessary support staff. This unit will be responsible for: (a) preparation of annual
work programs and corresponding budgets; (b) coordination between NGOs, local
authorities, and central and regional authorities; (c) contacts with financial institutions; (d)
coordination with the other project components; and (e) monitoring of program performance
and impact. The executing unit will benefit from the technical guidance and operational
support of MIJEUMA, particularly at the prefecture level. In each of the prefectures, two
PAIB agents will provide support to NGOs willing and able to participate in project activities.
These NGOs will be responsible for reviewing requests for loans, performing feasibility
studies, selecting the most viable projects, and requesting the central management unit's
assistance in obtaining loans for the selected micro-enterprises through the formal banking
system. Hence, the PAIB agents will be the operational links between the executing unit, at
the central level and the NGOs, network agents, and entrepreneurs, at the field level
3.37           Potentially profitable micro-enterprises with credit needs exceeding
US$1,000 up to a maximum of US$10,000 will be directed towards the formal banking
system. Both the Bangue Rwandaise de Developpement (BRD) and the Banques Populaires
(BP) have experience in approving loans for the creation of rural micro-enterprises. The
PAIB will deposit the equivalent of US$250,000 with these institutions in the form of loan
guarantee funds. Based on these two bank's evaluations of loan requests submitted by
prefectoral units (approved by the PAIB central management unit and the sub-contracting
NGO), these institutions will finance micro-entrepreneurs who lack the necessary collateral for
ordinary loans. Forty percent of each of the approved credits will be guaranteed by the PAIB
guarantee fund and 60 percent assumed by the bank. Potentially profitable, but very small
micro-enterprises (requiring less than US$1,000 investment) will be directed towards
community-based savings and credit associations. It is expected that this type of scheme will
benefit extremely small potential entrepreneurs who are not in a position of obtaining funds
from a bank due to the limited size of their activities and their lack of collateral. A service
charge (of at least 10 percent per year) will be added to the loan amount in order to partially
defray service costs and to acquaint entrepreneurs with the notion of credit and the payment
for financial services.
3.38         Enviromental Issues, To avoid potentially negative environmental effects
arising from certain types of micro-enterprises, a positive list of micro-enterprises is being
established as part of the completion of the component preparation. For each type of project
specific, environmental guidelines will be established to cover both project selection and
project execution. The positive list and its corresponding guidelines will be prepared during
the final preparation stage with help from experts and submitted for appropriate approval by
the Ministry of Environment. The positive list and corresponding guidelines may be revised
from time to time as necessary and the revised list submitted for approval by IDA.
lving Standards and Poverty Monitoring Component
3.39         Rationale and Objective. From the inception of its structural adjustment
program the Government of Rwanda has stated an interest in monitoring the micro-economic
and welfare impact of the process of policy reform. The real economic effects of a process of
structural adjustment find expression in the behavior of households and individuals regarding
labor supply, production, trade, and consumption. The objective of the poverty monitoring
system to be established under PNAS is tro trace the evolution of selected determinants of



-23 -
welfare, and welfare outcomes, in the context of the country's adjustment process. Under the
poverty monitoring system, particular attention would be paid to the following aspects: (a) the
evolution of living standards over time (consumption of food and other essentials, nutritional
status, satisfaction of basic needs, demand behavior in such areas as health, schooling, and
housing); (b) the identification of poor groups in need of targeted assistance to raise their
income and consumption possibilities; (c) the participation of different population groups in
specified sectors of activity and economic growth; and (d) private reactions to, and the
distribution of benefits from, changes in relative incentives between sectors and lines of
production as induced by the process of structural adjustment.
3.40         Thus, the proposed poverty monitoring system would generate data on the
evolution of key aspects of welfare over time. The data required to analyze the distributional
consequences of a process of structural adjustment are currently unavailable in Rwanda. A
household survey auete Nationale sur les Budgets et la Consommation des Menages" has
been carried out in the eid 1 980s, but the size of the sample (ess than 300 households in the
rural areas) was small, and imporiant changes have occurred in the Rwandese economy since
that period. The survey needs to be updaLc- However, as already mentioned, a poverty
profile of Rwanda has been developed on the basis nf this household survey as part of the
preparatory work for PNAS. The proposed poverty moiitnring system calls for repeated data
collection over time, because adjustment is a dynamic process1  its benefits and burdens are
distributed in time. The changes currently affecting the Rwandese e&c'omy (internal and
external shocks, adjustment, high population growth, war, AIDS epidemic, .cc.) have
different employment and income consequences for different groups. A policy-oriented
analysis of these consequences pre-supposes a permanent and economy-wide monitoring
system.
3.41         Proframmatic Approach and Instruments. A first issue in the context of
planning a welfare monitoring system over time pertains to the type of data to be collected.
Generically, it is appropriate (for reasons of cost and expediency) to distinguish between
indicator-based and survey-based poverty monitoring. Indicators include variables such as
wage rates (particularly for unskilled labor), rural-urban terms of trade, indices of key food
prices, and nutrition surveillance (growth monitoring in health centers and at sentinel sites).
Time series of these poverty indicators (with various observation points per year) will provide
a fairly accurate picture of broad poverty trends. But indicators do not provide information
on causes of change, and they cannot account for population heterogeneity as sample surveys
do. Observation of basic trends via indicators is less costly, but also much less revealing than
survey-based analysis.
3.42         In the area of household surveys, it is useful to distinguish between integrated
and priority surveys (PS). In the former, the full income generation and expenditure
processes, and basic needs achievements are observed. Examples of this are the World
Bank's Social Dimension of Adjustment (SDA) multi-topic integrated survey, the World
Bank's living standards measurement surveys, and Rwanda's household consumption survey
of the mid-1980s. An example of the latter is the World Bank's SDA priority survey, a
household survey instrument designed for the rapid identification and monitoring of policy
target groups. The data content of the priority survey covers a range of welfare aspects
(including employment, assets, anthropometry, migration, agricultural and non-farm
household enterprises, health consultations, school attendance and educational achievements,



- 24 -
housing and amenities, and selected household expenditures) 2/. Compared with the
integrated survey, the content of the priority survey is quite restricted, but the data, although
collected over a larger sample, permit much faster tabulation and analysis. Ideally, the
priority survey is conducted in the first phase of a survey program, hence providing policy
makers with an initial empirical basis for targeting essential and urgent interventions. When
repeated, the priority survey becomes a monitoring tool for tracing changes in welfare and
basic needs fulfillment across socio-economic groups. Repetition of the priority survey make
sense, because (as stated earlier) the micro-level effects of macroeconomic policy reform (or
external shocks) are distributed over time and across groups and thus call for a combination of
cross-sectional and time-series data.
3.43         Given the existence of the priority survey as an innovation in household
survey "technology" (this survey has been developed under the Bank's SDA Program and is
now being implemented in a number of African countries), the government has decided to
refrain from investing in an indicator-based monitoring system in the context of PNASI/ and
to deploy the SDA priority survey as a tool for poverty monitoring in Rwanda. The priority
survey would be complemented once during the life of PNAS by an integrated survey to
permit multi-variate analysis, update the weights for the calculation of regional price indices
and, in general, permit comprehensive policy analysis on living standards and their
determinants.
3.44         Overall, the welfare monitoring system proposed under PNAS would consist
of one Integrated Survey (to be carried out in 1994-95) and two Priority Surveys (1993 and
1996). Technical details regarding the surveys and the program of field implementation,
processing and analysis are given in Annex V.
3.45         Institutional ADets. The Director-General of Statistics in MINIPLAN will
have overall responsibility for implementing this component. The Director of Surveys (a
department within the Directorate of Statistics) will be the technical manager for the surveys.
Statisticians, computer specialists and other relevant staff from this department will be
mobilized to carry out the surveys and analyze the data. The welfare monitoring system to be
established should integrate the two aspects of data collection and processing, on the one
hand, and policy-relevant analysis, on the other hand. Thus, the BCP will be responsible for
forming a coalition, and foster contact, between data users (analysts in the Ministries of
Planning, Finance, Central Bank, line ministries; universities, donors) and data gatherers
(Direction de la Statistique of MINIPLAN). To this end, a Comite des utilisateurs (Users'
Committee) consisting of the above agencies (see organizational chart No HI) has been created
7.1    A full description of the PS (including a prototype questionnaire) is given in

Working Paper No. 10, The World Bank, 1991.

Health, Education and Agriculture projects) and will contribute to the overall poverty
monitoring system.

to ensure a constituency for the survey program among planners and policy makers and
maximize the use of the data for analytical purposes. The BCP will also be responsible for
the dissemination of the results of the survey analysis, in close coordination with the technical
committee in charge of monitoring the implementation of the structural adjustment program.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Status of Project Preparation
4.1          The proposed operation was identified in October 1990, in parallel with the
preparation of the structural adjustment program. A follow-up mission took place in January
1991 to: (a) define further the design of each component and agree on the terms of reference
for project preparation; (b) help finalize the 1991-93 social sector public expenditure program;
and (c) start building up donor coordination. At this stage, UNDP agreed to finance initial
project preparation and to provide technical guidance to the Rwandese preparation team. The
preparation mission which took place in May 1991 to review progress in project preparation
focused on institutional arrangements for preparing the proposed operation. During this
mission, the government set up a multi-sectoral preparation team, organized in five working
groups (Food Security, LBWs, PAIB, Education and Social Surveys). MINIPLAN's
directorate of studies and projects was put in charge of coordinating the project preparation
process. International technical assistants were recruited through UNDP financing for the
LBWs and PAIB components and preparation of the project document. The Canadian
cooperation provided a consultant for the Food Security component. In addition, several local
consultants were recruited by UNDP to contribute to the preparation process. Pre-appraisal
took place in September 1991, and the mission was able to review comprehensive working
documents for all components, and to assess the feasibility of certain activities during field
visits. The mission left detailed recommendations to the preparation team to improve
technical and managerial aspects of the proposal. Appraisal took place in December 1991.
Aa advance under the PPF of US$1.3 million has been provided to the government to
complete project preparation and initiate project-launch activities (such as training of key staff
and detailed feasibility studies and preparation of bidding documents).
B. Project Management
Overall Institutional Framework
4.2          The proposed institutional framework has been designed to respond to specific
operational characteristics of the PNAS, including: (a) its multisectoral nature which implies
an effective collaboration between all ministries involved; (b) the large number of small-scale
activities scattered throughout the country; (c) the involvement of private contractors in the
LBWs; (d) the participation of several external agencies and various NGOs; and (e) the
expected high disbursement rates. These characteristics have several important implications,
including the need for: (a) providing PNAS with as much operational autonomy as possible,
in particular to avoid undue interference from the administration; (b) separating the functions
of overall programming and financial management from technical management of specific
programs; and (c) ensuring that PNAS management has the required managerial skills for
running such an operation. On the basis of these considerations, the institutional structure of
the PNAS has been organized as follows: (a) the MINIPLAN is institutionally responsible for
program execution because the PNAS is part of the social safety net that MINIPLAN



- 26 -
monitors; (b) a program management unit (Bureau de Coordination ciu PNAS - BCP) will be
responsible for the day-to-day financial management and implementation monitoring of the
PNAS; (c) three executing units (one for each operational component LBWS, PAIB and Food
Aid and Nutrition); and (d) a national coordination council (the Conseil de Coordination du
PNAS will be responsible for overall supervision and coordination of the program. The BCP
will be formally created as an self-managed project entity under the umbrella of MINIPLAN.
This institutional arrangement would allow the BCP to carry out programming, budgeting and
financial management without bureaucratic controls from the administration. The main
elements of the proposed institutional framework are described below. An organizational
chart is provided at the end of the report.
4.3          Conseil de Coordination. This advisory body would include representatives
from the Prime Minister's office, MINIPLAN, MININTER, MINrTRAPE, MINLJEUMA,
MINISANTE, MINITRASO, the Ministries of Finance, Trade, Agriculture, NGOs and
External agencies. The Conseil's functions are to: (a) monitor the progress of the PNAS
against the objectives and strategies stated in the Social Policy Statement issued by the
government; (b) ensure coordination and collaboration among the sectors and various external
agencies involved; and (c) review the recruitment process of key staff of the BCP to ensure
that the best candidates have been selected. The regular schedule of the Conseil's meetings is
every 6 months. The president is elected during the first assembly until the next formal
session. Extraordinary sessions can be called upon request of one or several members and
approval by the president. Meetings will be systematically called during IDA's supervision
missions.
4.4          Bureau de Coordination (BCP). A detailed description of BCP's composition
functions and staffing is provided in Annex IV. Key functions of the BCP include: (a)
preparation of general annual work plans for the PNAS; (b) review and consolidation of
annual work programs and budgets for each project component; (c) preparation of annual
financing plans in coordination with all donors involved in the PNAS; (d) management of
disbursement procedures (including the special account) for the IDA credit; (e) provision of
adequate budgetary allocations through program accounts for the recurrent expenditures of all
project activities; (f) procurement of works, goods and strvices either directly or on the basis
of draft bidding documents prepared by the executing units; (g) arrangements for the audit of
program accounts and general audit of the PNAS; (h) preparation of annual reviews of project
implementation on the basis of indicators collected from the executing units; (i) adjustment of
the PNAS overall strategy on the basis of the findings and recommendations of the mid-term
implementation review (see para 4.15); and () overall monitoring of PNAS activities and
coordination with the administration, external agencies and NGOs involved in the operation.
4.5          Executing Units. There are three executing units: (a) the Cellule HIMO
(described in para. 3.26) which will be responsible for managing the implementation of the
LBWs component; (b) the PAIB unit (Bureau Executif PAIB, described in para. 3.36) which
will be responsible for managing the implementation of the Micro-enterprise component; and
(c) the PSAN unit (Bureau Exdcutif PSAN described in para. 3.17) which will be responsible
for coordinating the implementation of the Food Aid and Nutrition component. Two of these
units are already operational for LBWs and Micro-enterprise Development with UNDP/ILO
support but will be strengthened to respond to the heavier workload. These units are located
in the relevant technical ministries (MININTER and MIJEUMA, respectively) to benefit from
their expertise and operational support at the prefecture level. The units, however, are
administratively independent from these ministries for their operations: they will receive their



-27 -
financial resources from and will be accountable to the BCP. The same principles will be
used with MINnTRASO while creating the PSAN executing unit, which will have a
coordinated work program with the local WFP office. Representatives of the line ministries
are members of the Conseil de Coordination where they have opportunities for expressing
their views and recommendations either during the regular sessions or by calling for a special
meeting if an important implementation issue has to be solved.
4.6          Establishment of the Institutional Structure and Staffing. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the government that the establishment of the Cgnseil d
Coordination and the BCP and the selection and appointment of staff for all key positions of
the BCP and the Cellule HIMO, including the four unit chiefs of the Cellule will be a
condition of Credit effectiveness (paras. 3.26 and 7.2 (c)). The qualifications and experience
of the personnel of BCP and the three technical units are essential for effective project
implementation. This staff will be recruited under contractual arrangements with MINIPLAN
after selection through local advertising and review by the Conseil de Coordination.
Experience in private sector management will be an important selection criteria, given the
type of activities to be carried out through the PNAS. The staff v-!Il be hired as local experts
under contract with the govermment. This personnel will receive salary benefits comparable
to those in the private sector, in order to recruit the most qualified individuals and ensure
adequate performance. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that
high level staff of the BCP (national coordinator, accountant and procurement specialist), and
the heads of the three executing units (Cellule HIMO, Bureau Executif PAIB and Bureau
Executif PSAN) will be satisfactory to IDA at all time during project implementation (para.
7.1 (d)).
4.7          Technical Assistance CTA . Rwanda does not have enough individuals with
the experience and skills required for rapidly and efficiently implementing the PNAS.
Technical assistance needs have been assessed for central management (BCP) and the four
components. A summary of these needs is provided in Annex VII. In order to increase the
coherence and coordination of technical assistance, UNDP has agreed to finance a
comprehensive TA program to support PNAS implementation. This TA program will be
managed by the BCP and will bring in the necessary skills for each aspect of project
implementation, including its monitoring. The technical assistants will be distributed between
the BCP (programming, monitoring and financial management) and the executing units of
each component (technical specialists). The BCP director and the principal technical advisor
will have joint responsibility for ensuring the coordination and monitoring of the technical
assistance program. The TA program will also contribute to the supervision of the PNAS by
providing on a regular basis the status of key program performance indicators. Finally, a
technical advisor will assist the MINIPLAN in monitoring the overall implementation of the
Social Safety Net. The government, UNDP and IDA will coordinate their efforts to have this
TA program operational by the time of credit effectiveness (expected by January 1993).
Project Implementation Strateg
4.8          Guiding Principles. First, each component is operationally independent from
the others in the sense that implementation delays for one component would not have a
negative impact on the others. All components, however, have complementary and
synergistic effects on poverty alleviation and their effective coordination would result in
efficiency gains. Second, the BCP will be responsible for ensuring a rapid and efficient



-28 -
implementation through: (a) effective planning/budgeting of all PNAS activities; (b) adequate
procurement, disbursement and accounting; and (c) monitoring of financial and physical
performance indicators. Finally, all PNAS activities will: (a) imply a certain participation of
the beneficiaries (communes, selected NGOs and the target populations); and (b) make use of
the private sector (contractors, consulting firms) to the largest possible extent.
4.9          Integration in the PEP. The PNAS is a new investment in the core social
expenditure program of Rwanda and as such it is included in the general three-year rolling
public expenditure program (PEP). PNAS appears in MINIPLAN's program because it is
under the administrative umbrella of this ministry. The integration in the PEP would permit
an annual review of the PNAS as part of the social safety net of public expenditures,
including Health, Education and Population. This would facilitate the coordination of external
financing and budget preparation for government contribution.
4.10         Donors' Coordination. Several donors have already expressed interest in
supporting the PNAS. UNDP has been involved in the project process since identification
and has contributed to the financing of project preparation. Canada has also participated in
the preparation, specifically for the Food Aid component. Other agencies, such as the
European (EEC) and the Belgian and Swiss cooperations have been actively involved in
discussions on the concept and design of the PNAS. At the implementation phase, the
coordination of these diverse contributions will be under the responsibility of the BCP.
4.11         Sustainability and Evolution. PNAS has been created to respond promptly to
a deteriorating social situation, with means and management practices that are not available to
the administration. But, beyond this primary goal of poverty alleviation, the PNAS should be
used to: (a) demonstrate the effect of better managerial practices on project implementation;
(b) better define the role of line ministries in poverty alleviation; (c) improve the performance
of the communes in community-based development; and (d) test the potential of the
collaboration between the public and the private sectors in social service delivery. During the
mid-term implementation review (see para. 4.15), an assessment of all these points will be
made to determine what should be the evolution of the PNAS. It is likely that certain
activities will be integrated into existing ministries while others might be completely
decentralized or contracted out to the private sector. The BCP will be responsible for
monitoring the implementation of these recommendations while avoiding a disruption of on-
going activities.
C. Proiect Monitoring and Reporting
4.12         Monitoring. The overall monitoring strategy is based on a bottom up
approach. Information on the various PNAS activities will be collected at the field level by
each executing unit and transmitted to the BCP. The BCP would aggregate the data in a
standard report which will be transmitted to the Conseil de Coordination and IDA every 6
months. The set of project performance indicators against which the progress of the PNAS
will be measured are presented in annex VIII. The BCP will not have to wait for feed back
to undertake corrective actions on the basis of the data they have collected if these corrective
actions concern managerial or operational issues. On the other hand, policy or strategic
decisions would be taken by the Conseil de Coordination on the basis of the analysis of field
reports and would follow a top down approach. In all this process, the TA team will have a
key role to play for ensuring both timely collection of indicators and accurate data analysis.

4.13         The project performance indicators described above give a good picture of the
degree of penetration of PNAS activities in the target population, but they fail to provide
information on: (a) the impact of poverty alleviation measures at the family level; and (b) the
socio-economic impact on communities of certain PNAS activities, such as the development of
micro-enterprises. Point (a) will be addressed through the Living Standards and Poverty
Monitoring component, which will establish regular social surveys at the household level.
Point (b) will be addressed through specific social studies aimed at assessing: (i) the potential
of micro-enterprise as providers of off-farm employment in rural areas; and (ii) the socio-
economic impact of LBWs on communities.
4.14         Reporting to IDA. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
government that: (a) the consolidated work prograrn, budget and financing plan for all project
components will be submitted to IDA for review and approval no later than October 31 of
each year of project implementation (para. 7.1 (a)); and (b) a progress report including: (i)
the status of all project indicators and an analysis of the causes for the discrepancies between
these indicators and the targets set in the annual work programs; (ii) a general assessment of
the progress towards the achievement of the PNAS objectives and lessons learned during the
past year; (iii) the status of procurement for all IDA-financed activities; (iv) the status of
disbursement for each credit category and the situation of the special account; and (v) the
identification of the major implementation problems and proposed remedial actions will be
submitted to IDA for discussion no later than June 30 of each year of project implementation
(para. 7.1 (c)). The annual audit report will be submitted separately, as specified in para.
5. 11. IDA's supervision plan is summarized in Annex IX.
4.15         Mid-Term Implementation Review. After two years of project
implementation, the government and IDA (during a specific supervision mission) would carry
out a mid-term project implementation review. About three months before the date set for
this review, the government would recruit a team of independent consultants to carry out a
preliminary project implementation review under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. The
review would focus on certain areas, including: (a) the impact of PNAS activities on target
groups at the community level; (b) the relevance of the initial targeting (particularly for the
priority communes of the LBWs component) and the necessary changes; (c) the performance
of managerial arrangements (particularly of the BCP) and the quality of coordination among
all entities involved in PNAS implementation, including line ministries; (d) an assessment of
the sustainability of PNAS and recommendations for further development in its scope and
design, particularly with regard to the intehration of certain activities into the public or private
sectors; (e) an assessment of the adequacy of the PEP process in providing a social safety net;
and (t) a set of recommendations for the second phase of project implementation. The results
of the review would be discussed by a joint government and IDA team. Agreement would be
reached on the necessary changes and adjustment in PNAS scope and design. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the government that a mid-term implementation
review of the PNAS will be carried out no later than June 30, 1995 under terms of reference
acceptable to IDA (para. 7.1 (e)).
4.16         Project Completion Report. The government will be given the options of
either preparing part II of the project completion report or preparing an independent
evaluation. In any case, the project completion report will be put together within four months
of the credit closing date.

V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Erject Costs
5.1              The project will be Implemented over a four-year period. Total costs for the
proposed project are estimated at FRW 553 million (US$46.1 million equivalent). Base costs
are estimated at US$40.0 million equivalent contingencies amount to US$6.1 million
equivalent (14 percent of total project costs). In addition, taxes amount to US$2.3 million
and import duties to US$0.7 million. Foreign exchange costs account for US$15.7 million or
34 percent of total project costs. Project costs by category of expenditure are summarized in
table 5.1 below and details are provided in Annex X. Food accounts for 32 percent of base
costs, labor cost for the LBWs program accounts for 18 percent, operating costs account for
12 percent, tecinical assistance accounts for 12 percent and equipment for 10 percent of base
costs. These costs b-ve been estimated during the December 1991 appraisal mission.

5.2              Contingency Allowances. Physical contingencies have been calculated at 5
percent for equipment, vehicles, food and materials. The following price contingencies have
been included: (i) on foreign exchange expenditures 3.6 percent per annum throughout
project duration; and (ii) on local cost expenditures 5 percent in 1993 and 4 percent
thereafter.
5.3              Estimates for equipment, materials, technical assistance and vehicles are based
on previous experience with other IDA-financed projects, estimates for food were prepared by
WFP, estimates for equipment, materials and salaries for the labor intensive works component

were prepared by the government and verified against ILO standard equipment lists. Travel
allowances are based on the current government scale.
5.4            Project costs by component are shown in Table 5.2 below. The food aid
component accounts for 35 percent of base costs, labor-based works for 45 percent, percent,
support to micro-enterprises 8 percent, Social Surveys 4 percent, project management for 5
percent, and the PPF for 3 percent.

5.5            Recuffent Costs. The recurrent cost implications of the proposed operation
are significant. After four years of execution, the annual operating costs are estimated at
FRW 245 million (US$2 million equivalent). This would represent an increase of about 2.5
percent over the projected recurrent costs of the social sectors (health, education and
population). During project implementation, it is expected that a significant part of the
recurrent costs will be financed by donors (including IDA) for expenditures in foreign
exchange as well as local costs (through an unified counterpart fund, see para. 5.7). Large
donor contributions are justified by the fact that recurrent costs in the social sectors are in
essence investments in human capital and should be therefore considered as priority
investments which could be largely funded by external aid. If foreign aid was severed at
project completion (an unlikely event), a 2.5 percent increase in recurrent costs appears as
affordable. However, since the total budget will not increase in real terms, the government
would have to find the incremental funding from cuts in other sectors (such as military
expenditures or subsidies to public enterprises). The vehicle for programming and
implementing this exercise is the PEP review process established under the structural
adjustment program. As already mentioned, the annual review of the social sector public
expenditure program is a covenant of the credit for this operation. During these reviews the
allocations for Health, Education, Population and the PNAS would be agreed upon with the
government and their execution monitored as part of the overall supervision of the PNAS.
5.6           EPject Sustainability. Providing adequate funding to the PNAS should not
preclude the government and external agencies to explore options for a lesser dependency on
either public funding or foreign aid and maximum efficiency of the program. The most
promising approach is the involvement of local communities and beneficiaries in the
operation. This approach would apply to the LBWs and the Micro-enterprise components, for
which communities are expected to develop a sense of ownership over the proposed actions
through their contributions either in labor or cash. However, beneficiary participation should



- 32 -
through their contributions either in labor or cash. However, beneficiary participation should
be kept equitable, in order to avoid disincentive effects for the poorest ponulation groups. In
this perspective, the communes could play an important role, particularly because they will
participate in these activities through initial contributions (either in cash or labor, depending
upon their poverty level). This approach tends to avoid an excessive dependency on public
assistance and welfare-type programs that run the risk to expend beyond the means of
countries as poor as Rwanda's. To find the right balance between central government
support, community-based programs (including local governments) and facilitation of private
initiatives is likely to be the key factor for the effectiveness and sustainability of this
cperation. On the long run, sustained economic growth with equity will be a major factor for
reducing poverty and food insecurity. In this perspective, it is expected that the joint benefits
of economic adjustments, sectoral investments and population control activities will help
reduce the need for and the scope of poverty alleviation ac:ivities. Another important aspect
of the PNAS which would be reviewed during project implementation is the efficiency of the
various activities. It is difficult at this stage to assess the unit cost of assisting individuals
from various target groups, and to identify the most efficient ways for clelivering the package
of social activities. On the basis of permanent monitoring and analysis, certain strategic
options will emerge and lead to the definition of the most cost-effective ways of reaching the
poor. These options will be formally assessed during the mid-term implementation review.
B. Financing
5.7            Of the total project costs of US$46.1 million, IDA is expected to finance
US$19.1 million (41 percent of total project costs). UNDP is expected to contribute
US$3.1 million (8 percent of total project costs) for technical assistance. WFP has committed
US$15.9 million (34 percent of total project costs) for food. The government is expected to
contribute US$8.0 million (17 percent of total project costs). Part of this contribution will be
covered by a unified counterpart fund: in the context of the Public Expenditure Review, the
government and the donors involved have agreed to constitute an unified common counterpart
fund (Fonds Commun de Contrepartie? from resources related to program food aid, sectoral
programs in kind and balance-of-payments support. The funds will be deposited into a
common fund managed by the Treasury, to be used to finance priority civilian expenditures,
including those relative to the safety net. In addition, the government will ensure that import
duties and taxes are covered for an amount estimated at US$2.98 million. The financing plan
by disbursement category is summarized in Table 5.3 below.

5.9    Category 5 (incremental operating costs) of para. 5.8 above includes incremental costs
for vehicle and equipment operation, maintenance and repair of the BCP, the three executing
units and the Directorate of Statistics (for the execution of the social surveys).
5.10       Contracts for goods and services or single purchases of less than US$20,000, and
all operating costs including local training will be submitted against statements of expenditure
(SOE). All disbursements will be fully documented by the BCP in a manner that would be
acceptable to IDA. The SOEs and all records such as contracts, orders, invoices, and payroll
vouchers will be retained by the BCP who will be responsible for maintaining this information
in a uniform manner for inspection by supervision missions and reviewed by the annual audit.
The accountant within the BCP will be responsible for monitoring disbursements and
compiling the financial information obtained (on a quarterly basis) from the three executing
units and maintaining this information. He/she will be the primary liaison person between
IDA and the Borrower for all issues pertaining to disbursements under the project. It is
expected that the project will be completed by June 30, 1997 and the credit closing date will
be December 31, 1997. The estimated quarterly schedule of disbursement is in Annex XII.
5.11       Special Account and Project Account. To ensure that funds for this project are
readily available and to facilitate disbursement, an initial deposit of US$200,000 will be
advanced from the IDA credit to cover 3 months' anticipated operating expenditures. These
funds will be deposited in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. They will be managed by
the BCP. The financial manager and the accountant will be in charge of disbursements and
will be responsible for the management of this special account and will maintain all
documentation pertinent to this account. In addition, he/she will on a monthly basis provide
IDA with all necessary information and will be responsible for submitting applications for the
replenishment of this account. The government will also open in a financial institution a
project account to cover 3 months of government contributions in operating costs which will
be replenished quarterly. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the government



- 34 -
that the establishment of a project account in a financial institution with an initial deposit of
US$450,000 equivalent will be a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 7.2 (d)).
S.12      Accounting. Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The BCP will
establish and maintain project-related accounts and will be responsible for compiling and then
consolidating the necessary accounting documents. Such accounts shall be maintained in
accordance with sound and locally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory
to the Bank. The BCP will provide quarterly and annual financial statements to reflect the
financial performance and position of the project. An auditor's opinion and report satisfactory
to the Bank on such statements will be provided within six months of the close of the fiscal
year. The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a basis
for loan disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. The foregoing accounting,
financial reporting and auditing arrangements should provide adequate and timely information
to the Bank for supervision of the project.
5.13      As part of the TA project (see para. 4.7), a financial manager will assist the
BCP's accountant in carrying out his/her tasks. In addition, in order to have an accounting
system fiuly operational at the time of credit effectiveness, an accounting firm will be
recruited under PPF to design an effective computerized accounting system for the PNAS.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the government that the proposed
accounting system has been found acceptable by IDA prior to credit effectiveness (para. 7.2
(e)).

5.15               The main objective of this project is to alleviate poverty by responding as
rapidly as possible to the most basic needs of the poorest population groups (primarily their
food security) and to transfer cash so that these people can purchase basic commodities. In
view of these concerns, procurement methods have been adapted.

5.16           Civil Wrk. Civil works undertaken under the PNAS include: (a) communal
road rehabilitation (unit cost US$13,000 per Km); (b) reforestation (US$300 per acre); (c)
agricultural terracing (US$1,000 per acre); (d) rural water supply (US$10,000 per
connection); and (e) commune-based infrastructures such as markets (US$50,0040). In order
to respond to the social objectives of the proposed operation, the works will: (a) bD distributed
among the 43 poorest communes in the country; (b) be labor-intensive in order to employ as
many workers as possible; and (c) be implemented to the greatest extent by small and medium
enterprises and NGOs. Consequently, ICB is not considered an efficient option for
contracting these works because they are small, labor-based (as opposed to equipment
intensive) and scattered in remote areas. If LCB fails to produce adequate competition
because of non-availability of competent contractors for certain types of works, negotiated
contracts with NGOs may be used. When negotiated contracts will be used: (a) costing will
be done on a commercial basis; (b) standard unit costs similar to those used for contractors
will be applied; and (' the works will be paid after completion and will be subject to the
same controls as contracts under LCB.
5.17           Contracts for LCB will range in size from US$20,000 to US$130,000 and the
total aggregate has been estimated at US$4.7 million. The size of negotiated contracts will
vary from US$20,000 to US$60,000 and the total aggregate has been estimated at US$4.3
million. Estimates for each type of works are summarized in Table 5.6 below. It is
anticipated that the bulk of negotiated contracts will be for reforestation (US$1.2 million)
because only a few contractors have the relevant expertise, whereas a number of local NGOs
are already involved in these activities.

5.18           God. Equipment to be used for the works, supplies, other equipment and
vehicles will be procured by ICB with an aggregate estimated at US$3.5 million. To the
extent possible, contracts wiUl be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$300,000 or more. Qualifying domestic suppliers would be given a 15 percent margin of

preference or the applicable import duty, whichever is lower. Contracts for mnaterials will
range in size from US$100,000 to US$300,000 and will be procured through LCB (because
contracts will be diverse in terms of size and types of goods) with an aggregate not to exceed
US$1.6 million. Furniture and office supplies will be procured through local shopping
procedures acceptable to IDA with a minimum of three price quotations. Contracts for
furniture and office supplies will average $15,000 with an aggregate not to exceed
US$100,000.
5.19         Expert Services, Studies and Training. For the technical assistance portion to
be financed by IDA (US$1.5 million), studies (US$100,000) and training (US$200,000),
consultants will be selected in accordance with World Bank Guidelines: Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (Washington, D.C.
August 1981). The additional technical assistance (US$3.2 million) will be financed by
UNDP.
5.20          periating Costs. Incremental operating costs, including maintenance supplies
and maintenance and operation of equipment and vehicles will be procured by local shopping
acceptable to IDA with a minimum of three quotations. Each contract will not exceed
US$ 100,000 with an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1 million.
5.21          intry Procurement Assessment. The last country procurement assessment
report was completed in June 1986. The borrower's procurement regulations are acceptable
for the methods of procurement proposed under the project. Competitive bidding advertised
locally has been reviewed by IDA and found acceptable, since these procedures include local
advertising, public opening of bids, specific criteria for evaluating the bids and award to the
lowest bidder. Foreign bidders who wish to participate will not be forbidden. LCB
documents will be reviewed by IDA prior to their release to bidders. In addition, to
encourage prompt action on ihe part of the Borrower, the submission to IDA 'Ior review and
approval of standard bidding documents for all types of procurement will be a condition of
credit effectiveness (para. 7.2 (f)).
5.22         Bank's Procurement Review. During project supervision, Bank-financed
works contracts above a threshold of US$100,000 will be subject to the Bank's prior review
procedures. In addition, during the first two years of project implementation all negotiated
civil works contracts will be subject to the Bank's prior review procedures. The review
process will cover about 70 percent of the total value of works procured through LCB.
Goods contracts or packages above US$100,000 will also be subject to prior review covering
about 80 percent of the total value of Bank-financed goods. Selective post review of awarded
contracts below the threshold levels will be carried out on about I in 4 works contracts and 1
in 10 goods contracts.
5.23         ProcurementMangement. The BCP will be responsible for overseeing all
administrative, managerial and financial aspects of the project including all procurement. The
BCP's National Coordinator and procurement specialist will attend a procurement course
under PPF financing. In addition, the procurement specialist will receive periodic short-term
technical assistance through the TA program (see para. 4.7). For each bidding documents,
technical specifications and quantities will be prepared by the relevant executing units.
Bidding documents will then be finalized and processed by the BCP.

5.25             Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)     prompt reporting of contract award information by the borrower;



- 39 -
(b)    comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank by the BCP and the
cellule HIMO indicating:
(i)   revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project,
including best estimates of allowances for
physical and price contingency;
(ii)   revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,
contract award, and completion time for individual contracts;
(iii)  compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of
procurement; and
(c) a completion report by the government within three months of the credit closing
date.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.1          In the short term, the proposed operation would provide support to the poorest
population groups. Immediate assistance would come in the form of: (a) food aid and
nutrition activities for the most destitute families and individuals; and (b) additional income
through access to LBWs for underemployed workers. The PNAS has also long term
objectives which are to: (a) monitor more accurately the status of poverty and its causes
through social surveys and initiate corrective actions in a timely fashion; (b) promote the use
of the most important asset of Rwanda, its labor force, through the demonstration of the
efficiency through labor-based techniques in civil works; and (c) gain some knowledge on the
potential for increasing off-farm employment opportunities through the micro-enterprise
promotion component. The PNAS will also give the opportunities to the communes to make
important development decisions. Finally, the PNAS would have an economic impact
through: (a) improvements in the communal road structure which will promote diversification
and specialization by improving the marketing infrastructure; (b) economic activities generated
by micro-enterprises; and (c) stimulation of local agricultural production as a result of local
food aid purchasing and increase in purchasing power induced by LBWs. These benefits are
difficult to quantify at this stage but an assessment of these will be included in the project
mid-term review. Component-specific benefits are described below.
6.2          Food Aid and Nutrition. The targeted food aid and nutrition activities
supported by WFP would directly benefit about 75,000 persons yearly, including children
under the age of 30 months, pregnant and lactating women, AIDS-afflicted families, and
orphans. The emergency food aid mechanisms (small emergency stock and relief fuid)
established under the PNAS would respond to immediate needs of the food insecure in case of
catastrophic events such as crop failure or severe loss in purchasing power. The development
of an adequate food aid policy would make program food aid more consistent with the
country's macroeconomic and agricultural policies.
6.3          Labor-Based Works. Almost 6 million person-days of employment would be
created. Approximately 600,000 individuals (assuming an average family size of six) would
benefit from this component over four years. Economic benefits would include road user cost



- 40 -
savings and production benefits in relation with road construction and maintenance as well as
increased agricultural production through agricultural terracing. The component would also
have a positive environmental impact with reforestation activities. Finally several policy and
institutional benefits are expected: the component should demonstrate the comparative
advantage of LBWs in the Rwandese context; the participation of private contractors and
NMOs would be encouraged and their capacities to implement this type of works strengthened.
The institutional capabilities of the communal administrations would be strengthened with
regard to the implementation of public works and maintenance of local infrastructures.
6.4          Micro-enterprise Promotion and Development. The direct beneficiaries of this
component would be about 1,500 entrepreneurs, their employees and related families (for a
total of approximately 30,000 persons). These benefits are quantitatively relatively limited as
compared with the two other components because the impact of this component is of a longer-
term nature. The PAIB is conceived as an experiment aimed at exploring ways and means for
expanding off-farm employment and improving the collaboration of NGOs and local
administratons in community-based development. Finally, an important indirect benefit of
the component would be the capacity building of selected NGOs involved in the program and
the expansion of the network of local leaders for the promotion of local initiatives.
6.5          Livying Standards and Poverty Monitoring. This component would allow
decision makers to better identify: (a) the target groups for social programs and the effects of
social policies on these groups; (b) the key determinants of welfare and welfare outcomes; and
(c) the social effects (positive or negative) of certain adjustment measures. The social surveys
and their analysis would represent an important policy-making tool for the years to come.
Risks
6.6          The major risk of this operation relates to possible delays in implementation
due to inadequate managerial performance. This risk is addressed as follows: (a) the PNAS
will be given an autonomous status vis-a-vis the Administration to avoid red tape and
bureaucratic hassle; (b) the central management unit (BCP) will be staffed with competent and
experienced staff (including three internationally-recruited technical assistants); (c) a UNDP-
supported technical assistance program will help to strengthen implementation capacities of
each executing agency. It is also expected that the involvement of private contractors and
NGOs in selected project activities will contribute to implementation performance. In
addition, the mid-term implementation review would help identify wealnesses in project
implementation and correct them. The other component-specific risks are summarized below.
6.7          Food Aid and Nutrition. The major risks are: (a) logistical problems for food
distribution; (b) ipterference of the administration in the food aid response (mostly for
political reasons) process; and (c) insufficient coordination among donors. The first risk will
be addressed by involving private contractors for both storage and transport of food. The
second risk will be minimized by the transparent managerial procedures of the PNAS.
Finally, the third risk will be addressed by the monitoring of the implementation of the food
aid charter.
6.8          Labor Intensive Works. In addition to the risk of implementation delay which
has been described above, the major risk of this component is its unsustainability in the long
run. The investment component of the program is relatively large and it is unlikely that the
government budget could absorb this level of funding if donor support decreases. This risk is



-41 -
addressed as follows: (a) the program is strictly targeted towards the poor, using a set of
criteria which should limit its expansion; (b) the component has been conceived with a
balance between welfare objectives and development objectives, the latter becoming more
predominant during the end of project implementation; and (c) the social justification of this
component (quick transfers to improve the entitlement situation of the poor) would be
revisited during the mid-term implementation review and at project completion, on the basis
of the evolution of poverty indicators.
6.9          Micro-enterprise Promotion and Development. The main risk is the potential
reluctance of certain NCOs to coordinate their activities in a sector of common interest
because of: (a) history of competition among NGOs for scarce resources; (b) some divergence
in development philosophy and approach among NGOs; and (c) concern about the autonomy
of participating NGOs. This risk is being addressed by further preparatory work carried out
under PPF by the PAIB unit. NGOs which have already expressed an interest in the program
are being contacted to: (a) discuss the purpose and strategies of the PAIB; (b) define in details
the role of participating NGOs; and (c) assess their institutional capabilities to participate in
the program. On the basis of this review, the PAIB staff will select participating NGOs and
will finalize a work program including action plans at the community level, credit modalities
and financing mechanisms fully consistent with ongoing activities of these NGOs.
6.10         Living Standards and Poverty Monitoring. The two main risks are: (a) delays
in execution; and (b) insufficient use of the data for policy development. The first risk would
be addressed by providing enough technical assistance and operational support to carry out
surveys and data analysis in a timely fashion. The second risk would be addressed by
supervision missions which will discuss findings of the surveys and organize seminars to
disseminate major policy developments.
VII. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1          During negotiations, a draft statement on human and social development
policy was finalized (para. 2.17) and, in addition, assurances were obtained from the
government that:
(a) the social sector PEP for the next three years and the consolidated work
program, budget and financing plan for all project components will be
submitted to IDA for review and approval no later than October 31 of each
year of project implementation (paras. 2.17 and 4.14);
(b) quarterly audit reports on actual non-salary expenditures of the ministries
of health (including spending on population activities), primary and secondary
education and planning (for social expenditures only) will be prepared by
independent auditors and will be submitted to IDA within 4 months following
the end of the quarter (para. 2.17);
(c) the implementation review of the social sector PEP for the past year and a
progress report including: (i) the status of all project indicators and an analysis
of the causes of discrepancies between these indicators and the targets set in
the annual work program; (ii) a general assessment of the progress towards
the achievement of the project objectives and lessons learned during the past
year; (iii) the status of procurement for all IDA-financed activities; (iv) the



-42 -
status of disbursement for each credit category and the situation of the special
account; and (v) the identification of the major implementation problems and
remedial actions - will be submitted to IDA for discussion no later than June
30 of each year of project implementation (paras. 2.17 and 4.14);
(d) key positions of tho BCP (Director, Financial manager and procurement
specialist), the heads of the three executing units (Cellule HIMO, Bureau
Executif PAIB and Bureau Executif PSAN) will be satisfactory to IDA at all
time during project implementation (para. 4.6); and
(e) a mid-term project implementation review will be carried out no later than
June 30, 1995 under terms of reference acceptable to IDA (para. 4.15).
7.2          The following would be Conditions of Credit Effectiveness:
(a) the approval by IDA of the 1993-95 public expenditure program in the
social sectors (para. 2.17);
(b) the approval by IDA of the training program for the LBWs component
(para. 3.23);
(c) the establishment of the Conseil de Coordination and the BCP and
selection and appointment of staff for all key positions of the BCP and the
cellule HIMO, including the four unit chiefs of the cellule (para. 4.6);
(d) the establishment of a project account in a financial institution with an
initial deposit of US$450,000 equivalent (para. 5.11);
(e) the proposed accounting system has been found acceptable by IDA (para.
5.13); and
(t) all the standard bidding documents have been found acceptable by IDA
(para. 5.21).
7.3          Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA credit to the Government of Rwanda of SDR 14.0 million (US$19.1
million equivalent), on standard IDA terms.

PUBLIC EXPENDITU EIMLICATIONS OF A SOCIAL SAF13ffNE
I.    Introduction and Background
1.    This annex presents the public expenditure implications of assuring a social safety net
during Rwanda's structural adjustment process. The objectives of a social safety net are to (a)
assure (or improve if necessary) essential social services including primary education, basic
health care and population control activities; and (b) provide targeted social programs to
respond to the most basic needs of the poorest population groups, particularly their food
security. Officially supported and financed targeted social programs in Rwanda constitute the
PNAS. While funding for objective (a) is expected to stay level or slightly increase as a share
of public spending the share of targeted social programs should decline once the benefits of
the various economic and sectoral adjustment programs (including the recently launched
population program) start reaching the poorer segments of the population. In February, 1991,
the IMP, the World Bank and the Government agreed on a recurrent budget designed to
protect basic social programs (in health, education and population) from the negative effects
of the cuts in public spending required by the adjustment program. However, as of the end of
August, 1991 these commitments have been ignored and critical non-personnel expenditures in
the social sectors, such as drugs, have been crowded out by the rapid growth of defense
expenditures. The health sector was the worst affected while the overall situation was better
in education because 90% of the education budget is for personnel but even here non-
personnel expenditures have been restricted. The situation improved somewhat by December,
1991 but in some cases the authority to spend (credits) was given too late for the technical
ministries to complete their purchases before the end of the fiscal year. The projections
presented here assume that the government will improve the management and allocation of
public funds.
2.    The estimates, which are in millions of Rwanda Francs in 1991 prices reflect the
expected inflation rates and the impact of Bank recommended revisions to the Government's
1992-94 public investment program (PIP). The recurrent budget estimates include the
estimated impact of the investment costs on recurrent outlays. These data can be used to
develop the 1992-94 public expenditure program in the social sectors after making appropriate
allowances for expected future inflation.
H.    General Characteristies Public Expenditures in the Social Sectors
3.    Compared to other sectors, the social services are more dependent on the recurrent
budget than on the investment budget and this may partly explain why they have borne the
brunt of budget cuts during economic adjustments. Investment spending is encouraged
because it is believed to stimulate growth. Rwanda faces constraints on its recurrent budget
because of the poor revenue situation which has been aggravated by the civil war and these
revenue constraints have been compounded by the increased defense spending needs brought
about by the same civil war. Consequently, the social sector ministries have been cut back to
within negotiated defilit limits.
4.    The budgetary distinction between investment and current spending may need to be
revisited in the case of the social sectors because current spending in the social sectors

ANNEX I
Page 2 of 6
represents investment in human capital which is an essential precondition for sustained
economic development. Salaries for teachers and doctors, purchase of pedagogic materials and
medicines are classified as recurrent expenditures in the budgetary sense while they represent
investments in the truest sense. Many donors, including the World Bank, have recognized
this and are more willing to fnance these expenditures on their projects but these are stop-gap
measures and the matter needs to be resolved fundamentally. While recognizing that such a
fundamental public finance question cannot be resolved during the Rwanda public expenditure
review (PER), this factor should be kept in view during the PER particularly considering that
significant reductions are being proposed in the recurrent budget along with increases for the
investment budget.

m.   Estimates of the Sodal Safety Net
5.     The estimates for 1990 reflect actual expenditures while the 1991 figure is a
projection based on trends in mid-December. The social safety net recurrent spending
projections for 1992 to 1994 have been developed by taking the following factors into
account: (a) provide sufficient financing for the social sectors to provide basic social services;
(b) adjust for the effect of devaluation on imported inputs such as essential drugs; (c) account
for domestic inflation in goods and services (no adjustment has been made for salaries of
public sector personnel as no increases are envisaged); and (d) adjust for the recurrent budget
requirements of investment projects presentiy in the pipeline as well as new projects
acceptable to the Bank. The social safety net investment spending requirements have been
developed in keeping with the overall sector development objectives developed by the Bank
and the Government. The sectoral breakdown follows administrative divisions to facilitate
budget allocation decisions. The estimates are summarized below.
A. Primary and Secondary Education
6.     The government has historically allocated significant resources to primary and
secondary education, and while there is room for qualitative improvement in primary
education, it has managed to keep up with the rapidly expanding school-age population but the
transition rate from primary to secondary has been falling. Furthermore, Bank studies indicate
that even in primary education, enrolment rates are likely to fall in the next ten years. The
Government is addressing some of these issues as part of a Bank-supported Sector adjustment
program. The budget requirements in table 2 below are estimated in keeping with this sector
adjustment program.

B. Health
7.     Despite public policy pronouncements that the government's goal in the health sector
is to improve primary health care for all, the bulk of the scarce public sector resources have
been going to curative services (and particularly hospitals) and preventive services have
suffered as a consequence of this misallocation. This bias has been reinforced in the long-run
by the inclusion of donor-financed hospitals in the public investment program.



- 47 -
ANNEX I
Page 4 of 6
8.     Bank knowledge of health sector financing issues has been deepened by a series of
studies (including primary data collection) which have found that: (a) drugs have been
severely underfinanced and major corrective financing increases are necessary; (b) personnel
shortages severely affect service delivery particularly in outlying rural centers; (c) preventive
services have been severely constrained by the shortage of funds; and (d) the government
investment program, which is dominated by hospitals, tends to reinforce the problem. The
proposed health sector expenditure requirements try to correct these imbalances in recurrent
expenditures and to incorporate Bank recommendations for investment expenditures. They do
not include King Faisal Hospital and should that facility be opened, another 500 million FRW
per year will be required in additional recurrent expenditures, putting further acute pressures
on an already underfinanced sector.
9.     The originally proposed 1992-94 Health Sector PIP was an improvement on the 1991-
93 PIP but it continued the bias towards curative services and the Bank recommended
eliminating a 400 million FRW grant financed project to convert two health centers into
hospitals. This is recommended not because Rwanda does not need more curative facilities but
the proposed operation is expected to require an additional 100 million FRW in operating
expenditures and those funds have higher priority uses.

10.   Expenditures in this sector, which is extremely critical for Rwanda, are expected to be
dominated by the IDA-financed Population Project. Government has to demonstrate its
commitment to this important sector by including sufficient counterpart funding in its budget.

E. Targeted Social Action Program (PNAS)
11.      To provide support for the poorest Rwandese until the benefits of the various
economic adjustment programs and the population control program  reach them  the
government has prepared PNAS (Programme National d'Action Sociale or PNAS). Even
though is expected to be mostly donor-financed, some contribution from the government is
needed. The cost structure of PNAS is given in the following table. The PIP needs to be
revised to reflect this project accurately.

IV.   Conclusion
12.   The core social sector expenditures will be reviewed each year both in preparing the
budgets and during execution. Management and resource constraint problems will be
identified and discussed with the government.
13.   In the context of the Public Expenditure Review, the government and the donors
involved have agreed to constitute an unified common counterpart fund (Ponds Commun de
Contrepartie) from resources related to program food aid, sectoral programs in kind, balance-
of-payments support and STABEX. The funds will be deposited into a common fund
managed by the Treasury, to be used to finance priority civilian expenditures, including those
relative to the safety net.

1.           This annex describes the project financed by the World Food Program (WFP)
in support to the National Social Action Program (Programme National d'Action Sociale
PNAS). This project (WFP RWA 4244) was approved by the WFP administrators in
December 1991. It will be implemented as part of the PNAS and in coordination with
nutrition activities supported by other agencies (UNICEF, IDA and WHO).
2.          In 1988, the caloric per capita availability in Rwanda was estimated at 1,786
Kcal or only 80 percent of the daily requirement. This figure is almost as low as those for
Ethiopia and Somalia where food insecurity has become widely visible through large scale
famines. Malnutrition is widespread: about 30 percent of under-fives are below international
standards for weight for age, 20 percent of newborns are underweight (below 2.5 Kgs) and
approximately 5 percent of children between the ages of 9 months and 30 months show signs
of severe malnutrition. In 1989, a famine situation broke out in the southern part of the
country with thousands of families in need of emergency food aid. Several hundred of people
might have died of hunger during this period. These facts are not new for Rwanda which has
a long history of food insecurity and periodic famines. During colonial times, the storage of
grain was mandatory at the community level. During famines, migration of workers to
Uganda and Zaire was the usual ways of coping with the situation.
3.           During the two decades following independence, food production kept pace
with population growth. The situation, however, has deteriorated in the recent past. The
population pressure is becoming unbearable in certain parts of the country: the average
population density has reached 400 per Km2 of arable lands. Farms are becoming too small
oess than 0.5 hectare) to make a living for large families. Underemployment is rising and the
purchasing power is diminishing. An increasing number of households are unable to acquire
even 80 percent of needed caloric intake despite allocating more than 70 percent of their
expenditures on food. The general economic situation of the country has worsened because of
its heavy dependence upon a single export - coffee - the price of which has dramatically
fallen in world markets. The country has now embarked into an adjustment process with the
Bretton Woods Institudions but no major economic growth is expected in the near future. The
economic recovery is made more difficult by the continuing military clashes with rebels
located in the southern part of Uganda.
4.           The severe AIDS epidemic is worsening the food security situation. In Kigali,
approximately 25 percent of the population in the age group 15-45 is seropositive. In rural
areas, where more than 93 percent of the population lives, seroprevalence is below 5 percent
for this age group but there is a risk that this figure increases rapidly because of the intensity
of exchanges between urban areas and the countryside. The number of seropositive
individuals is estimated at 50,000 people in urban areas and 150,000 in rural areas. AIDS is
becoming the leading cause of death in urban areas amoung young adults. These human
losses have a significant impact on the country's economy and food security situation because



- 51 -
ANNEX II
Page 2 of 5
the people who are dying are at their most productive ages. In AIDS-afflicted families it is
common to have both parents infected. As a result, the number of orpheans is increasing
rapidly, particularly in urban areas. Orphanage absorptive capacities distributed among
orphanages (1,100 children), institutions for handicapped (1,000 children) and centers for
street children (300 children) are becoming insufficient to cope with the incrreasing number of
children coming from AIDS-stricken households. Initially, extended families were taking care
of these children, but with the deteriorating economic situation families can ill afford to take
care of additional children.
5.           Rwanda is at a critical juncture: unsustainable population pressure,
deteriorating economic environment, difficult political transition towards multipart sm are all
interweaning factors which make a recovery process particularly arduous even with external
support.
Project ObJeetives
6.           General objectives. The general objectives of this project are to contribute to:
(a) the PNAS food security and poverty allevation strategy, with a focus on reducing
malnutrition among children of poor families; and (b) the National AIDS control program
with a focus on improving food security among AIDS-afflicted families and assisting orphans
to attend school. The project is not isolated but integrated into a national strategy supported
by several external agencies and several national NGOs. Food aid will be used both as a
direct transfer to food-insecure families and as a mean to reactivate nutrition and social
activities carried out by the network of nutrition centers.
7.           SDecific Qjectives. The project has three sets of specific objectives: (a) to
reduce malnutrition among children (between the ages of 9 and 30 months), pregnant women
and lactating mothers from poor families; (b) to provide food aid to AIDS victims and
families and cash for schooling; and (c) to provide supplementary feeding to orphans and cash
for schooling. Quantitative targets for each set of objectives are summarized in the table
below.

8.           Targeted food aid through nutrition centers. Rwanda has a network of 256
centers distributed over the country. About one third of these centers are run by religious
NGOs. Since 1984, nutrition center operations have been integrated into health center
activities. The international NGO Catholic Relief Service (CRS) provided food aid in support
to nutrition centers for twenty years (1963-83) until the government asked for a change in
approach (more targeted towards the rehabilitation of malnurished children). No agreement
was reached and the CRS started to withdraw in 1984. The government did not attempt to
take over and nutrition centers, deprived of food, lost rapidly a large share of their clients.
This has been a loss for both poor families who had access to additional food (or income,
because par of the donated food was sold on the marki>ts) and nutrition surveillance and
education. The WFP project will give an opportunity to the Ministry of Health to reactivate
nutrition center activities. The availability of food will be an incentive for poor families to
bring in their children. Nutrition surveillance and nutrition education activities will be
organized in parallel to food aid distribution. Since there is a strong correlation between
poverty and malnutrition, it is expected that the most destitute families will benefit from these
activities.
9.           For the first year, the project will start with a limited number of centers
(around 50) selected on the basis of their operational capabilities. Operational criteria
include: (a) trained personnel with experience in nutrition activities; O) regular nutrition
surveillance activities; (c) regular session of nutrition education; (d) existence of a community
demonstration garden; (e) good knowlegd of the community the center serves; (f) good
functional relationship with the health center; and (g) adequate storage capabilities for food
aid. The program will be progressively extended as additional nutritional centers become
operational through a rehabilitation program carried out jointly by UNICEF and the IDA-
supported Family Health Project. WHO will provide technical advice to the program and
assist in its monitoring. An additional criterion for selecting new centers will be the level of
poverty of the population they serve.
10.          Three targets groups have been defined. The first group include children
between the ages of 9 months and 30 months, whose weight/age ratio is below the
international standard or who show clinical signs of malnutrition. Nutrition center staff will
be trained (or re-trained) in properly recording the weight/age ratio. Food rations will be
provided to the families of these children over a period of 90-180 days. The second group
includes pregnant women wha attend pre-natal clinics and are identified as at malnutrition risk
by health staff. They will receive food aid for about 6 months (since the time of the first pre-
natal visit). The third group includes lactating mothers whose newwborm weights less than
2.5 Kg and women identified as at malnutrition risk by medical staff. They will receive
assistance during 12 months.
11.          Support to AIDS-affected families. This component will be carried out by
CARITAS, a Catholic NGO with a vast experience in social programs in Rwanda, including
assistance to AIDS vicdms and food aid during famines. Beneficiaries wiUl be families with
AIDS patients. They will receive bi-montdly food rations distributed by CARITAS social
workers. The project will cover urban areas only, starting with Kigali. The criteria for



- 53 -
ANNEffX II
Page 4 of 5
selecting families have been established by CARITAS: (a) female-headed househholds where
the mother is too ill to work and does not have other sources of income; (b) families with two
AIDS-stricken parents; and (c) families who have lost both parents and are dependent upon
elder children. In addition to food aid, children from AIDS-affected families will receive an
allowance of FRW 4,500 to cover school fees and other school-related expenditures. This
financial support will also be managed by CAR1TAS.
12.           Su1rt to orohanages. The project will provide food aid to orphanages and
other institutions taking care of orphans. Food aid will be calculated on the basis of daily
rations to cover the needs of about 5,000 children each year. CARITAS will be responsible
for managing this component. This support should cover the demand created by AIDS and
the war situation.
Ouantitative and Oualitative Aspects of Food Aid
13.           Beans, maize and sorghum flour have been chosen on the basis of local food
habits. They are complemented with sugar, milkpowder and oil. WFP will: (a) provide
1,400 MT of milkpowder, 1,000 MT of oil and 700 MT of sugar from overseas; and (b)
make available about US$6 million for local purchasing of maize and sorghum, the equivalent
of 15,000 MT of maize and sorghum flour. In addition, WFP will import annually 2,000 MT
of wheat which will be monetized on the domestic market; the funds generated will be used
for local purchasing of beans and maize and sorghum flour. Local purchasing will be done
by tender and will be extended to neighboring countries if local production falls short of
needs.
14.           The daily allowances (in grams and nutritive values) for each category of
beneficiaries are summarized in the table below.

15.   The project will be Implemented as a component of the PNAS and will thus benefit
from its managerial and monitoring system described in the main text of this report. The
PNAS ccordinating office (BCP) will work in close collaboration with the WFP field office to
ensure effective distribution of food to nutrition centers through contracted private
transporteurs. The MINISANTE will be responsible for coordinating the training of nutrition
center staff and monitoring the impact of these activities. CARITAS will be responsible for
AIDS-related activities and the orphanage program. The WFP field office, in coordination
with the CATGA (Food aid coordinaton unit) will monitor the effect of wheat importation on
local markets to switch to local purchase in case of market glut for this commodity. An
assessment of project performance will be carried out as part of the PNAS mid-term
implementation review.

LABOR-BASED WORKS PROGRAM
I.    Background and Context
1.    Rwanda, as the most densely populated country in sub-saharan Africa, has a
comparative advantage in labor among the various factors of production. The country's
overall population pressures and the scarcity of off-farm employment have contributed to
increasing the proportion of the labor force which is unemployed or severely underemployed.
Recent events (war and political disturbances) which have disrupted modem sector economic
activity have also tended to aggravate an already serious unemployment and under-
employment situation. The proposed operation will help to address the problems of
unemployment and poverty by providing direct employment opportunities in the short run.
The long run objective of this component is to increase the country's institutional capacity,
particularly that of the private sector and the communes, to manage, plan and execute labor
based public works.
2.    The country's public works program, particularly road building, has remained more
or less equipment intensive even though the country's comparative advantage has been in
labor. Ten years ago a national labor based works program (Programme Special de Travaux
Publics a Haute Intensite de Main d'Ouevres or PSTP-HIMO) was started with technical
support from the International Labor Office ([LO) and financing from various donors
including the Netherlands, Italy and UNDP. The program was not accepted by the Ministry
of Public Works (MINITRAPE) and was attached to the Ministry of Interior (MININTER) on
the grounds that the program dealt primarily with communal roads which fell under the aegis
of MININTER. Despite signiticant achievements particularly in the Prefecture of Gitarama,
the PSTP-HIMO has remained a pilot program and has not been generalized due primarily to
its failure to integrate the private sector in the process.
3.    A study commissioned by the International Labor Office I/ to compare the costs and
benefits of labor based works (LBWs) with equipment intensive works (EIWs) found that the
LBWs program had several advantages in terms of cost, employment generation and reduced
imports. The principal negative effect found was reduced government revenues because of the
lesser use of imported goods which tend to be taxed relatively more heavily than unskilled
labor and locally produced implements. These results of the ILO program provide
justification for increasing LBWs though this study needs to be followed up with more
research particularly in view of the fact that the Rwandese franc has been devalued and the
trade regime has also been changing.
4.    The reasons for the lack of generalization of LBWs in Rwanda in the light of its
advantages tend to be primarily institutional. MINITRAPE has been unwilling, for a variety
of reasons, to emphasize LBWs methods. Consultants involved in the preparation of detailed
designs and bidding documents have generally failed to take into account Rwanda's
comparative advantage in unskilled labor and have instead tended to use methods more
suitable for labor-short/capital-surplus countries. The most common rationale given for this

has been primarily that equipment intensive approaches are needed in order to assure certain
quality standards. Yet experience, of India, China and other labor surplus countries, shows
that with careful preparation of design and bidding documents, quality can be maintained even
wF i working on LBWs.
S.    The lack of enterprises with the capacity to do LBWs public works has been another
reason for not generalizing labor based works. PSTP/HIMO has failed in one aspect of its
objectives, which was to develop enterprises capable of undertaking LBWs type public works.
It has tended to work through force account rather than through enterprises. Any future
expansion of LBWs programs needs to involve work through private enterprises rather than
work by force account alone for two reasons: (a) by working through enterprises, the private
sector capacity to execute LBWs would be expanded and these firms could then apply LBW
methods to projects outside the program; and (b) managerial constraints in the public sector
prevent expanding programs beyond the pilot phase. Force account works need to be limited
to that volume necessary to train entrepreneurs and their workers (chantiers de formations).
t-he training for entrepreneurs needs to emphasize managerial training as well as technical
!ssues as management skills are significantly more important for LBWs than for ElWs.
6.    The labor based approach is also suited for forestry, anti-erosion and other rural
infrastructure (such as markets). Urban solid waste management and sanitation can also be
undertaken.
1x.    Obiectives and Scope of the Proposed LBWs Proa
7.    The Social Action Program has been designed as a means to assist the food insecure
and other vulnerable segments in the short to medium run before the expected benefits from
the Structural Adjustment Program reach them. Nevertheless, it has been decided from the
beginning that the activities undertaken would be development rather than relief oriented.
Another long run objective is to develop the capacity of the communes to plan, develop and
maintain local infrastructure. Therefore the LBWs component has the following objectives:
a.    create employment particularly for unskilled labor;
b.    devolve control of the day to day implementation of public works away from
the center to as decentralized a level as possible;
c.    develop private enterprises capable of performing LBWs type works;
d.    train engineering consulting firms in country in preparing LBWs type designs
and bidding documents;
e.    contract to local firms after training in LBWs through competitive bidding to
consolidate their development; 2/
f.    support a LBWs road maintenance program, and

g.    protect Rwanda's environment through a forestry sub-component and an anti-
erosion sub-component.
8.    To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the project would carry out the following:
a.    train local construction firms and engineering consulting firms in LBWs;
b.    rehabilitate and maintain communal roads over a four-year period using the
LBWs approach. As far as possible, the works would be executed by private
firms selected through competitive bidding;
c.    finance reforestation, forest reconversion and maintenance of existing forests
using LBWs approach;
d.    support development of agricultural terraces according to the recommendations
and cautionary notes of Report of the National Commission on
Agriculturel/. and other soil conservation measures such as programs
against ravines;
e.    support the development of rural water supply using the LBWs approach
including the development of gravity based piped water and tapping springs to
conserve their flow so that their water is used effectively;
f.    finance the construction of rural markets and other physical infrastructure
identified as important to the commune;
g.    finance LBWs urban services and works in view of the rapid increase of the
urban unemployed.
9.    The LBWs program is initially proposed for forty three communes in five prefectures.
Initially fifty two communes were selected according to a composite index of vulnerability but
nine were dropped because the IDA-financed Transport project is expected to fund major
amounts of labor based works in those communes starting this year. The index is a composite
of three separate indices which are food aid index, index of people officially listed as destitute
and an index of labor surplus. Use of the last assures that LBWs do not compete with other
economically viable activities. The list of communes along-with proposed indicative
allocations are given in Table 3 of this annex. Field visits confirm that the targeted communes
are among the most vulnerable though it should be emphasized that once more reliable data
are available the list of communes may be revised. Once the data from the PNAS surveys are
available and more detailed results from the census are produced the list of communes and
their indicative allocations can be revised and modified following the mid-term review.
10.   The proposed LBWs will be executed by cash-for-work in preference to food-for-work
for the following reasons:

a.    preserve the dignity of the worker by valuing his/her contribution as a worker
on a LBWs site of equal worth to any other form of work;
b.    reinforce the sense of productive employment over welfare dependence; and
c.    cash-for-work is easier to manage than food-for-work.
Supporters of food-for-work argue that this approach assures that the income will be used as
food for the family and not for other purposes. This assumes that the poor workers have no
sense of judgement and responsibility and that they need to be told what to do. The evidence
gathered from surveying workers in the pilot program suggests otherwise. The data, however,
do show that women workers tend to use more of their income on food for the family and the
program will therefore give preference to women workers whenever possible.
III.   Project Management and Implementation Plan
A. Basic Principles
11.   The principal objectives behind the organization and implementation plan proposed for
this component are to: (a) keep the LBWs program independent enough of the central
administration to avoid implementation delays, (b) enhance communal administrative capacity
to plan and execute LBWs; and (c) use the coordination capacities of the prefectures and
technical ministries without increasing the delays inherent to the inclusion of additional
institutions. To achieve these objectives PSTP/HIMO will be renamed and completely
reorganized with its tasks transferred to a new agency, the Cellule HIMO. This agency would
be outside the administration and would have full power to procure goods and services
independent of government procurement rules subject only to regular audits. The PNAS
Coordinating Office (Bureau de Coordination du PNAS or BCP) will advance funds regularly
to the Cellule HIMO to finance the next six months of its work, after approving annual LBWs
program proposed by the latter. The communes will receive a budgetary allocation and define
their own priority action programs for the various sub-components with support from the
Cellule HIMO. With technical support from the Cellule HIMO, the communes will implement
LBWs by contracting SMEs and NGOs though during an initial training phase force account
may be used. The Cellule HIMO will be responsible for assuring that standards are met and
for the procurement of goods and services while the commune will be responsible for
organizing and assuring maintenance of LBWs.
12.   The BCP's responsibilities vis-a-vis the LBWs component will be to:
a. maintain liaison with external donors;
b. examine and approve annual work plans for Cellule HIMO;
c. advance funds to a special Cellule HIMO account covering the next six months of
LBWs; and

B. Structure. StaMng and Responsibilikies of Cellule HMO
13.   The Cellule HIMO will be an independent autonomous organization responsible for
assisting communes in executing LBWs reporting a Director, recruited for a fixed period and
assisted by appropriate staff and consultants. The Director will be recruited by the CDC
(Conseil de Coordination du PNAS) which will use local competitive bidding to identify
candidates. The selected candidate will need to be approved by IDA and at all times the
Director should be acceptable to IDA. The Director will be guided by a Committee of
Technical Advisers to be presided over by the Secretary General of the Ministry with
responsibility for Communal Development (at present MININTER) and including the
Secretary Generals of the Ministries having responsibility for public works, agriculture and
plan. It will also include the Director of PNAS, while the Director of the Cellule HIMO will
serve as a non-voting member-secretary of the Committee. The Committee will approve the
annual work-plan of the Cellule HIMO before it is submitted to PNAS for funding.
14.   Following an international recruitment effort for Rwandese professionals with a
proven track record in management, the Director will be recruited for a period of four years,
subject to his/her appointment being confirmed after the first year. The Director will be
assisted by a unit chief for administration and finance and three technical units chiefs for
roads, forestry and other LBWs. These units will be staffed in accordance with their work-
load. The three technical units will use short term consultants and their permanent staff
should not exceed four professionals for the roads unit and three professionals for each of the
other two units. While the specific LBWs remain the property and responsibility of the
communes, the technical units will be responsible for aspects of LBWs in their area of
specialty including inventory of LBWs, supporting communes in preparing their PICs (see
para. 15), technical advice on specific projects, preparation of bidding documents, supervising
the bidding process and supervising the execution of LBWs.
C. Preparation of Rolling Three Year Communal LBWs Investmnent Programs
15.   The Communes will prepare a three year rolling investment program (Programme
d'Investissements Communal or PIC) to establish their priorities for LBWs. As priorities are
expected to change from time to time, these PICs will be revised annually by the commune
and submitted to the Cellule HIMO every year on or before August 31 to allow their
incorporation into the annual work program to be submitted by the Cellule HIMO to the BCP.
16.   The PICs will be prepared by the communal administration in a three step process.
First, consultants recruited by the Cellule HIMO will prepare an exhaustive inventory
including preliminary cost estimates of all potential LBWs in the forty three target communes
by June 30 of each year 4/. These projects will then be compiled into lists by commune and
submitted to the communal administrations and concerned technical ministries. The technical
ministries will have until July 15 to comment after which date the communal councils will
vote on their priority three year rolling LBWs investment program in view of their indicative
4/Debilcd d exhave mvaitorien repeted duin the fit year. Pw  eqyeau tbe invenv   will be upded ta into

budgetary allocations. These PICs will be submitted to the Cellule HIMO by August 31 and
the Cellule HIMO will have until September 15 to request supplementary information.
Following this period, the Cellule HIMO will incorporate these PICs into their annual action
program for submission to the BCP before October 31.
17.   The inclusion of a project in a PIC does not necessary imply that it will be financed
even if all the projects add up to less than the indicative budget allocation for the commune.
Each project in the commune's FIC needs to be evaluated on its own merits following criteria
described in the next section. If the communal administration does not submit enough
acceptable projects to use up its Indicative budget allocation by the end of the third quarter,
the excess funds will be placed in a common pool available to all communes submitting
acceptable projects. In addition, when a commune subm s acceptable projects totalling more
than its allocation for the year, these additional acceptable projects will be placed in a pool of
projects for funding from the common pool following the end of the third quarter. Should the
total cost of acceptable projects eligible for common pool funding exceed the resources
available in the common pool, priority will be given according to an index that equally weighs
the communes poverty ranking and the labor intensiveness of the project.
18.   It may happen that a commune submits a project that uses up more than its allocation
for the year. If such a project is found to be relevant, the Cellule HIMO may authorize the
commune to borrow from its allocation for future years.
D. Project Selection Procedures
19.   Projects included in the PICs are not automatically approved for funding. The
commune needs to request financing for specific projects from the Cellule HIMO. These
projects will be approved if they satisfy the required cri.eria some of which apply to all
projects and some to specific types of projects. The first step in the process consists of
submitting a financing request from the communal administration to the Cellule HIMO which
will respond within a fixed number of days. The number of days for responding and the type
of response will depend on the type of LBWs and the estimated cost of the proposed project.
Annex m, Table 1 shows the type of response and the number of days that the Cellule HIMO
can take for the response. To facilitate rapid responses projects under $40,000 dollars can be
approved by the Chief of the responsible technical unit following discussions with the
Director. Projects in excess of $40,000 will be reviewed by a committee headed by the
Director and including the four unit chiefs 5/. In addition, during the first three years only,
the chief of the ILO technical assistance team will also be on the committee. The projects
will have to meet the selection criteria described below.
1. Selection Criteria Applicable to all Projects
20.   Selection criteria include general criteria applicable to all types of projects and also
criteria specific to each type of project. All projects, with some specific exceptions 6/,

must be included in the three year rolling PIC to be eligible for funding. Projects which have
already been funded by other sources will be rejected. The objective of the LBWs program is
not only to support productive projects but also to generate employment a minimum
percentage of the project cost must be labor costs. Projects whose labor costs fall below the
minimum will be rejected. These minimum labor cost percentages will vary by project type
and the standards to be used in project selection are given in Annex IH, Table 2.

2. Additional Selection Criteria for Road Projects
21.    Communal road rehabilitation will be financed only if the cost of rehabilitation per
person in the zone of influence 2/ of the proposed road does not exceed a fixed maximum.
This maximum cost per person has been established to allow an implicit economic rate of
return of 10%. As the benefits to rehabilitation depend on the pre-rehabilitation condition of
the road, three different levels of maximum cost per person have been established. The
maximum cost per person in zone of influence 8/, when the road is accessible only by four
wheel drive vehicles and only in the dry season, has been set at $18. If the road is accessible
by four wheel drives year round and ordinary vehicles in the dry season, the maximum
allowable cost is set at $12/person in the zone of influence. Finally, if the road is
occasionaUy blocked to ordinary vehicles from time to time during the rainy season, the
maximum cost per person is set at $7.

22.   Before road rehabilitation projects in the commune can be financed, the communal
administration must agree to create a road maintenance fund which will receive 20% of all
increases in the commune's revenues starting from the beginning of the project. Furthermore,
the commune will agree either to recruit, or to name one of their existing staff, a Chief
Linkman (Chef Cantonnier) who will be paid by the commune and will be responsible for all
road maintenance in the commune. The Chief Linkman will be trained by the Cellule HIMO.
The communal authorities can also request the Cellule HIMO to finance some additional
linkmen (cantonniers) to be paid out of project funds on the understanding that these linkmen
will eventually be recruited by the communes on their resources once the maintenance fund
reaches an adequate level.
3. Additional Selection Criteria for Forestry Projects
23.   Forestry projects will be subject to the following conditions:
a.    they should not replace existing natural forests; and
b.    they should not rely exclusively on rapidly growing imported species such as
pines or eucalyptus but use native species, particularly fruit trees, to the
maximum extent possible.
24.   Before forestry projects are financed the communal administration must agree to set
up a forestry fund to be financed out of the revenues generated by forestry activities and to
avoid over-exploitation of planted and natural forests in the commune. It is expected that the
forestry fund will start receiving revenues in about five to seven years just about the time that
PNAS is expected to be completed.
4. Additional Selection Criteria for Anti-Erosion Projects
25.   Agriculture terraces will be financed subject to all involved property owners affected
agreeing on any reallocation of land that may become necessary and subject to the assurance
that necessary agriculture services such as extension, fertilizer and other inputs will be made
available by appropriate authorities. As the economic benefits to this type of works will
accrue to individual land-owners, public financiig for these projects (such as the LBWs
program) will be limited to demonstration projects only. The LBWs program will not finance
terracing on more than two hills per commune. No specific criteria (apart from minimum
labor use percentage) have been established for ravine control and other anti-erosion projects
and they will be financed as long as they meet general selection criteria.
5. Additional Selection Criteria for Water Supply Projects
26.   Water supply projects will be financed as long as the cost per beneficiary does not
exceed $40 and a water users committee is set up to assure maintenance. The maximum cost
par beneficiary can be exceeded only if it can be adequately demonstrated that clean water
cannot be provided in that area at a lower cost and that water supply is a significant
community problem. The latter can be demonstrated by showing that a large amount of time
and effort is spent fetching water.

ANNEX III
Page 11 of 18
6. Additional Selection Criteria for Rural Markets
27.   Rural market projects will be financed subject to the following conditions (a) no other
markets exist within the zone of influence of the proposed market; (b) priority to
rehabilitation of existing markets rather than construction of brand new ones; and (c) evidence
that a viable system to manage and maintain the market will be set up. Markets are important
sources of revenues for the communal authorities and they must demonstrate their
commitment to the market by agreeing to set aside a pre-set percentage of revenues from the
market for its management and maintenance. These funds will be managed by a market
management committee which will include sellers and buyers at the market.
7. Additional Selection Criteria for Other Communal Infrastructure
28.   Other communal infrastructure could be financed as long as they meet the general
requirements and the communal authorities are willing to provide 50% of the construction
costs either from their own resources or from user charges paid by the direct beneficiaries.
The other major condition is that labor costs must amount to 45% of total costs.
=. Additional Selection Criteria for Urban Services
29.   Urban services projects will be financed if they meet the minimum labor use threshold
of 50%. Priority will be given to projects in poorer localities and those using higher
proportions of iabor. In case of construction of new infrastructure, suitable assurances
regarding future maintenance will be necessary.
E. Selection and Managemet of Contractors for Executing LBWs
30.   Contractors will be short-listed based on the following criteria: (a) willingness and
ability to do LBWs; (b) demonstrated management and technical skills; and (c) familiarity
with the area. Proof of the first two could be based upon examining past-experience or by
participating in training programs which will be organized by the Cellule HIMO in each of
the five prefectures where the target communes are located, starting during the pre-project
period.
31.   Training for existing and new firms in labor based methods will cover labor
management, financial management and technical skills. The training will be started soon after
appraisal and all firms interested in bidding for the LBWs will need to participate or provide
other evidence of their previous experience in executing LBWs. Newly trained firms with no
previous experience may initially be limited to simpler works such as routine road
maintenance and once they have demonstrated their competence they will become eligible for
all types of works. Following the training period, newly trained firms may be given sole
source contracts to execute under close supervision of the trainer. If they successfully execute
the contract, they will be given another contract which will not be supervised as closely. At
the successful conclusion "f the second contract, they will be included in the eligible list of
contractors.
32.   Eligible lists of contractors will be prepared and all eligible contractors will be
informed of up-coming bids. The bidding documents will specify methods of work and rental



- 66 -
ANNEX II
Page 12 of 18
rates to charged by the Cellule HIMO for heavier equipment 2/ should the contractor decide
to rent equipment from the Cellule. (Instead of renting, the contractors will also have the
option to purchase the equipment by making monthly payments which will include principal
and appropriate interest payments.) These payments could be made in cash up-front or as a
deduction from their payments (including appropriate interest charges at market rates). The
contractors will then be asked to submit bids using a single envelope and the lowest bidder
meeting all technical criteria will be selected. The bids will be opened in the presence of
representatives of the commune and the Cellule HIMO. If the lowest bid exceeds estimated
costs by more than 15%, the bidders could be asked to re-submit bids or the bidding could be
suspended while the estimated costs are re-examined.
33.   To encourage small enterprises bid-security will be kept small Oust enough to
discourage non-serious bids) and losing contractors will be refunded their security within a
week of bid selection. Furthermore, the contractors will be given advance payments
equivalent to 10% of the bid subject to bank guarantee and they will be allowed to submit
monthly invoices until the payments total 70% of the bid. The final payment will be made
after the work is approved and accepted separately by the commune and by the Cellule
HIMO. The acceptance decision must be taken within a month after completion and the final
payment should be made within two weeks after acceptance. In some cases the last 10% of
the payment will be paid only after a fixed period of maintenance established in the contract.
F. Supervision and Control of Contractors
34.   These will be the joint responsibility of the communal authorities and the Cellule
HIMO though the latter will be solely responsible for all technical decisions. The Cellule
HIMO could recruit short-term specialists responsible for supervising work-sites. As the
Bourgemestres (commune chief) are unlikely to have the time to follow LBWs in detail, the
communal authorities are expected to nominate a member of the communal development
council or a sector chief as coordinator for each type of LBWs (forests, roads etc.). In
addition to technical supervision, the Administration and Finance unit of the Cellule HIMO
may occasionally carry out financial supervision should that appear to be necessary in certain
cases.
IV. Summary Description of Proposed Project
A. Communral Roads
35.   Communal roads are the largest sub-component; it includes rehabilitation of roads,
rozl-related structures and maintaining existing and rehabilitated roads. The project objective
goes include developing the capacity of Rwanda's road construction industry in labor based
methods. The Cellule HIMO section responsible for roads will check these bidding documents
to assure that LBWs methods are proposed. Standards will be jointly agreed on by the
communal administration and the Cellule HIMO.

ANNEX III
Page '3 of 18
36.   Three types of forestry activities will be supported by the project. These include
reforestation, reconversion (improvement) of existing forests and maintenance of forests.
Forestry activities are particularly relevant to include in a LBWs component of a Social
Action Program because of two important factors: (a) they are environmentally beneficial; (b)
they can be easily triggered to inject purchasing power into an area during emergencies such
as acute food insecurity. The priority forestry action program prepared by each communal
administration will be used as guidel,nes for intervention.
C. Soil Conservation
37.   Soil Conservation activities include agriculture terraces (terrasses radicales) and a
campaign to control hill-side ravines (lutte contre le ravinement). They will be implemanted
by the Cellule HIMO in collaboration with the communal administrations and local
community groups. However, for agriculture terraces, an important input is expected from
existing agriculture services or projects. The Cellule HIMO does not propose to include in its
staff any experts on agriculture terraces though the staff will include anti-erosion experts.
38.   The project proposes to finance about two hills per communal administration as these
works are conceived as demonstration projects. Any fiurther terracing with public funds was
not thought to be justifiable in view of the fact that the benefits will be accruing to private
individuals while costs of LBWs are being borne by the state. This sub-component also
includes control of ravines and other soil conservation activities. Priority will be defined by
the communal administration working closely with Cellule HIMO experts and local groups.
D. Rural Water Supply
39.   This component includes gravity based water supply lines. It also includes tapping of
springs in 20 communal administration. These works will be contracted out to NGOs such as
COFORWA working under the direction of the communal administration. Maintenance of
these works will be carried out by user associations.
E. Rural Markets and Other Communal Infrastructure
40.   Rural markets are of interest because not only do they provide a much needed public
facility but the market fees and taxes provide an important source of revenue for the
communal administration. Fifteen markets are expected to be financed under the program.
They will be managed by a committee set up by the communal administration and the costs of
maintenance will be paid for out of market receipts. The communal administration will keep
the profits.
41.   Similarly, other infrastructure of interest and importance to the communal
administration may be financed. The choice will be made by the communal administration
with technical support and approval from the Cellule HIMO. A key criterion for the approval
of any such investment will be assurance of resources to maintain and manage the structures.
G. Urban Services
42.   The LBWs program is expected to work with municipal authorities to provide
employment for the poor unemployed in urban services such as solid waste management and



- 68 -
ANNEX mH
Page 14 of 18
other services of public interest. The increasing population pressures on the land have led to
the spontaneous migration of surplus rural population to urban centers despite laws prohibiting
such movements. These restrictions are expected to be reduced in the near future increasing
urban population, unemployment and the population pressure on urban services. LBWs can
finance urban infrastructure (drains and roads in poor areas of the city) or urban services
(solid waste management). The works will be executed in accordance with a priority action
plan established by the concerned local government unit.
V.    Environmental Imgact and Mitigation Plan
43.   Labor based public works could have positive and negative environmental
consequences though the positive consequences are the more likely. This component includes
communal road rehabilitation & maintenance, anti-erosion measures, construction of
communal infrastructures and reforestation. The environmental effect is generally expected
to be positive if the actions proposed below are implemented. The risks concern preserving
top-soil, existing natural forests and diversity of tree species.
44.   The proposed actions to avoid environmental risks include reliance to the maximum
extent possible on labor based construction using medium-sized equipment only when there is
no other choice. No new roads are planned and only existing roads will be rehabilitated. The
agriculture terracing will be done on existing agriculture land and will be done on a pilot
demonstration basis. Care will be taken to remove the top soil first before terracing and then
replacing them on the terraces. Reforestation will be on treeless hillsides with little
agriculture potential and reforestation will attempt to include native species instead of
exclusive reliance on pines and eucalyptus.
VI.   Sustannabilitv. Benefits and Risks
A. SustainablkY
45.   The proposed program aims to create Rwandese private sector expertise in executing
LBWs. This expertise to be used in other infrastructure projects possibly reducing their costs
while at the same time increasing employment. Constructing public infrastructure through the
lower cost LBWs method implies a positive longer-run impact on the public exchequer. By
emphasizing execution through the private sector, the program avoids the potential danger of
creating a new class of public employees. Finally, since LBWs have a comparative advantage
in Rwanda, developing private 3ector capacity to execute LBWs is economically more
efficient.
B. Benefits
46.   Almost ten million person days of employment are expected to be created by the
component. Past practice in LBWs program has been to employ individual workers for an
average period of three months. This means an average income transfer of 11,500 FRW ($91)
to about 150.000 workers, assuming average family size of seven, over a million individuals
should benefit from the program over six years.
47.   Direct economic benefits are expected to be substantial. The benefits will consist of
road user costs savings as well production benefits for the road construction and maintenance

sub-component. The economic benefits to terracing is expected to be higher agriculture
output.
48.    Apart from economic benefits, the project will have a positive environmental impact.
This will be both direct and indirect. The terracing will reduce soil erosion and help restore
soil fertility. Other types of environmental activities such as reforestation are also included.
The indirect benefits emerge in moving to environmentally friendlier labor based road
construction and maintenance methods.
49.   The long-run impact of the project on institutional development is also important. An
important objective is to help create a capacity for labor based construction among Rwandese
contractors and strengthening local private firms involved in construction and consulting.
This will also help Rwanda move closer to using construction methods suited to its
comparative advantage. The project also aims to provide NGOs with the opportunity to
execute public works. Bank procurement rules permit some guarantee of contracts to suppliers
during a limited period following training. The small enterprises and NGOs trained under the
program will be granted this advantage as an incentive.
50.   Another important institutional development impact is expected in strengthening the
capacity of communes to plan and execute small scale public works. This will be
supplemented by the development of community groups within the commune responsible for
maintenance of infrastructure such as water supply and markets.
C. Riga
51.   The project may be subject to the following risks: (a) intensified civil strife may
threaten project implementation; (b) potential use of the project for political ends; (c) lack of
agreement on independence for Cellule HIMO may lead to procurement delays and other
implementation problems that have affected projects in Rwanda; (d) it may risk creating
dependence, unless the project development objectives are stressed over its social objectives;
and (e) unwillingness to continue with LBWs after the project is over. This last risk is
important because it could threaten the project's long term objective of fosteing a paradigm
shift in Rwanda's construction industry.
52.   These potential risks will be addressed as follows: (a) targeting strictly according to
poverty; (b) insisting on independent implementation; and (c) presenting the project as a
development cum social effort. The risk of political manipulation will be reduced by
targeting communes according to an objective index, while the risk of ethnic strife can be
reduced by targeting workers strictly according to poverty. Independent implementation is
expected to be the key issue to be taken up during appraisal and Bank support for the
program is likely to be contingent on it. To avoid the last two risks identified above, the
project has to be presented as a genuine development project which happens to create
employment opportuiities for the poor and not as a social assistance program.

MICRO-ENTERPRISE AND LOCAL INITIATIVE PROMOTION PROGRAM
Context
1.           The Programme d'appul aux inidatives de base (PAIB) follows from an
interest in creating awareness among the population of off-farm employment as a means to
make a living. Since the structural adjustment program is in place, greater attention has been
paid to encouraging local development initiatives and exploring opportunities for rural non-
agricultural employment. With the population predominantly rural, this policy has historically
concentrated on intensifying agricultural production and improving the quality of rural life.
However,\rapid population increase has served to reduce the size of individual land holdings,
and centralized development planning has not proved adequate to the task of understanding the
population's needs. Serious problems have been encountered in putting this policy into
practice:
(a)   absence of clear line ministry policy directives for support to grass-roots initiatives;
(b)   lack of coordination between national development policies and micro-enterprise
development (eg. public purchasing policy, import permit restrictions, foreign
currency control, fiscal and financial incentives);
(c)   lack of technical and financial resources among the 145 decentralized administrative
structures (communes) to plan and carry out development activities;
(d)   lack of coordination among aid agencies (multi-lateral, bi-lateral, NGOs, religious
groups), causing a waste of limited resources, duplication of efforts, and occasionally
contravening actions;
(e)   lack of specialization and insufficient technical/financial resources among local NGOs;
(f)   lack of effective means of communication between the population, on the one hand,
and donors, government, and NGOs on the other hand;
(g)   long tradition of agricultural work as a means to earn a living; this is not
about to change quickly.
2.           Donors and NGOs (both local and international) are interested in finding ways
to promote off-farm employment and grass-roots initiated development in rural areas. For
example, the EEC has an on-going project in the prefecture of Ruhengeri to respond to the
particular needs of rural collectives (collecivitds de base) and to involve them in all stages of
project activities. Switzerland has been supporting communal development in the prefecture
of Kibuye for 6 years. The Projet d'appui au developpement du secteur artisanal rural
(ADSAR), financed by France, has been creating small furniture workshops in rural areas
throughout the country. The Associaionfrancaise des volontaires du progras (AFVP) works
exclusively in the field of insdtutional strengthening of communal administrations. The
Organisation canadienne pour la solkdarite et le d6veloppement (OCSD) collaborates directly
with local NGOs to increase their professional competence and managerial capacity.
DUTERJMBERE, an affiliate of Womens' World Banking, concentrates its efforts in support
of women entrepreneurs through its Kigali office and 2 regional offices. The Association
rwandalse de dcveloppement lnt6gre (ARDI), also with 2 regional offices, encourages tech-
nical innovation and manages small credit funds for rural collectivities.

ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 7
3.           The Projet d'appul aux micro-rdalisatlons/micro-entreprlses, financed by
UNDP with technical assistance from ILO, has been particularly successful in building
awareness around non-agricultural employment and assisting micro-entrepreneurs. In the four
years of its operation, over 100 new micro-enterprises in rural areas (carpentry, mechanics,
sewing, welding, photography, food processing and baking, etc.) have found access to credit,
as well as training and counseling in management, commercialization, and production
techniques. At present, the project is intervening in four of the country's ten prefectures
(Kibuye, Butare, Kibungo, Ruhengeri). A grass-roots "network of agents" has been
established, comprised of dynamic farmers, popularly chosen community members, local
religious and secular NGO representatives, and communal employees. This network is
responsible for helping the population bring forth ideas for productive activities. The project
then provides the technical and financial assistance necessary to bring the most profitable of
the ideas to fruition. To date, approximately 4,000 requests have been received for study and
possible credit financing, with some 506 "network agents" operating in the four prefectures.
The reimbursement rate for financed projects is nearly 80%. These "network agents"
invariably encounter proposals which, though not suitable for development as private
enterprises, nevertheless would provide some socially valuable service. These propositions
are currently channeled to other funding agencies, however it is difficult to obtain fundings
since these interventions are small and scattered throughout the country.
4.           The traditional banking system has not been an appropriate mechanism to
finance micro-enterprises. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Industry in 1990 revealed
that only 10% of micro-entrepreneurs contacted had benefited from a traditional bank loan.
Nevertheless, banks have on occasion attempted to put in place special loan procedures for dce
sector. Beginning in 1986, the Banques Populaires (BP) promoted a loan system targeted
towards the craftsmens' associations (KORA). This system featured simplified approval
procedures and promoted the notion of loans to groups rather than to individuals as a means
to assure repayment. The results have not been positive due to the fact that guarantees
required to obtain loans were high (twice 4' e size of the loan), and that banks wert very
cautious in granting loans to what they conbJered a high-risk group. The program has been
discontinued. Duterimbere is in the process of negotiating an understanding with the Banques
Populaires involving a guarantee fund to facilitate access to credit for its members and clients.
The UNDP/ILO project mentioned above has negotiated a similar agreement with the Banque
Rwandaise de Ddveloppement (BRD).
Objecti'ves
5.           The specific objective of this program, the Programme d'appui aux initiatves
de base (PAIB), is to foster the creation of profitable, employment generating micro-
enterprises on a national scale. To achieve this objective, the PAIB will improve the
resources and services necessary for the sector and rationalize their delivery to potential
micro-entrepreneurs. Concretely, the program will strengthen the existing "grass-roots
network" of the UNDP/ILO project (e.g. NGOs local projects, communal authorities,
community representatives), broaden its mandate and membership, and expand it to 10
prefectures within three years. In addition, competent and experienced NGOs will be
reinforced and assisted to play a key role in the field implementation of the program and in
the elivery of training and service to micro-entrepreneurs. Financial resources will be made
availabie to individuals and groups through financial institutions or through community-based



- 75 -
ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 7
savings and credit association. By these means, the PAIB will assist in materializing the best
ideas brought forth by the population to create new micro-enterprises and reinforce existing
ones.
Target Grou
6.            This program will have both direct and indirect beneficiaries. Direct
beneficiaries are of two types: (a) ambitious, dynamic entrepreneurial-type persons with good
ideas who will receive access to credit and personalized technical assistance appropriate to the
complexity of their proposition and the size of the credit necessary; and (b) local community
members who will benefit from the realization of small, socially productive projects. Indirect
beneficiaries are those NGOs who wish to collaborate in the PAIB and individuals at the
grass-roots level, recognized as dynamic and having some influence within their community,
who will receive a basic training appropriate to their role as front-line promoters of
economically profitable and/or socially productive ideas. They will receive specialized
training assistance, access to network resources, and financial incentives as sub-contractors for
technical assistance services.
7.            The focus of the PAIB is on the development of appropriate strategies,
techniques, and resources for encouraging the development of off-farm employment programs.
In this regard it should be considered as a pilot project, particularly in that it seeks to involve
NGOs in a national program to an extent never before attempted. In micro-enterprise
development, the accent will be placed on profitability and viability of the business, rather
than on the number of jobs created in the sbort-term. These factors make it not only difficult
but hazardous to set quantitative goals. Nevertheless, based on the UNDP/ILO project
results, the PAIB expects to train and mobilize approximately 1,265 local change agents, and
assist approximately 1,500 individuals and their families (some 50,000 persons) involved in
micro-enterprises. In addition, at least ten national or regional NGOs will benefit from PAIB
activities. An important aspect of the final preparatory phase of the PAIB will consist in the
development of appropriate indicators of project performance and impact. These should be of
both qualitative and quantitative nature; and should reflect not only the different categories of
beneficiaries, but also the evolution of the project's impact over time, from prefectures of
earliest intervention to prefectures of later intervention.
Description of Activities
8.            Creation of the decentralized networks. As previously defined, potential
"change agents' are those motivated individuals at the community level who are responsible
for creating awareness of the program among the target populations, soliciting productive
ideas, and assisting potential entrepreneurs and local groups to formalize their ideas for
productive activities. These agents will be volunteers but will receive training (promotion
techniques, basic entrepreneurship), materials and limited travel allowances. They are the key
element in a "bottom up" communication approach that will assure that program activities are
demand-driven. Network members will be continuously "on-site" as the direct link between
the target population and other participants in the PAIB (NGOs, development projects,
communal and prefectoral administrations, etc.). In each prefecture, the network wil relay
its collected prnposals to the anteimeprefectorale, the prefectoral coordinating unit (PCU),



- 76 -
ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 7
made up of decentralized project staff and representatives of NGOs and development projects
operating in the prefecture. These units will be responsible for processing the collected
productive proposals: pre-selection, feasibility study, and selection for credit funding (micro-
enterprises) or consideration for direct financing (communal initiatives).
9.            Creation of profitable micro-enterprises. The initial steps in this process
will be the creation of awareness and interest in non-agricultural employment opportunities
among the target groups. Potential or existing micro-entrepreneurs who could benefit from
the PAIB services, as well as potentially profitable micro-enterprise ideas, identified by the
network are transmitted to the PCU. Through its various mechanisms and entities, the PAIB
will provide a number of services for the micro-entrepreneur: (a) feasibility studies based on
the pre-selected micro-enterprise proposals; (b) preparation and presentation of selected
proposals for financing; (c) negotiations with financial institutions in order to fully utilize
existing lines of credit and the funds guaranteed by the banks; and (d) utilization of the line of
direct credit managed by the program if the intervention is very small. Micro-entrepreneurs
will benefit from training in management, accounting, commercialization, production
techniques and other relevant skills. A contract between the prefectoral coordinating units and
the NGOs for these and other support services will be negotiated (by consensus among the
sub-contracting NGO, the PAIB executive management unit [EMU], and the entrepreneur) as
an integral element of the credit financing, in order to assure that the services offered respond
appropriately to the client's defined needs. It is expected that the PAIB wi;l create an average
of 30 new micro-enterprises per prefecture per year, for a total of approximately 1,500
throughout the duration of the program. Examples of the types of micro-enterprises expected
to be created are carpentry/furniture-making, sculpture, welding/bicycle repair, leather work,
sewing, food processing and baking, automobile repair, small restaurants, photography shops,
and personal services.
10.           Capacity-building of NGOs. A number of competent and experienced NGOs
will be called upon to bring their knowledge and contacts to bear in identifying potential
entrepreneurs and profitable ideas for micro-enterprises, and in developing viable and
profitable micro-enterprises. Selected NGOs will be encouraged to define their fields of
particular expertise. EMU staff will negotiate specialized training packages with these NGOs
in order to improve their capacity to intervene effectively in the target sector. Thus prepared,
the NGOs will be eligible to sub-contract the provision of services to micro-entrepreneurs
assisted through the PAIB: technical assistance in the fields of management, accounting,
marketing, appropriate technology, commercialization. Regional representatives of these
NGOs who participate in the PCU will also be trained by staff from the executive
management unit in feasibility analysis, since they will be responsible for administration of
PAIB-managed direct credit funds and the recommendation of proposals to the central guar-
antee fund managed through financial institutions. It is expected that both the training offered
to NGO representatives and the sub-contracts for entrepreneur follow-up will function on a
partial cost-recovery basis whose terms should be defined during the preparatory phase of the
project. It will also be necessary during the preparatory phase to undertake an in-depth study
of all NGOs working in the target sector focusing on each NGO's objectives, long-term goals,
strengths, staffing, training, and experience.

Institutional Structure
11.          In order to achieve the proposed "bottom up' approach of maximum
participation by the target population in all stages of the PAIB, and in an effort to speed
reaction time and assure close monitoring of financed activities, it is intended to decentralize
decision-making to the limit allowed by sound management principles. The proposed
management structure of this component will preserve the strengths of the existing
UNDP/ILO project experience while reflecting the enlarged mandate and broader partnership
base of the PAIB. While maintaining the relationship with the Ministry of Youth and the
Associative Movement (MUEUMA) established through the existing UNDP/ILO project, the
PAIB will require considerable financial and administrative autonomy due to the highly decen-
tralized activities proposed and the necessary negotiations with a large number of intervenants.
12.          A technical unit responsible for network organization and feasibility analysis
training will be spun off from the UNDP/ILO project to the prefectord level. This unit will
participate with local NGO staff, development project representatives, and appropriate
prefectoral administrators in the PCU. (As many NGOs and projects are regional in scope,
the make-up of the PCU will vary from one prefecture to another.) In order to respect the
principle of maximum decentralization and quicker response time, the PCU will be respon-
sible for reviewing requests for credit assistance and financing, performing feasibility studies,
selecting the most viable projects, and directing micro-entrepreneur towards appropriate
financial institutions. These teams will be the links between the executive management unit,
on the one hand, and the NGOs, network agents, entrepreneurs and community groups, and
tocal government, on the other hand.
13.          The aforementioned executive management unit (EMU), composed of a
national Director, two national financial analysts, an international technical assistant (during
the first three years only), and a minimum of administrative support staff will be responsible
for: (a) liaising on a regular basis with the PNAS management unit for example for large
purchases of equipment among other things; (b) coordination among the diverse partners
(grass-roots entities, NGOs, local authorities, banks, Government); (c) representation of
funding agencies in credit guarantee fund management; (d) annual programming; (e) coordina-
tion with other PNAS components; and (f) monitoring and documentation of program
performance and impact. This entity will also administer the local initiatives fund, analyzing
proposals submitted by the PCU.
14.          To assure a forum for dialogue on sector policy and to ensure the full
participation of the major stakeholders, NGO representatives will join the EMU and
representatives of MUEUMA and the Ministry of Planning in a consultative body (PAIB Ad-
visory Council) responsible for advising the EMU on annual programming and overall
adherence to PAIB goals and orientations.
Fnacdng Mechanisms
15.          Potentially profitable micro-enterprises with credit needs over USS 1,000 and
to a maximum of USS 10,)00 will have access to the formal banking system. Both the
Banqw Rwandaise de De eloppement (BRD) and the Banques Popudaires (BP) have ex-
perience in approving loans to stimulate the creation of off-farm enterprise through guarantee



- 78 -
ANNEX IV
Page 6 of 7
fund mechanisms. From targeted donor contributions, the PAIB will deposit a total of US$
250,000 with these institutions in the form of loan guarantee funds. After completing a
feasibility and financial study of credit requests submitted from the PCU, the NGO "loan
sponsor" will forward loan requests to the EMU. Upon recommendation by the EMU (as
representative of the funding agencies and executive agency of the PAIB), and after their own
evaluation of the soundness of the proposal, collaborating financial institutions will finance
micro-entrepreneurs who lack necessary collateral for ordinary loans, with 40% of approved
credits assumed by the PAIB guarantee fund and 60% assumed by the financial institution.
While actual interest rates will be maintained below full market rates, a service surcharge
(percentage of loan amount or flat rate) will be added to the net loan amount to partially
defray follow-up expenses further instill the idea of payment for service value. As with the
direct credit fund, the particular sub-contracting NGO is responsible for loan reimbursement
monitoring and follow-up; the financial institution is responsible for guarantee fund admini-
stration; and the EMU is responsible for sub-contract monitoring.
16.          Smaller but profitable micro-enterprises will be directed towards community-
based savings and credits associations. This type of credit is geared towards extremely smniIl
entrepreneurs who are not in a position to obtain funds from a bank due to the limited size of
their activities, a lack of collateral, and a lack of credit history. Although no interest charges
will be applied to these loans, a 10% service charge will be added to the loan amount to
partially defray service costs and to acquaint entrepreneurs with the notion of credit as a
payment for financial service. The NGO who expects to be awarded the sub-contract for
support service, the "loan sponsor", should sponsor the loan request based on its analysis of
proposal technical and financial feasibility. The particular sub-contracting NGO is responsible
for loan reimbur. ment monitoring and follow-up; the EMU is responsible for sub-contract
negotiation and monitoring.
Benefits and Risks
17.          The direct beneficiaries of this component will be the approximately 1265
members of the grass-roots networks, and the approximately 1,500 individuals and their
families (some 50,000 persons) involved in micro-enterprises assisted. Although
quantitatively this component will have a more limited effect than Food Security and Labor-
Based Works, its impact should be seen in a more long-term. The PAIB should be seen as a
policy experiment aimed at developing the strategy, methodology, and capacity to effectively
promote off-farm entrepreneurship, and improving the collaboration of NGOs and local
administrations in community-based development. To this end, an important indirect benefit
of the component will be the institutional reinforcement of selected NGOs in their specialized
tasks of fostering the development of a dynamic, self-reliant pluralistic civil society.
18.          The greatest risk to this component is the possible refusal of NGOs to
coordinate their activities in a sector of common interest. A number of constraints must be
recognized and pro-active action taken during the preparatory phase to counteract them: (a) a
history of competition among NGOs for scarce resources; (b) increased donor uncertainty
about the most effective manner to support even long-standing NGO partners; (c) a lack of
clear mission statements and coherent organizational development strategies among NGOs;
and (d) the wide divergence in development philosophy and approach among NGOs. Every
effort must be made to protect the coherence of the PAIB without menacing the autonomy of

ANNEX IV
Page 7 of 7
participating NGOs. While the PAIB offers real incentives to NGOs, it will be necessary to
fully involve major NGOs in the final preraratory phase so as to assure that intervention
strategies, credit modalities, and financing mechanisms are acceptable as complements to
already existing NGO programs.
19.          Given that the PAIB is a Government-sponsored initiative, a concomitant risk
is that NGOs may refuse to collaborate with the various levels of government. It will be
necessary to assure the greatest autonomy possible to the EMU so that it is seen to be truly
responsive to the needs of its target populations.
20.          The risk of a lack of absorptive capacity among the NGOs will be limited by
the NGO survey carried out during the preparatory phase. The risk of a market glut for
potential enterprises is reduced by the provision of adequate feasibility studies of enterprise
propositions on a case-by-case basis, and the overall PAMB orientation toward profitability a--
sustainability (rather than short-term effects).
Relation with Other PNAS Components
21.          The PAIB can produce a multiplier effect for the direct injection of monies
through Labor-Based Works (LBW). The demand elasticity for products likely to be
produced by rural micro-enterprises is great (e.g. building materials, clothing, food).
Moreover, whatever personal savings which may be generated may be quickly put to
productive use if suitable micro-enterprise ideas are identified. Through the number and
nature of micro-enterprise ideas originating in LBW target communes, it will be possible to
gain at least a qualitative idea of the persistence, accumulation, and use of injected monies.
In this area, the PAIB may complement the Poverty Monitoring Component by revealing
consumption pattern changes as functions of disposable income growth.

LIVING STANDARDS SURVEYS AND POVERTY MONITOR1NG
Background and context
1.    The statistical apparatus in Rwanda was born with independence. During the last
twenty years, considerable progress has been made. But, despite this progress and because of
the disproportion between the vast needs and the modest means, the current demand for
statistical data is far from being satisfied, and planning and economic management still lack
statistical data.
2.    The main agency producing statistics is the General Statistical Office (GSO) at the
Ministry of Planning. Two other agencies share a role in statistics production: the
Department of Agricultural Statistics (DSA) at the Ministry of Agriculture and the National
Population Council (ONAPO). Other agencies also produce statistics for ministries or public
services, such as the Ministries of Health, Primary and Secondary Education, Industry,
Employment, and the Civil Service, as well as the Central Bank.
3.    The General Statistical Office (GSO) is responsible for producing economic statistics
mainly through various surveys on: price, enterprises, employment, budget and consumption,
and population censuses. The Office produces the national accounts, price index.es, vital
statistics, hotel statistics and enterprises statistics. They publish the national statistics
yearbooks, comprising all information on the country's economic activities (trading, imports,
exports, industrial production, finances -customs, dbt, banking). Unfortunately, as these
agencies are subject to numerous difficulties, the production of these statistics is irregular and
incomplete.
S.    The GSO is responsible for supervising the surveys carried out to promote and to
ensure consistency and to improve the general quality of all national data. However, the
internal coherence of the data gathering network is not effective: this affects the efficiency of
the production of statistics.
5.    The GSO consists of four divisions: Surveys and Methods (DSM), General Statistics,
National Accounts and Population Census. The DSM consists of services covering, Data
collection, Coding, Editing, Processing and Analysis.
6.    Since its creation, GSO has carried out surveys such as the Household Budget
Consumption Survey (ENBC, 1983-85), the Employment Survey (1989), and the Population
Census (19S1). Data produced with ENBC allowed production of the national accounts,
weights for the price index, households' expenditure, incomes composition, demographic
characteristics and health/nutrition indicators and production of a Poverty Profile.
7.    The level of quality and the frequency with which statistics documents are released
reveals the difficulties GSO faces. The last national accounts were released in 1990 for the



- 81 -
ANNEX V
Page 2 of 14
1988 accounting. The price index is produced only since January 1991. It is necessary to
update the household basket for computing the weights for the price index. Price data
collection is carried out regularly for all provinces but only the national index is currently
produced. One consequence of this delay is that the Central Bank produces its own price
index for the capital city, Kigali.
8.    The results of a demographic survey carried out in 1981 were not released until 1986,
due to financial difficulties. A survey on employment was carried out in 1989 on a sample of
15,000 households, covering three areas: training, education and employment. However the
survey is experiencing difficulties with the analysis and delays in the release of the results. In
1991, GSO executed a survey on training and employment matching in several ministries and
private firms at the employers and employees levels. The results are being processed.
9.    GSO has received assistance to carry out its survey program from various donors.
The major donors for the ENBC were the French, USAID, and the World Bank. UNDP is
financing two consultants to set up the enterprises file, to produce the price index and to
evaluate and improve the social sectors statistics. UNFPA has also provided assistance for the
1978 and 1991 censuses and for a demographic survey in 1981. Other bilateral donors as
well as UNDP are participating in the funding of the 1991 census.
10.   In general, GSO's numerous problems (a part from funding) are mostly due to lack of
flexibility and autonomy for recruiting personnel. Staff's capacity is often low and the lack of
means to improve their capacity through training, as to provid them with adequate equipment
for data processing and analysis, limits improvement. These problems are being partly
addressed by means of the census and the situation will be improved with the installation of a
computer network.
11.   In summary, GSO does not have the means to fulfill its mandate of coordinator and
controller of the production of the whole statistical apparatus.
12.   The two other major producers, DSA and ONAPO, have been successful with a work
program supported heavily by donors since the 1980s. DSA has produced an impressive list
of publications from a yearly agricultural survey which started in 1984 on a sample of 1,500
rural households. The development of DSA staff's analytical capacity was well demonstrated
by the project. The publications cover subjects like: women's role in the Rwandese
agriculture, use of fertilizers, employment in rural areas, coffee, land ownership and
parcelling out, households' food security and nutrition (boarder trade, potentiality for goats-
farming). The last results were released in 1989; the 1990 results have been delayed because
of the 1990 events. This survey should give information on the rural households' accounts
for updating macroeconomic indicators for the rural areas.
13.   ONAPO's activities are set up in the framework of the population policy and consist
of analyzing data produced by different sources, and producing socio-demographic data. A
Health and Population Survey was interrupted by the events of 1991. ONAPO also carries
out an important study program related to population and health issues.

14.   Most of the Government's statisticians come from local training institutes like the
"Centre de Formation des Adjoints Techniques" and the 'Institut Africain et Malgache de
Statistigues et d'Economie Anpliguees", for intermediary and high level statistician and
economists respectively. Nowadays, these institutes face serious difficulties of financing and
because the level of registration is decreasing as a consequence of the economic difficulties of
the funding partner countries.
15.   For elaborating and implementing economic policies, it is imperative to have adequate
statistical information. If these policies could have transitory effects on some groups of the
popy.lation, it is necessary to identify such groups and to determine the period (and the degree
of ixatensity) for which they will be affected.
16.   It is critical for the government to produce macroeconomic indicators for evaluating
and monitoring the economic performance of the country. This calls for indicators which
measure inflation, tariffs, interest rates, taxes, producer and consumer prices, distribution of
public expenditure, employment characteristics, salary distribution and incomes for all sectors
(including the informal one) and households' consumption for all areas and categories.
17.   Despite GSO's efforts, end users of GSO's data acknowledge information gaps
revealed .uy the irregular frequency of publication of major macroeconomic indicators, their
incompleteness and the ~overage gaps in the statistical fields. The major negative elements
could be summarized as the incomplete coverage of some fields, the questionable quality of
available data, the weak comparativeness of different data sources and the low timeliness of
available data.
18.   Except for employment statistics, social statistics are relatively well collected, are
information rich, but have very little use. Statistics on education are regularly produced for
all levels, however, because of the little demand, their processing is tardy. Constraints for
the primary and secondary schooling statistics are partly due to the fact that computerized
processing is used only for publications. The education yearbooks, regularly produced, are of
good quality; however, more needs to be done on the cost of private and public education,
mainly at end of cycles, to study the education system returns and quantify the lacks of
personnel and equipment Statistics for higher level are worse. For the past two years, no
yearbook was produced because of the lack of administrative staff. Even though the data
exist, staff do not have the means or the time to process, publish and use them.
19.   Health statistics have benefited from external support, in particular from UNICEF.
The Ministry of Health's statistiW-ai service is equipped with microcomputers, laser printers
and portable microcomputers. Support received was extended to training of staff including
computer use. Data collection is done at the level of the regional health services.
Information is processed and verified on site before being sent to the national center.
However, there are quality problems due to incomplete coverage of the private health services
and of some public services. The coverage of certain types of information (ike external
consultations) is likely to be incomplete. Lack of supervision from the national center staff is
also reason for the poor quality of data. As for education, there is little use of the
information produced. Regional centers rarely use information gathered by their own service.
In fact, training of the staff in statistical and computer techniques is inadequate. In general,



- 83 -
ANNEX V
Page 4 of 14
the service lacks high level staff who could communicate at the level of the regional office
chiefs (doctors mainly), they also lack transport for supervision missions and the means to
implement the complementary health surveys that are needed.
20.   Employment statistics are scattered and in general incomplete. The "Direction de
l'Emploi' follows up positions in the Civil Service and therefore covers a restricted field.
Coverage of the "Caisse de Securite Sociale" is partial because registrations are also partial.
At the province level, staff are following employment registration, but private sector
employers often recruit directly and do not report to Social Security and to Employment.
GSO has undertaken to create an employment matrix to handle and organize information from
different sources. The work has already started but has had to stop for lack of adequat,
computer equipment.
Pro.ect Justification
21.   This review of the Rwandese statistical system shows that even though there is a
relatively important production of statistics in the couz-try, data currently produced or to be
produced in the near future do not satisfy the needs of information for monitoring the impact
of economic reform. Data collected at GSO or DSA are not based on samples large enough
to allow identification of regional socioeconomic groups or to produce indicators of their
characteristics.
22.   As a whole, the statistical apparatus needs to be strengthened. However, the
framework of this project is too narrow for such a large goal. The project as described in the
following chapter will focus on strengthening the production of statistics relevant to measuring
and monitoring households' living conditions. This has been identified as a priority within the
framework- of the Structural Adjustment Program and of the National Social Action Program
(PNAS). The data required to analyze the distributional consequences of a process of
structural adjustment are currently unavailable in Rwanda.
23.   While this project will produce integrated data at the level of the household as a
statistical unit, what is fundamental for causal analysis is that it will allow to identify and to
study the households' behavior. The proposed monitoring system calls for repeated data
collection over time, because adjustment is a dynamic process and its benefits and burdens are
diztributed over time. The changes currently affecting the Rwandese economy have different
employment and income consequences for different groups. A policy-oriented analysis of
these consequences implies a permanent economy-wide monitoring system.
24.   The project aims at developing coordination between producers and users of statistical
data to avoid waste of resources by: (i) developing activities of users groups; (ii) widely
disseminating project survey results and by makdng the project data accessible for sectoral
analysis; and (iii) integrating these results in designing and assessing policies.

25.   The project is located at GSO for the following reasons:
- GSO has the mandate to produce data for the country's nationwide planning;
- OSO has the largest capacity for implementing a national survey; and
- GSO is commissioned for coordinating and controlling all statistical work
performed in the country at the national level.
Description of the Living Standards and Poverty Monitoring Component
26.   Qbjet. To monitor the microeconomic and welfare impacts of the policy reform
underway with the structural adjustment program, the objective of the PNAS component for
Living Standards and Poverty Monitoring is to generate data on the evolution of key aspects
of welfare over time. To trace the evolution of selected determinants of welfare and welfare
outcomes, the project will pay particular attention to: ( ' the evolution of living standards
over time (consumption of food and other essentials, nutritional status, satisfaction of basic
needs, demand behavior in certain areas as health, schooling, and housing amenities); (b) the
identification of poor groups in need of targeted assistance to raise their income and
consumption potentialities; (c) the participation of different population groups in specified
sectors of activity and economic growth; and (d) personal reactions to, and the distribution of
benefits from, changes in relative incentives between sectors and lines of production as
induced by the process of structural adjustment.
3urve Progrm
27.   Tbree surveys will be undertaken during the four-year program: two priority surveys
(PS) and one integrated survey aS). These surveys will be accompanied by community
modules developed according to the needs.
28.   The Priority Survey is a rapid survey that can be used to diagnose the households'
socio-econom;c situation. The PS focuses on a set of selected indicators that will allow this
diagnosis and the classification of the households into socioeconomic groups. Tbis survey is
designed to produce only dependant variables. When repeated over time, it becomes a tool
for monitoring and measuring the evolution of the population's living standards.
29.   The sampe design is based on the necessity to represent the socioeconomic groups, to
allow follow-up of the variables of concern and to keep a tight timetable for the operations.
A computerized list of households from the 1991 housing census will be used as a sampling
frame. The sample characteristics will be fixed with a sampling expert's assistance. The
opportnity to draw a master sample for the three surveys will also be determined by him.
However since such a sample will be drawn from the final results of the census (not expected
before 1994), it might be premature to draw the master sample from the preliminary data. In
any case, as the PS will be carried out two years at least after the census, it will be necessary
to carry out a listing operation in order to update the census list.



- o5 -
ANNEX V
Page 6 of 14
30.   The PS sample will consist of a random selection of households. Enumeration areas
(EAs) will be drawn with probability proportional to the size of their population. To increase
the sample efficiency, the EAs will be classified in homogenous strata such as: major urban -
other urban - and rural according to agro-climatic zones. To avoid too much variation in the
EAs size, large EAs will be divided and smaller ones will be regrouped. Within these
segments, clusters of 8 to 20 households will be drawn. The size chosen for urban or rural
areas may differ. This size will be fixed by the sampling expert according to the stratas
homogeneity, the sample distribution and the needs for the selection of variables for the
questionnaire. The households will be selected with equal probability. Such a design
provides for a self-weighted national sample. It may be necessary to increase some groups
representation because they are too small or too scattered but their representation within the
sample is critical. It may also be necessary to identify Social Economic Groups (SEGs) at the
listing stage within the clusters to take these into account in the households selection. This
procedure will ensure a good representation of these groups in the sample.
31.   The size of the sample is fixed according to the number of SEGs to be represented in
the sample. For the sample to be efficient, each group should be represented by 500 to 600
households. Determination of the SEGs will be the responsibility of the sampling expert
using information to be gathered by GSO. Discussions held at GSO have defined the
following groups:
(a) Rural:
- farming wage-earners
- other wage-earners (private or public)
- farmers (independent)
- other non-wage-earners
(b) Urban:
- public sector wage-earners
- wage-earners in private sector and informal sector
- formal private sector wage-earners
- employers, traders (formal sector)
- unemployed
- others
32.   GSO will provide the sampling expert with all information for the final determination
of these groups.
33.   The strategy to be followed for repeating the survey over the years to monitor the
evolution of the SEGs and of the indicators will be dermined when designing the sample.
The options are: (a) use of a master sample, (b) use of a household panel to be followed up
dting the period, and (c) use of the same sample of households or of EAs. Each option has
its limitations and the date that the census fin results are expected also limits the possibility
of choice for the first PS.

ANNEX V
Page 7 of 14
34.   The questionnaire for the PS is used in a single visit to the household. During this
visit, the head of the household is interviewed for about one hour. Eventually the other
household members participate in the generation of their household incomes. The
questionnaire helps gather information on the household, as well as on the members.
35.   The questionnaire proposed by the World Bank was discussed in a workshop at GSO
and an adapted version was drafted to be presented and discussed within a national
commission, representing the country's major users of statistics.
36.   Ihe questionnaire consists of ten sections as follows 1/: household's identification;
list of household's members and their background characteristics (demography, education,
health and employment status); employment information for the head of the household and
other active members; housing, utilities, access to public services; work migrations;
description ani production of the household' s holdings; characteristics of the household's
non-farm enteiprises including activities during the past 12 months; household expenditure
(health, education, major frequent purchases); household's incomes by sources; household's
assets and; anthropometric measurements for children under 5 years old.
37.   Forms for the listing operation will be prepared using the sampling expert's
recommendations. The selection of the households will be drawn from this list. Manuals for
interviewers, supervisors and data entry clerks will be prepared by GSO with technical
assistance.
38.   Data Collection and Data Entr. The survey implementation is organized to ensure
timely release of the survey results. The system proposes the use of mobile teams attached to
a regional office. The regional offices are equipped with microcomputers where a data entry
clerk enters and checks the data as soon as they come from the field. The data entry program
also does structure, format and consistency checks. Proximity of the EAs allows for quick
checking of errors by returning to the households for correction. As GSO personnel has
practiced IMPS, the Bureau of the Census' software, GSO is willing to use this for the PS,
but other software such as RODEPC and DBASEII can be used.
39.   The data entry program should be prepared simultaneously with the questionnaire in
order to be tested together during a pilot survey. The purpose of this is to test and finalize
the design of the questionnaire, the data entry program and the survey organization. The field
staff is organized in teams of two to three interviewers with a data entry clerk, a driver and a
supervisor. The rolc of the supervisor is to organize the team's work and to ensure the
quality control and communication between his team and the survey central management team.
He is also responsible for carrying out the community survey when necessary. Senior staff at
SO will be responsible for managing data collection, programming and analysis. Their role
of executive supervision is crucial for data quality.
l/A full doecription of the IS metbodology and questionnaire exist in -The Social Dimeons of Adjustment
Priority Survey, Wodkng Paer No.12, Survey and Staics, World Bank 1990.

40.   As Rwanda is a small country with relatively good road conditions, it is possible to
have 10 to 12 survey teams (according to the final sample size) gathered on a reduced number
of regional offices. Each center may support two to three teams according to its position.
41.   The Integrated Survey. This survey is more complete than the PS. While the PS
gives only a broad description of the households' conditions, the IS seeks for explanations and
causes in order to better understand the cooping mechanisms used by the households to
integrate the structural adjustment effects and to explain how and why households react to
constraints and changes in the economic context. In a sense, the IS is complementary to the
PS. The IS lasts a full year in the field during which a smaller sample of households (3,000
average), is observed. Information is collected for each household on a monitored period of
one month and on retrospective periods of 3 or 12 months, for expenditure and incomes.
During the monitored period, the households are visited several times (two visits minimum) to
increase the quality of the information gathered.
42.   The saml is drawn the same way for the IS and the PS. It is possible that specific
groups will be more focused than others. The sample will he designed to ensure that 400 to
500 households are selected for each analytical field.
43.   The IS auestionnaire is applied in two rounds corresponding to the questionnaire's two
parts. The first concerns essentially information on the households' members while the
second part concentrate on the economic performance of the household. The advantage of the
multiple rounds is to cut off what would be otherwise a very tedious interview, and to provide
for delimitation of a reference period to monitor household expenditure The questionnaire
consists of 12 sections as follows:

contents will be adapted according to the PS results and the users committee
recommendations.
45.   Conununity Module and Survey. These modules aim to provide data at the
community level (prices, services) to complement the analysis of the household level data.
This will allow study of the meso-micro links. Such a module will be applied together with

the IS in the sampling localities. Respondents will be local authorities and people responsible
for public services. The module consists of three main sections:
(a) access and use of public services in the vicinity: markets, primary and
secondary schools, health centers, hospitals, public transport etc..);
(b) road infrastructure, electrification, potable water etc..;
(c) prices, which consist of collecting price information on a list of products
several times a day at different sale points in the locality.
46.   The PS module can be developed to include group-interviews of people of both sexes
and of different responsibilities in the community. This survey will produce more detailed
information on the needs of the community, the level of satisfaction of the population using
the local services, op. the impediments faced by the population in using these services and the
difficulties of the personnel who run these services.

Institutional Framework
49.    SO at the Ministry of Planning will be responsible for executing this component.
The Director of the DSM will be the technical director for the surveys. Statisticians and
computer specialists in this department will be in charge of survey implementation.
50.   Funding will be channeled through the PNAS Management Unit (BCP), which will be
responsible for disbursement and for communicating with the donors.
51.   A Users Committee will be established to discuss the survey contents, determine
priority for statistics production in the PNAS context, oversee terms of reference for studies
to be carried out with the surveys data, ensure timely diffusion of the survey results as well as
ensuring that these are taken into account by the country's decisionmakers. This role could
be taken by the PNAS Monitoring Committee, or members of this committee could act as the
Users Committee. The participation of donors supporting social sectors activities or the
PNAS should be ensured.
Traini,g
52.   Field staff training programs will be carried out for each pilot and for the main
surveys. Interviewers, supervisors and data entry clerks will receive training adapted to their
responsibilities in the operation. Staff will be recruited or replaced on the basis of their
marks in the selection tests and on their observed aptitude to carry out the survey tasks.
53.   The GSO's senior staff, statisticians and computer specialists will be trained in survey
techniques in order to familiarize them with their responsibilities for organizing, supervising
the field work and the data processing and to carrying out the analysis.
54.   Complementary training will be given to the senior staff through local and regional
seminars and workshops on subjects such as sampling, data collection, data analysis and
computer science. The project also provides for long-term overseas training where some
senior staff, chosen for their ability, will receive complementary training on specific areas.
Details of the training program will be specified at an early stage of the project.
55.   GSO's senior staff will participate in seminars and workshops organized for the
African statisticians working on the Social Dimensions of Adjustment initiatives where they
will be able to benefit from and share other African countries' experience.
Technical Assistance
56.   The keys for the project success will be the motivation and qualification of the staff in
charge of implementation. The evaluation of the GSO's personnel has shown that senior staff
lack experience particularly in data analysis. The project provides funds for hiring a long-
term consultant for a two-year period. His role will be to assist GSO's personnel in launching
and executing the PS activities and for preparing the IS. He will support the Director of
Department of Survey and Methodology in organizing and managing the activities, and will



- 91 -
ANNEX V
Page 12 of 14
support the analysis of the PS. He will be responsible for training GSO's senior staff by
organizing training seminars and ensuring implementation of the training program.
57.   The project will provide for 9 man/months of international consultation for specific
training activities for the preparation of the sampling (lm/m), for computer programming (3
Wml), and for data analysis (5 W/m).
58.   The project provide for 30 mr/mr of local consultation. This concerns specifically
support for computer programming and data analysis and for publication of the results. This
will allow GSO to hire local experts from the University or IAMSEA (Institut Africain et
Malgache de Statistiques et d'Economie Appliquee) to support these activities and to provide
training to its staff.
Study Program. Seminars and Dissemination of Results
59.   Along with the project implementation, studies will be carried out at different stages
of the data production. This study program will start with the publication of the PS1 results.
A study program will be established with the support of consultants on the basis of the
"Analysis Plans for Understanding the Social Dimensions of Adjustment" 3/, and based on
the priorities fixed by the Users Committee. It will be preferable for the study program to be
animated by the planning divisions at the Ministry of Planning because these divisions would
be the best judges of adequacy to ensure full integration into policy design and policy
implementation. The analysis of the data collected in the project context will logically follow
the different axies of the social dimensions of adjustment and development. Generally there
are two axies: the market used by the different SEGs, and satisfaction of basic needs. As
constraints differ for men and women, it is suggested that the analysis on these axies be
conducted separately. In general terms, the elements for an analysis approach will include the
following:
1. Behavior according to the labor market:
in-depth analysis of target groups like young people, emphasizing their
employment characteristics;
training-employment match;
employment, employment supply and remuneration (wage- earning
manpower);
migration.

- 92 -
ANNEX V
Page 13 of 14
2. Behavior according to the credit market:
monetary and non-monetary saving at the household's level;
demand and use of credit for production and con-umption;
sources and cost of credit.
3. Behavior according to the product market:
characteristics and revenues for family, farming and non-farming
enterprises;
food and non-food consumption; food security at the household's
level;
non-food expenditure.
4. Behavior according to basic needs:
access to health care and household's choice for health care;
nutritional status;
behavior toward fertility;
household's choice concerning children's education;
housing conditions, access to potable water, sanitation etc...
5. Poverty Profile:
calculation of poverty indicators by region and SEGs;
analysis of the sources of incomes and of the composition of
consumption for the poor and the non-poor;
60.   The Users Committee will be responsible for determining the priorities for the
analysis. The necessity for more specific or in-depth studies wi1l become parallel with the
needs for planning. These stui-?s cannot be anticipated at this stage, however, it is possible
to suggest the following:
fiscal policy: what are the effects of a specific consumption tax? (demand,
substitution effects, tax receipts, social equity);
public expenditure: what are the effects at individuals' level of a specific
deterioration of the composition of the public expenditure against the health
sector (availability and quality of primary health care, effects on the
households' choice for health care and im terms of health and nutrition status)?
61.   This kind of example could be developed with more details for monetary policy
measures, price policy, exchange and trade policy. The Users Committee with the
consultant's assistance if necessary, could develop a detailed study program.

62.   Seminars and workshops for dissemination will be organized to present the survey
results, or to present and discuss the findings and conclusions of the major studit. The
purpose of these meetings will be for the participants to discuss the findings and their policy
implications and make recommendations to the Government.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE COORDINATING OFFICE
OF THE NATIONAL SOCIAL ACTION PROGRAM
(Bureau de Coordination du PNAS - BCP)
Introduction
1.           The need to set up a project coordinating office became evident during the preparation
of this operation for the following reasons: (a) the PNAS is a complex operation involving various
sectors and many international agencies; a central structure is therefore needed to coordinate and
monitor a wide range of activities; (b) the actions supported by the PNAS are scattered across the
country and require quick and efficient operational and financial support if significant delays in their
execution are to be avoided; (c) the social actions are highly decentralized to the communes and
communities, making their management via the normal chamnnas difficult; (d) the multiple sources of
financing require high-quality financial management focusing exclusively on the PNAS; and
(e) Rwanda's urgent social needs call for swift actions which can hardly be prepared or executed by
the existing administrative departments, already overburdened by their regular tasks.
2.           Another important factor behind this decision is the fact that experience from projects
similar to the PNAS in neighboring countries has shown the need to create competent and autonomous
central management structures. In a number of African countries in which management of social
actions was dispersed among various ministries, operations could not get off-the ground. Whereas in
those cases in which an independent structure was set up, social programs were able to be put in place
more rapidly. It is important that Rwanda be able to benefit from this experience.
Objectives of the Coordinating Office
3.           The objectives of the BCP are to: (a) put in place the administrative and financial
conditions required for swift and effective execution of PNAS activities; (b) ensure proper
coordination and management of the funds required to implement this project; (c) promote the
coordination of the various components of the PNAS and the mutual strengthening of their effects;
(d) ensure financial monitoring of the entire operation and satisfy the various sources of financing
regarding the proper utilization of funds; (e) help disseminate information on social sectors; and
(f) gather all the data regarding implementation of the PNAS and present them regularly to the
Government and the international community.
4.           It is important to clarify that the BCP is not a direct executing agency for the PNAS,
but an entity responsible for overall program planning, coordination, cirwulation of information,
financing of activities and operational support when necessary. The BCP is in direct contact with the
various PNAS executing agencies, but does not interfere in specific technical areas unless specifically
requested to do so or when issues arise that must be resolved.

ANNEX VI
Page 2 of 8
BCP Activities
5.           The activities and functions of the BCP can be summarized as follows: (a) defining, in
conjunction with the PNAS executing agencies, a general action plan and an execution timetable based
on an overview of the objectives for each component; (b) reviewing the executing agencies' annual
work programs and budgets and approving them for financing; (c) providing funds for operating
expenses to each executing agency on a quarterly basis; (d) managing the project, either directly
(government budget, IDA credit, certain donors), or indirectly, through the channeling of external
resources; (e) monitoring procurement matters for equipment, vehicles and other goods; (f) financial
monitoring of all PNAS activities and maintaining the overall project accounts; (g) providing ad hoc
technical assistance for tI., programming and monitoring of certain PNAS activities and financing of
some training in light of needs identified during implementation of the program; and (h) general
supervision of activities and preparation of reports.
6.           The BCP will work in close collaboration wu v team of international experts, that
will be financed by UNDP and possibly by other international agencies. This team will provide
coordinated technical assistance for all PNAS components. The BCP will ensure that the terms of
reference for the technical assistants are in line with the objectives of each component.
7.           In general terms, the BCP will act as a financial intermediary between the various
sources of financing and the executing agencies and as a facilitator for the execution of activities.
Those involved in the PNAS must be able to refer to the BCP for any problem that may arise during
the course of execution. The office must have the capacity to c:isseminate information and make ad
hoc checks, and must also be given the resources to finance studies when these are necessary. A
fixed amount (US$100,000) will be budgeted for this purpose.
8.           To ensure maximum effectiveness, the BCP will be fully equipped with computers,
office equipment materials, vehicles and an adequate communication system. An operations manual
will be prepared and distributed to all PNAS participants.
BCP Personne
9.           The BCP personnel will include: a full-time national coordinator, a project
management specialist, an experienced accountant and a procurement specialist. Except for the
project management specialist, who will be recruited on the international market, the other experts
will be recruited by competition from among persons of Rwandese nationality. The BCP will also
have the necessary support personnel (secretaries, drivers, messengers, and others). The terms of
reference for these personnel, together with the skills required and recruitment procedures, are set out
in the supplement to this annex. These experts will be hired on conditions comparable to those in the
private sector. The contracts, to be signed by the supervisory authority, will be for three years and
will be renewable.
10.          The BCP will also be given the funds required to recruit ad hoc technical assistants
when necessary in the fields of procurement, accounting and information technology. Funds will be



- 96 -
ANNEX VI
Page 3 of 8
provided for training the personnel involved in implementing the various components, and for study
towns and seminars abroad.
Status of the BCP
11.          The BCP's legal status will give it managerial and financial autonomy. The Minister
of Planning will oversee the BCP given its mandate regarding intersectoral coordination and
monitoring of the PNAS. The BCP's start-up costs and operating expenses will be flnanced by IDA
under a PPF advance. The BCP's annual operating budget will be presented annually to the donor
community.
12.          The BCP will be responsible and accountable to a national committee containing
representatives of all the ministries involved selected NGOs and donors (as observers). The
committee will be chaired by a prominent national figure and will meet at least twice a year (more
often if necessary), to be informed by the BCP of the progress of the PNAS and to enable committee
members to exchange views on the performance of the various components. The members of the
committee will regularly receive the progress reports prepared by the BCP.
Functional Relations with the Executing Agendes
A.           HIMO Comnonent
13.          The HIMO unit, for which thie terms of reference and statutes are set out in the
component document, will present not later than October 31 of each year its program and budget for
the following year. The BCP will have a maximum of one month to comment on the proposal. It
will then make an initial deposit to the HIMO unit account to cover its financing needs for a six-
month period. As these funds are spent, the accounting department of the HIMO unit will prepare
expense statements justifying these expenditures. These statements will be standardized and
forwarded quarterly to the finance section of the BCP, which will check the accuracy of the
substantiating documents and will reimburse the HIMO account on receiving authorization from the
coordinator. This procedure should permit regular financing of the activities of this component while
ensuring proper checks on the accounts. For purchases on the international markets, the HIMO unit
will be responsible for preparing bidding documents which it will forward to the BCP to ascertain that
the correct pmcedures have been used. The BCP will then issue invitations to bid. Bids will be
evaluated and contracts awarded and signed in conjunction with the BCP procurement section and the
HIMO unit.
14.          All the technical aspects of the component will be the responsibility of the HIMO unit
(including the signing of contracts between the unit and enterprises), without any intervention from
the BCP. Nonetheless, the unit must send progress reports to the BCP twice a year along with copies
of all contracts signed by the communes. If unanticipated difficulties occur, the unit may request
technical assistance from the BCP. In case of disputes, the HIMO unit will inform its supervisory
ministry (MININTER), which, having studied the point at issue, will request a special meeting of the

ANNEX VI
Page 4 of 8
PNAS national committee to discuss the problem and find a solution satisfactory to all parties (this
procedure applies to all PNAS components and therefore will not be repeated in the rest of this text).
B.           Food Aid and Nutrition Component
15.          TargetedF7ood Aid. The WFP office, st-ngthened by permanent technical assistance
provided as part of the TA program to the PNAS, will be responsible for food purchases and their
reception, and for monitoring their transport to the prefectures by local transporters. WFP will
prepare detailed budgets for all the costs to be incurred (storage, contracts with private transporters,
sundry expenses) a-i will submit them to the BCP for approval and financing quarterly. The WFP
office will provide iLh. documents needed to justify replenishment of the account. Transport from the
prefectures to the nutrition centers will be organized by local administration and financed by BCP.
16.          Nutrition Activities. The Nutrition Division of MINISANTE will be responsible for
strengthening the nutrition activities in the centers participating in the WFP program. The role of the
BCP in this area would be limited to periodic monitoring of activities on the basis of reports provided
by MINISANTE and periodic meetings with the principal agents, viz. WFP, MINISANTE, UNICEF
and other agencies involved in this program.
17           Emergency Food Aid. The BCP will be responsible for: (a) coordinating financing
for the relief fund and the reserve stock; and (b) financing the logistics of food aid and, possibly,
technical assistance for management of distribution. To perform this task, the BCP will be
responsible for the circulation of information between the early warning service of the MINAGRI, the
CATGA and the relevant departments of MININ lER. The BCP will monitor execution of the
decisions of the national commission on food aid (to be supervised by MINIPLAN and whose lead
donor is Canada). A detailed description of the procedures for mobilizing and distributing food
assistance from the center to the families at risk is given in the document describing this component.
C.           -iaK-roots Initiative Suport Program (PAIB)
18.          The executive office of the PAIB will submit to the BCP the annual
programs/budgets: (a) for off-farm employment promotion; (b) training activities; (c) actions to
develop micro-enterprises and micro-projecs; and (d) operational support to other organizations
performing this kind of activity. The disbursement process will be similar to that described for the
other components: allocation of funds for six months of operations and quarterly replenishment based
on substantiated expense statements. One of the four staff from the executive office will be
responsible for maintaining the accounts. A repor. on activities wiel be sent annually to the BCP.
D.           Social Suvys
19.          The BCP will tinance surveys on the basis of programs/budgets prepared by the
General Directorate of Statistics. The BCP will pay for purchases of equipment and materials in
accordance with lists prepared by the specialists.

ANNEX VI
Page 5 of 8
20.          The 'RCP will also finance the circulation of the results of these sui-veys and the
associated analyK   iThese activities will be undertiaken in conjunction with the users' committee and
all the agencies im ' v ed in the development of social policies.
Relations with Financng Ageies
21.          The BCP will be responsible for the regular financing of all PNAS activities. To
perform this task the BCP must have a thorough kne wledge of all the administrative and financial
procedures required by the various donors. In the case of IDA, for example, the BCP will directly
manage the proceeds of the Credit granted to the Government. With regards to other donors wishing
to manage directly this funds, the BCP will ensure that the necessary funds are mobilized in a timely
manner, according to procedures to be specified. Certain donors may wish to make the BCP
responsible for managing their contributions, subject to periodic checks on their use. Finally, the BCP
will receive budgetary allocations to cover government contributions to PNAS operations.
22.          An annual meeting of PNAS donors will be organized by the BCP under the aegis of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINAFFET). At this meeting, the Government will present its
annual report on the PNAS, including disbursement performance for each component, and will
mobilize additional resources if necessary.
Evaluation of the Performance of the BCP
23.          An annual audit will be carried out by the donor financing the operations of the BCP.
In addition, the BCP's overall paformance will be evaluated during the medium-term review of the
PNAS. During this review the various options regarding the BCP's future (elimination at the end of
the PNAS, evolution or integration) will be studied, and recommendations will be put forward jointly
by the Government and the external agencies participating in the PNAS.

agencies; (c) preparing a three-year procurement plan consistent with the overall schedule of PNAS
activities, and monitoring its execution; and (d) ansuring the acceptability and consistency of all
imported equipment. He or she will also be responsible for giving technical advice on all the

Recrudinent Procdl'res for BCP Personnel
'These procedures must be drawn up by t'  -Lorities. It is suggested that the
PNAS National Committee would be responsible for selecting the itional coordinator on a
competitive basis, having reviewed the candidates' curricula and interviewed them. The recruitment
process must be totally transparent. Ihe coordinator will be recruited as a national consultant through
a contract signed with the supervisory authority. The salary and benefits offered to the coordinator
must be comparable to t;lose in the private sector for positions with similar levels of responsibility.
After the selection of the coordinator, a recruitment committee will be
established to hire the project management specialist, the accountant and the procurement specialist.
The process will be similar, involving an invitation to submit applications and in-depth analyses of
candidates.
The accountant must pass a test that includes cost accounting and
computerized systems. The composition of the recruitment committee should be specified later, but
in any event the coordinator must be a member of it. Salaries and benefits for these three positions
must also be competitive with those in the private sector. Contas should be signed either directly
with the BCP or with the supervisory authority.
The essential point of this recruitment process is to obtain individuals with the
highest possible skills and to offer them terms attractive enough to ensure their fuil commitment to the
operation. Given the financial size of the PNAS and its significance for Rwanda, this will be a
worthwhile investment.

TRAINING PROGRAM
1.           Food Aid and Nutrition Component. The training program will be geared
towards improving the performance of nutrition centers staff involved in food aid distribution.
Training activities will be carried out by staff from the Nutrition Division of MINISANTE
and the funding will be provided by the IDA-financed Family Health Project, in collaboration
with UNICEF. Technical assistance will be provided under the PNAS to: (a) assist the WFP
office in the logistics of food aid; and (b) assist MINISANTE in monitoring nutrition activities
at the nutrition center level. Training programs for nutrition workers are being elaborated by
the Nutrition Division of MINISANTE with the support of technical assistance provided under
PPF and of UNICEF staff.
2.           Labor-Based Works ComDonent. Training for existing and new firms would
include: (a) labor management, which is one of the most critical aspects of this type of works;
(b) financial management, including budgeting, response to bids, accounting and auditing; and
(c) technical skills for each type of works. The training program is being prepared by
consultants recruited under PPF through ILO. The training will start in mid-1992, about 6
months before credit effectiveness.
3.           In parallel with the training of interested firms, the personnel of the
communes that have been selected will receive a specific training for the preparation of the
communal investment plans. This training will be carried out by a team of consultants
recruited by the Cellule HIMO. The consultants will work with a grour of 10 communes at a
time and will train them in the selection and presentation of investment projects, selected from
the broader communal plans. After the initial training, the consultants would once a year
review the proposals made by the communes and suggest improvements in the methodology.
4.           Micro-Enterjrise Promotion and Development. The volunteers who constitute
the grass roots network (agents de chaniement) will receive a simple training in promotion
techniques and basic principles methods to identify potential entrepreneurs. This training will
be carried out by selected NGOs active in rural development. At the initial stages, PAIB staff
from the central and regional levels will participate in the training to familiarize NGOs in this
type of approach. In subsequent training sessions, only PAEB staff from the prefectoral level
will participate in the training. After three training sessions, NGOs will be fully responsible
for the training, without PAIB technical assistance.
5.           The training of potential micro-entrepreneurs follow the same pattern, with
initial training carried out by NGOS with the support of PAIB staff. The training will include
management, accounting, commercialization, technical skills and other specialized skills.
6.           Social Surveys. Senior staff from the General Directorate of Statistics and
from the Department of Surveys will receive a specialized training organized by experts
recruited under PPF. This training will start in June 1992. In addition, the senior staff will
participate in seminars and workshops organized by the Social Dimension of Adjustment
Initiative for African Statisticians. A few high level staff will receive fellowships for training
abroad in the field of survey management, data analysis, questionnaire design and others.

7.           Technicians from the General Directorate of Statistics will train Interviewers,
supervisors and data entry clerks for each type of surveys. This training will be organized
and supervised by the long-term technical advisor to be recruited for this component. In
addition, 9 man/months of international consultation have been programmed for specific
training activities, including preparation of the sampling (lm/m), computer programming
(3m/m) and data analysis (5m/m).
8.           Prject Management. Each key staff of the BCP (project coordinator,
procurement specialist and accountant) will receive a short-term intensive specialized training
abroad. To the extent possible, this training will be carried out under PPF in order to have
this staff fully prepared for the launch of the project in early 1993.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE iNDICATORS
1.           The project performance indicators proposed below will be used as a
monitoring tool and provide the BCP and IDA supervision missions with information
pertaining to the project's impact on the target populations. These indicators will be gathered
by the BCP on a quarterly basis and will be used for comparison purposes between previous
quarters. They will serve as a managerial tool to better target on-going interventions in order
to ensure the maximum impact possible on the poorest segments of the population.
2.           These indicators will also permit the BCP to compare overall performance and
response to the PNAS between the various communes and serve as a basis for stimulating the
lesser performing communes. They will also serve as a comparison mechanism between
communes to see which activities have a greater impact. This will permit to assess the mutual
reinforcement of PNAS activities at the community level. For example, it will enable the
BCP to see whether certain target groups are benefitting from several PNAS interventions or
are there different target groups of people benefitting from each intervention.
3.           The BCP will collect these indicators from the PNAS' executing agencies
(cellule HIMO for the Labor-Based Works component, Bourgmestres (commune chiefs) for
the Food Security component, and the PAIB executive unit for the Micro-Enterprise
Promotion and Development component) who will be made aware of the fact that this
information should be on hand at all times. With regards to nutrition, the BCP will rely on
MINISANTE's statistics collected by regional offices in the prefectures where food aid is
made available. In addition, the BCP will be responsible for putting together a list of all the
communes where there are project interventions and collect from certain key communes the
prices of 10 commodities that have an impact on poor households (e.g. kerosene, aspirin,
chloroquine, used clothing, kg. of beans, and kg. of potatoes for example).
4.           The BCP will be required to furnish the information to IDA on a quarterly
basis and include this information in its annual report. Indicators by component are as
follows:
(a) Labor Based Works Component Performance Indicators (to be collected
by BCP based on input from the cellule HIMO on a quarterly basis):
-     Total number of persons employed per quarter;
-     Number of women employed per quarter;
-     number of persons employed by commune and the duration of
their employment;
-     wage rate and the type of works that are being performed in
each commune.

ANNEX IX
Page 2 of 2
(b) Food Security Component Performance Indicators (to be collected from
the Bourgmestres):
-     Total number of families who received food aid by commune;
-     Number women head of households that received food aid by
commune;
-     Number of AIDS infected households that received food aid
by commune;
-     Number of orphanages having received food aid;
-     malnutrition data (underweight children and newborns) from
nutrition centers involved in the food aid program;
(c) Micro-enterprise Promotion and Development Component Performance
Indicators (to be collected from the PAIB Executive Unit):
-     Number of micro-enterprises created in each commune;
-     Number of persons that are currently employed by the newly
created micro-enterprises;
-     Number of women micro-entrepreneurs;
-     Age distribution of the micro-entrepreneurs;
-     Reimbursement rate of the loans;
-     Which NGOs have been involved and for what task;
5.           The BCP will be responsible for aggregating these data and consolidating
them into standard tables. Deviations from the expected outputs (see project targets in main
text) will be analyzed and remedial actions will be proposed. IDA's supervision missions will
assess on a random basis the accuracy of the data collected at the field level.
