F. Results Framework
i.      The original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not have a results framework. The
indicators shown below were thus developed as the project was under supervision and implementation
(see ISRs).

ii.          Objective of the Project:

According to the Loan Agreement the objective of the Project was to develop the institutional capacity
and improve the financial infrastructure and legal framework of the Borrower’s financial sector to prevent
future crisis. The FSTAL was expected to achieve this objective by strengthening the institutional
capacity of the Banking, Securities, Insurance and Pension Superintendencies, with particular emphasis
on the institutional development of the Superintendency of Banks and by modernizing the financial
system infrastructure, particularly the country’s payments and securities settlement systems. The FSTAL
was also expected to develop strategies for strengthening the Central Bank (BCRD) finances and the

                     The passing of the Law amending the LMF was a prerequisite to adjust the corresponding

                     regulations. While all regulatory norms defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)

                     Crédito Público was created in 2006. Since then, resources from the FSTAL contributed to
                     the capacity building of the middle office area of the Department through the design of a risk
                     management strategy. In addition, an important sub-component consisted of the upgrade of
    Comments
                     the debt management system software (SIGADE) which incorporates a more powerful IT
                     platform for managing debt information and processing of debt servicing. The SIGADE
                     software also includes an application for debt analytics including modeling capabilities to
                     perform simulations of alternative debt strategies. This component is expected to become
                     operational in 2012.

1.      Throughout the 1990s, the Dominican Republic (DR) ranked among the fastest growing
economies in the Latin American and Caribbean region. During 1991-2000, the economy grew
by 5.9 percent on average and per capita income increased by 4.1 percent in real terms. The
country achieved fast economic growth within an increasingly stable macroeconomic
environment, characterized by low inflation, manageable fiscal deficits and declining public
sector debt.

2.      During 2001-2002, a combination of external factors (the global economic slowdown and
the events of September 11, 2001) and domestic policy weaknesses contributed to a slower
economic growth rate (3.5 percent p.a. during 2001-02). The Government responded to the
growth slowdown with increased public spending, which led to worrying but still manageable
deficits, largely financed by foreign borrowing. A waning confidence in the adequacy of
macroeconomic policies in the face of external pressures, coupled with a large current account
deficit (averaging 3.6 percent of GDP during 2001-2002), led to a weakening of the peso which
depreciated by 27 percent against the dollar between December 2001 and December 2002,
compared to a 2.7 percent depreciation the year before. This happened despite heavy intervention
by the Central Bank in the foreign exchange market which contributed to a sharp decline of net
international reserves from US$962 million in December 2001 to US$376 million in December
2002.

Banking crisis in 2003

3.      In 2003, the economic difficulties were compounded by a massive banking crisis that
shattered the country's already weakened macroeconomic framework and jeopardized its growth
prospects. In April 2003, the third largest commercial bank, Baninter, collapsed due to its
inability to face intensified liquidity withdrawals. To avoid the spread of a crisis of confidence to
the rest of the financial sector, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) stepped in
by guaranteeing all of Baninter's deposits. In the months following this intervention, two
medium-sized banks, Bancrédito and Banco Mercantil, experienced large deposit withdrawals
and also received liquidity support from the BCRD. Subsequently Nova Scotia Bank acquired
part of the Baninter portfolio and also agreed with the BCRD to administer part of the portfolio
not acquired. BCRD overtook part of the related party portfolio of Bancrédito and sold the rest to
Grupo León (the owner of Banco Profesional). Finally, BCRD also assumed part of related party
portfolio of Banco Mercantil and the Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago acquired the rest.
Internationally assisted inspections of the remaining banks to determine if there were additional
vulnerabilities in the system were subsequently financed through an IDB technical assistance
loan.

4.     The Baninter collapse was caused by mismanagement and fraudulent banking practices
as well as a weak banking supervision framework. Since 1989 Baninter had been operating a


                                                 1
parallel bank by regularly issuing promissory notes to depositors that were not registered in the
official accounts of the bank. Regulatory weaknesses in the financial system had previously been
identified in an assessment conducted in the frame of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) in 2001. The FSAP report had concluded that the DR's banking system suffered from
systemic vulnerabilities resulting from major weaknesses in all supervisory agencies (banking,
insurance, securities and pensions), insufficient levels of capitalization and loan loss
provisioning, large concentrations of loans to few borrowers, including lending to related parties
as well as a high concentration of loans to un-hedged foreign currency borrowers. The FSAP
diagnostic had called for prompt and decisive corrective measures in early 2001.

The macroeconomic implications of the crisis

5.     By honoring all deposits including off-shore and off-balance sheet exposure of the failed
banks, the Government may have helped limit contagion in the banking system, but it placed a
very large fiscal burden on the country, thus putting macroeconomic stability at risk. Central
Bank assistance to the troubled banks was estimated at about 21 percent of GDP. Since part of
the liquidity support was not sterilized, the higher monetary expansion fueled currency
depreciation and inflation.2

6.       The Government addressed the macroeconomic challenges with a stabilization program
that was supported by an IMF Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) for US$620 million. The economic
stabilization program also included measures aimed at ensuring banking sector reform, sound
fiscal policy, sound monetary policy, and a flexible management of the currency. In order to
sterilize the excess liquidity and provide for an orderly management of the costs associated with
the bank bailout, a competitive auction for the placement of Central Bank securities issued in the
domestic market was instituted along with a rediscount facility that would provide liquidity to
Central Bank paper. A plan to re-capitalize the Central Bank and unify the foreign exchange
market was also developed. The financial sector component of the Government’s program
covered five pillars: (i) resolution of the failed bank Baninter; (ii) completion of a special
inspection by the Superintendency of Banks (SB) to determine if there were any instances of
fraud in other commercial banks; (iii) reinforcement of safety and soundness principles to be
adopted by financial institutions; (iv) implementation of a bank resolution framework; and (v)
strengthening of prudential regulations foreseen in the Monetary and Financial System Law (Ley
Monetaria y Financiera, LMF), for more effective supervision and enforcement by regulators.

7.      Soon after its approval, the IMF SBA almost came undone when the Government, in
mid-September of 2003, bought out a private investor’s share in two electricity distribution
companies (Edenorte and Edesur). The Government purchase of these two electric power
companies led to a worrisome increase in total public sector debt. The impact of this re-purchase
of the electric power companies for the Government’s cash-flow and debt position, along with
the consequences for the financial viability of the electricity sector, and the lack of transparency
regarding the terms of the deal held back implementation and disbursements of the IMF SBA
and an IDB social sector adjustment loan.

    The peso depreciated by 90 percent against the dollar in the first eleven months of 2003.


                                                            2
8.      The combined economic impact of the banking crisis, the re-purchase of two electricity
distributors, and the resulting delays in external financing flows triggered a recession. GDP
declined by 0.3 percent in 2002 followed by a moderate expansion in 2003 and more solid
growth thereafter (See Table 1 below). Inflation surged in 2004 following the monetary and
fiscal measures adopted during the crisis. International rating agencies downgraded the country
several times in 2003, and the exchange rate and risk spreads experienced a sharp deterioration
especially in the last quarter of the year. Net international reserves fell to about US$128 million
at end-November, and the authorities were having difficulties servicing the Government’s
external debt.

9.      After an independent commission of international experts set up to evaluate the purchase
of the electric power companies Edenorte and Edesur submitted its draft report in November
2003, the IMF resumed the first review of the SBA for which technical-level discussions were
concluded on December 2003. These discussions had to take into account slippages that had
emerged with respect to several program targets, including those related to fiscal and monetary
policies, and delays in completion of some of the program’s structural measures. The discussions
for the first review of the program centered on plans to address these slippages with a revised
program for 2004.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10.     The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FSTAL) was designed during the
banking crisis of 2003 with a focus on medium-term institution building and reforms to enhance
the efficiency of the financial system and help prevent similar crises in the future. According to
the Loan Agreement the Project Development Objective was to develop institutional
capacity and improve the financial infrastructure and legal framework of the Borrower’s
financial sector to prevent future crisis.

The FSTAL was expected to achieve this objective by strengthening the institutional capacity of
the Banking, Securities, Insurance and Pension Superintendencies, with particular emphasis on
the institutional development of the Superintendency of Banks and by modernizing the financial
system infrastructure, particularly the country’s payments and securities settlement systems.

The FSTAL was also expected to develop strategies for strengthening the Central Bank (BCRD)
finances and the Ministry of Finance’s debt management function which were needed in order to
facilitate greater market efficiency.




                                                            3
11.     Project outcomes and results were to be monitored through a set of well-defined
indicators, although the metrics for their measurement had not yet been sufficiently refined at the
time of Board presentation. The development objective indicators identified for the FSTAL in
the PAD were:

      Central Bank re-capitalization strategy allows for more efficient implementation of
       monetary and fiscal policies through a reduction in the quasi-fiscal deficit of BCRD and
       consequently greater financial market stability.

      Reduction and better control of government debt exposure through the implementation of
       the debt management function within MIFIN which would enhance financial market
       efficiency.

      Efficient supervisory function and enforcement of the LMF through issuance of its
       regulatory framework.

      The strengthening of the financial regulatory agencies in order to enhance financial
       system efficiency, increase confidence and help prevent a future crisis would be reflected
       in an increase in the M2/GDP ratio.

12.     For each of these areas the achievement of outcomes was also to be measured by a
qualitative assessment of the impact of improvements in the policy and legal framework on the
performance the financial system drawn from market indicators.

The wording of the PDO contained in the Loan Agreement differed from the one presented in the
PAD. The PAD established two objectives: i) strengthening the institutional capacity of the
monetary authorities to improve the design and implementation of monetary and fiscal policies;
and ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial regulatory agencies to reduce risks
and increase efficiency, transparency and accountability of financial activities. The focus of the
objective in the Loan Agreement was on the role of the regulatory agencies and financial
infrastructure in preventing a future crisis with the Central Bank recapitalization strategy and the
public sector debt management policies linked to the efficiency of the financial sector rather than
as part of a strategy of economic policy reforms. The PDO in the Loan Agreement and in the
PAD did not differ substantially. However, for clarity, the ICR is focused on the PDO as defined
in the Legal Agreement, as the indicators are more closely aligned with the PDO as written in the
legal agreement.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

Not applicable.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.    The primary beneficiaries of the FSTAL, as originally designed, were the Government
agencies directly involved with the financial sector including: the Central Bank (BCRD), the


                                                 4
Ministry of Finance, the Superintendency of Banks (Superintendencia de Bancos, SB), the
Superintendency of Insurance (Superintendencia de Seguros, SS), the Superintendency of
Pensions (Superintendencia de Pensiones, SIPEN) and the Superintendency of Securities
(Superintendencia de Valores, SIV). After the restructuring of 2009, the Superintendency of
Insurance was excluded.

14.     The other groups of beneficiaries were the financial institutions whose performance
would improve as a result of the strengthening of the regulatory framework and financial system
infrastructure as well as individuals whose savings in the form of bank deposits or other types of
investments would be less vulnerable to losses. Greater confidence in the financial system would
also contribute to a higher savings rate and thus greater availability of financing for investments.

1.5 Original Project Components

15.     Project outputs consisted of drafting new regulations, preparation and implementation of
strategic plans, development of risk-based supervisory methodologies including supervision
manuals, training and education programs for regulatory staff dealing with new norms and
procedures, and acquisition of software and hardware to upgrade the agencies’ IT infrastructure.

16.     For each of the Superintendencies the emphasis was on developing risk-based
supervisory practices. In some cases such as insurance and pensions, the Project was to assist in
deepening of technical capabilities such as actuarial expertise in insurance and establishment of
disability standards used in defining pension benefits, and development of risk analytics skills
within the public debt management office. The acquisition of hardware and software was critical
for the introduction of a new payment system and an online public debt management platform.
These institutional initiatives were expected to enhance each agency’s regulatory capacity and
thus contribute to a more efficient and resilient financial system.

17.    In order to achieve its objectives, the Project was designed with the following major
output components:

Project Component 1 - US$0.35 million ( 2.3% of total loan amount)
Strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank and statistics improvement
18.    This component was to focus on:

(a) Defining a strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank in view of the large quasi-fiscal
deficit.

(b) Improvement of the Central Bank statistics to bring them closer to international
standards.

Project Component 2 - US$2.49 million ( 17.8%)
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Banking Superintendency (SB)
19.     The main weakness in banking supervision that was exposed by the crisis was the
deficient organization of the supervisory agency, compounded by the lack of independence of
supervisors. The activities supported by this component included:



                                                 5
   (a) IT auditing function: acquisition of equipment and the drafting of an IT systems
       evaluation manual, as well as the necessary training to implement it.

   (b) External audits accountability: improvement in prudential regulations for banks’
       external auditors consistent with international best practices.

   (c) Institutional strengthening of the SB: support the design and implementation of an
       institutional development plan for the SB, including a supervisory strategy, the
       reinforcement of the internal organization, and the reinforcement of human resources.

   (d) Implementation of risk-focused supervision: build the capacity within the SB to carry
       out risk-oriented supervision in all the areas of the banking business, by refining its
       examination manual as warranted and by providing the necessary training to implement
       it.

   (e) Full implementation of the off-site analysis manual: incorporate some components not
       yet present; and provide training for supervisors in the use of this new methodology.

Project Component 3 - US$0.99 million (7.0%)
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Superintendency of Securities (SIV)
20.    The sub-components of the strengthening of the SIV included the following:

   (a) National strategy for securities market development and promotion which would
       include the design and first implementing steps of a capital markets promotional
       campaign.

   (b) Establishment of a central registry of market instruments and participants.

   (c) Issuance of secondary regulation and accompanying manuals, including assistance
       for the practical implementation of these rules and regulations, both at the level of the
       regulated market intermediaries and issuers, and the day-to-day enforcement effort of the
       SIV.

   (d) Development of on- and off-site surveillance functions at SIV under a risk-based
       supervisory framework.

   (e) Procurement of IT systems (hardware and software) to support SIV activities.

Project Component 4 - US$1.64 million (11.7%)
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Superintendency of Insurance (SS)
21.    The sub-components of the strengthening of the SS included:

   (a) Review and update of the legislation: support an expert consultant to identify gaps in
       the legislation and determine what supporting regulations should be prepared.




                                                 6
   (b) Implementation of risk-based supervision by revising procedures for off-site and on-
       site monitoring of companies.

   (c) Procurement of IT systems (hardware and software) to modernize the system of
       supervision: acquisition of a network of PCs within the Superintendency and an external
       link to insurance companies, such that information could be submitted electronically.

   (d) Development of actuarial capacity as part of supervision through technical training
       by international experts.

   (e) Human Resource Management: restructure and right-size the agency.

Project Component 5 - US$1.49 million (10.3%)
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Pensions Superintendency (SIPEN)
22.      A new social security system had been established under Law 87-01 that included a
mandatory pension scheme. This component was to assist SIPEN with strengthening its
institutional framework through:

   (a) Strategic planning, institutional development, human resource, and IT
       implementation: develop a strategic plan and finance the purchase of the equipment and
       software to support the supervisory function.

   (b) Establishment of appropriate technical and regulatory framework for survivor and
       disability benefits: build the institutional apparatus required for efficient eligibility
       determination of benefits.

   (c) Investment policy advice on appropriate regulations and linkages to other capital
       market reforms: commission studies on the interaction between pension fund growth
       and the development of capital market instruments.

   (d) Training of supervisory staff including exchange with other supervisors in the
       region.

   (e) Creation of database and production of periodic reports in coordination with other
       agencies including statistical bulletins and daily valuation reports to be made
       available to the public.

Project Component 6 - US$3.5 million (27.6%)
Payments and Securities Settlement Systems Reform
23.     Establishment of a comprehensive reform of the payments system, including the launch
of safer and more efficient systems and an improved legal and oversight framework, through:

(a) New RTGS System using SWIFT Y-Copy services: assist BCRD with the acquisition of a
    modern RTGS system that meets the needs of the financial industry.




                                               7
(b) New automated Check Clearing System: acquisition of an automated Check Clearing
    System to replace the existing semi-automated system.

(c) Establishment of an appropriate Legal framework and Oversight function: The legal
    framework included in the LMF must be completed by its corresponding regulation.

Project Component 7 - US$0.5 million (3.2%)
Regulatory development of the LMF
24.    The LMF, as such, was not directly applicable in the DR and needed to be supported by
appropriate regulation. The Bank would focus on implementation of the rules for:
   (a) market and operational risk;
   (b) rules for prudential norms;
   (c) external audit norms for financial institutions;
   (d) foreign exchange rules;
   (e) contingency fund rules;
   (f) net international reserves management rules;
   (g) new norms for Savings and Loans institutions and;
   (h) rules of FHA insurance.

Project Component 8 - US$0.99 million (6.8%)
Debt management and development of fixed income markets

   (a) Support for the re-organization of the Ministry of Finance (MIFIN): support the
       needed change in management and the re-training of personnel to allow them to perform
       new functions.

   (b) Capacity building in the front, back and middle office areas of MIFIN’s Public Debt
       Department [Crédito Público (CP)]: support the design of a project plan for the
       development of an office of CP which includes: a) how to approach markets through
       competitive mechanisms such as auctions (front office); b) how to design risk
       management strategies (middle office); and c) how to efficiently and securely register
       Government debt (back office).

   (c) Registration of all types of Government debt including suppliers’ credits in arrears.

   (d) Strengthen risk management capabilities and support for the definition of a
       corresponding debt issuance strategy in the CP and in the BCRD: support for risk
       courses, funding strategy design, etc.

   (e) Support for money market development: the development of a repo-market based on
       legally sound master repo-contracts.




                                                 8
Project Component 9 - US$2 million (12.5%)
Contingencies to deal with potential intensification of banking crisis
25.    This component was set as a safeguard against a deepening of the crisis, which could
undermine the implementation of the program. In case of deepening of the crisis these funds
would be available to hire experts to manage intervened banks in a professional manner to ensure
cost minimization.

Project Component 10 - US$ 0.1 million (0.6%)
Audit of Financial Statements
26.    Hiring of a firm to audit the financial statements of the project.

1.6 Revised Components

27.     Several revisions were made to the Project components including a reallocation of funds,
which did not materially affect the Project’s PDO. The replacement of the Financial
Management Unit and the elimination of the Superintendency of Insurance from the Project were
made through amendments to the Loan Agreement; whereas the reallocation of Project funds
constituted a second order restructuring which did not require a formal amendment.

Second-Order Project Restructuring in 2009
28.     During the March and June 2007 supervision missions, a number of implementing
entities indicated a need to extend the closing date due to the delay in initiating project
execution. The implementing entities also indicated the need to reallocate funds among activities
because some activities had already been implemented with own resources due to those delays.
Other implementation problems included the refusal by SS to carry out its part of the project.
The implementing agencies also indicated that some of the TA needs had changed over time and
thus wanted to structure new activities that were more relevant to the Project objectives. By
2009, an agreement had been reached on a restructuring that would facilitate effective
implementation of the remaining tasks under a newly established completion date.

29.     While the proposed modifications required an amendment to the Loan Agreement, they
did not significantly affect the Project’s PDOs, or the structure for implementation. No material
changes to the key performance indicators were made; and only several output indicators were
added. According to the Bank’s Guidelines, the amendment required the approval of the
Regional Vice President. However, the removal of the SS from the Project diminished to some
extent the achievement of the PDO of strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial
sector regulatory agencies. In this case it was felt that the benefits from continuing with the other
five agencies greatly exceeded any shortfalls from not including the SS component.

30.     In addition to the new completion date, the changes introduced by the restructuring were
as follows:

Project Component 1 - Strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank and statistics improvement
31.    Due to the delays in initiating project execution, the authorities of the BCRD had
proceeded with some of the activities of this component with their own funds. Consequently the
Borrower requested the addition of the following activities that were consistent with the Project’s



                                                 9
objectives: (a) enhancement of BCRD’s information technology (IT) capacity; (b) design and
implementation of mechanisms for business continuity and a risk management system; and (c)
strengthening of the BCRD’s Strategic Planning Unit particularly in the implementation of
operational plans across the organization.

ELIMINATION of Project Component 4 - Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the
Insurance Superintendency (SS)
32.    The Insurance Superintendency had given indications that it did not intend to implement
its component, despite repeated efforts by the Project Coordination Unit, Government authorities
and Bank missions. The Borrower and the Bank agreed that the funds assigned to the SS be
reassigned equally among the other implementing agencies.

Project Component 7 - Regulatory development of the LMF
33.     The BCRD and the SIB had already drafted and implemented the necessary regulations to
effectively implement the LMF. However, the Monetary and Financial Authorities were
preparing amendments to the LMF to take into account the new developments in international
financial markets and the 2009 FSAP recommendations. These amendments were to be sent to
Congress for approval. The new activities proposed by the Government were thus to (a) update
the regulations of the amended LMF, when approved; and (b) submit a draft of a law on financial
conglomerates for approval which was viewed as necessary for implementation of consolidated
supervision.

Project Component 8 - Debt management and development of fixed income markets
34.      Due to the delays in initiating project implementation, the authorities of MIFIN had to
implement some of the activities of this component with their own funds. The new proposed
activities involved: (a) strengthening and capacity building of the Ministry’s Public Debt
Department including its IT capacity; (b) design and implementation of a system to consolidate
the information of all public sector programs and projects that are financed by external resources.

Project Component 9 - Contingencies to deal with potential intensification of banking crisis
35.    With the improvements in the macroeconomic environment and the healthy performance
of the banking system, it was agreed that half of the amount that had been assigned to this
component be released in 2009 and redistributed equally among the participating entities.

Application of the new Country Financing Parameters
36.    The Borrower requested the application of the new Country Financing Parameters in the
July 2007 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which increased the limit in cost co-participation
from 80 / 85 percent up to 100 percent. This would allow the project to finance "reasonable
taxes" with Bank resources, thus overcoming a barrier to loan disbursements, in view of the
magnitude of taxes applied to consultants’ services.

1.7 Other significant changes

Extensions of closing dates
37.   The original effectiveness date of the FSTAL was April 2004. However, due to delays in
Congressional approval, effectiveness was not declared until August 8, 2005. Project



                                                10
implementation was further delayed to the beginning of 2006 because of the need to introduce
two amendments to the Loan Agreement: the elimination of UNDP as Project Financial Manager
and the establishment of a Special Account for BCRD as the new financial manager for the
Project. Due to these events, Project execution started approximately two years after the original
expected date.

First extension:
38.     In 2007, a number of implementing entities indicated the need to extend the Project’s
closing date, as delays in effectiveness had significantly reduced the implementation period. Due
to concerns at that time about the potential soundness of the Dominican Republic’s financial
sector, especially in the context of the then global financial crisis, the Bank recommended that
first an update assessment be undertaken as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) to gain a better understanding of the resilience of the country’s financial sector to
potential negative shocks. Consequently, the Bank proposed to the authorities a four month
interim extension while the FSAP took place, and, depending on the FSAP’s initial findings, to
reach a determination on how to proceed with the Project amendment and extension. The
authorities accepted the FSAP mission, and the Country Director approved a four month
extension of the Closing Date to April 30, 2009.

Second extension:
39.     During the initial extension of the closing date in 2009, the Bank moved ahead with the
third Amendment to the Loan Agreement and thus included an extension from the provisional
date of April 30, 2009 to June 30, 2011, to allow execution of the Project under its reformulated
components.

Third extension:
40.     As the last extension, the closing date was changed from June 30 to December 31, 2011
in order to allow time to complete several important activities.

Replacement of the Project’s Financial Management Unit in 2005

41.     As established in the PAD, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was to be comprised of
BCRD as coordinator plus a representative from each participating entity’s technical units. The
BCRD in turn was to contract the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a support
unit to perform the Financial Management function of the PCU. This decision had been made in
view of BCRD’s lack of experience with Bank projects, the complexity of the project, and the
Bank’s demanding procurement process.

42.     After Loan approval by the Board, the Government asked the Bank to replace UNDP as
the procurement agent with PCU at BCRD which was considered to already have some of this
expertise and that it would also allow for capacity building within participating agencies’ project
coordination units.

43.   Thus, on July 25, 2005, about a month prior to Project Effectiveness, the First
Amendment was approved calling for the replacement of the UNDP as the Project’s Financial
Management Unit by BCRD’s PCU. In order to support BCRD’s new role, the Bank made its



                                                11
staff available to assist it throughout the implementation process. The Bank also agreed to
provide training to the implementing agencies of the PCU in Bank procedures for procurement
and financial management.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
44.     Project implementation based on Bank financing is summarized in Table 2. Because of
the cancellation of the SS component and reallocation of crisis contingency funds, all of the
participating agencies were able to utilize a larger amount of funds. The notable increase in the
allocation for the BCRD component is due to the development of a joint project with SB to
establish a web-based unified portal to receive information from the supervised financial
intermediaries. The Pension Superintendency and the Public Debt Office also received
significant increases in their allocations. An analysis of key implementation factors is presented
in Section 2.2 and a summary of the Project’s main activities under each component is shown in
Annex 2: Outputs by Components.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of Background Analysis

45.     This Project was designed to provide medium-term institutional and market reforms, but
was prepared during a banking crisis. While the approach pursued by the Government, mainly
BCRD, helped limit the contagion in the banking system, the injection of liquidity in support of
all of the failed banks’ deposits fueled inflation and triggered a sharp depreciation of the
currency while leaving BCRD in a financially compromised position, which threatened its ability
to effectively manage monetary policy.

46.    The international financial community— the Bank, IMF and IDB—followed a
coordinated approach to engage the authorities in the crisis management. The IMF was the first


                                                                    12
responder with a Stand-By Agreement in August 2003, which provided US$ 620 million to
address BCRD’s quasi-fiscal deficit through a re-capitalization strategy. The IDB’s US$6 million
technical assistance project, Strengthening the Banking Sector, Supervision and Regulation
focused: on (i) assisting inspections of banking institutions which were conducted with
international consultants; (ii) development of banking regulations dealing with financial
conglomerates and consolidated supervision as well as LMF regulations dealing with the
monetary and financial authority; (iii) regulation and management of state-owned banks; and (iv)
advice on coordination of oversight activities by the financial sector regulatory agencies. While
there was a fair amount of overlap with the Bank’s FSTAL, the IDB project focused on items
needing immediate attention so that it’s most important component were the assisted inspections
aimed at identifying any potential problems in the other financial institutions similar to those that
caused the collapse of the three banks.3 Thus the Bank’s approach to supporting the financial
sector during this troubled period was on longer-term institutional and policy reforms.

47.       The Bank’s analysis in preparation for this Project focused on a number of key issues:

         A weak supervisory function and institutional capacity in most of the government
          agencies dealing with supervision of the financial system.
         Need to make the new LMF Law (2002) effective through the drafting of 19 critical
          regulations that were essential for its effectual implementation.
         Entanglement of financial groups which underscored the need for much greater
          coordination among regulators and supervisors.
         Lack of a consistent approach to risk-based supervision across all regulatory entities, with
          high priority in the case of the Superintendency of Banks.
         The urgency of establishing a state-of-the-art Real Time Gross Settlement system in order
          provide a safe and secure payment system with minimal contagion.
         As a relatively new institution established in 2003, the Superintendency of Securities
          required technical assistance in a number of areas.
         Low level of credibility of government securities which were to play a leading role in the
          development of the securities market.
         With a new pension system instituted in 2001, the Pensions Superintendency was being
          challenged by increasing responsibilities for overseeing a rapidly expanding pension
          fund.
         With the growth of the pension funds, a key concern of the Pension Superintendency was
          the development of greater depth and scope of the domestic capital markets since pension
          funds could only invest in a few instruments.
         Because of the limitations in terms of the size and liquidity of the financial system the
          government had to rely on international financial markets for funding thus limiting its
          debt management options and accentuating the risk profile of its liabilities.
         The diagnosis of the Insurance Superintendency pointed to a gap in terms of technical
          experts in insurance and a need for a rationalization plan given the agency’s low ratio of
          technical to total staff.

 Assisted inspections were on-site inspections by SB staff accompanied by international experts on bank
examinations.

Assessment of Project Design

48.     The Bank’s diagnosis was comprehensive in scope and appropriately indentified a
number of weaknesses in the financial system; nevertheless, the Project’s objectives and design
of multiple components may have been ambitious given the limited capacity of the various
agencies, especially those that were still relatively new. Thus the project became too complex
with an unrealistic timetable. There were six implementing agencies: BCRD; the
Superintendencies of Banks, Insurance, Pension, and Securities; and the Ministry of Finance’s
Public Debt Office. While each entity posed its own challenges and opportunities, the design
could have taken into consideration the priority and relevance of reforms in each of the
components and accordingly sequenced the Project activities in stages. For example, given the
banking crisis, the need for reforms in the Superintendency of Banks was a greater priority, than
that of the securities markets. At the same time, the urgency to provide funding for crisis
resolution had also begun to dissipate in early 2004 prior to Board approval. The large funding
needs associated with the bail-out of the banking system also appeared to have been resolved
through the IMF Stand-By Agreement, and some of the other immediate institutional needs were
covered through the IDB loan.

49.     Given the extensive list of reforms identified during Project appraisal, perhaps the Bank
should have designed a simpler project with a narrower scope and the possibility of a follow-up
project. While the Government may have been more receptive to a TA project immediately after
the banking crisis, the key to sustainability is the engagement of future Governments to the
objectives supported by the FSTAL. Thus, structuring the Project as a series of TAs would have
been a way to expand future support, based on actual commitments by the Borrower. An
alternative would have been a project with a longer execution, perhaps six years, with some
monitoring and phasing arrangements.

50.      Undoubtedly there was a need to integrate the efforts to strengthen all the regulatory
agencies of the financial sector, but the complexity of the agenda and the depth of reforms
needed across the different entities were perhaps too ambitious. For example, even today there
are notable methodological differences in the approach taken to valuation of securities held in an
investment portfolio by a bank, a securities firm, and a pension fund administrator. One of the
principal obstacles has been a more coordinated approach by the regulatory agencies to establish
an agreed methodology for securities valuation or the accounting treatment of such assets. At the
same time, the concept of risk-based supervision was a fundamental theme for all supervisory
agencies and this was not introduced as a project sub-component until after the 2009
restructuring with the proposed drafting of a new law on financial conglomerates; but here the
challenge was the ability to manage a project across numerous participating entities.

Adequacy of Government Commitment

51.     Initially the Government was actively engaged in the Project preparation along with the
participating agencies which worked closely with the Bank. Once the immediate crisis
environment settled, Government commitment to the Project was not as strong. The delay in
congressional approval of the Project was an indication that post-crisis support for the Project’s
objectives was waning. The change in Government in 2004 also diminished the level of support.



                                               14
Eventually the Insurance Superintendency component was cancelled due to lack of commitment.
After the Government requested that the UNDP be replaced by the Central Bank’s PCU, the
financial management unit did not receive the financial resources to comply with the additional
responsibilities resulting hereof.

Assessment of Risks

52.     In the appraisal document the Bank identified the risk of the Project as substantial. One of
the imminent threats was an intensification of the banking crisis, but it was hedged to a large
extent by the IMF Stand-by agreement as well as the Project’s crisis contingency component of
US$2.0 million. The lack of political commitment to strengthen supervisory agencies and limited
implementation capacity were also flagged as substantial risk. However, in the case of limited
implementation capacity, the risk was lowered to moderate given the agreement that UNDP was
to act as the principal procurement agent for the Project. Nevertheless, the degree of risk would
have called for a more conservative approach to the design of the Project.


2.2 Implementation

53.    During its long duration, the implementation of the Project was influenced by the factors
explained below. A summary of the principal outputs of the Project is shown in Annex 2:
Outputs by Components.

Delays in effectiveness

54.    One of the initial challenges for the Project was the long delay in meeting effectiveness
conditions. Project execution started approximately two years after its Board approval date of
February 2004. In part due to lack of response by members of Congress along with the political
changes introduced by a new Government in August 2004, the Senate did not approve the Project
until March 29, 2005. The Project was then declared effective in August 10, 2005. A Bank
mission took place in September 2005 to put in motion the implementation phase of the project
which finally became operational by early 2006.

Change in Project Coordination Unit

55.   As explained in the previous section, the change in the PCU required an amendment to
the Loan Agreement which was approved in July 2005. This in turn necessitated a second
amendment, which was approved August 22, 2006, authorizing BCRD to establish a Special
Account for the purpose of managing the funds from the Loan.

56.    The decision to exclude the UNDP as procurement agent adversely affected the
implementation of the Project. Lack of experience in working with Bank projects proved to be a
setback to the PCU at BCRD. At the same time, it limited the ability of the other implementing
agencies to process new sub-projects because they did not have access to experts who could
“walk-them-through? the procurement process. Post-reviews subsequently performed by the
Bank’s procurement specialist pointed to numerous areas for improvement and recommended the


                                                15
hiring of a procurement specialist experienced with Bank projects, which did not materialize
until well into the implementation period. The absence of a qualified Procurement Specialist
during most of project’s implementation period meant that the Bank’s procurement staff had to
provide unusually detailed comments to many processes and that some of the more complex
activities had to be repeated, thus increasing the Bank’s effort significantly above the levels
experienced in other projects. In addition, the Bank undertook extensive supervision-related
training activities.

57.     The delay in effectiveness and processing of the two amendments associated with the
change in the PCU affected the ability to achieve the development objectives in a timely manner.
The FSTAL was approved in February 2004 and the second amendment was approved in August
2006, marking the beginning of the operational effectiveness of the project. Nonetheless, some
participating agencies, such as BCRD and the Ministry of Finance, went ahead and financed their
planned activities with their own resources, due to the importance of those initiatives. Others,
such as SIPEN, were still working with the funding from the IDB loan well into 2007. Thus the
delay in Bank funding did not appear to be a critical concern in those cases. The impact of these
issues on implementation is demonstrated by the very slow progression of Loan disbursements as
shown in section G of this report’s Data Sheet.

Change in Implementing Agencies’ Staff and in Bank Project Manager

58.     Changes in the Bank’s staff and their counterparts in the Dominican Republic before and
during implementation had a material impact on implementation. The Project was approved in
February 2004 and in August of that year there was a change in Government, which in turn led to
a change in the leadership of government ministries and in each of the supervisory agencies. In
the case of the SS, the new Superintendent in 2004 did not support the Project’s insurance
component, despite repeated efforts by the Government authorities, the PCU and Bank missions;
thus the Government eventually requested the Bank to eliminate this component. The withdrawal
of SS from the FSTAL dealt a setback to the goal of establishing a common risk-based
supervisory platform across all areas of the financial sector. After 2004, additional staff changes
occurred at SB and SIV but with only moderate impacts on Project continuity.

59.     On the Bank side, there were three task managers during implementation of the Project.
For a project challenged by its complex design and implementation arrangements, as well as the
procurement issues mentioned above, the changes in Bank managers were disruptive for
implementation and were brought up by some of the participating agencies interviewed for this
report. Each project manager required time to become familiar with the agenda for each
participating entity and this also contributed to the delays in the approval of project activities. In
view of the implementation issues that arose during the tenure of the Project, continuity of the
Bank’s task manager and greater frequency of supervision missions may have improved
implementation performance.




                                                 16
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

60.     The original project document (PAD) had a project implementation plan as well as a set
of monitoring and evaluation indicators. The M&E framework, however, was enhanced and
reinforced during the supervision by using additional indicators for tracking the impact of
component outputs on PDO, including those pertaining to the reallocation of Project funds in
2009, especially on the reduction of risk and increase in efficiencies of the financial system. The
latter were tallied and tracked as part of the Bank’s supervisory activities and reported in the
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs). Nevertheless the original design did not
encompass sufficient measurable outcome indicators and those reported in the ISRs were a mix
of outcome and output indicators.

M&E Implementation

61.     The supervision missions monitored the quantitative as well as qualitative indicators. The
results indicators were mainly qualitative in nature such as assessing whether the risk-based
supervision carried out by a regulatory agency was consistent with international best practice.

M&E Utilization

62.     Project information was monitored through the ISRs although more quantitative
indicators would have been helpful. The PCU was moderately effective in terms of maintaining
timely information; however, it did not keep up-to-date detailed records on a consolidated basis
in terms of the purpose of each sub-project, costs, contracts, disbursements procurement methods
and output.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

63.     In view of the problems encountered during implementation regarding less than
satisfactory management of the procurement process and concerns raised by the post-reviews of
procurement, some weaknesses have been identified in the financial reporting process. Some of
the basic information on project outputs was found to be incomplete, in some cases the
information for some sub-projects was not consolidated with the overall schedule of Project
implementation which was needed as part of ongoing supervision. While the external project
audits have been completed, they only address the overall totals spent on each component, and
based on a review of the financial information on the Special Account. Thus the PCU should
have provided more up-to-date reports using the extensive information in the Project files in
order to perform a better assessment of implementation results.


2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

64.    Following the 2009 FSAP, the Bank continued to engage in dialogue with the Borrower
and currently has plans for non-lending technical assistance in areas such as the delivery of a



                                                17
crisis simulation exercise to gauge the country’s preparedness for potential negative
developments in the financial sector or in actions to strengthen the delivery of financial services
to MSMEs and the consolidation and supervision of the financial cooperatives. While the
financial authorities have voiced some requests, discussions with the Bank have stalled as the
closing of this Project coincided with the national elections which were held in May 2012, thus
creating uncertainty about the permanence of the main counterparts of the Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
65.     This section assesses the outcomes of the Project based on the Bank’s evaluation criteria.
Section 3.1 applies the relevance test in the context of the latest Bank Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS). Sections 3.2 and 3.3 review the achievement of objectives and efficiency of
Project outputs in order to arrive at the overall assessment of outcomes.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

66.     The development objectives of the Project were consistent with the priorities at the time
of Board approval as well as with current Borrower and Bank development goals. The objective
of the FSTAL was to enhance confidence and to reduce the likelihood of future financial sector
crises and thus their potential impact on poverty levels and income distribution.

67.     The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) established as its overall goal to support
the country in reducing its vulnerability to internal and external factors. 4 The objectives of the
FSTAL are consistent with these goals. Born out of the banking crisis, the Project still maintains
its relevance in assisting the Government to strengthen its regulatory framework and thus
minimize the risk of a financial crisis that could have a devastating impact on the social well-
being of the population.

68.     By contributing to a greater stability of the financial system this Project directly supports
the second pillar of the CPS: promote competitiveness in a sustainable and resilient economic
environment. Without sustainable economic growth reduction in poverty is not possible. The
health of the financial sector is one of the foundations for sustainable long-term growth, given its
role of channeling savings into investments that boost productivity and competitiveness. A
vulnerable financial system discourages savings and thus investments and also threatens to
undermine the social well-being of an aging population that will depend on the value of their
pension benefits upon retirement.

69.        Based on the reasons discussed above, the relevance of this project is deemed to be High.


3.2 Achievement of the Project’s Development Objective

70.     This section describes the extent to which the Project has achieved its development
objectives. It assesses the linkage between Project outputs and outcomes for each of the Project
components. A detailed review of the effectiveness of the combined effect of the Project on

market trends during the period of implementation and beyond is presented in Annex 4: Macro
Outcomes Achieved.

Overall Rating for Achievement of PDO

The Project has made positive contributions in terms of institutional development and market
efficiency. Some components such as the payments system, and the Superintendency of Banks
had a greater impact on outcomes than other components, such as those related to the securities
market and to the pension system, which did not have a significant impact on market outcomes
(see more discussion in Annex 4: Macro Outcomes Achieved). One of the setbacks to the
Project was the cancellation of the component dealing with the Insurance Superintendency,
which limited the Project’s development objective of increasing the institutional capacity of the
financial regulatory agencies. Nevertheless, in terms of the financial system, the insurance sector
continues to represent a very small component as seen by total insurance premiums which have
actually declined from 2.1 percent in 2002 to 1.3 percent in 2010. However, from the perspective
of financial system vulnerability, the critical areas for this evaluation of outcomes in terms of
the PDO have been the banking system and securities market, which also include the payments
system and which are currently deemed to be stronger with a greater capacity to withstand both
external and internal shocks thanks in part to the institutional reforms supported by the Project.
For these reasons the achievement of development objectives is rated as satisfactory.

Contribution of Project outputs to the achievement of outcomes

Strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank and statistics improvement

71.     Since the strategy to re-capitalize BCRD was financed with its own resources, this
component contributed to the development of a joint BCRD-SB web-based information portal
for regulatory reporting by financial intermediaries. As shown in Table 4 below, BCRD’s quasi-
fiscal deficit has been reduced throughout the period of the Project and the issuance by BCRD of
investment certificates and other bonds to finance the rescue of the banks in 2003/04 has
provided the securities market and the pension funds with a viable source of investments during
the initial stages of development of the securities market. This accomplishment, while not
directly supported by the Project, was an important factor in the success of the other components.

Joint BCRD – SB information portal

72.     The creation of a web-based information portal for the submission of regulatory reports
by financial intermediaries to the BCRD and SB is expected, once completed in 2012, to notably
improve the technological capabilities of the regulators. The quality of the information will
improve through electronic reconciliation and testing of the data provided by the financial
intermediaries. The adoption of a unified format for the data reported by financial intermediaries
will reduce the probability that reporting institutions will provide different information to each
regulatory entity. The new portal will represent a significant saving in the cost of compliance for
financial institutions that previously had to manually compile and deliver the information
separately to BCRD and SB. The utilization of authorized digital signatures will also contribute
to the integrity of the information.

73.     In view of the successful outcomes described above, the effectiveness of this component
in terms of the support provided by the Bank to the BCRD-SB web Portal towards the
achievement of Project outcomes is expected to be positive once the new system is fully
implemented and for this reason the achievement of outcomes is considered moderately
satisfactory.

Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Banking Superintendency (SB)

74.    The success of the SB component in developing a strategic plan, adopting a risk-based
supervisory model, and strengthening of its IT audit function and improving its utilization of
human resources can be demonstrated by the following outcomes:

      Risk-based supervisory practices were initiated in 2006.



                                                 20
       Risk-based capital requirements have been adopted for market risk (interest rate and
        exchange rate risk) and SB is in the process of introducing norms regarding operational
        risk. A draft law has been submitted to congress to grant SB greater authority to take
        preemptive actions in requiring a financial institution to increase capital.

       Consolidated supervision is moving slowly, marked by still limited cooperation between
        regulatory agencies. Approval of the recently submitted draft law on financial groups
        would facilitate the sharing of information across regulators. Consolidated supervision of
        foreign affiliates has been progressing well with respect to Central America where
        information sharing agreements have been established.

       At the time of Project restructuring in 2009, international financial agencies— the Bank,
        IMF and the IDB—considered that the effectiveness of banking supervision had
        improved significantly since 2003 and, based on further innovations in supervision
        practices that have since been supported by Project funding, this trend has continued.

        As shown in the Annex 3 Table A3-1, supervisory activities have increased as SB
        pursues a more methodical process of monitoring the banking system.

75.   Given the accomplishments of the SB in institutional development and its impact on
outcomes this component is considered as satisfactory.

Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Securities Superintendency (SIV)

76.     The securities market has grown rapidly, yet the contribution of the Project to these
developments has been limited. Also the difficulties encountered during implementation of this
component in terms of delays limited its effectiveness. The training program for SIV staff along
with the upgrade of its IT capabilities had a positive effect on institutional development as well
as the consultants’ work on regulatory reforms, but it is not considered to have had a material
impact on the progress experienced by the securities market (see analysis in Annex 4: Macro
Outcomes Achieved).

77.    The contribution of the Project towards the objectives for this component is thus
considered as moderately satisfactory.

Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Pensions Superintendency (SIPEN)

78.     Institutional reinforcement through the assistance of the Project enabled SIPEN to engage
its organization more effectively in fulfilling its role as regulator. Among the outcomes attributed
to the Project are:

        The strategic planning department of SIPEN has taken a more proactive approach
         through the adoption of the balanced scorecard method to monitor its implementation.

        Sanctions against AFPs have started to appear as a sign of improved on-site supervision,
         particularly risk-based supervisions.


                                                21
        The time required for approval of new financial instruments has been reduced through
         increased training of the technical staff and adoption of new analytical methods
         including the acquisition of software in 2011 to perform risk analysis of financial
         instruments.

        The risk classification commission of SIPEN has taken a more proactive approach in
         approving new investment instruments such as securitized assets and investment funds.
         This is also reflected in the number of new public offerings approved as investments for
         the AFPs.

        Development of new life tables provides the agency with a more effective tool to
         measure the expected value of pension benefits.

        SIPEN is considered as one of the public institutions that provide information most
         transparently, considering the transparency rating given by the non-partisan Civic
         Committee for Citizens’ Participation, in which this entity received a score of 99.5%.


                  Table 5: SIPEN - Outcome Indicators for Institutional Strengthening
                                                                      2007      2011

                 Source: SIPEN


The effectiveness of the Pension Superintendency component is thus deemed to be satisfactory.

Payments and Securities Settlement Systems Reform

79.    The new RTGS payments system became operational in 2008 and has already produced
very positive results in terms of grater market efficiency and reduced risk. Key benefits of the
new system include:

       Reduced instances of fraud as the system applies rigorous validation standards to each
        transaction plus regulators are engaged in ongoing surveillance of transactions.

       Settlement time is greatly reduced as the transactions are recognized on a real time basis
        thus reducing the time from as long as 24 hours to only minutes.



                                                  22
      The national securities custodian CEVALDOM was authorized to de-materialize
       securities in 2008 thus enhancing the liquidity and safety of securities transactions.

      Costs per transaction have been notably reduced compared to the previous manually-
       entered to an automated system for funds transfers. The previous system was based on
       delivery of physical documents, along with multiple entries of a transaction as it moved
       through different stages of finality which also increased the probabilities of errors.

      Greater funds stability. In the previous system financial intermediaries had to estimate
       their funds position during the day which could result in a funds shortfall by the end of
       the day.

      Increased volume of transactions arising from greater confidence in the payments system
       as well as new cash management and online products introduced by financial
       intermediaries. The volume of transactions between clients has surged during 2009 –
       2011 (See Annex 3 Table A3-2).


80.    Because of its contribution to increased efficiency of the payments system and lower
systemic risks the effectiveness of this component is considered to be highly satisfactory.

Regulatory Development of LMF

81.     All regulations to the LMF established in the original PAD were adopted by the
participating agencies for each of their Project components. However, and as discussed in the
earlier section on implementation, the new activities established by the 2009 restructuring called
for passage of reforms to the LMF and subsequent revision and updates to relevant regulations
with support from the project. These reforms were presented to Congress in March 2011 but are
still awaiting approval, rendering it impossible to adjust the regulations as established in the
2009 restructuring. Because of the delay in the approval of the additional reforms to the LMF the
effectiveness of this component is considered moderately satisfactory.

Debt management and development of fixed income markets

82.     The establishment of the Public Debt Department and its staffing brought together the
human and IT resources to maintain an up-to-date profile of the public debt, to service the debt
on a timely basis and to perform an ongoing analysis of public debt with the goal of optimizing
its maturity / cost profile. Some enhancements in debt reporting are still needed such as reporting
of loan commitments.




                                                23
83.       Among the outcomes of the activities performed by this component were the following:

         Information on public debt is more up to date. With the new debt management system
          much of the entry and analysis of the information is automated, thus contributing to
          greater efficiency.

         The upgrade of the unit’s IT system has also improved the accuracy of information on
          public debt. The back-up system acquired under the Project has notably improved the
          security of the Government’s debt information.

         The Department has been publishing a quarterly report since 2006 on the state of the
          government debt that provides a very useful analysis, which among other topics
          addresses the structure of the debt, its risk profile, and comparative debt ratings (See
          Annex 3 Table A3-3).

         There has been a steady rise in the relative size of the debt. The Government has also
          been steadily increasing the average life of its domestic debt, thus helping to reduce its
          maturity risk. The currency exposure of the government’s debt has also been reduced.

84.   In view of the above contributions by the Public Debt Department to the outcomes of
improved management of monetary and fiscal policy, the contribution of this component is
deemed satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

85.    The Project appraisal did not incorporate an ERR/IRR criteria for evaluation purposes.
However, the procurement of goods and services followed Bank policy regarding requests for
bids and the selection criteria which is aimed at choosing the most efficient (cost-effective)
approach to procurement. . A number of outcomes discussed in the previous section point to cost
savings from increased productivity through improved IT systems that directly reduced labor
costs.

86.     Another important aspect of efficiency is the amount of time needed to produce the
expected benefits. The longer the completion time, the lower the cumulative value of the benefits
in terms of the time value of money and rising costs over time. When the timeline of the Project
is taken into consideration or the discounting of future benefits and costs to their present value,
the net benefits may shrink due to the long implementation period and the cancellation of
planned activities that were not designed in time before the Project’s closing.

87.     The longer than programmed duration of the FSTAL adversely affected the efficiency of
the outcomes. Costs were higher for purchases of goods and services and also in terms of the
project management costs. The weakness in the procurement office may have materially
increased the costs of the Project, and the less than satisfactory financial control reduced the
efficiency of implementation.




                                                 24
88.    Based on the experience of the project, particularly the long implementation period and
weak management of the procurement process, efficiency is thus considered to have been
moderately satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

89.     The overall outcome rating, which incorporates the three rating sub-categories is thus
considered moderately satisfactory. While the relevance of the Project is considered high and the
achievement of the PDO as satisfactory, the problems with project design and efficiency in terms
of the long period of implementation lead to the moderately satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not applicable.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

90.      The achievement of the Project’s development objectives was dependent on a
strengthening of the institutional framework of the financial system regulatory agencies: BCRD,
SB, SIV, SIPEN, and of the Public Debt Department of MIFIN. These and other aspects of
institutional development impact are discussed in depth in the earlier sections on implementation
and outcomes.

Not applicable.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: significant

91.       As stated in the PAD, the principal risks to this Project are:

         Onslaught of another banking crisis.

          A number of initiatives by the regulatory agencies and supported by the Project have
          reduced vulnerabilities to both, external financial shocks and internal systemic crises.
          However, more work is needed to establish better defenses. For example, the recent
          submittal of a draft law to increase the powers of SB to take preemptive actions to
          require that banks increase capital would be an important tool in preventing systemic
          problems. The Bank had also discussed with the Government carrying out a simulation
          exercise of a banking crisis that could help diagnose potential weaknesses in the event of
          a crisis. While the securities market has not been afflicted by unexpected turbulence, a


                                                   25
    crisis in this sector could have system-wide repercussions. What mechanisms do
    regulators have to respond in the case of a massive selloff of securities? The securities
    market has expanded very rapidly in the past ten years, although it is still small when
    compared to the banking system.

    On a positive note, the recent global financial crisis appears to have had only a modest to
    moderate impact on the financial system mainly through some reduction in liquidity
    ratios. Banks were not exposed to the type of financial instruments that suffered severe
    losses in value in other markets.

   Lack of political commitment to strengthen the supervisory agencies

    While much progress has been achieved during the past ten years in the regulatory
    environment, more work needs to be done in order to keep pace with rapidly evolving
    financial markets. Full implementation of risk-based supervision across all sectors is still
    not a reality, and IFRS have not been implemented yet, thus reducing the transparency in
    the financial sector and hampering the harmonization of policies between the different
    superintendencies. However, the regulatory agencies will need support in terms of
    financial resources as well as approval of key pieces of legislation needed to further
    strengthen their ability to effectively regulate markets. The long delay in Project
    effectiveness was a reflection of weak political support for reforms in the financial
    system. The draft of the reform to the LMF is still waiting approval in Congress since
    March 2011. The lack of Government response regarding participation by the Insurance
    Superintendency was a setback to the goal of strengthening the financial sector
    regulatory environment.

   Lack of coordination among financial agencies in establishing a level playing field for
    all intermediaries in the financial system.

    Some of the regulatory agencies have been around longer than others. This is reflected in
    their institutional development. One of the critical success factors in the establishment of
    an effective regulatory environment is to have close coordination of supervisory
    activities. Currently there are differing standards for financial instruments such as the
    case of valuation of securities and the form of marking-to-market. To the extent that
    financial information is not represented in an identical format across different markets,
    there is a high likelihood of non-stable market activities. Consolidated supervision will
    not work without close cooperation and information sharing by all regulatory agencies.
    The Government presented a draft law to congress on financial groups that would
    establish the groundwork for better coordination between financial system regulators, but
    it is still awaiting approval.

   New market challenges that may not be appropriately addressed by the regulatory
    agencies.

    Financial innovations are an opportunity as well as a challenge because of inherent risks
    that are not fully understood. One of the current challenges in the financial system is how


                                            26
        to promote the growth of the securities market in view of the sizeable growth of pension
        funds. As pension contributions continue to grow, particularly with successful efforts at
        raising participation in the pension system, the pension funds will need to find new
        investment alternatives that will offer attractive returns while keeping within acceptable
        levels of risk. If those opportunities do not materialize, pension funds could end up
        taking greater risks or retirees may find their livelihood threatened by insufficient funds
        in their accounts. At the same time, the introduction of new financial instruments that
        appeal to pension funds but whose risks are not fully understood could undermine the
        stability of the financial system as the recent global financial crisis demonstrated.

92.     The sustainability of the Project’s outcomes depends on the effectiveness of the
Government and the regulatory agencies in addressing the above-mentioned challenges.
Notwithstanding the positive performance of the banking system since the 2001 crisis, including
the time during the global financial crisis,, the continuing challenges facing the regulatory
system posed by the above-mentioned factors combined with the likelihood of external and
internal shocks that could undermine the stability of the financial sector lead to a risk assessment
for the Project’s development outcome that is deemed significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

93.     As discussed in section 2.1, the Bank designed a relatively complex Project in view of the
limited capacity for implementation. Other projects from the IMF and IDB were running
concurrently. There was a need to make trade-offs in the design of a much less complex
operation, notwithstanding of the importance of all the components for a strategy. A simpler
project may have been more effective. As mentioned earlier, another option would have been to
extend the execution time and to phase activities over time thus reducing complexity while
keeping mechanisms in place to adjust the Project’s activities as needed. The use of a
contingency fund as part of the Project was a good idea in view of the fluid situation in the
banking system. On the other hand, better M&E arrangements would have facilitated project
supervision and thus effectiveness.

94.     The large number of participating agencies made the implementation arrangements much
more challenging. In addition to the UNDP as financial controller and procurement agent, it
would have been useful to hire staff with operational experience as overall project coordinator.
The decision to drop the UNDP from the Project proved to be a strategic mistake in view of the
difficulties in managing the work flow that plagued implementation. Another option could have
been to hire a full-time project coordinator with long experience with Bank procurement; such an
individual could have been very useful in assisting the other participating agencies during the
procurement process.




                                                27
95.     Complex design and a less than satisfactory project management arrangement were
detrimental to the Project outcomes. For these reasons, Bank performance in ensuring quality at
entry is judged to be moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: moderately satisfactory.

96.     This was a complex project with ambitious goals whose challenges were compounded by
delays in its operational start. In response to the slow pace of disbursements during the initial
implementation period the Bank attempted to provide additional support to the PCU and the
participating agencies, especially in the area of procurement; but in the end these initiatives
could not overcome the fundamental challenges posed by the Project’s design. Even with the
pickup in disbursements during the latter years which contributed to a material improvement in
outcomes, additional efforts would have been necessary to achieve the outcomes that were
originally envisioned for a much shorter implementation period.

97.    It was mentioned by the participating agencies that the changes in the Bank’s Project
management was a challenge since it took each new task manager some time to get up to speed
with the many ongoing activities. The team did, however augment formal supervision activities
with work done under the DR FSAP and work carried out in support of a fiscal Development
Policy Loan (DPL).

98.    The Project was restructured in 2009 following the Mid-Term Review mission in
2008.This restructuring, combined with intensive supervision, and allowed activities to be
completed with good results. Considering all of the above discussed factors, Bank performance
during supervision is thus deemed moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory

99.     The issues of Project design and missteps regarding the financial management aspects
compromised the final outcome; however, the restructuring of the Project in 2009 was able to
keep the more productive activities in line and achieve the goals of some of the components. The
overall evaluation of Bank performance is thus rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory

100. At the start, the Government was keenly interested in the objectives of this Project. As
stated in the PAD, the Government reached out to the Bank, the IMF, and the IDB to assist in the
resolution of the 2003 banking crisis. Because of immediate and concerted actions by the BCRD
and SB to isolate the problems with the banks, recovery took place sooner than expected. The
IMF Stand-by Agreement for $620 million also relieved the financial burden of the bank bailout.




                                               28
These factors helped to clear the sense of urgency that had been felt during the initial project
design period.

101. A waning of Government commitment is evident in the long delay of Project
effectiveness. It appears that improved efficiency and reduction of risk in the financial system in
the wake of a potentially serious banking crisis was not a priority for Congress. The cancellation
of the Insurance Superintendency component was made even after the PCU representative and
the Bank approached the Government to explain the importance for Project outcome to have the
participation of all the regulatory agencies. Insufficient support by BCRD to the PCU also
contributed to the implementation problems described in this report. Even though BCRD
replaced UNDP as the Project’s financial control unit, it was not given sufficient resources to
staff the unit adequately. In addition to this, the Congress apparently has not given sufficient
importance to the passing of the amendments to the LMF which would establish, among other
things, the much needed legal base to the introduction of risk-based and consolidated
supervision.

102. For these reasons Government performance in this project is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory

103. The initial implementing agency arrangements involved contracting UNDP to manage the
financial and procurement aspects and the central PCU acting as a coordinator across the other
participating agencies. The decision to assign all those responsibilities to the central PCU when
its staff did not have the experience with this type of procurement process was a setback to
Project outcomes. Other participating agencies expressed frustration with slow response and lack
of technical expertise on procurement matters in fact some processed some of their procurement
requests directly with the Bank. Notwithstanding the procurement function in some agencies also
suffered from lack of experience which also aggravated the delays in project implementation.

104. Bank staff recommended on numerous occasions that the PCU hire an expert on
procurement to work with all participating agencies and improve the performance of the Project.
The complexity of design had also been a factor in the project’s slow progress. On the verge of a
decision to cancel the Project, the PCU was authorized to hire an expert on a part-time basis who
was able to make moderate improvements in the procurement process. However, one person on a
part-time basis was not enough to resolve the implementation bottlenecks that had plagued the
project. But with the additional support from the PCU and greater involvement by the
participating agencies, the Project was able to reach its target by the final closing date. At the
time of this evaluation some deficiencies in financial accounting had yet to be resolved.

105. The problems with the central PCU unit were not resolved in a satisfactory manner by the
Government, although PCU staff and some of the sub-units of the PCU in the participating
agencies made good efforts to process the RFPs, execute contracts, and monitor implementation,
others did not have experienced staff that could guide the sub-projects effectively through their
completion. These efforts were reinforced by 13 procurement related workshops provided by



                                                29
Bank during the life of the Project. After the 2009 Project restructuring and with the Bank
training support on procurement, the implementing agencies were instrumental in speeding up
disbursements towards the end. This evaluation thus considers the rating of the Implementing
Agencies’ Performance as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: moderately satisfactory

106. Based on the above comments, the combined rating for Government and Implementing
Agency performance is deemed moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

107.   The principal lessons learned are:

      During difficult times and when there is limited implementation capacity it is important
       to keep the design of a project simple even if the project is smaller. This Project was too
       complex with multiple implementing agencies. Given the limited experience with
       financial sector operations in the Dominican Republic the FSTAL should have been
       structured as a simple project with clean implementation arrangements or alternatively
       with a longer execution period and a phased approach, in which triggers would be
       established for each phase of implementation. If successful, a follow up operation or
       phases of a longer duration project could have maintained the continuity of institutional
       support while being more responsive to changing TA needs over time. The best indicator
       of project sustainability is borrower engagement in follow-up operations. The FSTAL
       tried to address too many challenges in the financial system but it should have been more
       selective particularly with the high degree of uncertainty at the time of project design.

      A complex TA with numerous components should have a highly experienced
       implementation team supported by a high frequency of Bank supervision missions. The
       PCU and its sub-units in the participating agencies in some ways acted as a bottleneck in
       implementation. Part of the problem was the absence of highly skilled procurement and
       financial management experts. When the agencies’ management capacities are limited the
       Bank should establish a clear conditioning that the PCU have the needed staff with
       sufficient funding during the implementation period. In addition, it may consider
       substituting lack of capacity with increased supervision, which in the end could yield
       better performance and thus higher economic rates of return.

      A TA project to assist a government in managing the fallout from a financial crisis should
       include non-allocated funds as a contingency. The design of the FSTAL included a
       US$2.0 million contingency fund in case there was a resurgence of the crisis. This is a
       very good design feature for projects that operate in a fluid environment where there may
       be a need to respond quickly with additional resources in areas not previously
       contemplated. The restructuring of project components in 2009 provided an opportunity
       to reallocate the contingency funds, but since the likelihood of a crisis had notably



                                               30
       subsided by then, these resources were utilized to support new TA needs that fit within
       the Project’s objective.

      The Bank should move faster to restructure slow moving projects.

Annex 2: Outputs by Components
In order to provide a better understanding of what was achieved under the Project, this annex
provides a brief summary of the main activities financed by the FSTAL.

Strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank and statistics improvement
108. Due to the delays in initiating project execution, the BCRD authorities had to implement
some of the activities of this component with their own funds. With the reallocation of Project
funds in 2009, from the cancellation of the SS component and the availability of the contingency
funds for project activities, BCRD used its allotment of those resources to upgrade its IT capacity
and strengthening of its strategic planning unit.

       Joint BCRD – SB information portal One of the new initiatives under this component
       was the development of a joint BCRD – SB online portal to serve as a joint platform for
       submission by financial institutions of information required by both regulatory agencies
       in a standard format.

Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Banking Superintendency (SB)
109. In support of SB initiatives the FSTAL:
     Financed consulting work for both the design and implementation of a Strategic Plan and,
       in January 2007, the SB approved its new organizational structure which incorporated the
       risk-based supervision model.
     Contributed to the training of SB’s personnel in the areas of risk-based supervision, IT
       auditing function, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
       (AML/CFT), operational risks, project management, and consolidated supervision.
     Contributed to the acquisition of IT equipment to handle the agency’s increased
       information requirements; and to support the new risk-based supervisory strategy,
       including the SB’s IT auditing function.

Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Securities Superintendency (SIV)
110. The FSTAL financed the following activities:
     Elaboration of the reform project of the Securities Market Law (in process).
     Diagnostic of the securities and products market in DR, identification of the main
       constraints in the securities market, and proposal of an integral strategy for the securities
       markets development and promotion.
     Implementation of the Accounting Plan and Manual as part of the issuance of secondary
       regulations.
     Development of the SIV’s supervisory capacity through the implementation of the
       automated system for off-site supervision, implementation of both the financial
       information remission system and the digitalized audit system for on-site supervision.
     Strengthening of the SIV’s technological platform to support the on-site and off-site
       supervisory function.
     Strengthening of the SIV’s human resources through training activities.




                                                34
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Pensions Superintendency (SIPEN)

111. The FSTAL supported the institution’s strategy development through the following
activities:
     Strengthening of SIPEN’s capacity regarding strategy management, project management,
         and quality assurance.
     Support and strengthening of the technical and administrative units within the SP,
         including quality controls as well as the IT platform.
     Realigning of the business and support processes with the management of human
         Resources.
     Strengthening of the operational processes and supervisory mechanisms of the
         Investments Control Unit.

112.   With respect to risk classification of alternative investment schemes:
      Elaboration of the approval methodologies for investment fund’s quotas and foreign
       securities classification.
      Strengthening of the methodologies for risk classification of different investment
       alternatives for pension funds.

Payments and Securities Settlement Systems Reform
113. The FSTAL provided financial resources for the modernization of the National Payments
System through the acquisition and implementation of a modern Real Time Gross Settlement
System (RTGS), which processes all high value and time critical payments transactions
including final settlement of clearing balances produced by all other systems. The RTGS system
started its operations in April 2008. The establishment of an automated check clearing house was
also financed by the Project and became operational in April 2012.

Regulatory development of the LMF
114. Building on the changes in the Constitution that were approved in early 2010 and that
strengthened the autonomy of BCRD, amendments to the LMF were submitted to Congress in
March 2011. Regulations for conglomerates and leasing and factoring were drafted as well as the
amendments to the insurance law.

Debt management and development of fixed income markets
115. The Law creating a new organizational structure in the Ministry of Finance was passed in
2006 along with the implementing regulations establishing the organization of Public Debt
Department. Resources from the FSTAL contributed to the capacity building of the middle office
area of the Department through the design of a risk management strategy. In addition, an
important sub-component consisted of the upgrade of the debt management system software
(SIGADE) which incorporates a more powerful IT platform for managing debt information and
processing of debt servicing. The SIGADE software also includes an application for debt
analytics including modeling capabilities to perform simulations of alternative debt strategies.
This component is expected to become operational in 2012. The Bank also financed some of the
work in the design and implementation of data base management software (UEPEX) that
interfaces with SIGADE and was deployed by MIFIN in 2009. This program has a module for
tracking budget resources execution and fund accounting.

Annex 4: Macro Outcomes Achieved

116. As explained in the section on outcomes, this Project has achieved a significant number
of outcomes through the institutional capacity of the monetary authorities and of the regulatory
agencies. These outcomes should in turn be reflected in greater efficiency of financial activities
and reduced likelihood of a financial crisis. The market outcomes reviewed in this section pertain
to the banking system, the pension funds, the securities markets, and the overall indicator of
reduced crisis probability.

Banking system trends
117. The banking system has benefitted from the initiatives supported by the Project in terms
of performance and reduced risk of another crisis. Despite the severity of the 2003 crisis,
earnings in the commercial banking system recovered strongly by 2005 as shown by that year’s
ROE of 17.5 percent. This also supports the conclusion that the Government’s response through
the bailout of the failed banks quickly contained a potentially systemic crisis. The emphasis on
risk-based supervision and thus on risks affecting the banks can be attributed to improved ratios
on loan quality and the moderately higher leverage capital ratios. However, some reduction in
liquidity is noted from 30.1 percent in 2005 to 24.5 percent in 2011.

118. The ability of the banking system to withstand external shocks has notably improved as
demonstrated by the results of the international financial crisis in 2008. As the global financial
system experienced severe liquidity problems and a surge in bank failures, performance of the
banking system in the DR was robust with only a moderate decline in profitability in 2009, yet
continued improvement in asset quality. Nevertheless, the lack of global liquidity did impact the
banks’ liquidity ratio which declined from 29.2 percent in 2008 to 25.5 percent in 2011, which
resulted in large part from global banks’ adoption of across-the-board cutbacks in international
lines of credit.

Securities market trends
119. An analysis of recent trends in the securities market focuses on the activities related to
registered private sector securities. The dominant role of public sector securities, mainly BCRD
and MIFIN securities issued in the domestic financial market is reflected in the discussion of the
BCRD re-capitalization and the public debt management components. As shown in Table A4-2
below the development of the private securities market has fluctuated notable during the past
three years. Primary market activities have been dominated by financial intermediaries, which
have averaged 58.1percent during 2005-2011 in domestic currency, and by manufacturing
enterprises, representing 30.0 percent during the same period. While there is strong growth in the
volume of secondary market activity during 2009 – 2011, it is still very small when compared to
the volume of transactions in public sector securities.

Pension System Trends
120. The pension system has experienced strong growth during the Project implementation
period. During 2005 – 2011 the size of the pension funds’ investment portfolio has expanded at


                                                                 39
an average annual rate of 41.6 percent, and if this trend continues it will greatly increase the
demand for investible securities. Table A4-3 below shows how the current portfolio of the
pension funds is highly concentrated in debt instruments of the public sector, BCRD and MIFIN,
and of the financial institutions. The investments in corporate bonds are significantly lower than
implied by their importance within the securities markets. One of the sub-components of the
Project was the strengthening of the investment regulations of SIPEN and greater flexibility of
viable investment instruments; however, it appears to have had limited impact on market
developments so far.

121. The average rate of return for pension portfolios, or the system average, during the past
five years has been 11.69 percent and the standard deviation of returns was only 2.3 percent,
which is consistent with the relatively conservative nature of the portfolios, mostly BCRD and
financial institutions debt paper. The deviation in average returns between each of the four AFPs
and the system average was 0.4 percentage point; this narrow differential reflects the investment
rule that penalizes an AFP if their return deviates beyond a specified margin with respect to the
system average.

122. While the contribution of the Project to the institutional development of the Pension
Superintendency was significant, the outcomes in terms of market development particularly
greater market efficiency through diversification of pension fund investments and higher returns
to the beneficiaries have been more limited.

Confidence in the financial system
123. One of the original outcome indicators was the reduction of crisis probability and
increase of efficiency levels as measured by the ratio of M2 to GDP where an increase in the
ratio was interpreted as greater confidence in the financial system. During the implementation
period the M2/GDP indicator has decreased steadily. There are several possible explanations for
these results. First, this measure may be more relevant in capturing the medium-term impact on
the financial system, thus its consideration at this point may not be advisable. And second, the

ratio has shown a moderate downturn since 2007 which could be explained by the spill-over
effects of the global financial crisis by reducing the level of confidence in the financial system.

Annex 9. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The following is a summary of the Borrower’s comments, which were provided as comments
made into the Spanish translation of the original ICR document. Minor changes, which were
mostly of editorial nature, were incorporated directly into the text. All other comments are listed
below, separating those related to the ratings from all others. In the cases of comments that led to
changes in the document, these changes are mentioned as a footnote to the Borrower’s
comments.

1) Overall rating:
The Borrower does not agree with the Government's overall rating and points at the different
treatment of the Bank and the Borrower in the ICR (where the Bank’s rating was moderately
unsatisfactory at entry and moderately satisfactory for supervision, obtaining an overall rating of
moderately satisfactory while the Borrower was granted an overall rating of moderately
satisfactory following a partial rating of moderately unsatisfactory for Government performance
and a moderately satisfactory rating for Implementing agency performance)6.

2) Other comments:

Paragraph 33:
The Borrower suggested adding (under title “Project Component 7 - Regulatory development of
the LMF?):
 “These amendments were submitted to Congress for approval, through communication No.2953
of March 31, 2011 (check link below).
http://bcintranet:8080/normativa/normas_proceso/financieros/remision_poder_ejecutivo_proyect
o_modificación_LMF.pdf “
The Borrower suggested adding at the end of the paragraph:
“This (legal) project is in its final phase, it was previously agreed with the Superintendency of
Banks and the Association of Commercial Banks of the Dominican Republic, and will be
submitted to the Monetary Board in the coming days.?

Paragraph 35:
The Borrower suggested a change to the text (under title “Application of the new Country
Financing Parameters?):
Replace “thus overcoming a barrier to loan disbursements, in view of the magnitude of taxes
applied to consultants’ services.? with
“this allowed the project to finance "reasonable taxes" with Bank resources, rather than requiring
local counterpart contributions. These new parameters began to be applied on April 30, 2009.?




6
  The overall rating of the borrower performance was adjusted in the ICR to moderately satisfactory -without
changing the partial ratings- considering the elements presented by the borrower (such as the passing of the law for
the development of a market for mortgages) which provided some elements that show a slightly stronger
commitment than captured during the field work.


                                                         48
Paragraph 51:
The Borrower suggested deleting the complete paragraph 51 (under title “Adequacy of
Government Commitment?):
“Initially the Government was actively engaged in the Project preparation along with the
participating agencies which worked closely with the Bank. Once the immediate crisis
environment settled, Government commitment to the Project was not as strong. The delay in
congressional approval of the Project was an indication that post-crisis support for the Project’s
objectives was waning. The change in Government in 2004 also diminished the level of support.
Eventually the Insurance Superintendency component was cancelled due to lack of commitment.
After the Government requested that the UNDP be replaced by the Central Bank’s PCU, the
financial management unit did not receive the financial resources to comply with the additional
responsibilities resulting hereof.?

Paragraph 56:
The borrower added the following comments (under title “Change in Project Coordination
Unit?):
“It should be noted that the PCU was subject to review of procedures every six months; in no
case was a violation of Bank rules noted. No objections were made to procedures, except for one
case of shopping, corresponding to one of the UTs (technical units), which did not have any
major consequences, since the objection referred to a simple procedural fault. The report
submitted by the World Bank’s task team leader on October 20, 2009 states in its item 1, that the
UCP lacked a Procurement Specialist dedicated exclusively to the World Bank procedures.
Although it is true that there was no dedicated Procurement Specialist for the World Bank, it is
important to clarify in this regard that all procedures were carried out by BCRD in accordance of
the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines. In response to the above mentioned report, a process of
comparison of at least 3 CVs was initiated, which resulted in the hiring of a procurement
specialist in June 2010 for a period of six months. It must be noted, the only about US$ 2
million, out of the total amount disbursed of US$12,006,864.79, corresponded to contracts
signed after the recruitment of this consultant, reflecting that the PCU had managed the project
satisfactorily until then7.?

Opinion of the Superintendency of Pensions:

There is no evidence that the performance of the PCU adversely affected (the achievement of)
the project's objectives. In this regard, the experts who worked for the Project Coordination Unit
of the Central Bank informed us in several occasions about the procurement processes.

Opinion of the Ministry of Finance:
In relation to the activities performed by the PCU, the General Direction of Public Debt
considers that it received the necessary help and support to achieve the objectives set for the
project, being correctly assisted every time it was needed.?

  As noted in the ICR, the absence of procurement expertise during longer periods of the project execution increased
significantly the amount of time to award contracts and to disburse funds as well as the level of effort, that was
needed to supervise the Project by the World Bank. This situation led procurement performance to be rated in some
ISRs as moderately unsatisfactory

Paragraph 62:
The Borrower deleted the following (under title “M&E Utilization?:
“however, it did not keep up-to-date detailed records on a consolidated basis in terms of the
purpose of each sub-project, costs, contracts, disbursements procurement methods and output.?
The Borrower added instead the following comment:
“We differ in this aspect, since the quarterly reports submitted to the Task Manager never were
subject to any remarks neither by him nor by the Financial Specialist of the Bank. The models
used in these reports were the standard formats that we were provided to us by the World Bank.
The Quarterly Progress Report submitted to the Bank, includes information related to the
procurement method, amount of the contract and the cumulative payments during the quarter.?

Paragraph 63:
The Borrower added the following comment (under title “2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary
Compliance?):
 “In reference to the procurement reports conducted biannually by Bank staff, the highlighted
deficiencies had no direct relation with the level of concern mentioned in this paragraph, being
the main concerns operational and of minor significance. The phrase: ‘Some of the basic
information on project outputs was found to be incomplete, in some cases the information for
some sub-projects was not consolidated with the overall schedule of Project implementation
which was needed as part of ongoing supervision.’ could not be understood?

Paragraph 64:
The Borrower added the following comment (under title “2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next
Phase?):
“Central Bank authorities have not ruled out the formulation of requests for technical assistance
to carry out a financial crisis simulation exercise or with respect to the supply of financial
services to MSMEs, the first of which requires an active participation of the Superintendency of
Banks and of the Ministry of Finance. The World Bank will be informed in a timely manner of
this decision.?

Paragraph 92:
The Borrower suggested deleting the following sentence (under the title “Lack of political
commitment to strengthen the supervisory agencies?):
“The long delay in Project effectiveness was a reflection of weak political support for reforms in
the financial system.?

The borrower added the following comment (under title “New market challenges that may not be
appropriately addressed by the regulatory agencies?):
“In 2011 the National Congress approved Law No. 189-11 Ley para el Desarrollo del Mercado
Hipotecario y el Fideicomiso en la República Dominicana (Law for the Development of the
Market for Mortgages and Trusts in the Dominican Republic), which creates several new
instruments into which pension fund managers have the opportunity to invest their resources,
properly insured, and with the privilege of first claims in the process of exclusion of assets and
liabilities; in the case of resolution of a financial intermediary, which gives greater security to the
holder of such securities.?

Paragraph 101:
The Borrower added the following comment (under title “Government Performance?):
“The BCRD, pursuant to the Loan Agreement of the Financial Sector Technical Assistance
Loan, did set up a PCU which comprised four technicians who were in charge of the functions of
Procurement, Financial Management and Supervision of the work of the PCU, which shows the
support from the BCRD to the project. It also appointed an officer of the Central Bank as
General Coordinator, who served as a channel and link between the other UTs (technical units)
and the World Bank’s offices, both local and in Washington. Moreover, the technological and
human infrastructure of the Central Bank was available for the PCU, which executed all
transactions and processes that were required by said PCU).?

Paragraph 103:
The borrower inserted the following comments (under title “Implementing Agency or Agencies
Performance?)
“Following the (World)- Bank's policies, request for no objection related to terms of reference,
bidding documents, procurement plan, as well as any other activity (could not be presented by
the technical entities), directly to the Task Manager, since these requests had to be handled
through the PCU. On the other hand, the Borrower did not agree with the comments that the
PCU was responsible for delays in the processes, as mentioned by other agencies.?

Paragraph 104:
The Borrower inserted the following comments:
“The Procurement Report of October 20, 2009, recommended the hiring of the Procurement
Specialist, and the PCU initiated the process drafting the TORs and finally hiring such
professional. This hiring complemented development of the Project. With regards to the
accounting deficiencies that are mentioned, it has to be noted that the project’s accounting was
carried out using the same platform that is used by the Central Bank for its own accounting. This
platform has not received any negative comments, qualifications or adverse opinions from the
audit firms that audit the Project.?

Paragraph 105:
The Borrower added the following comment:
“On another issue, the borrower is only aware of four workshops that were organized by the
World Bank instead of the thirteen mentioned in the document.?
