I. THE TOURISM SECTOR
1.01      Despite its varied attractions, the Dominican Republic has been
a late starter in the Caribbean tourism trade. Up until 1970 the country's
accommodation capacity amounted to about 1,100 rooms catering mainly to busi-
ness traffic. In the '70s, with a return to political stability and the
introduction of a generous incentives system, private investors undertook a
program of hotel construction which brought the country's capacity to about
3,570 rooms (Table 1, Annex I). This additional capacity, two thirds of which
is located in the capital city of Santo Domingo, includes three large luxury
establishments planned to cater to affluent North American business and leisure
visitors plus a number of small hotels aimed at domestic and Puerto Rican
visitor traffic. Despite considerable gains (para. 1.03), visitor traffic has
not matched thus far the abrupt increase in accommodations in Santo Domingo.
While slow economic growth in the Dominican Republic has constrained the
expansion of business traffic, Santo Domingo's limited tourism assets (the
capital city has neither beaches nor the tropical atmosphere that the typical
tourist expects to find in the Caribbean) have failed to attract the number
of vacationers hotel investors had expected. As room occupancies and prices
declined (the latter under the impact of the luxury hotels' efforts to market
their services to cheap package tours) (Tables 2 and 3, Annex I) the operating
results of Santo Domingo's accommodations deteriorated, leading to a halt in
construction of new hotels in the capital city. With the expected gradual
build-up of business demand, occupancies and tariffs are expected to increase
to levels ensuring the profitability of most establishments except the
lavishly expensive.
1.02      The Dominican Republic has only started to tap its beaches, its
best tourism asset. In 1977 Dominican beach hotels had a total capacity of
780 rooms; by comparison beach hotels in the Bahamas and Jamaica had capaci-
ties of 4,400 and 7,500 rooms respectively. The Republic's beach accommoda-
tions include the luxury La Romana resort owned by the US company, Gulf
and Western, the Government owned complex in Samana and smaller, largely
privately-owned hotels scattered along the coast. Beach hotels are faring
reasonably well with occupancies around 60% (Tables 2 and 3, Annex I).
1.03      Foreign visitor traffic by air to the Dominican Republic grew by
some 18% annually over the 1968-77 period and the country's share in the total
Caribbean traffic increased from 1.2% to 3.6% (Tables 4 and 5, Annex I). In
1977 airborne foreign tourists numbered 262,400. 1/ Over the 1968-77 period,
the number of cruise visitors to the Dominican Republic increased at the
spectacular annual rate of 52%, attaining a level of 133,400 in 1977. About
90% of the 1977 cruise arrivals were recorded at Puerto Plata on the north
coast; Santo Domingo and Samana shared the remainder.
1/   In 1977 Dominican tourism statistics also recorded 47,100 arrivals by
Dominicans residing abroad, mainly in the US and Venezuela. The large
majority of them visit the country for Christmas and the summer vacation
and stay with friends or relatives.



1.04      Dominican Republic tourism is overwhelmingly dependent on the US
market which generates over 80% of all arrivals, one third of whom are Puerto
Ricans. The number of visitors from Europe and Canada have doubled since 1975
and together currently account for 8% of all arrivals (Table 6, Annex I).
Tourism traffic is seasonal with two peaks, December and July, and two valleys,
April-May and September-October (Table 7, Annex I). The Dominican Republic's
progressive tapping of the holiday market and the introduction of 7 nights/8
days packages have resulted in increased concentration of airborne tourists in
the period December-February and in lengthened sojourns (the average stay of
foreign visitors has extended from 4.5 to 6.4 days between 1970 and 1977).
1.05      In keeping with the experience of most other tourism destinations,
the composition of foreign visitor traffic in the Dominican Republic has
changed as accommodations have expanded and diversified. According to a
survey carried out by the Central Bank, the share of business traffic, which
is relatively insensitive to supply increases, declined from 43% in the winter
season of 1972/73 to 20% in the winter season of 1976/77; conversely, the
share of holiday visitors increased from 29% to 44%. For the entire year, an
estimated 50% of total foreign visitors by air are now holiday visitors, 30%
business visitors and the balance are attracted to the Dominican Republic for
mixed pleasure and business reasons or for visiting relatives and friends.
1.06      Tourism's major economic impact is on the balance of payments and
employment. In 1977 airborne visitors spent on an average an estimated US$44
per day and cruise visitors an estimated US$16 per visit. On this basis,
gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism would be about US$77 million,
representing 10% of total merchandise exports in the same year (Table 8,
Annex I). Since the import component of tourism receipts is estimated at
about 25%, the net foreign exchange receipts of the sector in 1977 amounted
to about US$58 million.
1.07      Direct employment in tourism consists primarily of jobs in hotels
and other tourism facilities and self-employment opportunities in transport
and the production and sale of handicrafts. Employment in hotels, restaurants
and entertainment is estimated at somewhat more than 5,000 persons. Over 1,500
people are employed in the production and sale of handicrafts, most of which
are purchased by tourists, and another 500 in internal transport catering to
tourists, which includes taxis, buses and domestic aviation. In total, as
many as 7,000 persons earn their livelihood from tourism. Further indirect
employment is generated in other activities (e.g., agriculture and light
industry) which supply part of their output to the tourism sector.
1.08      The rapid increase of tourism facilities in the Republic has been
encouraged by highly generous incentives. The tourism incentives law of 1971
(Law 153) grants full exemption from income taxes for ten years to all approved
projects and, if the need is demonstrated in the project feasibility study or
if at least half the ownership of the enterprise is in Dominican hands, the
exemption can be extended to 15 years. In addition, the law provides exonera-
tion (for the same period) from construction, registration and capital sub-
scription taxes. Tourism investors are exempted from all duties on imported
materials and equipment necessary at both construction and operation stages,



- 3 -
provided these cannot be obtained locally at competitive prices and comparable
quality. Furthermore, the foreign exchange necessary for these imports is
provided by the Central Bank at the official exchange rate. 1/ Finally,
profits invested in tourism, irrespective of their origin, are not subject to
income tax. The incentives system is administered by a Tourism Development
Board, chaired by the Director of Tourism (para. 1.10) and including repres-
entatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce,
the Technical Secretariat of the President's Office, the Central Bank and
the private sector. Until recently, the Board granted incentives routinely
following only a scant review of the proposals submitted. Also, in the past,
the President's Office granted incentives beyond those included in the law, a
situation which led to a number of abuses.
1.09      The Direccion Nacional de Tourismo e Informacion (DNTI) and the
Central Bank of the Dominican Republic have responsibilities in the tourism
sector. DNTI, established in the President's Office in 1968, is in charge of
promoting foreign tourism, formulating tourism policies and regulating tourism
development. Until recently, DNTI's resources were limited--a budget of about
RD$ 1 million in 1978 and a staff of 50, including fewer than ten with pro-
fessional training--and was unable to fulfill its mandate. Most of the
country's promotion as a tourism destination has thus resulted from the
marketing effort of hotel firms, especially the Gulf and Western subsidiary,
rather than from DNTI's endeavors. The Central Bank has taken over the
responsibility of producing statistics. Planning, project analysis and
regulatory functions in the tourism sector have never been properly exercised.
1.10      In September 1971 the Monetary Board decided that the Central
Bank should become more deeply involved in the tourism sector and created the
Departamento para el Desarrollo de la Infraestructura Turistica (INFRATUR).
INFRATUR was allocated an initial RD$ 5 million to develop and administer
tourism infrastructure projects. Later it became the channel for Central Bank
financing of both hotel and handicrafts projects. INFRATUR sponsored the
studies for two integrated resorts. The one at Boca Chica near Santo Domingo
was aimed primarily at the domestic market but did not materialize, chiefly
because of difficulties in securing the land. The other, on the north coast
near Puerto Plata, was aimed at the international market and proposed develop-
ment of the sites of Playa Dorada and Playa Grande, located 5 and 80 km
respectively, east of the city of Puerto Plata (see Map 10759R). In November
1974 the Bank approved a US$21 million loan (first Puerto Plata tourism
project, Loan 1051-DO) to the Central Bank to finance the infrastructure
works (site preparation, roads, water, sewerage, power and telecommuni-
cations systems) and common facilities for Playa Dorada and Playa Grande.
Development of the two sites would then be continued by private investors,
both local and foreign, who would build accommodations for a total of 5,200
1/   Otherwise hotal investors would have to pay for their imports with
foreign exchange purchased on the parallel market at a premium which now
stands at about 25%.



-4-
rooms. The Bank loan also included funds for the terminal building of the
Puerto Plata International Airport, the runway of which was constructed in
1971.
1.11      In order to encourage hotel investment, the Government has provided
not only the tax and other incentives described above, but has also assisted
in providing loan capital on terms appropriate for hotel investors. As in
most developing countries, no private domestic financing institutions are able
or willing to provide funds on the terms required--at least 12 years' maturity,
with a grace period covering a major part of the construction and start-up
period, and at market rates of interest--while the amount of private loan
capital obtainable from abroad for hotel investment is severely limited.
Consequently, in order to mobilize private equity capital for hotel construc-
tion, the Central Bank has provided long-term loan capital.
1.12      Until the establishment of INFRATUR, the Central Bank had been pro-
viding funds through its Fondo de Inversiones para el Desarrollo Economico
(FIDE) for small hotels, mainly located in Santo Domingo. INFRATUR has con-
centrated its financing on large hotels and its portfolio includes 11 loans
to 6 hotels, mostly in Santo Domingo, for a total of RD$ 35 million. Funds
for the hotel credit operations came from its original RD$ 5 million, loans
from two private foreign banks for a total of US$18 million, 1/ and interest-
free advances from the Central Bank. Since the Central Bank, of which INFRATUR
is a part, lends directly only to financial intermediaries, INFRATUR's hotel
credit funds are channeled through financial intermediaries who carry the
commercial risk. Because of the size of the loans and the risk involved,
only the Government-owned Banco de Reservas and the Bank of America controlled-
Corporacion Financiera Asociada 2/ have been willing to make hotel loans.
INFRATUR has been lending up to 70% of estimated project costs, for terms of
up to 30 years including grace periods of up to 10 years, at an interest rate
of 5% (9 loans) and 9% (the 2 most recent loans) to intermediaries and 9% and
11% to final borrowers (Table 9, Annex I). 3/ INFRATUR's experience in hotel
financing has been disappointing. The three luxury hotels it financed in
Santo Domingo were plagued with cost overruns and contributed to overcapacity
1/   Including US$15.0 million from the Royal Bank of Canada (at interest
rates of 1% over LIBOR for the first five years and 1-1/8% over LIBOR
thereafter, with 12 years' maturity including five years' grace) and
US$3.0 million from a consortium headed by the Chemical Bank of New
York (interest 1.25% over LIBOR with eight years' maturity including
four years of grace).
2/   The loans through Corporacion Financiera Asociada were guaranteed by
Gulf and Western.
3/   For two hotels the Central Bank also agreed that "blocked" funds be
invested and that they be registered as foreign capital and as such
be eligible for repatriation as dividends.

in this category of establishment (para. 1.01). To date none of these hotels
has been profitable. Although they are still in the grace period of their
loans, two of them are in arrears in payment of interest to the financial
intermediaries.
1.13      Sale of handicraft products to tourists represents a potentially
significant source of benefits from the growth of tourism to the Dominican
Republic. These benefits, however, have been limited because the existing
handicraft products are often of poor workmanship and unimaginative design
and are poorly marketed.
1.14      On August 12, 1976 the Monetary Board provided INFRATUR with
RD$ 500,000 to assist the Fundacion Dominicana de Desarrollo (FDD) in develop-
ing handicrafts production for export and sale to tourists. FDD is a private
non-profit institution devoted to developing rural areas. Through its handi-
crafts program, FDD trains artisans, helps them organize their cooperatives,
finances workshops and working capital and markets part of the production.
Loan funds are provided by INFRATUR to FDD through the Banco Popular. The
maximum amount of each loan is RD$ 15,000 for a term of four years including
one year of grace. Interest rates charged to the intermediary, FDD and the
final borrowers are 3%, 5% and 8% respectively. By the end of May 1978, FDD
had trained 340 artisans in leather and ceramics in two centers and made loans
amounting to RD$ 130,000. FDD has plans to expand its handicrafts program to
include other specialties, in particular, amber jewelry which, in view of the
Dominican Republic's outstanding resources in raw amber, has promising pros-
pects for export and sale to tourists--provided the quality can be substan-
tially improved.
1.15      The Government which came to power in August 1978 decided to improve
the organization and strategies of the sector. It has introduced legislation
in parliament to upgrade the status of DNTI to that of a ministry and has pro-
vided it with a substantial budget for 1979 (RD$ 4 million including RD$ 1.8
million for promotion). DNTI needs further strengthening of its technical
capability and has approached various agencies with requests for technical
assistance. The Dominican authorities are also in the process of preparing
new regulations for the granting of incentives based on the recommendations
of a study carried out under the first Puerto Plata tourism project. This
study argues for a reduction in the level of the incentives, careful defini-
tion of eligible projects on the basis of economic analysis and elimination
of import duty exemptions for furniture, fixtures and all items needed for
operation. Import duty exemptions for construction materials and equipment
would not be limited to goods on a list established by DNTI. The availa-
bility of foreign exchange at the official rate would be limited to imports which
qualify for duty exemption.
1.16      In addition, the Government has decided to concentrate its tourism
development efforts on the Puerto Plata region. With the completion of the
infrastructure works, scheduled in mid-1979, the region, already a popular
stop for Caribbean cruise ships, will possess the assets required to become



- 6 -
a major tourism pole. An additional stimulus to the tourism develonment of
Puerto Plata would be the Drovision by INFRATUR of adequate loan financing to
private investors interested in the construction of hotels and other tourism
superstructure in the region.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Objectives
2.01      In early 1977 the Central Bank sought Bank assistance in establish-
ing a credit facility for hotel investors in the Puerto Plata area. An iden-
tification mission visited the Dominican Republic in May 1977 and recommended
Bank financing of the accommodation development planned through 1983. In sub-
sequent discussions with Dominican authorities, it was agreed to broaden the
scope of the project to include works in the city of Puerto Plata to consoli-
date its position as a major port of call for cruise ships out of Miami, as
well as to provide for training in handicrafts and for technical assistance
to DNTI and INFRATUR. Further Bank involvement in the Dominican tourism
sector was made contingent upon concrete evidence of the Government's intent
to rationalize the incentives system, a commitment the Government had already
made under the first project. Accordingly, the Dominican authorities prepared
a draft of the new regulations on the incentives system which was modified
during negotiations to take into account the Bank's comments (para. 1.15).
Enactment of the regulations by a presidential decree is a condition of loan
effectiveness.
2.02      The main objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) assist the Central Bank in setting up a proper
hotel credit mechanism to finance construction
of tourism acccommodation facilities in Playa
Dorada, Playa Grande and Puerto Plata;
(b) enhance the tourism potential of Puerto Plata
for cruise ship passengers and visitors to Playa
Dorada and Playa Grande alike;
(c) provide investment, training and employment oppor-
tunities in the tourism sector and selected handi-
crafts activities for the population of Puerto Plata;
(d) strengthen the administration of the sector; and
(e) provide assistance to the Dominican authorities in
establishing sound tourism policies.

B. Project Description
2.03      The project includes four components:
(a)  a line of credit to finance tourist accommodations and
tourist services in Playa Dorada, Playa Grande and
Puerto Plata;
(b)  urban works in the low lying area of Puerto Plata near the
tourism pier;
(c)  an artisan center; and
(d)  technical assistance to INFRATUR and DNTI.
Line of Credit
2.04      The line of credit will be used primarily to provide loan funds
for construction of tourist accommodation facilities with a total capacity
equivalent to 1,600 rooms, some 1,200 in Playa Dorada, 300 in Playa Grande
and 100 in the city of Puerto Plata itself. Accommodations in Playa Dorada
and Playa Grande would develop as follows:

2.05      The accommodation capacity to be financed in Playa Dorada and Playa
Grande under the proposed project to be built between 1979 and 1983 would be
sponsored in the main by private investors. The first Puerto Plata tourism
project included funds to finance a campaign aimed at attracting Dominican and
foreign investors to the project. INFRATUR has prepared the required promo-
tional materials and hired an investment promotion advisor. However, because
of the political changes which occurred in the Dominican Republic in 1978, a
systematic promotional effort was not undertaken. Following a presidential
decision that the project would remain a responsibility of INFRATUR, putting
an end to the uncertainty as to which agency (DNTI or INFRATUR) was to admin-
ister the Puerto Plata project, INFRATUR has begun an intensive investment
promotional campaign (in Europe, the US and Venezuela), the first phase of
which was completed before negotiations. The campaign has received a favor-
able response among private investors and it is expected that enough investors
would be identified to permit accommodation development in accordance with the
timetable indicated in Table 1.
2.06      In the meantime, the Central Bank had to take upon itself the devel-
opment of the first hotels. It is constructing a 225-room bungalow hotel
due to open in October 1979 and is completing the final design of a 250-room
hotel, both at Playa Dorada.  In the event ongoing negotiations with private
investors for their participation do not succeed, the Central Bank plans to
go ahead with construction of this hotel as soon as the final design is com-
pleted. Meanwhile investors' interest in constructing apartments has been
strong. Final design of a 280-room complex at Playa Dorada has been com-
pleted; the developer plans to sell units to individuals (Dominicans and for-
eigners) who would use them for a maximum of two months and make them avail-
able to tourists during the rest of the year. The Central Bank has worked out
a scheme whereby the individuals purchasing the apartments would lease them on
a long-term basis (10-15 years) to a management company which would administer
them as if they were part of a hotel operation. During negotiations, the
Central Bank and the Bank agreed that the applications for each aparthotel
subproject would include draft contractual arrangements acceptable to the
Bank, between the Central Bank, the developer and the management company.
These arrangements which would also include the long-term lease contract
between the management company and the owners of the individual units, would
provide the basis for the Central Bank to use the proceeds of the proposed
loan to finance a maximum of 350 rooms in apartments to be sold to individuals.
2.07      At present hotel capacity in the city of Puerto Plata amounts to
150 rooms catering primarily to Dominicans visiting the beach on weekends and
during summer vacations. A minor market is made up of the crews of yachts
calling at Puerto Plata for repairs and supplies. With the nearing of the
opening of the Playa Dorada resort and the expected inauguration of the Puerto
Plata International Airport, local investors have expressed interest in in-
creasing Puerto Plata's accommodation capacity by building new establishments,
extending existing ones or converting old houses into pensions. These estab-
lishments would be used chiefly by the segments of the international market
attracted more by the quaint charm of Puerto Plata than by the sport and



entertainment facilities of Playa Dorada and Playa Grande. The Central Bank
would use the funds of the line of credit to finance a maximum of 100 rooms in
Puerto Plata, of which about 60% would be in renovated houses. In order to
encourage small local investors, the maximum size of establishments to be
financed would not exceed 25 rooms.
2.08      About 7% of the line of credit is earmarked for financing tourism
services such as restaurants, cafeterias, shops and tourism transport in the
city of Puerto Plata and the two resort areas of Playa Dorada and Playa Grande,
as well as for financing a 30-boat marina. Tourism services to be located in
buildings of architectural and historical value would be financed with funds
from the line of credit only if the exteriors of the buildings were restored
according to the plan which was prepared under the first Puerto Plata tourism
project and registered with the Office of Cultural Heritage.
Urban Works
2.09      The urban works would be aimed at improving the area between the
tourism pier and the city, restoring the central park to its Victorian splendor
and extending the city's sewerage system to include the area near the tourism
pier.
2.10      Cruise ships use a pier constructed in 1918 which is in bad condi-
tion for lack of maintenance. The pier is separated from the city by a
desolate expanse of reclaimed land partially occupied by warehouses--an
unfitting introduction to Puerto Plata for disembarking cruise visitors. The
Ministry of Public Works and Communications started improvements to the pier
in January 1979 including structural repairs to the piles, beams and deck,
asphalting the deck and replacing existing fenders and dolphins. Under the
proposed project, the waterfront area would be converted into a landscaped
park. Access to the pier would be redesigned to provide separate areas for
the taxis, buses, motorbikes and horses offered for rental to the tourists.
The old unused railway station at the entrance to the pier would be converted
into a tourist information office. The proposed project includes funds for
earthworks, paving and landscaping and restoration of the railway station.
2.11      Puerto Plata's central square was an architectural jewel until 1930
when it underwent major reconstruction including the replacement of a wooden
bandstand by an incongruous concrete structure, which is now deteriorating.
Under the proposed project, the bandstand would be restored to its original
style and the square would be landscaped anew.
2.12      About 80% of the city of Puerto Plata is served by a sewerage
system, including treatment in stabilization ponds. The collection network
was not extended to the lower part of the city because funds were insufficient
to finance the network in an area with a high water table. At present waste-
water from this part of the city runs in gutters and open drains into an open
channel which discharges into the harbor next to the tourism pier. The
sanitary conditions in this area are particularly bad after rains. Under the
proposed project the sewerage network would be extended to the low lying area



- 10 -
of the city. Sewage would be collected by gravity to a low point within the
area and pumped from there into the existing network. The proposed loan would
also provide funds for a separate system for stormwater drainage consisting
of drainage by surface and underground mains discharging into open channels
in the port area.
Handicrafts Center
2.13      The Puerto Plata region is endowed with some of the world's richest
amber mines. The amber is mined by primitive methods and processed mostly
in Santo Domingo and Santiago. Part is then shipped back to Puerto Plata
to be sold to cruise visitors. The objective of this component of the project
is to build a center where about 50 artisans, 20 of whom would already have
had some experience in the trade, would be trained each year. In addition to
acquiring improved workmanship, the trainees would be taught how to develop
designs appealing to a wider market. Trained artisans would be encouraged to
set up cooperatives which could obtain financing for their workshops from the
Central Bank (para. 1.14). The center would also assist the cooperatives in
purchasing materials as well as marketing and distributing their products.
The project provides funds for transforming a house in Puerto Plata's historic
center into a training center and for purchasing and installating the required
equipment. I/
Technical Assistance
2.14      The project includes a total of 132 manmonths for technical assis-
tance. Technical assistance to INFRATUR would provide the services, for term
assignments, of experts in specialized fields such as land development, hotel
construction and equipment. These assignments would amount to 12 manmonths
spread over three years. An economist and a financial analyst would assist
DNTI for a two-year period with sectoral planning, economic evaluation of
projects and administration of the tourism investment incentives. Three
instructors, to be hired for two years, would assist in the start-up of the
handicrafts center.
C. Project Costs
2.15      Project costs are estimated at US$71 million equivalent including
US$4.0 million equivalent in taxes and duties. The foreign exchange component
of the project cost is estimated at US$33 million. Detailed cost estimates
for the various categories of expenditures are given in Annex II and are
summarized in Tables 2 and 3 below.
1/   Most of the equipment can also be used to work on larimar--a local
semiprecious stone--and on horn and shells. The center would also
train some artisans in these fields.

2.16      Investment costs of tourist accommodation facilities in the program
outlined in paras. 2.05 and 2.06 have been estimated on the basis of prevail-
ing construction costs per hotel room in the Dominican Republic. The average
construction cost per room amounts to US$40,000 including contingencies. The
average foreign exchange component is estimated at 47%.
2.17      Civil works costs for the urban works and the handicrafts center
have been estimated on the basis of prevailing construction unit costs and on
a preliminary analysis of space requirements for buildings and quantities for
other works. Their foreign exchange component averages 34%. The estimated
costs of furniture and equipment are based on average prices either in the
Dominican Republic or abroad. Their foreign exchange components amount to
75% and 90% respectively. An average increase of 12.5% has been allowed to
cover physical contingencies for civil works, equipment and furniture for
all items not included in the line of credit. Technical assistance will be

engaged for an estimated total of 132 manmonths at an average cost of about
US$5,000 per manmonth. 1/ The foreign exchange component of technical assis-
tance has been estimated at 70%.
2.18      Price increases are estimated over April 1979 base costs according
to the implem-atation schedules of individual project components and the
following annual price escalation rates:

D. Project Implementation
2.19      INFRATUR will bear the responsibility for project implementation.
The project will be implemented within five years from loan signing with a
terminal date for submission of subprojects under the loan of December 31,
1982 and a proposed closing date of December 31, 1984. Funds in the line
of credit are expected to be fully committed within three years from loan
signing, with all construction completed in five years. The urban works
and handicrafts center will be completed within two years of loan signing.
Promptly after completion of the project, but not later than one year after
the closing date of the loan, INFRATUR shall prepare and furnish to the Bank
a completion report on the execution and operation of the project.
INFRATUR's Organization
2.20      The chart below summarizes the organization of INFRATUR.  Its
governing body is a board which is chaired by the Governor of the Central
Bank and includes the Bank's manager, its legal counsel, a member of the
Monetary Board and the Director of DNTI. INFRATUR's Director acts as the
board's secretary.
1/   This figure includes subsistence and travel and is an average of the
following elements: Sectoral planning: 48 manmonths at US$6,250;
Subproject appraisal: 400 mandays at US$300;
Artisan training: 72 manmonths at US$3,300.

2.21      INFRATUR has two operating divisions:  Infrastructure and Projects.
The Infrastructure Division which implemented the first Puerto Plata tourism
project consists of two units and a technical office. The Supervision Unit is
responsible for the completion of the first Puerto Plata tourism project and
supervision of the urban works and handicrafts components of the proposed
project. The Development Control Unit is in charge of enforcing the controls
established on the north coast under the first Puerto Plata tourism project.
INFRATUR's newly created Projects Division would be in charge of the line of
credit. Its head has long standing experience in tourism and will be assisted
by an architect-advisor and an advisor in land development. The Division
includes an Investment Promotion Unit which would be responsible for attracting
investors to the project sites, a Project Analysis Unit to be in charge of
appraising the various subprojects and a Technical Unit which would supervise
their implementation. The head of the Project Analysis Unit is an economist
with long experience in the Central Bank. The Puerto Plata office, under the
supervision of the Infrastructure Division, will take charge of and maintain
the infrastructure works once they are completed and will be responsible for
relations with local authorities.
2.22      During negotiations, the Central Bank agreed that INFRATUR would
consult the Bank prior to replacing the head of either division or of the
Project Analysis Unit. INFRATUR's revised internal regulations were discussed
during negotiations and found acceptable to the Bank.
Implementation of Line of Credit
2.23      The policies and regulations that will govern INFRATUR's operations
in tourism financing are set forth in a statement (see Annex III). This
statement, which provides a satisfactory basis for channeling Bank funds for
onward lending for tourism investments under the proposed project, was
finalized during negotiations. Any subsequent modification of the statement
would require Bank approval.
2.24      Subprojects to be financed would be presented to INFRATUR jointly
by investors and intermediary institutions. INFRATUR's Project Analysis Unit
would appraise the subprojects which would then be submitted for review by
INFRATUR's loan committee comprising its director and subdirector, the Central
Bank's deputy manager for finances and the head of the Projects Division.
The subprojects would finally be presented to INFRATUR's board for approval.
All accommodations subprojects with total investment cost exceeding US$300,000
and nonaccommodation subprojects in excess of US$100,000 would require prior
Bank approval. This would permit the Bank to review all accommodation sub-
projects in Playa Dorada and Playa Grande, about 50% of the accommodation
projects in Puerto Plata and 50% of the nonaccommodation projects.
2.25      The subloans would be channeled through financial intermediaries
who would assume full credit risk on subloans and would service their debt
to the Central Bank in accordance with fixed amortization schedules. Com-
mercial banks, financieras, savings and loan associations and mortgage banks



- 16 -
would all be eligible. Whereas several mortgage banks, as well as the Govern-
ment owned Banco de Reservas, have expressed interest in serving as interme-
diaries, private commercial banks are unlikely to participate due to the poor
experience of hotel lending in Santo Domingo (para 1.12). If the first hotels
built in Puerto Plata prove profitable, it is possible that more interme-
diaries would elect to participate, individually or as part of consortiums.
Since the Central Bank is likely to invest in pioneering hotel projects (para.
2.06) in Playa Dorada, a maximum of US$6 million of the proposed loan could be
used by the Central Bank to invest in its own hotel projects. These proj-
ects would be submitted to the appraisal and review procedures described in
para. 2.24. Before the Central Bank sells any of its hotels, it would agree
with the Bank on the terms and conditions of the sale.
2.26      Typical accommodation subprojects would be financed to the extent of
35% by investors' equity and 65% loan funds of which 62% would be derived from
INFRATUR and 3% (the working capital) would be provided by financial interme-
diaries from other resources. Accommodation subloans would include grace
periods of up to four years (typically to cover two years of construction
and the first two years of operations) with final maturity up to 17 years.
The following terms would apply to nonaccommodation subloans.

/a   INFRATUR would be a last resort lender and give priority to borrowers
from Puerto Plata.
2.27      At present a usury law provides a ceiling of 12% on interest rates
in the Dominican Republic. In practice, effective lending rates are in-
creased above 12% by the addition of closing costs and fees. The Central
Bank plans to charge intermediaries 9% for hotel subloans and 9.5% for other
subloans and to allow them to charge final borrowers 12% annually plus one-
time closing costs of about 3-4% of the amount of the loan. Under this
arrangement, the Central Bank would have a margin of about 2% above the World
Bank rate to cover its administrative expenses and the exchange risk. If



- 17 -
inflation rates in the Dominican Republic do not increase beyond predicted
levels, 1/ the proposed interest rate structure for hotel lending would
ensure that final borrowers are charged positive interest rates in real
terms. During negotiations, the Central Bank agreed to review in consultation
with the Bank the adequacy of the interest rate structure in June 1981.
If inflation rates should then reach or exceed 12%, no further commitments of
funds from the line of credit would be made, unless the Bank were satisfied
that the final borrowers would be charged positive real interest rates. In
the event the interest rate ceiling rate were removed, the rate to the final
borrowers would be linked to a rate which reflects market conditions, i.e.,
that which the mortgage banks would charge on loans exceeding seven years for
commercial construction, leaving the intermediaries' margin intact.
Implementation of Other Components
2.28       Execution and subsequent maintenance and operation of the urban
works and handicrafts center would be based on interagency agreements among
INFRATUR, the Puerto Plata Municipality, the Instituto Nacional de Aguas
Potables y Alcantarillado (INAPA) and FDD. INFRATUR would be responsible
for implementation; it would thus be in charge of land acquisition, final
design, advertising requests for tenders, evaluating bids and entering
into contracts for these components. Upon completion, the sewerage system
would be owned, operated and maintained by INAPA and the other urban works
by the Puerto Plata Municipality. The Municipality and INAPA would reimburse
INFRATUR for the cost of the works. The handicrafts center would be leased
to FDD. A condition for disbursing the relevant funds from the loan account
is for INFRATUR to enter into agreements satisfactory to the Bank with the
Municipality, INAPA and FDD.
E. Financing Plan
2.29       The project financing plan provides for an IBRD loan of US$25 mil-
lion equivalent, or 35.2% of total project costs. The Central Bank contribu-
tion will be US$10 million, or 14% of total project costs. Financial inter-
mediaries are expected to participate in the project with US$2 million of
their own funds, or 3% of the line of credit. Equity investment in the facil-
ities to be financed by the line of credit will amount to US$24 million, or
35% of the total investment in these facilities. The Central Bank has sub-
stantially completed arrangements with a foreign commercial bank to obtain
cofinancing for the project in the amount of US$10 million. A condition of
loan effectiveness is that the loan agreement with the commercial bank be
signed. The sources and uses of project funds are summarized below.
1/   The following inflation rates were registered:  1975, 14.5%; 1976, 7.8%;
1977, 16.4%, and 1978, 5.5%. The following inflation rates are projected:
1979, 8%; 1980 and beyond, 9-10%.

/a   US$10 million from foreign banks which would be lent directly to the
Central Bank and US$2 million which would be provided on a project
by project basis by Dominican banks to finance working capital.
/b   The amount of technical assistance included in the World Bank loan
would be decreased to the extent that the Dominican authorities find
financing on more favorable terms from multi- or bilateral sources.
With INFRATUR's promotion campaign (para. 2.05) and the hotel credit facility
established under this project, it is expected that private capital will be
forthcoming. In order to assist investors in raising equity for pioneering
projects, the Central Bank is considering permitting them to invest blocked
funds or itself participating in the equity through contributions of land.
F. Lending Terms
2.30      The Bank loan of US$25 million equivalent would be for 17 years
with a 4-year grace period at the prevailing Bank lending rate of 7.9% and
the standard commitment fee of 0.75% annually. The loan would be made to the
Central Bank with the guarantee of the Government. This loan would include
US$300,000 of retroactive financing to reimburse INFRATUR for expenditures
incurred before loan signing on two subprojects in Playa Dorada.
G. Procurement
Line of Credit
2.31      Before subloans are extended prospective borrowers will generally be
required to submit to INFRATUR at least three bids for civil works accompanied
by an evaluation report. INFRATUR's review will take into account the bidder's



- 19 -
financial position, previous experience and work capability with respect to
personnel and equipment. For contracts for the supply and installation of
equipment, furniture and fixtures amounting to more than US$2,500 equivalent,
the borrower would be required to submit at least three quotations from
qualified suppliers registered with INFRATUR. Prudent shopping would be
allowed for purchases of less than US$2,500 equivalent provided their total
amount would not exceed US$10,000 for each project. (Similar procurement
procedures would be used by the Central Bank for its own hotel investments.)
In the event of disagreement between INFRATUR and a prospective borrower as to
the estimated cost of civil works and/or equipment, the parties will seek
arbitration from the technical department of the Banco Nacional de la Vivienda.
Other Components
2.32      Since it is unlikely that foreign construction companies would
be interested in bidding for such small scale works as those called for by
the remaining components, the related contracts for civil works, furniture,
materials, fixtures and equipment totaling about US$2.4 million equivalent
would be let on the basis of competitive bidding after local advertising. The
Bank's prior review and approval of invitations to bid, proposed awards and
final contract will be limited to those contracts in excess of US$100,000
equivalent for civil works and US$50,000 equivalent for furniture, materials,
fixtures and equipment for each component.
H. Disbursements
2.33      The following disbursement percentages will be applied:
(a) with respect to the line of credit, 54% of the
amounts disbursed by INFRATUR under each subloan and 35%
of the expenditures by the Central Bank on its own hotel
investments. Only expenditures made within 180 days
prior to the date on which the Bank receives an application
to disburse on a subloan would be eligible for Bank
financing. The Bank's normal 90-day limit would
be modified because double intermediation requires
a longer time period; and
(b) with respect to all other components:
(i)  30% of total expenditures for civil works;
(ii)  70% of foreign expenditures for goods; and
(iii)  70% of the expenditures for technical assistance
expenses including travel and subsistence.



- 20 -
The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Table 6, Annex II. Dis-
bursements for the line of credit would be made against statements of expendi-
tures by subloans, certified by INFRATUR. Detailed documentation would not
be submitted to the Bank but would be retained by INFRATUR for expost review
by the project's supervision missions. Disbursements for all other components
would be made against standard documentation.
III. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Prospects
3.01      After sustained growth in the years 1968-73 (8.4% per annum),
tourism traffic to the Caribbean stagnated in 1974 and 1975 as a result of
the severe recession in Europe and North America. In 1976 traffic growth
resumed (by less than 1%) and picked up substantially in 1977 (7%) to reach
4.9 million arrivals for the Caribbean area. Partial figures for 1978 in-
dicate an even higher growth rate. The bulk of the traffic consists of North
American and European vacationers seeking relief from the cold winters at
home on the beautiful and sunny Caribbean beaches. The US accounts for 48%
of total tourist arrivals in the Caribbean, Canada for about 9% and European
countries for 6%.
3.02      With an increasing number of North Americans and Europeans attaining
income levels compatible with medium- and long-haul travel, tourism to the
Caribbean is expected to continue to expand at a substantial rate. Travel
trade sources estimate the likely growth in overall tourism to the Caribbean
region over the long term at 6% per annum. Growth prospects are particularly
favorable for middle-income visitors traveling in groups, whose numbers have
increased by a remarkable 80% per annum since the US Civil Aviation Board
decided to deregulate charter flights in 1975. This is precisely the market
segment for which accommodations planned at Playa Grande and Playa Dorada
are intended. Located within an hour of the Puerto Plata International
Airport, which can handle all types of aircraft and which will be open to
charter flights, these accommodations will be reasonably priced and offer a
full range of sports and entertainment activities, including golf courses,
a close-at-hand marina and shopping facilities provided both within the
project areas and in nearby Puerto Plata.
3.03       Inclusive trips of eight days, seven nights from New York (includ-
ing group air fare, hotel accommodations, transfers and taxes, but excluding
meals, recreation, excursions and trips), would start at US$280 to Playa
Dorada, i.e., at cost levels considerably below those of similar trips to
other Caribbean destinations which start in the US$300-370 range. 1/ Costs
1/   US$299 to Cancun.
US$349 to Jamaica.
US$360 to the Bahamas and Puerto Rico.



- 21 -
of packages to Playa Grande would start at US$390, a competitive price in the
Caribbean for a more exclusive resort area. Furthermore, accommodations in
Playa Dorada and Playa Grande will benefit from an important form of indirect
promotion in that they will be visited by cruise passengers disembarking at
Puerto Plata as part of their off-shore tour.
3.04      Occupancies of hotels to be financed under the proposed project are
projected at 65-70% in Playa Dorada and 65% in Playa Grande; the latter is a
more exclusive resort where a larger share of individual travel is expected.
These occupancies which would be reached over a three-year build-up period,
are similar to those current in other Caribbean destinations such as Barbados
(65.2% in 1976), Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands (64.2% in 1976) and Cancun
(68.5%), 1/ and below those experienced in 1977 by Mexico as a whole (73.7%)
and the Bahamas and Bermuda in 1976 (76.3%).
3.05      Assuming double occupancy factors of 1.7 persons per room in Playa
Dorada and 1.6 in Playa Grande, an average length of stay for foreign travelers
of seven days and allowing for 10% of bednights by domestic travelers, pro-
jected occupancies would require 155,000 international arrivals in 1986 and
260,000 in 1993. These targets are achievable. Even if the country's total
capacity outside the Puerto Plata area increases by 1,000 2/ additional rooms
by 1986 and by another 2,000 in 1993, and if all establishments achieved the
same occupancies as those projected in Puerto Plata, the total number of
foreign visitors to the Republic would have to reach 475,000 in 1986 and
725,000 in 1993, an average annual growth rate of 7%. This growth rate is
considerably lower than that achieved by the Republic in the past decade and
only slightly higher than that projected by the Caribbean Tourist Association
for the Caribbean region as a whole.
B. Financial Analysis
Hotel Profitability
3.06      Hotel investments likely to be financed under the proposed line of
credit include four types of hotel subprojects: Type A is based on a proposal
for Playa Grande submitted to INFRATUR by Dominican investors; Type B is
similar to the hotel at Playa Dorada which the Central Bank has been studying
(para. 2.06); Type C and the aparthotel are representative of the more modest
accommodation facilities expected to be built at Playa Dorada. The invest-
ment costs inclusive of the costs of land assumed for each type are summarized
below.
1/   Cancun has reached an overall 68.5% occupancy in its third year of oper-
ation.
2/   Including the 300-room Club Mediteranee in Punta Cana whose construction
is expected to start in 1979.

/a   Including physical contingencies but excluding interest during con-
struction.
3.07      Projected operating results of each hotel type are detailed in
Tables 1 to 4, Annex IV, and summarized in Table 8. According to these pro-
jections, the four different types of hotels should attain satisfactory levels
of gross operating profits (GOP), ranging from 24.6% to 38.9% of hotel reve-
nues in the fourth year of operation. The financial internal rate of return
after taxes (IRR) in real terms would range accordingly from 9.2% to 16.5% on
total investment and from 15.4% to 30.3% on equity for hotel Types B, C and
the aparthotel. The variations in operating results stem primarily from dif-
ferences in investment costs, occupancies and tariffs. Financial returns for
the Type A hotel (6.4% on total investment and 9.9% on equity) are less
attractive because the higher investment costs are not fully compensated by
the higher tariffs. However, the only Type A hotel project envisaged under
the program, according to the proposal submitted to INFRATUR (para. 3.06),
will be implemented jointly with a 260-room aparthotel, which will allow
higher rates of return on the overall project. Internal rates of return for
each type of hotel are summarized in Table 9.
3.08      Hotel profitability has also been analyzed with respect to changes
in the underlying assumptions. Table 9 illustrates the sensitivity of the
internal rate of return on total investment and on equity to variations in
investment costs, occupancies and tariffs. The analysis indicates that
fluctuations within a reasonable range (+ 10%) in any of these key variables
have only a moderate effect on hotel financial returns. Profitability of the
more expensive types seems to be less certain than that of the cheaper hotels
and aparthotels; this argues for submitting such projects to a particularly
stringent financial analysis.

Other Components
(a) Handicrafts Center
3.10      FDD has forecast annual sales for the center at about RD$ 200,000
and operating costs at RD$ 150,000 (RD$ 30,000 for administrative expenses,
RD$ 40,000 for salaries to students and RD$ 80,000 for raw materials), leaving
a surplus of about RD$ 50,000 adequate to earn a return of 8% on the invest-
ment and to cover the lease of the facilities.
(b) The Urban Works
3.11      The investment in the urban works would be recovered from the fees
paid by cruise ship visitors. At present cruise passengers do not pay fees in
Puerto Plata as they do in many other Caribbean harbors. Once the urban works
have been carried out and made the city more attractive to cruise ship pas-
sengers, Puerto Plata could charge a fee of US$1.25 per cruise visitor (lower
than most competing ports) without running the risk of diverting traffic. On
the basis of the number of cruise passengers expected for the 1978/79 season
(165,000), the fee would generate over US$200,000 annually, enough to recover
the investment in the urban works and provide a rate of return of 12%. The
procedure for introducing the fee, as well as the split of revenues and
obligations between INAPA and the Municipality will be regulated in the
agreements these agencies will enter into with INFRATUR (para 2.28).
Financial Analysis of INFRATUR
(a) Existing Situation
3.12      INFRATUR has separate accounts which are summarized in Annex IV,
Tables 5 and 6. At the end of 1977 its total assets amounted to RD$ 67.1
million, with hotel loans accounting for RD$ 34.7 million and the first Puerto
Plata project investment for RD$ 26.6 million. The remaining assets included
participation in the Hotel Hispaniola in Santo Domingo (RD$ 1.2 million),
preparation of the Boca Chica infrastructure project (RD$ 0.8 million) and
loans through the handicrafts program (RD$ 0.1 million). The assets were
funded from (a) the initial Central Bank contribution of RD$ 5 million;
(b) interest-free advances from the Central Bank amounting to RD$ 31.3 mil-
lion; (c) RD$ 3.6 million as the Central Bank's counterpart to Loan 1051-DO;
(d) RD$ 5.5 million withdrawn from Loan 1051-DO; and (e) RD$ 18 million from
loans from foreign commercial banks.
3.13      INFRATUR has not yet received any income from its infrastructure
investments. Its revenues consist almost entirely of interest income on
its hotel loans. This income increased steadily from RD$ 331,000 in 1974 to
RD$ 1.7 million in 1977 while interest and related expenses to foreign banks
fluctuated with LIBOR reaching a peak of RD$ 1.7 million in 1975 (Annex IV,
Table 6). INFRATUR incurred losses on its hotel loans until 1976 as a result
of its early loans which were made available to intermediaries at an interest
rate 5% below the cost of its resources. In 1977 interest revenues exceeded



- 26 -
interest costs by RD$ 400,000; this, however, was not enough to cover the
administrative and general expenses which amounted to RD$ 460,000. Since its
inception, INFRATUR has incurred overall losses amounting to RD$ 3.7 million.
(b) Projected Infrastructure Operations
3.14      INFRATUR's infrastructure investment in Playa Dorada and Playa
Grande amounts to RD$ 26.7 million in 1978 prices. This amount excludes
the investment in the Puerto Plata airport which will be the responsibility
of the Comision Aeropuertuaria and the water and sewerage systems which will
be transferred to INAPA. INFRATUR's revenues will be derived from land sales,
leases of the facilities, operation of the two golf courses and service
charges levied on accommodation facilities. INFRATUR's operating costs
associated with the infrastructure will include expenses for administration,
maintenance, promotion and payment of interest on the Bank loan. Assumptions
on revenue and expenses are detailed in Annex IV-B. On the basis of these
assumptions, INFRATUR will earn a 10.6% internal rate of return in real terms
on its infrastructure investment. (This rate of return would exceed the
target rate of 9% originally set in the loan documents of the first Puerto
Plata tourism project.) The pro forma income statement of INFRATUR's infra-
structure operations is presented in Table 7, Annex IV.
(c) Projected Lending Operations
3.15      On the basis of the accommodation development scenario presented in
para. 2.04, INFRATUR would finance projects costing a total of RD$ 71 million
up to 1984. Its 1984 loan portfolio will amount to RD$ 45.0 million. For the
period 1979-84 INFRATUR's interest income will exceed interest expenses by an
average 3.0% margin; this will cover its operating expenses (1.3%) and all or
a major portion of the foreign exchange risk. The statement of INFRATUR's
lending operations is presented in Table 9, Annex IV.
(d) Projected Consolidated Operations
3.16      Table 10, Annex IV, consolidates INFRATUR's infrastructure and
lending operations and Table 11 summarizes the statement of INFRATUR's sources
and uses of funds. They show that until 1982 INFRATUR would accumulate cash
deficits requiring Central Bank contributions of RD$ 5.4 million. From 1985
on INFRATUR's annual net cash generation is expected to average around RD$ 9
million. This latter amount would be adequate to provide loan financing, for
example, for a 350-room Type B hotel per year or 550 rooms of Type C hotel.
Thus if it so chose, INFRATUR would be able to continue providing credit for
future accommodation development in Playa Dorada and Playa Grande once the
line of credit has been exhausted.
(e) Audit
3.17      INFRATUR's accounts are audited by the Superintendent of Banks
and an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. These auditing practices
would continue under the proposed project.

C. Economic Analysis
3.18      The investments to be financed by the proposed loan are part of a
regional tourism development program in the Puerto Plata area which was begun
under the first Puerto Plata tourism project. The program consists of infra-
structure works in Playa Dorada and Playa Grande; accommodation facilities
supported by this infrastructure and to be built over the 1978-85 period;
ancillary facilities, such as sports, shopping, transport and the production
of handicrafts; and urban works in the city of Puerto Plata. The proposed
project can therefore be economically evaluated only in the context of the
first Puerto Plata tourism project. The analysis undertaken here reevaluates
the economic returns to the entire investment program, including all the
infrastructure works which have already been largely completed. A rate of
return is also calculated on the incremental investment in accommodation
development financed by the proposed loan.
Investment Costs
3.19      Financial investment costs in infrastructure works under the first
Puerto Plata tourism project are estimated at US$43.3 million, in 1978 prices.
These costs include land acquisition, roads, water supply and sewerage systems,
solid waste disposal, lighting and telecommunications, golf courses, central
facilities and public beach facilities. They also include hotel training
facilities, technical assistance, project administration, investment promotion,
the completion of the airport and the water and sewerage systems of the ad-
joining village of Rio San Juan. Urban works and the handicrafts center in
the city of Puerto Plata to be financed under the proposed project, would
cost about US$2 million. The economic costs of these infrastructure works,
expressed in 1978 prices, amount to US$48.5 million, or about 7% higher than
the financial investment costs, with annual replacements estimated at 2% of
the original investment cost. The economic costs differ from the financial
costs in that they exclude half the price of land (about 5% of total costs)
reflecting limited alternate uses and the fact that INFRATUR has had to pay
significantly inflated land prices as the project became known; on the other
hand, the investment costs were adjusted upwards by 12%, reflecting an esti-
mated foreign exchange premium of 25% over the official rate, for the import
content of these investments.
3.20      The accommodation development program for the 1978-85 period provides
for the development of 2,265 rooms in Playa Dorada and 1,190 rooms in Playa
Grande, in different types of facilities such as hotels, villas and apart-
hotels at an average investment cost per room, in 1978 prices, of US$33,000.
The economic investment costs for this superstructure, after adjusting for
interest charges during construction and shadow pricing foreign exchange, are
US$102.5 million. Annual replacement costs, after three years of operations,
are estimated at 3% of the original financial cost, a weighted average of 1.5%
for construction, 12% for furniture and 10% for equipment.



- 28 -
3.21      Foreign visitors attracted by the project will demand a whole
range of goods and services provided outside the accommodation facilities.
There are already a number of shops and restaurants as well as some trans-
port facilities in the city of Puerto Plata, but they are not sufficient to
cover projected demand. The investment costs of expanding the provision
of these goods and services in any one year is projected to equal 60% of the
incremental tourist expenditures outside hotels for the following year. The
total additional investment cost in nonhotel tourist activities is estimated
at US$30.0 million for a ten-year period, including replacements, taken as 15%
of the original investment costs after three years of operations.
Operating Costs and Revenues
3.22      The operating costs and revenues of the accommodation facilities are
derived from the financial forecasts outlined in Tables 1 to 4, Annex IV. 1/
These forecasts have been modified for the economic analysis. Economic oper-
ating costs have been raised by 7.5%, reflecting the premium for foreign
purchases. The gross economic benefits also include the service charge (10%),
the tips (2%) and the portion of the 5% room tax paid by foreigners. Foreign
tourists' expenditures for accommodation facilities (expected to account for
90% of such revenues), have also been shadow priced.
3.23      On the basis of the experience of similar enterprises, the operating
costs of activities outside hotels are estimated to average 70% of sales.
Nonhotel expenditures by hotel guests are expected to average US$20 per
visitor per day. These would be spent on the purchase of handicrafts and
other shopping, the renting of cars and boats, public transportation and
restaurants. Earnings of labor in nonhotel activities are assumed to equal
their economic opportunity cost. This may introduce a conservative bias
because employment opportunities in these activities tend to reduce seasonal
unemployment and to increase the earnings of people already partially occupied
with these activities.
3.24      In addition to expenditures on accommodation and other tourist
facilities, revenues from the project would include visitor expenditures
for tourist cards (US$2) and departure taxes (US$3) and the cruise visitor
fee (US$1.25). There will also be incremental spending by those cruise
visitors who would not have disembarked without the improvements in the city
and those who may spend more because of increased spending opportunities.
These benefits have not been taken into account. Nor have the benefits to the
local population in Rio San Juan and Puerto Plata from the water and sewerage
and other urban works been credited to the project.
1/   The maximum occupany for 750 of the rooms to be built under the program
has been assumed at 50% for the best estimate of the economic returns
to the program. This reflects the assumption that villas and apart-
hotels will be occupied for some of the time by their owners.

Rate of Return and Net Present Value
3.25      The economic cost and benefit streams resulting from the above
assumptions, projections and estimates are presented in Table 12 below. On
the basis of these streams and of an economic life of 32 years (with no resi-
dual value taken into account), the internal economic rate of return for
the entire investment program is 17.5%. The present value of the program's
net operating benefits (i.e., gross benefits minus operating costs), dis-
counted at 11%, is US$250 million, about 1.5 times as high as the present
value of all investment costs including replacements. The rate of return for
the accommodation investment program alone (including the supporting infra-
structure) is 16.3%, while investments in nonhotel tourist activities have
an internal rate of return of 40.7%, as summarized in Table 11. When the ori-
ginal investment costs of infrastructure are excluded (but maintenance costs
included), the economic rate of return is 31.3% and the NPV US$137.4 million.

/a   At 11%.
/b   Infrastructure investments are included here and in the overall invest-
ment program (see Table 12).
3.26      The economic analysis has been carried out on the assumption that
none of the tourism activity generated in the Puerto Plata area would have
occurred in the absence of the infrastructure investments and the credit
made available through the Central Bank, Most of the existing capacity in
the Dominican Republic is situated in the capital city of Santo Domingo.
About half of the 780 rooms classified as beach accommodations in various
parts of the country are situated by the sea but they either do not have beach
facilities nearby or are too primitive to be used by North American tourists
on group tours. Further, some of the proposed beach-tourism expansion in
Puerto Plata will be complementary to existing facilities in Santo Domingo
because tourists who now stay away due to the absence of beach facilities can
henceforth divide their vacation time between the capital and a beach resort.
Thus, for the best estimate, net diversion of tourist traffic from existing
facilities was considered negligible and expenditures by visitors accommodated
in facilities built by the project were accordingly treated as fully incre-
mental to the country.

Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risks
3.27      Sensitivity of the internal economic rate of return and net present
value of project benefits to changes in cost and revenue assumptions are shown
in Table 13. Also shown is sensitivity with respect to delays in the imple-
mentation of the program of superstructure development and to valuing foreign
exchange costs and receipts at the official exchange rate. Economic returns
to the proposed investment program are more sensitive to increases in operat-
ing costs than to changes in investment costs. The switching values for these
variables (i.e., the percentage change which reduces the present value of net
benefits to zero at the opportunity cost of capital) are over 50% for invest-
ment costs and 27% for operating costs. Such an increase in operating costs
without a corresponding increase in revenues would imply a very large decline
in operating efficiency. Although management performance may fall short of
the level assumed in the hotel financial projections, the likelihood of a
large and persistent shortfall is small.
3.28      Net economic returns from the program would tend to zero if occupan-
cies fell to below 40%, an unlikely outcome. Although a shortfall in the
projected traffic is one of the most important project risks, it would take
very large drops in both occupancies and prices to reduce the economic rate
of return of the program below the opportunity cost of capital. Experience
from other comparable destinations suggests that such drops are not likely
to occur. Finally, to reduce the net benefits of the program to zero, the
superstructure development program would have to be delayed by seven years.
Again the probability of such a long delay is small.
3.29      Although the proposed investment program has been found to be econ-
omically justified, the economic viability of each subproject will have to
be demonstrated on a case-by-case basis. The analysis will be carried out by
the Project Analysis Unit of INFRATUR. After the first subprojects come into
operation, the analysis of further subprojects will be based on the market,
seasonality, occupancy and price experience of the Puerto Plata accommodation
establishments.

/b   Equivalent to assuming that the service charge is part of the opportunity
cost of labor or that about 15% of hotel revenues (and the corresponding
operating costs) are not incremental to the economy.
Employment Effect
3.30      In addition to the nearly four years of continuous employment for a
large number of construction workers in infrastructure works, the construction
of the various superstructure facilities is expected to generate over 10,000
manyears of employment. Another 3,800 new permanent jobs would be created
once all the accommodation facilities built under the program are in full
operation. Employment would also be generated in other tourist activities
such as restaurants, shops, tour agencies, entertainment and recreational
facilities and the production and distribution of handicrafts; incremental
employment in these occupations is expected to amount to 3,000 jobs. Addi-
tional jobs will be created indirectly in activities which supply goods and
services to the tourism sector. Total permanent employment attributable to
the program is thus expected to exceed 8,000 jobs.



- 33 -
Budgetary Impact
3.31      When the incremental tourism traffic attracted by the facilities
built under the project reaches its full potential, the Government will be
collecting annually about US$1.0 million from the sale of tourist cards, from
air departure taxes and from landing fees for cruise visitors. A further
US$1.2 million of budgetary revenues will derive from the 5% bednight tax.
There will also be budgetary revenues from duties on goods imported by tour-
ism establishments and from income taxes on wages and salaries of tourism
employees. After the period of tax holidays is over, the Government will
also begin collecting taxes on hotel profits. When all tourism accommodation
facilities are paying their full profits tax, budgetary revenues from this
source are expected to amount to US$4.3 million. Total Government receipts
once the project is in full operation are thus estimated to amount to US$7
million annually.
Balance of Payments Effect
3.32      Incremental foreign exchange receipts from the proposed program of
tourism development are projected at about US$65 million in 1985, rising to
US$74 million by 1988 (see Table 14). This compares with estimated total
receipts from tourism to the Dominican Republic of US$77 million in 1977.
About US$21 million of foreign exchange payments, however, will have to be
made annually in order to maintain and operate the tourism facilities built
under the program. Thus, once these facilities are in full operation, the
net foreign exchange inflow is expected to be US$53.7 million, or 72% of gross
receipts.

Project Beneficiaries
3.33      The main beneficiaries from the tourism activity to be generated by
the project will be the Government, the private sector enterprises investing
in hotels and other tourist facilities and the local labor force. The Govern-
ment will gain substantial revenues through taxation of tourists and tourist



- 34 -
enterprises. Unskilled labor will benefit particularly because wages, bene-
fits and overall earnings will be appreciably above their maximum earnings
in the next best alternate employment opportunity in the low-wage economy
of the area. Producers and distributors of handicrafts will also increase
their earnings through higher productivity and larger tourist demand. All
of these benefits are incremental and would not materialize without the
project.
Social Impact
3.34      The social impact of the proposed tourism investment program on
the Puerto Plata region is expected to be largely favorable. The economic
activity generated by the development of tourism in the area will touch the
lives of the majority of the local population. Living standards will rise
as employment opportunities in tourism enterprises are created and as self-
employment in small tourism-related enterprises becomes widespread. Ensuring
broad access to the benefits from tourism is of primary importance in mini-
mizing the potentially adverse effects arising from a large influx of middle
and high income visitors into a traditionally depressed and isolated area.
The inclusion in the line of credit of funds especially earmarked for handi-
crafts and other tourist services is expected to encourage the participation
of local entrepreneurs in the tourism development of the area.
3.35      The increasing cruise visitor traffic of recent years has already
brought the local population into gradual contact with foreign holiday
travelers. This process has been useful both for introducing the people of
the area to the gains from tourism development and for detecting some of
the potential adverse effects of this type of encounter. The Puerto Plata
community is aware of these problems. Its representatives will be working
with a sociologist retained by INFRATUR (with funds from the first tourism
loan) first to identify and then to implement appropriate solutions.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      During negotiations the Government and the Central Bank agreed
that:
(a) the Central Bank would consult with the Bank in case
incumbents in any of the following positions are to be
replaced: heads of INFRATUR's two divisions and the head
of the Project Analysis Unit (para. 2.22);
(b) any modification of INFRATUR's lending policy statement
would have to be approved by the Bank (para. 2.23);
(c) the Government, the Central Bank and the Bank would review
the adequacy of the interest rate structure in June 1981.



- 35 -
If inflation rates should then exceed 12%, no further com-
mitments of funds from the line of credit would be made
unless the Bank were satisfied that the final borrowers
would be charged positive interest rates (para. 2.27); and
(d) if the interest rate ceiling were removed, the interest rate
charged to the final borrowers would be equal to the one
charged by mortgage banks on loans exceeding seven years for
commercial construction (para. 2.27).
4.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan are that:
(a) the presidential decree enacting regulations for the tourism
incentives law be issued (para. 2.01); and
(b) the loan agreement with the private commercial bank be
signed (para. 2.29).
4.03      Conditions for disbursing the relevant funds relating to the urban
works and handicrafts center component are for INFRATUR to enter into agree-
ments satisfactory to the Bank with INAPA, the Municipality and FDD (para.
2.28).

8. Loan Requirements and Conditions
8.1     Company funds invested in the projects financed under the program
must amount to at least the percentages of total investment cost listed
below:

projects implemented in stages, the investments already made will be taken
into account in the financing plan provided the project has not begun oper-
ations on the date of application. Among the factors influencing the decision
for INFRATUR financing will be the project's feasibility, its ability to
service its debt, its importance to the tourism sector and the economic re-
sources of the applicant.

SECOND PUERTO PLATA TOURISM PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Hotels
1.       The following four types of hotels have been analyzed:
Type A:   a 250-room first class hotel in Playa Grande,
constructed at a total cost of US$46,530 per
room, catering primarily to the traditional
Caribbean luxury market. It provides a host
of leisure activities, including a nightclub,
restaurants and shops. It is operated by a
management firm.
Type B:   a 250-room first class hotel in Playa Dorada,
constructed at a total cost of US$40,070 per
room, catering mainly to higher priced package
tours. It offers a nightclub, restaurants and
shops. The hotel's operations are handled by
a specialized company.
Type C:   a 100-room hotel, constructed at an investment
cost of US$25,850 per room, as part of the
village resort complex in Playa Dorada, with
centralized facilities intended to serve the
needs of moderately priced package tours. Al-
though this hotel is likely to be managed by
its owner, the financial analysis is carried out
on the assumption of management by a specialized
company.
Aparthotel: 225 hotel-equivalent rooms at a total invest-
ment cost of US$28,740, in either Playa Dorada or
Playa Grande. Although the majority of units have
kitchens or kitchenettes, a centralized restaur-
ant, coffee shop and bar are available. A manage-
ment company, specialized in aparthotels,operates
the facility.
2.       For these four types of hotels pro forma income statements have
been prepared using information contained in the Study of Hotel Profitability
in the Dominican Republic financed under the Puerto Plata tourism project,
together with reports and data of hotel operations in other Caribbean des-
tinations and Mexico. All revenue and cost items are in constant December
1978 prices.

ANNEX IV
3.       Assumptions Common to all Hotel Types
(a) Financing
Equity:                           35% of investment costs
Long-term debt:
Loan amount               -  65% of investment costs
Interest rate             -  2% real interest rate
Terms of loan             -  17 years including the grace period
Grace period              -  Construction period (maximum two
years) plus first two years of operation
Method of loan repayment -  Ordinary annuity
(b) Depreciation
Buildings and construction:       2.0%
Equipment:                        6.7%
Furniture and fixtures:          10.0%
(c) Income tax:                      38% (after first ten years)
(d) The internal rates of return have been computed in real terms
over a period covering construction and 30 years of operation.
4.       Assumptions on operation receipts and costs for each hotel type pre-
cede the pro forma statement of each.

B. INFRATUR
Pro Forma Statement of Income and Expense - Puerto Plata Infrastructure Project
5.       A pro forma statement covering the period 1979-90 is presented in
Table 10. These projections include revenues and expenses relating to the
Puerto Plata tourism facilities with the exception of the airport and the
water and sewerage systems which will not be operated by INFRATUR. All pro-
jections are in 1978 prices.
6.       Revenue assumptions are as follows:
(a) Land disposal has been based on the accommodation develop-
ment schedule (see para. 2.05).  It is also assumed that
during the first five years INFRATUR will sell land to in-
vestors with immediate payment of half the price and defer-
ment of the other half for five years. The price of the
deferred portion will be increased at an annual rate of 9%.
(b) Land prices have been determined to recuperate INFRATUR's
investment in infrastructure (excluding the airport, and
the water, sewerage and solid waste disposal systems) from
the land disposal program forecasted for the period 1979
to 1990 and earn a 9% return. The average price per m2 over
the period would be RD$ 33.43 or RD$ 21.35 for 1978, in-
creasing by 9% annually thereafter.
(c) Property leases for the commercial center and the beach
and riding clubs have been computed on the basis of full
recovery of INFRATUR's investment plus a return of 9%
p.a. It was further assumed that the facilities in Playa
Dorada would be fully operational by 1980 and those in
Playa Grande by 1981.
(d) Receipts from the operations of the two golf courses have
been projected on the assumption that 10% of hotel guests
will use the courses and that a maximum of 60,000 persons
could use the courses each year (this maximum to be reached
in 1986). Greens fees (RD$ 12) and golf cart revenues
(RD$ 6 for two persons) assumed are comparable to competing
facilities in the Caribbean. Food and beverage sales by
the golf club have been assumed at RD$ 5 and RD$ 2 respectively
for 50% of the players, and the pro shop sales at RD$ 1 per
player per day. Total payroll was assumed at RD$ 112,000
per course, operating supplies at .9% of total revenues,
golf cart repair and maintenance at RD$ 250 per year and
course maintenance at RD$ 100,000 for each course from the
fourth year on, somewhat less before that. Direct costs for
food, beverages and the pro shop have been taken at 45%, 28%
and 69% of respective sales.
(e) INFRATUR will levy a service charge of RD$ 1 per guestnight
in hotels, aparthotels, villas and apartments to cover
maintenance, administration, depreciation and promotional
expenses incurred for the project area.



- 74 -
ANNEX IV
7.       Operating cost assumptions are as follows:
(a) Administrative expenses are limited to the operation of a
project supervision office in Puerto Plata estimated at
RD$ 64,000 in the first year and RD$ 108,000 thereafter.
(b) Expenses for streetdrainage and beach maintenance, fire
and ambulance services, environmental sanitation, solid
waste disposal and streetlighting have been projected at
RD$ 292,000 annually for Playa Dorada and RD$ 138,000 for
Playa Grande.
(c) INFRATUR's promotion of the project has been estimated at
ED$ 300,000 annually.
8.       Depreciation assumptions are as follows:  golf courses, club facil-
ities and the commercial center over 25 years; vehicles and equipment in the
maintenance operations over 5 and 10 years respectively. No provisions for
amortization of preopening expenses have been made since all such charges
will be recovered through land sales.
Projected Total Lending and Borrowing Program - INFRATUR
9.       INFRATUR's outstanding loans amounted to about RD$ 35,1 million
at the end of 1978 and generated interest income averaging about 6.4% p,a,
10.      INFRATUR's new loan program for the period 1979-84 is summarized
in Table 8. For the purpose of projecting interest income, the interest
rate on hotel loans has been assumed at 9.5%, and on loans extended for
other components (urban works and an artisan training center), at 10.5%.
11.      INFRATUR's existing borrowings include two foreign bank loans.
One, over US$3.0 million at 1.25% interest over LIBOR (principal repayment
in equal installments of US$750,000 p.a.), will be paid off in August 1982;
the other, over US$15.0 million at 1 to 1-1/8% interest over LIBOR (princi-
pal repayment in equal installments of US$2,000,000 p.a.), in April 1986.
12.      For the purpose of projecting interest expenses, the interest
rate on the US$25 million 17-year Bank loan has been set at 7.5% p.a. The
US$10 million commercial bank loan has been assumed with a maturity of ten
years and floating interest rates on average loan balances declining from
12% p.a. in 1979 to 7% in 1989. Table 10 presents details of INFRATUR's
projected loans, borrowings and interest income and expenses.
Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Income and Expense
13.      The pro forma consolidated financial statement of INFRATUR is
shown in Table 11. Administrative expenses for its lending operations
have been set at RD$ 300,000 per year. INFRATIUR's commitment to defray
expenses for the hotel training school up to a maximum of RD$ 150,000 is
shown under "other expenses."
Projected Total Sources and Uses of Funds
14.      Table 12 presents INFRATUR's annual generation of funds and their
application.  Their proJection is based on information given in Tables 8-11.
