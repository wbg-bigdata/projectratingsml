MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDfT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the followinig memoranldm and recommendation on a proposed
development credit for SDR 46.1 million, the equivalent of US$65 million, on standard IDA terms with
a n.aturity of 40 years to help finance a project for the transport sector. Part of the proceeds of the credit
(US$ 10.9 miulion) would be onlent to the Regie du Chemin de Fer du Mali (RCFM) (for track
rehabilitation and studies: grant form; for other subcomponents, 20 year repayment period, including
10 years of grace, with interest at 7.5% per annum). Parallel confinancing is expected in the amount of
US$173.4 million.
2.1    Country/Macro-Economic Background. Mali is a vast, sparsely populated Sahelian country with
limited natural resources. The bulk of its agricultural production takes place along the Niger River and
in the southern third of the country. The often long distances between agricultural production areas and
consumer centers, along with the poor condition of the country's transport infrastructure, make for high
domestic transport costs and temporary inter-spatial disequilibria in agricultural markets. However,
recently enacted measures aimed at liberalizing the regulatory framework have increased competition in
the transport industry and have resulted in more efficient services.
2.2    After several false starts, Mali began its adjustment effort in earnest in 1988 and has since
implemented a wide range of economic and institutional reforms. These have included complete domestic
marketing and price liberalization, reforms to the regulatory framework and tax regime, public enterprise
restructuring, and progressive elimination of trade distortions. The civil service wage bill has been kept
in check, and the share of social sector expenditures in the recurrent budget has increased steadily. These
mezsures have improved the economic incentive system and have allowed greater play of market forces
in determining economic outcomes. Furthermore, the transparency and efficiency of public resource
allocation has improved. Real GDP growth has gone up from an annual average of less than 2% during
the first half of the 1980s to an average of about 3.7% between 1988 and 1992. The public sector's fiscal
position also improved from a deficit of 12% of GDP equivalent in 1991 to 9.6% in 1993.
2.3   Progress in restorh g macroeconomic balances, however, remains slow in a fragile political
context that has seen three government changes between April 1992 and February 1994. During the
second half of 1992 and for much of 1993, the financial recovery program began to falter. Revenue
performance was weaker than anticipated, and while overall spending was within the programmed limit,
some expenditure items (notably student scholarships) increased significantly in response to pressure from
various social groups. The fiscal deficit, despite some improvement, remained higher than expected.
Furthermore, balance-of-payment performance has been adversely affected by the fall in the world market
price of cotton, the maia export crop. More importantly, the program was, until recendy, unable to
achieve significant improvements in Mali's external competitiveness and, as a result, the economy was
not able to generate the growth rates needed to allow improved standards of living and the alleviation of
poverty.
2.4    On January 12, 1994 the governments of the CFA zone-of which Mali is a member-decided
to devalue the CFA franc by 50% in foreign currency terms. This decision should give a new boost to
Mali's ongoing structural adjustment efforts and provide a greater chance for success in stimulating the
economy and, ultimately, achieving the' sustained growth necessary for raising the standards of living.



2
A new Policy Framework Paper (PFP), which was circulated to the Board on February 25, 1994, has
been agreed on with the Government for the 1994-96 period. This outlines important accompanying
measures to the devaluation necessary to help restrain inflation and to ensure that significant real
depreciation is attained. Other features of the PFP include continued focus on human resource
development, improved efficiency in agriculture, the provision of basic infrastructure services (notably
transport), and the continuation of public enterprise reform and reforms to the regulatory and incentives
framework.
3.1    Country/Sectoral Background. The transport sector is a key factor in Mali's development. Based
mainly on subsistence agriculture subject to a highly unpredictable climate, the Malian economy depends
heavily on foreign trade (40% of GDP) and, therefore, on the efficiency of its international transport
systems. Total imports of various basic consumer and capital goods in 1992 were estimated at nearly
600,000 tons (including 200,000 tons of petroleum products) valued at CFAF i80 billion, while 1992
exports totaled nearly 200,000 tons (cotton accounting for nearly half) worth CFAF 87 billion The
development of local trade, spurred by the increased activity in population movement and in rapid urban
growth, has made domestic transport particularly important. Land transport accounts for most of the
trade traffic, with annual volumes on the order of 1.1 billion ton-kn (tk) (25% by rail) and 2.2 billion
passenger-km (pk) (10% by rail). Transport contributes some 5% of GDP and has posted average annual
growth rates of about 4% in the last few years. Given the country's size and its landlocked position, the
development of Mali and the competitiveness of its economy depend more than usual on the operational
efficiency of its tiarsport system which currently faces a number of problems.
3.2    Because it is landlocked, Mali's imports and exports are dependent on the neighboring countries'
overland routes and seaports. Until recently, Government intervention in international transDort
(particularly through freight allocation and rate-setting) was partly responsible for the high cost of
international transport equivalent to about 30% of the country's import bill. About half of international
traffic is by road (mainly from Abidjan), while the rest is by rail (from Dakar). Road transport suffers
from poor performance and insufficient competition in the trucking industry and from a lack of adequate
maintenance of road infrastructure. Rail transport has shown significant improvements in operational and
fmancial performances in recent years, but the RCFM still needs to develop a decidedly commercial
orientation and improve collaboration with the Senegal railway company, Societe Nationale de Chemins
de Fer du Senegal (SNCS) into a true partnership. River barge transport services are provided by the
private sector for part of the year when the Niger river permits navigation; the parastatal Compagnie
Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV) has also intermittently operated freight and passenger service at
a loss downstream from Koulikoro. Two new airlines, Mali Timbuktu Air Service (MALITAS) and Air
MALISA, were created in 1990 and 1993, respectively, with more than 80% private sector participation,
to provide local air transport services. Mali also rejoined the international carrier Air Afrique in 1992.
As a result of the recent devaluation of the CFA franc, the volume of imports is expected to decrease
somewhat; the share of international transport in the country's import bill may decrease from 30% to
about 20% to 25% since only a part of the fuel price increase is being passed on the users, with the rest
being absorbed through a decrease in fuel taxes. For domestic traffic, which plays a crucial role in food
security during recurring periods of drought and is handled predominantly by road, the impact of the
devaluation is again expected to be muted since vehicle operating costs are expected to increase by some
40%, i.e., well below price increases of imported goods.
3.3    While efficient and competitive transport is necessary to the country's development, transport
infrastructure is expensive to construct and maintain, thus placing heavy -..emands on the scarce available
resources. The parity change of the CFA franc will increase road maintenance costs by some 40% (in



3
CFAF). Therefore, it will be more essential than ever that future investment and maintenance works are
carefully screened with particular emphasis on maximizing potential foreign exchange savings.
3.4    To bring the transport sector in line with Government's macro-econom , adjustment reforms, the
then MinistWre de I 'Equipement et de l 'Habitat (MEH) decided in early 1991 to set up a Transport Sector
Commnittee (TSC) which brought together all the sector's operators, public and private, in a first-ever
attempt to bring a particiDatorv approach to bear on identifying key sectoral problems and develooina
approaches to their solution. The TSC met a number of times and, with the assistance of facilitators
brought in for this purpose, prepared a draft Declaration of General Transport Sector Policy (DGTSP).
This was fiully discussed with IDA and formally adopted by Goverunent on Novemv"ber 2, 1993. This
Policy introduced fundanmental changes in sector objectives in five major respects: it pledged its
comnitment (a) to encourage competitiveness and gve a bigger role to the private sector in the transport
and public works industries; (b) to restructure public enterprises, particularly the RCFM, and to replace
force account works in the highway sec.or, including road maintenance with works by contract; (c) to
use economic criteria ir transport investment choices; (d) to give infrastructure maintenance the highest
priority in resource allocation; and (e) to take more responsibility for rural roads, in particular, and the
environment, in general. The new strategy is discussed fully in the Mali Transport Sector Memorandum
(Report No. 12095-MLI, green covei issued in October, 1993).
4.    Program and Project Objectives. The proposed project is part of a sector-wide program to
support the Goverrnment of Mali's efforts:
(a)   to strengthen sector management and performance through reorganization and local
capacity building;
(b)   to restructure transport sector paratatals;
(c)   to modify the regulatory and institutional framework to promote increased private sector
participation in the provision of services and the execution of works;
(d)   to rehabilitate and maintain a priority network of transport infrastructure; and
(e)   to improve the transport operation's efficiency, and reduce transport costs.
5.    Program and Project Description. The proposed project is designed around the Government's
five-year (1994-98) program of sectoral reforms contained in the DGTSP, supported by a parallel donor-
assisted program of investments in transport 2ector. The program has four components and IDA will
participate in financing the following three:
(a)    a capacity build;ag and trainirg component focusing on support for the implementation
of sector policy measures, the modernization of sector admir;stration, and the
reorganization of transport services. This component will be fully financed by IDA
(US$5.7 million, 2% of total project costs);
(b)    a road component to finance a five-year program focusing on the rehabilitation, and
routine and periodic maintenance of a priority network accompanied by environmental
actions, improvement of rural tracks, purchase of ferries, improvement of Bamako 's main
urban roads system, and procurement of equipment for routine road maintenance. This



4
component will be cofinanced by donors-the IDA project will finance some 19% of this
component (US$208.1 million, 68% of total project costs); and
(c)    a railway component designed to help the Government and RCFM  implement the
program to restructure the railway business and pat it on a more commercial footing, and
finance a five-year investment program, focusing mainly on improving traffic safety and
preserv-ng existing assets-the IDA project will finance some 28% of this component
(US$32.5 million, 11% of total project costs).
The fourth component is an investment component for airports to finance both safety equipment for the
Timbuktu and Bamako-Senou airports and technical studies, and is fully financed by cofinanciers (US$7.8
million, 3% of total project costs). Price contingencies represent US$51.6 million, 16% of total project
costs. Further cost details are given in Schedule A; procurement and disbursement arrangements in
Schedule B; and the project preparation timeframe and principle IDA staff involved in Schedule C. The
status of Bank Group operations is given in Schedule D.
6.    Project Implementation. The program, to be carried out over a period of five years, will be
implemented, under the supervision of the respective donors, by the ministries responsible for Finance
and Commerce, for Equipment and Transportationi, RCFM for the railway component, and A-roports du
Mali-Agency for the Safety of Aerial Navigation in Africa and Madagascar (ADM-ASECNA) for air
tansport. The role of the ministries would be redefined to include only planning, programming,
budgeting and supervision for roads. A small coordinating unit will organize joint donors' meetings
annually, assist the Administration and RCFM in handling the procedures relative to procurement and
disbursemerits, and will coordinate the documentation and reports to be prepared by each executing
agency. As learned from the implementation of the ongoing Fifth Highway Project (Cr. 1629-MLI), and
from experiences with the AGETIP model, the following arrangements have been agreed on to facilitate
implementation: (a) the transport sector administration (Direction Nationale des Transports - DNT for
transport, and Direction Nationale des Travaux Publics - DNTP for roads) will be reorganized to improve
efficiency; (b) the RCFM will be strengthened by transforming it into a commercial enterprise, and
reinforcing its technical and commercial integration of international freight rail transport services with
SNCS, thereby improving efficiency and competitiveness; (c) the execution of works by force account
will be progressively abandoned; (d) a special account for routine road maintenance has been created so
that contractors, particularly small ones, executing works for the project may be paid quickly; and (e)
the transformation of public works equipment service into a public equipment rental comipany will
facilitate the work of small private contractors by providing them with equipment they cannot afford to
purchase.
7.    Project Sustainabilitv. The economic appraisal of the planned investments shows a 28% rate of
return; dhe existing and *xpected revenues from road user taxation and RCFM's billings cover all
infrastructure costs as well as RCFM's operating costs. The sustainability of the project will be promoted
by means of: (a) institutional reforms to be introduced within the sector's administraon to upgrade its
planning and management capacities; (b) reforms in transport regulations to allow the industry to develop;
(c) restructuring of the public enterprises to eihance their efficiency, and the passing on to users, through
the prices charged, of the full range of transport operating costs, including maintenance and infrastructure
renewal; (d) revision of the road user taxation system to improve recovery of road use costs;
(e) development of the Malian constuction industry; (f) training and upgrading of sector personnel; and
(g) reduction of the annua infrastructure rehabilitation bill through the introduction of rational routine
mnaintenance and preventive periodic maintenance.

8.    Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. Over the past 25 years, IDA has financed five
highway and three railway projects in Mali for a total of US$130 million (current). The implementaion
of all these projects was marked by administrative sluggishness, procurement delays, slow disbursements,
insufficient resource allocation for routine maintenance, inefficient works execution by force account,
payment delays to contractors, and programming of investments and works. New investments, often with
inadequate rates of retun were favored over maintenance of existing infrastructure. Specific lessons from
the implementation of the Fifth Highway Project include: (a) maintenance performed by force account
is lower in quality and higher in price than work contracted to the private sector. In the proposed
project, the proportions of routine maintenance done by contract will have to exceed 75%; (b) project
implementation suffered severely from procurement delays and caused a three-year overrun (in fact the
five-year project, approved in 1985, is now schduled for completion on June 30, 1995). The proposed
project introduces delegated contract management for routine maintenance. It will use standard bidding
docurmients and a procedures manual to expedite procurement-related matters; (c) it was difficult to get
an accurate picture of the cost of force account works because DNTP's account   was inadequate.
Provision has been made in the proposed project to overhaul DNTP's accounting system and computerize
various services; (d) the Fifth Highway Project did not explicitly address the issues of rural roads and
the environment. The proposed p;oject provides for the conctruction of rural roads to open up areas with
agricultural potential. It systematically incorporates environmental concerns into all road designs and
maintenance works and finances environmental actions and safety along the roads. Lessons learned from
the transport sector in general include: (a) the project-by-project efforts to achieve a more rational
approach to investment planning, to strength institutional capabilities and improve subsector performance
have had little success. The proposed project is part of an overall transport sector program which places
transport development in a policy-b.sed, sectorwide framework developed by the Government and
supported by donors; (b) the necessity of implemengin2 a nackaqge of policy reforms through a coordinated
nvestment program to keep the focus on the broad sectoral and developmental objectives; and (c) the
need to carefully define the mechanics of resource allocation for routine maintenance and the timely
payment of local contractors.
9.1   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The reform program launched by Government in thetrazu=ort
sector calls for support to improve the sector's efficie zy in order to reduce transport costs, to help make
the Malian economy, particularly the export sector, more competitive, and to stimulate the development
of agriculture by opening up isolated rural areas in coordination with the Ministry of Rural Development.
Th_ institutional reforms and the proposed studies and capacity building are geared toward modernizing
and streamlining the Administration, withdrawing it from management and works operations, and
strengthening its investment planning, programming and supervision capabilities. The new oriention
aims at strengthening the role of the private sector, both in the transport industry, where administrative
constraints will be eliminated, and in public works, where the proposed measures will foster the
development of local contractors and engineering firms. Considering Mali's resources, external aid is
needed to successfully implement the reform and investment program. With its long and extensive
experience in the transport sector, IDA's participation would be essential to assisting Government in
coordinating the contributions of aU donors in the framework of a sectoral program that includes priority
projects offering reasonable rates of return, together with support for reform measures.
9.2   IDA's Country Assistance Strateav (CAS) to Mali will continue to focus on promoting human
resources and private sector development, extending and rehabilitating basic productive infrastructure,
improving macroeconomic management, and building institutional capacity. This project is cornsistent with
the last CAS for Mali which was discussed by the Board in November 1992. The objectives of the
proposed project are also consLstent with the up coming CAS scheduled for Board presentation during



6
the first half of FY95. IDA lending to Mali in the next few years is expected to increase substantially to
support the Government's expanding adjustment effort and to assure that output growth recovers
significantly.  Planned operations include a follow-up adjustment operation, and  new investment
operations in agriculture, infrastructure, and human resources. The transport sector project is an
important part of IDA's assistance strategy for Mali since it will allow improved access to, and efficiency
of, transport services which are critical for ensuring a quick and strong supply response and stimulating
growth.

(f)    adoption, by the Governments of Mali and Senegal, of a joint action plan, acceptable to
IDA, for the technical and commercW integration of international freight rail transport
services; and
(g).  the signature of agreements between RCFM and the Government, acceptable to IDA, for
the operation of passengers domestic lines to be maintained for public service obligations.
11.   Environmental Aspects. This project is rated category B. An assessment of the ongoing Fifth
Highway Project's impact on the environment was car-ied out in 1993 and its recommendations have been
incorporated into the project. The environmental action plan adopted by the Government in the DGTSP
covers the key actions to be taken. The terms of reference for studies and the designs of works will
include actions for protecting and imVr,ving the environment. There is no resettlement involved, the

road and rail track rehabilitation programs following existing alignments. The environment and safety
subcomponent will allow the execution of works for local improvements in villages, anti-erosion planting,
safety and other actions to improve the enviromnent along the roads.
12.   Prorm  Objective Categories. The project participates in promoting the development of
competitiveness (reinforced by CFA devaluation) of the economy by reducing transport sector costs and
developing the capacity of small public works firms working in the private sector. It reduces poverty in
rural arees by creating employment opportunities through the construction and maintenance of rural roads
and through agricultural development. In addition, the project aims at increasing the efficiency of both
public and private sector management in the transport and public works industry.
13.   Project Benefits. The program and project are designed to modernize the administration of the
sector and, most importantly, to reduce transportation costs. The overall appraisal of the two principal
program components (road and rail, accounting for about 95 % of program costs) yields an internal rate
of return (IRR) of 28%, more than double the discount rate (12%) adopted (the rates of subprojects range
from 178% for periodic maintenance for a semi-urban road to 12% for the last rural track included in
the program; the sensitivity tests carried out show rates of return higher than 12 %). The project is also
expected to result in many other indirect benefits that cannot be quantified. It will enhance the transport
sector's efficiency by realigning the functions of its administration, restructuiing its public agencies to
give them a firmly commercial character and improving their operadonal capacities. The program will
have a high economic and social impact on the population through reduced trensport costs, the 280,000
person/months of jobs it will create, and the promotion of small local firms to meet the increased demand
expected to arise through the multiplier effects of the income generated by the program.
14.  BRisk. The principal project risks stem from the fact that the Government may not be able to
implement all the desired reforms in the sector, or to remove the obstacles to the mobilization and
allocation of adequate financial resources for counterpart funding and, in particular, for routine road
maintenance. Mali transport agencies' institutional capacity to manage the program is presently weak.
For RCFM, the risk would derive from the insufficient integration of international freight services with
SNCS. I .ese risks are minimized by the strong ownership demonstrated by the Govermment during
project preparation, the fulfillment of all conditionalities for the negotiations, monitoring of the anmual
public investment programs and key indicators of RCFM activities, continued coordination with other
financing institutions, strengthening of sector management through reorganization and capacity building.
15.   Recomnendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
